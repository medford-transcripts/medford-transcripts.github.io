1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,033
[SPEAKER_20]: Bringing arts and culture to the forefront continues today.

2
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:21,021
[SPEAKER_20]: This winter, I signed on to the Metro Mayor's Medication Compact to become carbon neutral region-wide by 2050.

3
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:31,651
[SPEAKER_20]: This raises environmental consciousness of every decision the city makes going forward.

4
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:41,150
[SPEAKER_20]: To this end, we initiated the process last fall to purchase the street lights that are owned and managed by National Grid, with the goal to convert to LED over the summer.

5
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:53,179
[SPEAKER_20]: We anticipate savings in electricity usage, thus reducing environmental amendments, and based on direct maintenance by us of the lights, there will be a less than five year payback from converting to LED.

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,645
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition, in collaboration with the city council, we are experimenting with increased lighting in Medford Square for our decorative lights.

7
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:06,792
[SPEAKER_20]: Once finalized, we will fully install for a safer streetscape in our square.

8
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:12,917
[SPEAKER_20]: Our Office of Environment has been hard at work to receive the following grants for additional projects.

9
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:19,803
[SPEAKER_20]: $250,000 from the Stanton Foundation to build a dog park at Riverbed Park, which will be built this spring.

10
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:20,844
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you, Class IV.

11
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:32,560
[SPEAKER_20]: A grant from the Mass Coastal Zone Management for 125,000 to build the city's first green infrastructure to naturally clean storm water before it flows into the Mystic.

12
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,185
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a partnership with the Mystic River Watershed Association, or MIRA as we refer to it.

13
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:49,572
[SPEAKER_20]: A partnership grant for the Clipper Ship Connector from DCR to design and engineer the half-mile multi-use path between Medford Square and River Bend Park.

14
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,202
[SPEAKER_20]: This is in partnership with Dr. Medford and Myra, and a generous donation from Wegmans for $23,000.

15
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Wegmans!

16
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:16,390
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not even in our city, and they're already contributing to these wonderful things, so we're very lucky to have them coming, and they expect construction to end by next October-November timeframe.

17
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:21,641
[SPEAKER_20]: We received a green community grant, another green community grant for $250,000.

18
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:25,306
[SPEAKER_20]: That's for LED lighting in our schools, which will be installed over the next few weeks.

19
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:32,957
[SPEAKER_20]: These grants would not be possible without the hard work of the team in the energy environment under the leadership of Alicia Hunt.

20
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:46,700
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia recently received the Mystic Municipal Leadership Award from the Mystic River Watershed Association.

21
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,063
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much, Alicia, for all your hard work.

22
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:54,130
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also want to thank Eagle Scout candidate, Calvin Lambert.

23
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,472
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe he's in the audience.

24
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:57,174
[SPEAKER_20]: Calvin.

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:13,269
[SPEAKER_20]: We're working with our environmental office and our Department of Public Works to build bridges around rice ponds and sensitive areas.

26
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,111
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you very much, Calvin, for your efforts.

27
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:31,981
[SPEAKER_20]: Lastly, we have created the Go Green Medford Coalition, which will be an umbrella entity for all sustainability-minded groups in Medford to coordinate activities and track outcomes.

28
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:34,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Environmental focus continues today.

29
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:44,209
[SPEAKER_20]: As chairperson of the Medford School Committee, working with committee members, administration, and faculty, our public schools continue to make great achievements.

30
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,730
[SPEAKER_20]: Examples include

31
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,862
[SPEAKER_20]: Increased access to career and technical education for Medford students.

32
00:03:50,362 --> 00:04:00,869
[SPEAKER_20]: The integration of Medford High and Medford Voc Tech has enabled our students to simultaneously participate in both rigorous academics and occupational exploration skill development.

33
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,531
[SPEAKER_20]: Nine new Chapter 74 technical programs are now available.

34
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Heidi, Riccio, and the students.

35
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:20,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Enrollment of ninth grade students in career tech education has doubled under her leadership.

36
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:27,194
[SPEAKER_20]: We've also secured over $1 million in new grants to revitalize our vocational technical learning environment.

37
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:35,880
[SPEAKER_20]: And we've also captured out-of-district tuitions and generated new sources of regionalized revenue to support expansion of educational opportunities for our youth.

38
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,145
[SPEAKER_20]: We have maintained a comprehensive curriculum that provides a full range of core academic subjects and specialized electives.

39
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:53,945
[SPEAKER_20]: MetroDOT has 16 Advanced Placement courses, among the most in the area, as well as a full complement of art, music, technology, foreign language, and health education programs.

40
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,646
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

41
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:09,615
[SPEAKER_20]: We have two standout MetroDOT students with us tonight, Joseph Farrar and Kenny Toussaint.

42
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:25,030
[SPEAKER_20]: Joseph, a Medford High School senior, took first place at the Massachusetts State Science and Engineering Fair in developing scientific models, while Kenny graduated last spring from Medford Tech and is currently enrolled in Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Services.

43
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,009
[SPEAKER_20]: As a little girl from Haiti, she left her homeland at the age of 11 with her dad.

44
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:45,951
[SPEAKER_20]: She worked hard to learn the English language and excelled in her technical programs.

45
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:51,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Kenny also earned college credits through a dual enrollment program at Buncombe Hill Community College.

46
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:58,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Both of these young adults demonstrate the Medford Public Schools advantage, MPS advantage, in our commitment to you.

47
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:14,319
[SPEAKER_20]: We have introduced before school programs at our elementary schools, while after school programs are growing exponentially.

48
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:18,941
[SPEAKER_20]: They provide substantial coverage and constructive activities for students after regular hours.

49
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:24,584
[SPEAKER_20]: We are enhancing our programs and activities to provide inclusive opportunities for all students.

50
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:33,268
[SPEAKER_20]: In order to accomplish this, substantial professional development with an emphasis on social and emotional learning in our schools has been made.

51
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:37,016
[SPEAKER_20]: We have added counseling and behavior support staff to our teams.

52
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:42,163
[SPEAKER_20]: Lastly, we're recognized by the National School Board's Journal for School Security Practices.

53
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:47,570
[SPEAKER_20]: We have tightened security at all schools by adding staff and the Raptor ID system.

54
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,234
[SPEAKER_20]: Investments in our school children continue today.

55
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:05,939
[SPEAKER_20]: Augmented security measures in our schools would not be possible without collaboration with our public safety professionals.

56
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,803
[SPEAKER_20]: Safety is a core component to an individual's comfort in and desire to be in a community.

57
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:18,447
[SPEAKER_20]: We have invested in state-of-the-art self-contained breathing apparatus for our firefighters and a second set of turnout gear.

58
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:23,391
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Medford City Council, for voting that last night for supporting this initiative.

59
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:29,335
[SPEAKER_20]: These are to provide the most current apparatus for firefighters' safety and ultimately for your safety.

60
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:35,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Nine new firefighters graduated the academy last month and one entered this past Monday.

61
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:40,413
[SPEAKER_20]: We are working hard to keep up with retirements by accelerating the civil service process.

62
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:47,157
[SPEAKER_20]: Kudos to our Board of Health for receipt of a seven-year, $100,000 per year grant from the Mass.

63
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:54,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Abuse to provide opiate abuse prevention services for six cities and towns in our area.

64
00:07:55,541 --> 00:08:08,251
[SPEAKER_20]: We all understand the impact this drug has on our society, and we are making every effort to raise awareness, erase the stigma, and provide assistance for those suffering from addiction, as well as support for their families.

65
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:23,243
[SPEAKER_20]: We have formed a team approach under Mary Ann O'Connor, who recently came to us in the last several months.

66
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,401
[SPEAKER_20]: for prevention and outreach.

67
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:31,764
[SPEAKER_20]: We have an outreach manager, a recovery coach, we work with Lawrence Memorial Hospital, and the police department.

68
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:39,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Every life matters, and we thank our police and firefighters for volunteering to administer NACAN in this cause.

69
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:54,994
[SPEAKER_20]: And while we are not to clear the trust at City, be assured that our police department protocols do not allow for profiling.

70
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:59,317
[SPEAKER_20]: Witnesses and victims are not asked about their immigration status.

71
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:01,599
[SPEAKER_20]: So be sure and ask your lawyer.

72
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:12,688
[SPEAKER_20]: And you can ask me what the question posed to me most often.

73
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,603
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have to say it's when are we getting a new police station?

74
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,144
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear day in and day out.

75
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:32,093
[SPEAKER_20]: And today, just this morning, I announced that we will be submitting a loan order to the city council next week on February 14th, requesting funds to commission an architect to begin the plans for a new station.

76
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,135
[SPEAKER_20]: We have turned this city upside down looking for a new location.

77
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:38,517
[SPEAKER_20]: We've toured commercial spaces.

78
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:40,438
[SPEAKER_20]: We've contacted property owners.

79
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:42,320
[SPEAKER_20]: Property owners have contacted us.

80
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:51,909
[SPEAKER_20]: And in the end, the right location with no land cost and no relocation during construction is the current site of the training facility on Main Street.

81
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:21,246
[SPEAKER_20]: The current facility will be demolished, and the proposed 35,000 square foot, three-story new construction will house all amenities at the state-of-the-art resilient headquarters, including deserved equal space for our female and male officers, technology upgrades, and most importantly, safe interior space for our office's well-being.

82
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,147
[SPEAKER_20]: Public safety investments continue today.

83
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:43,338
[SPEAKER_20]: In conclusion, this city of ours, this great city of ours, continues to move forward on a foundation built on dialogue.

84
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:52,120
[SPEAKER_20]: A dialogue that echoes in this building, allowing the voices of all residents to be heard with an attitude of inclusion and fairness.

85
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:59,543
[SPEAKER_20]: A dialogue of renewal, where creative and imaginative ideas are brought forward to better the quality of life in our city.

86
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:08,660
[SPEAKER_20]: A dialogue that resonates with the message that Medford is on the move, embracing a future of possibilities, embracing a future of hope.

87
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:17,128
[SPEAKER_20]: On this night, in our beautiful City Hall, and I say that the state of our city is sound, it is stable, and it is sturdy.

88
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:38,538
[SPEAKER_20]: And as your mayor, I stand as committed as ever to foster this dialogue with you as we continue to cultivate a city on which we can be partners in progress.

89
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,043
[SPEAKER_20]: God bless America, the commonwealth, and the United States of America.

90
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:49,289
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you all very much for being here this evening, and good night, and be safe tomorrow with the upcoming blizzard.

91
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:49,770
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

92
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

93
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:29,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Please remain standing.

94
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the final invocation and benediction, we invite Reverend Wendy.

95
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:40,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

96
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:42,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you inspired?

97
00:12:51,313 --> 00:13:00,803
[SPEAKER_19]: I was thinking, I don't like the sound stable and sturdy, because that sounds so sound, stable and sturdy.

98
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:09,611
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was thinking that it felt pretty spectacular and scintillating and safe for all and Stephanie.

99
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:21,323
[SPEAKER_19]: to do something for me, citizens of Medford.

100
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:29,504
[SPEAKER_19]: I wonder if, for just a minute, we can have all of our elected and staff, city staff, sit down for a second.

101
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Elected and city staff.

102
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:36,725
[SPEAKER_19]: And everybody else, I'm gonna ask you to help me bless these people.

103
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:44,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you just extend a hand towards the people who are serving you today?

104
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,367
[SPEAKER_19]: For it continues today.

105
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:50,200
[SPEAKER_19]: and join me in the spirit of blessing.

106
00:13:51,641 --> 00:14:13,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, loving, forgiving spirit of the universe, God of all that is, God of this city, God of these people, God of goodness and change and sturdiness and future and yesterday and today, it continues.

107
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:22,095
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we ask your blessing on these good people who we have elected and we have given the responsibility to serve us.

108
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:32,586
[SPEAKER_19]: We thank you for their wisdom, for their courage, for the day-to-day doing it all to make us sturdy and stable and sound.

109
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,850
[SPEAKER_19]: Help them to be courageous as we go from this night.

110
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:53,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Help them to be that which we need in this city to make us scintillating and exciting and future-oriented at the same time that we are grounded in all that we have been.

111
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:59,254
[SPEAKER_19]: God, we thank you, and we ask your blessing on all of these people.

112
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,435
[SPEAKER_19]: And now, if you'll all stand back up.

113
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,707
[SPEAKER_19]: I will bless us all.

114
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:09,409
[SPEAKER_19]: May God continue today to bless us and keep us.

115
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:17,392
[SPEAKER_19]: May God continue today to show us the way and to be gracious to us, to shine upon us.

116
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:25,216
[SPEAKER_19]: May God continue today to look upon Medford with kindness and grace and love.

117
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:28,357
[SPEAKER_19]: And we pray all of this in the name of love.

118
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:29,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Let the people say.

119
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I might, she pray.

120
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:51,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Lieutenant Casey, retire the colors.

121
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Prepare to halt.

122
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,064
Forward halt.

123
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,450
Halt.

124
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:35,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all, and the mayor kindly invites you to gather for some refreshments, some pastries and some coffee out in the rotunda.

125
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:38,072
[SPEAKER_07]: If the munchkins out there haven't eaten them all up by now.

126
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:51,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford City Council, 14th regular meeting, Medford Mass, April 11th, 2017.

[SPEAKER_21]: And all the sites are safe and in regulations for the handicapped accessibility?

174
00:43:13,422 --> 00:43:16,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, for the NWRA, they requested a service.

175
00:43:18,344 --> 00:43:20,786
[SPEAKER_02]: MWRA or their contractors will do the digging.

176
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:23,889
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll put the conduit, they'll pull in the secondary conductor and stuff.

177
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:25,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just have you on the pole.

178
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

179
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:46,808
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, just for, I, I see everything in order just off the record though on Fulton street, if there are the questions I had, there's a pole on Fulton street right at the corner of Salem and Fulton and they have, uh, it's obviously, uh, uh, one of your poles and it has, um, a cable line that's anchored to the sidewalk.

180
00:43:48,017 --> 00:43:51,480
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's been pulled off of the sidewalk.

181
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,042
[SPEAKER_21]: And that cable is now almost into the street.

182
00:43:55,583 --> 00:44:00,366
[SPEAKER_21]: It looked, and there was a cone over the existing hole, but that's been dangling there for weeks.

183
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:07,771
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that we put something in, if you can look into that, is that the type of, are we going to have that type of construction when we lay these poles in?

184
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Are these going fixed in and then being?

185
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:11,434
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's obviously.

186
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:12,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

187
00:44:12,335 --> 00:44:12,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

188
00:44:12,755 --> 00:44:14,016
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Salem and Fulton.

189
00:44:14,316 --> 00:44:15,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Salem and Fulton, right.

190
00:44:15,577 --> 00:44:16,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually right in front of the, uh,

191
00:44:17,293 --> 00:44:21,834
[SPEAKER_21]: The oil, oil, uh, I think it's Jiffy Loop right at the corner.

192
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:24,675
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you can look at that, Mr. Jankowski, I really appreciate it.

193
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,376
[SPEAKER_21]: And I find everything else in order.

194
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:27,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

195
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:32,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion for approval by Councilor Scott Manning, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

196
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:34,419
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor.

197
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:34,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

198
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:35,719
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, excuse me.

199
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:37,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Falco.

200
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,160
[SPEAKER_01]: One quick question.

201
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when will, uh, do we know when the work's taking place?

202
00:44:43,241 --> 00:44:44,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume, um,

203
00:44:46,503 --> 00:44:47,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not positive.

204
00:44:48,044 --> 00:44:52,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume once this passes, I would think the customer would get started on a week or two, I would assume.

205
00:44:52,866 --> 00:44:54,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we know how long it's going to take?

206
00:44:54,347 --> 00:44:56,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it should be 15 feet, so I would think it would be a day.

207
00:44:57,408 --> 00:44:58,769
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all going to be done on the grass strip.

208
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:02,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to interfere the road itself, which is going to be the grass strip.

209
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:08,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I may, really quick, Councillor Scott probably brought up a good point about a pole.

210
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:13,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a call the other day about a pole at the corner of Fulton Street and Fulton Spring.

211
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,259
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a double pole, and now it's one and a half poles.

212
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,320
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally cut it in half.

213
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,940
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a stump.

214
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

215
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,040
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing on it.

216
00:45:21,401 --> 00:45:21,981
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing on it.

217
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:23,221
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about four feet off the ground.

218
00:45:23,261 --> 00:45:24,081
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of odd.

219
00:45:24,941 --> 00:45:29,802
[SPEAKER_01]: You have one single pole, and there's a pole next to it that was a double pole at one point.

220
00:45:29,902 --> 00:45:31,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's just about four feet off the ground.

221
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:36,504
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's a bit of a safety hazard if you have a small child that's walking by or running in trips.

222
00:45:36,564 --> 00:45:39,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a problem that needs to be addressed.

223
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:40,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take a look at it.

224
00:45:40,524 --> 00:45:41,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

225
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:43,665
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a corner of Fulton Street and Fulton Spring.

226
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:44,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

227
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:46,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knife.

228
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:49,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, the gentleman at the podium answered my question.

229
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:56,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, by looking at the diagram, I had a question as to whether or not any street excavation was going to take place and whether or not there was going to be a need for a traffic management plan.

230
00:45:56,536 --> 00:46:01,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, he's informed us that it's all going to take place on the grass strip, that it's 15 feet of conduit, that it's going to take one day to do so.

231
00:46:01,537 --> 00:46:02,157
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no problem.

232
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,118
[SPEAKER_14]: I would second councilor Scott Pelley's motion for approval.

233
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:05,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

234

[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor on the motion by councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by councilor Dela Russo.

235

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

00:46:28,448 --> 00:46:28,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

248
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:31,610

[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be subject to appropriation.

284
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:28,356
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be pretty much a pass-through account, where when we get a bill for our legal fees or our fees from the registry, they would already have been paid by the delinquent taxpayer.

285
00:49:28,376 --> 00:49:30,777
[SPEAKER_06]: We take it out of that account and pay the fees.

286
00:49:32,146 --> 00:49:38,909
[SPEAKER_06]: The Department of Revenue has made a general recommendation that all cities and towns accept this statute.

287
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:47,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cleaner, more transparent way to see how funds are being expended to recoup tax title funds.

288
00:49:48,732 --> 00:49:49,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

289
00:49:49,493 --> 00:49:50,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilwoman Gohern.

290
00:49:50,973 --> 00:49:52,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Carviello.

291
00:49:53,254 --> 00:50:00,697
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could explain, I guess, the process we use now and also it sounds like our expenses are going to be taken out of this account.

292
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:04,134
[SPEAKER_05]: What about properties that are seized or sold?

293
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Those money's going to come in and then we're going to expend from the same account?

294
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:19,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happens now is when we pursue a tax title case, taxes, interest, fees, everything, the money has been put forward by the city to pursue those cases.

295
00:50:19,903 --> 00:50:27,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And when the delinquent taxpayer seeks a redemption, they only get a redemption once all those costs have been paid.

296
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:39,810
[SPEAKER_06]: The taxes under this revolving fund, the taxes and the interest would go into the general fund, and the costs would then come back to the treasurer, who could then use them to pursue other cases.

297
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:46,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I have a line item of $3,500 to use toward tax title cases.

298
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:50,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And just this year, we've already filed 30 cases, and that's $75 per

299
00:50:54,719 --> 00:51:03,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Filing fees are up at about $2,500 already, so it doesn't leave a lot of money to pursue some of the larger cases that require filings in land court, et cetera.

300
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:10,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So with this, when those fees come in, we can build that up and use it going forward.

301
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:20,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will allow you to—money that is brought in from delinquent properties or money owed can then be—we can use more of it towards

302
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:29,039
[SPEAKER_05]: collecting from other properties versus right now you're limited to the $3,500 and you'd have to ask the mayor's office to appropriate more.

303
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:30,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a way for us to.

304
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:33,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is really being paid back by the delinquent taxpayers.

305
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:42,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the city getting their money back from the delinquent taxpayer and then using those funds to continue to pursue other delinquent taxpayers.

306
00:51:42,605 --> 00:51:48,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what if we recouped so much money and this account became obviously extremely high,

307
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,421
[SPEAKER_05]: would we be able to transfer out of it?

308
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:59,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not certain if you can transfer out of it, but you can close it, which I would assume then would then go to the general fund.

309
00:52:00,045 --> 00:52:08,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't foresee it really gaining, you know, and growing that much because the fees aren't that great.

310
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:13,491
[SPEAKER_06]: But if legal fees are being paid by a taxpayer, then we're going to have to pay the legal bill.

311
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:16,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So it goes in and goes out pretty regularly.

312
00:52:17,812 --> 00:52:20,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's the purpose of the DOR recommending this?

313
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:32,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they think it's cleaner and it's more transparent for cities and towns to show how much money is spent and how much money is recouped through the process.

314
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:33,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

315
00:52:35,535 --> 00:52:36,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor DelaRosso.

316
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:45,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, as one who's always been an advocate and supporter of efficiency in government,

317
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,502
[SPEAKER_09]: and in the pursuit of transparency.

318
00:52:53,643 --> 00:52:58,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I support this resolution in motion for approval.

319
00:52:58,666 --> 00:52:59,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

320
00:52:59,047 --> 00:52:59,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Rossell.

321
00:53:01,128 --> 00:53:01,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice president marks.

322
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:03,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

323
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,351
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, thank you man for coming tonight.

324
00:53:06,151 --> 00:53:12,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, do you know what was expended the last three years, uh, to collect for these texts, uh, delinquent properties?

325
00:53:13,536 --> 00:53:14,377
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been $3,500 on the line item.

326
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:19,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gone into deficit, I'm sure, at some point.

327
00:53:19,253 --> 00:53:19,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

328
00:53:19,773 --> 00:53:24,557
[SPEAKER_17]: So we don't have an accounting over the last three years how much has been expended to collect each and every year?

329
00:53:24,957 --> 00:53:26,298
[SPEAKER_17]: I realize your budget line item.

330
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:26,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

331
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:27,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Over and above the budget line item.

332
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you how much has been spent in this year, which is $112,000.

333
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:35,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

334
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:41,589
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I'm trying to do is get a picture of what we've done in the past.

335
00:53:42,693 --> 00:53:44,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, have we hired outside?

336
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:48,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause I assume that part of this money will go to outside attorneys.

337
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:48,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that not correct?

338
00:53:48,874 --> 00:53:50,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have hired outside council, right?

339
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:52,535
[SPEAKER_17]: But we've expended in the past.

340
00:53:53,095 --> 00:53:56,335
[SPEAKER_17]: What are percent that we've gained from expending this money?

341
00:53:56,676 --> 00:54:03,997
[SPEAKER_17]: So just say in a given year, we expend a hundred thousand dollars and we get back 30 to 300,000 in tax title.

342
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:08,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have a, uh, an estimate on every year?

343
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:10,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can give you a breakdown right now.

344
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:12,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked it today.

345
00:54:12,427 --> 00:54:15,891
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to see a few years, not just this year.

346
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:17,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to look back.

347
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:20,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I've only been here for a little over a year, so I would look back.

348
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:26,703
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, under Mayor Burke's tenure, we've brought in $2.25 million and spent about $110,000 to do that.

349
00:54:32,296 --> 00:54:32,676
[SPEAKER_17]: That's great.

350
00:54:32,696 --> 00:54:59,946
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to see a picture, Mr. President, if we could, on maybe the last five years, what has been, in addition to the line item that was mentioned, what has been expended by the Treasurer-Collector's Office and how much money has been taken in for that period of time so we can get a handle on whether or not we're expending too much money or whether or not we're getting our bank for our buck by hiring these attorneys and what the practice has been in the past.

351
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:01,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Has it always been outside attorneys?

352
00:55:02,724 --> 00:55:12,211
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe if we get a breakdown of what the expenses were to over the past five years compared to collections, I as one member think that would be helpful to make a decision.

353
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:13,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

354
00:55:14,252 --> 00:55:17,854
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo is seconded by Councilor Falco.

355
00:55:18,094 --> 00:55:19,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

356
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:22,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to, just to be, make sure I completely understand it.

357
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:25,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought any monies recouped would go into this account.

358
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that was, if we had this account open now and we would have 2.2

359
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:33,193
[SPEAKER_05]: to $5 million minus the $110,000?

360
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:34,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

361
00:55:34,574 --> 00:55:41,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Only the cost and fees that we recoup would be in the revolving fund.

362
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:49,704
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that would give us sort of the seed money to continue prosecuting, not prosecuting, but getting those cases to come to fruition.

363
00:55:50,385 --> 00:55:55,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And the taxes and the interest that we get goes to the general fund.

364
00:55:56,745 --> 00:55:59,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 2.25 million would go to the general fund.

365
00:55:59,948 --> 00:56:01,869
[SPEAKER_06]: That has already gone to the general fund.

366
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:02,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

367
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:02,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

368
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:10,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And that includes included in that are some of the, are all of the legal fees because the delinquent taxpayer pays the legal fee.

369
00:56:12,098 --> 00:56:12,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

370
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:23,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So if this happened next year, 2.25 minus the one 12 that of costs and fees, one 12 would go into this new account and then the rest would go into the general fund.

371
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:24,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

372
00:56:24,237 --> 00:56:26,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Provided that those, you know, it's a ballpark.

373
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:34,001
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's def, it's always difficult for the treasurer to know how much needs to be expended to, to get these monies back.

374
00:56:34,101 --> 00:56:38,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's one letter and sometimes it's, it's a case in land court.

375
00:56:38,303 --> 00:56:43,605
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's difficult to know how much, um, needs to be expended.

376
00:56:43,685 --> 00:56:48,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did spend a lot of time in the beginning looking through the cases and then, um,

377
00:56:50,016 --> 00:57:09,812
[SPEAKER_06]: grouping them into Group A, B, and C. And Group A, we're just finishing those cases up now, and those were the ones that were, if you will, the easier ones, that there were no issues with title or issues with taxpayers no longer living in the city or owning the property.

378
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:13,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of those cases are coming to fruition now.

379
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:14,856
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a bunch still in land court.

380
00:57:15,276 --> 00:57:17,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to move on to Batch B, which

381
00:57:18,294 --> 00:57:22,876
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to be more difficult because they have issues.

382
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:27,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the $75 filing fee, that's not lien court.

383
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:29,578
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that a filing fee for you mentioned?

384
00:57:30,138 --> 00:57:40,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the city takes the property, once we send notice and the taxpayer ignores the notice, then we record the lien.

385
00:57:40,481 --> 00:57:40,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

386
00:57:40,821 --> 00:57:44,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we just advertise to and then we record it.

387
00:57:46,952 --> 00:57:47,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice president marks.

388
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:49,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

389
00:57:49,593 --> 00:57:59,275
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and I'm not sure if you're prepared to answer it tonight, but based on the $2 million figure you just gave, uh, is that something that, uh, your office has been working on in the past year and a half?

390
00:57:59,815 --> 00:58:05,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Or is that something that may have been initiated three or four years ago that finally went through land court and settled?

391
00:58:06,197 --> 00:58:13,559
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was, um, that's money that has been come into the city starting January 4th, 2016 to today.

392
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:23,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has all been a result of the work that our office has done.

393
00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:29,980
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was work that was tracked down recently within the past year and a half, letters sent and so forth.

394
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:39,247
[SPEAKER_06]: When I arrived, there was over four, I'm going to say $4.2 million out on the street in tax money.

395
00:58:40,428 --> 00:58:41,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Currently right now?

396
00:58:41,428 --> 00:58:42,629
[SPEAKER_06]: No, when I arrived.

397
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:43,870
[SPEAKER_06]: When you arrived.

398
00:58:44,331 --> 00:58:45,912
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we have in delinquent taxes right now?

399
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:51,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we're below 2 million right now for the entire city.

400
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:52,539
[SPEAKER_17]: We're below 2 million.

401
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:54,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

402
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,221
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it'd be much higher than that.

403
00:58:56,681 --> 00:58:57,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it grows.

404
00:58:57,342 --> 00:59:07,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're going to, we're going to hit the next quarter, um, may 1st, and then we're going to get people who are delinquent then, and we're going to add new cases to the, to the role.

405
00:59:08,669 --> 00:59:14,072
[SPEAKER_17]: And this, uh, amount reflects also, uh, anyone that is delinquent in their water and sewer, correct?

406
00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:18,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Water and sewer goes on to your, when you don't pay your water and sewer bill, that goes on to your real estate bill.

407
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:20,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It's leaned on your real estate bill.

408
00:59:20,331 --> 00:59:25,414
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if you don't pay real estate, do we know what percentage out of that 2 million was water and sewer?

409
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:26,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

410
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:28,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to, I would have to look at that.

411
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:29,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

412
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:41,343
[SPEAKER_17]: And my last question back some years ago, well before your time here as treasurer collector, uh, there was a proposal offered, uh, by the previous administration, uh, to look at a tax amnesty.

413
00:59:42,104 --> 00:59:43,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, where do you stand on tax amnesty?

414
00:59:44,991 --> 01:00:04,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm opposed to a tax amnesty because I believe I see a lot of people who come and pay their taxes in a timely manner and they're making sacrifices and they're not doing all the things that they may want to do, maybe not taking a trip or buying the new car, but they're making sure that their taxes are paid.

415
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:07,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that those people

416
01:00:09,066 --> 01:00:10,466
[SPEAKER_06]: are doing the right thing by the city.

417
01:00:10,626 --> 01:00:23,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think when people choose not to, and I understand there are people who can't and we work with those people, but when people choose not to pay their tax bills or their water and sewer bills, we still have bills as a city that have to get paid every month.

418
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:31,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And so to allow people to forego any interest or penalties and come in and pay the tax just doesn't seem fair to me.

419
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:38,853
[SPEAKER_17]: So just educate me, if someone is delinquent for years and just say there are a number

420
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,634
[SPEAKER_17]: of people that are delinquent for years.

421
01:00:41,134 --> 01:00:45,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we assess the taxes based on those that are delinquent?

422
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:50,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Like you're saying, geez, we have people that are repeat offenders.

423
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:53,563
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't paid their taxes or the water bill in 10 years.

424
01:00:53,963 --> 01:01:01,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we take that into consideration when we set our tax, uh, uh, numbers in our budget numbers?

425
01:01:02,387 --> 01:01:08,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, because those are accounts receivable that we haven't brought in, that we can't get to come in.

426
01:01:08,191 --> 01:01:13,974
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but are we charging other taxpayers more money based on the fact that those delinquents aren't paying?

427
01:01:14,455 --> 01:01:20,979
[SPEAKER_06]: If the delinquency goes on the recap, and then those are receivables that we can't get, then yes.

428
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,283
[SPEAKER_06]: But Alicia would be able to answer that better than me, where the receivables would appear.

429
01:01:29,004 --> 01:01:30,645
[SPEAKER_17]: If she could, I'd like to get an answer on that.

430
01:01:31,842 --> 01:01:32,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

431
01:01:33,163 --> 01:01:35,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia Dunley, finance director, City of Medford.

432
01:01:36,184 --> 01:01:41,167
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they're not directly increased based on those losses, on those people that are not collecting.

433
01:01:41,267 --> 01:01:43,468
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why she's trying to actively do tax title.

434
01:01:43,989 --> 01:01:49,051
[SPEAKER_12]: And we could actually do foreclosures if we felt like going that far.

435
01:01:49,412 --> 01:01:53,534
[SPEAKER_17]: So we exhorb, meaning the city exhorbs those delinquents?

436
01:01:54,194 --> 01:01:56,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they're kept as accounts receivable outstanding.

437
01:01:56,956 --> 01:01:59,237
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to keep trying to get them in tax title.

438
01:01:59,337 --> 01:02:01,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do have the ability, if we can't

439
01:02:01,687 --> 01:02:04,548
[SPEAKER_12]: recoup that money to try to take it through foreclosure.

440
01:02:05,268 --> 01:02:07,869
[SPEAKER_17]: So at what point do we reach out?

441
01:02:08,249 --> 01:02:14,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it when the amount of property that's owed or the amount of money that's owed surpasses what the assessed value is?

442
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:19,333
[SPEAKER_17]: At what time do we go out and start pursuing those legal avenues?

443
01:02:19,353 --> 01:02:21,773
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be a discussion I would have with the mayor and with the treasurer.

444
01:02:22,294 --> 01:02:23,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't give an exact answer on that right now.

445
01:02:24,594 --> 01:02:26,375
[SPEAKER_12]: So are they ongoing, those discussions?

446
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:40,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I may, we, we are always, I have a running list of tax title accounts and I'm always reviewing it and, uh, seeing how we can get to these people and get these monies in.

447
01:02:41,146 --> 01:02:44,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's not something we review once every six months.

448
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:49,468
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, it's a continuing effort on the part of my office to bring that money back to the city.

449
01:02:49,488 --> 01:02:50,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

450
01:02:51,628 --> 01:02:53,469
[SPEAKER_17]: And my last question is, uh, based on,

451
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:57,148
[SPEAKER_17]: What we've brought in, you said, over $2 million.

452
01:02:57,888 --> 01:02:59,948
[SPEAKER_17]: How many properties does that actually account for?

453
01:03:02,168 --> 01:03:04,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we talking one large commercial property?

454
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:06,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we talking 300 small properties?

455
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:10,850
[SPEAKER_06]: There are probably, I want to say, I had a report the other day.

456
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:15,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say 50 plus properties brought in.

457
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:23,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say probably that's about 60 properties because we had some that were in litigation and some that resolved short on litigation.

458
01:03:24,256 --> 01:03:25,156
[SPEAKER_17]: about 60 properties.

459
01:03:25,737 --> 01:03:53,250
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would just ask Mr. President, um, that, uh, we receive, uh, the questions that were asked tonight, uh, regarding, uh, the, um, three or five years, which is, you know, either one would be fine with me of a number of, uh, uh, the amount of money that was requested, not just within the budget, but requested, uh, by the treasurer collector to, uh, collect on these tax delinquents over the past three years.

460
01:03:54,052 --> 01:03:57,795
[SPEAKER_17]: And what percent have we brought in based on those particular years?

461
01:03:58,956 --> 01:04:01,298
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could see a run and tally for the past three years.

462
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:02,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

463
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:02,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

464
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:09,804
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Councilor De La Russo, as seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Vice President Motz.

465
01:04:09,824 --> 01:04:11,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

466
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:14,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor De La Russo?

467
01:04:14,487 --> 01:04:14,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

468
01:04:15,308 --> 01:04:16,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco?

469
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:16,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

470
01:04:17,322 --> 01:04:17,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Nye?

471
01:04:18,003 --> 01:04:18,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

472
01:04:19,003 --> 01:04:19,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Kern?

473
01:04:19,724 --> 01:04:19,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

474
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:21,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Marks?

475
01:04:21,546 --> 01:04:21,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

476
01:04:22,406 --> 01:04:23,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

477
01:04:23,347 --> 01:04:23,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

478
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:25,029
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caprio?

479
01:04:25,169 --> 01:04:25,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

480
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

481
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:33,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

482
01:04:33,696 --> 01:04:33,716
[SPEAKER_18]: 17-352.

483
01:04:34,977 --> 01:04:39,001
[SPEAKER_18]: To the Honorable President and members of the Method City Council, City Hall, Metro-Mass.

484
01:04:41,123 --> 01:04:41,543
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

485
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:47,730
[SPEAKER_18]: 17 3 51 to the honorable president and members of the city council, city hall, Miffin mess.

486
01:04:48,450 --> 01:05:04,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear Mr. President and city councils, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve, approve combining the water enterprise fund and sewer enterprise fund into one enterprise fund per mass general law chapter 44 section 53

487
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:08,894
[SPEAKER_18]: F1 and 2.

488
01:05:08,994 --> 01:05:14,177
[SPEAKER_18]: To that end, I hereby, I here, I recommend your approval of the following resolution.

489
01:05:14,538 --> 01:05:30,168
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the city of Medford accepts the provisions of chapter, chapter 44, section 53 F1 and 2 of the Massachusetts general laws and combines the water enterprise fund and the sewer enterprise fund into one enterprise fund.

490
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Effective fiscal year 2018 attached

491
01:05:36,393 --> 01:05:47,235
[SPEAKER_18]: is the combined Water and Sewer Enterprise Funds Memorandum that was provided to the Water and Sewer Commission, highlighting the benefits of consolidating the two enterprise funds into one enterprise fund.

492
01:05:47,615 --> 01:05:51,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, a letter from the Water and Sewer Commission is provided, which demonstrates their support.

493
01:05:53,056 --> 01:05:58,497
[SPEAKER_18]: Finance Director Alicia Nunley is present to answer any questions from the council regarding this matter.

494
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:00,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

495
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:02,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address of the record again.

496
01:06:02,478 --> 01:06:04,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia Nunley, Finance Director, City of Medford.

497
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:12,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, honorable president and Councillors.

498
01:06:13,924 --> 01:06:23,489
[SPEAKER_12]: What we would like to do is combine the water and sewer enterprise fund into one enterprise fund for reporting since everything is under MWRA here.

499
01:06:24,169 --> 01:06:27,011
[SPEAKER_12]: It just makes more sense for reporting to have it all in one fund.

500
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, for financial reporting.

501
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:36,750
[SPEAKER_18]: Any questions?

502
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:42,515
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my understanding.

503
01:06:42,535 --> 01:06:47,078
[SPEAKER_10]: This matter has made its way through the water and sewer commission and that's a recommendation that they've made.

504
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:47,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

505
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:48,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

506
01:06:50,661 --> 01:06:51,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice president mocks.

507
01:06:52,562 --> 01:06:53,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

508
01:06:54,243 --> 01:07:04,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, you know, knowing that there's always been a distinction between the water and the sewer accounts through this enterprise account and also the budgeting is based on, uh,

509
01:07:06,672 --> 01:07:10,815
[SPEAKER_17]: or some of the budgeting is based on what is in with these particular accounts.

510
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:35,152
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just wondering what else maybe if Alicia can specify why else other than this makes it easier for accounting, why else would we change over knowing that to me, like the budget, having separate budget line items is more accountable than having just one total budget line item when it talks about appropriations and to making sure that

511
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:38,977
[SPEAKER_17]: money is spent, the taxpayer money is spent appropriately.

512
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:41,779
[SPEAKER_17]: So what other reasons can you give us for this change?

513
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:44,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's easier also for tracking for expenses.

514
01:07:44,981 --> 01:07:57,528
[SPEAKER_12]: So instead of trying to split it up between how much somebody is working on sewer versus how much somebody is working on water for recording fixed assets, it's easier for me than to see what I want to attribute to water, what I want to attribute to sewer.

515
01:07:58,649 --> 01:08:01,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we could also break it up within the one fund.

516
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,232
[SPEAKER_12]: It could still have those separate lines showing a water revenue,

517
01:08:04,637 --> 01:08:05,638
[SPEAKER_12]: a sewer revenue.

518
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:07,519
[SPEAKER_12]: It would just be in one fund.

519
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,802
[SPEAKER_12]: So it wouldn't be necessarily it's one line item.

520
01:08:11,162 --> 01:08:14,064
[SPEAKER_12]: It would still show those differences but in one fund.

521
01:08:14,765 --> 01:08:15,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that make sense?

522
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:20,389
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you're still taking the time to account for them within one fund, what's the big cost?

523
01:08:20,589 --> 01:08:22,251
[SPEAKER_12]: It gives more flexibility as well.

524
01:08:22,711 --> 01:08:28,535
[SPEAKER_12]: So, for instance, when I had to come to you guys in December and I had to get that appropriation to cover the $563,000, I believe about

525
01:08:31,252 --> 01:08:32,692
[SPEAKER_12]: I was short in the sewer fund.

526
01:08:32,793 --> 01:08:38,594
[SPEAKER_12]: If they were in one fund, if I have a surplus in one and a deficit in the other, I can put them together.

527
01:08:38,834 --> 01:08:41,495
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have to go forward and it can clean itself up.

528
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:45,357
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's all going to MWRA anyway.

529
01:08:46,117 --> 01:08:46,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

530
01:08:46,677 --> 01:08:50,218
[SPEAKER_17]: What do we have currently within the combined accounts?

531
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:55,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, when you're saying you asked me as far as revenues, you asked me as far as expenses.

532
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:59,011
[SPEAKER_17]: No, what do we have in the water and sewer enterprise accounts?

533
01:08:59,211 --> 01:08:59,711
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm saying.

534
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:02,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you asking me as far as money and revenue collections?

535
01:09:02,852 --> 01:09:03,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Money?

536
01:09:03,132 --> 01:09:04,152
[SPEAKER_17]: What do we have in there for money?

537
01:09:08,414 --> 01:09:09,854
[SPEAKER_12]: In the sewer account, I have 10,000,297,330.19.

538
01:09:09,894 --> 01:09:09,854
10,000,297?

539
01:09:09,954 --> 01:09:10,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

540
01:09:10,274 --> 01:09:11,495
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the water fund, I have 8,000,213,355.33.

541
01:09:26,426 --> 01:09:32,188
[SPEAKER_17]: And what do we anticipate the surplus to be in these accounts?

542
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:38,550
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have actually had to bring that with me from the Water and Sewer Commission.

543
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually didn't bring that with me.

544
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:41,111
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize, but I can provide that to you.

545
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:43,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we looking at about $8 million, $9 million?

546
01:09:43,372 --> 01:09:44,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that's the last figure I heard.

547
01:09:45,753 --> 01:09:47,513
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's as much as revenue that's come in.

548
01:09:47,554 --> 01:09:48,574
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a surplus.

549
01:09:48,954 --> 01:09:50,515
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just revenue that's come in here to date.

550
01:09:50,595 --> 01:09:51,415
[SPEAKER_17]: This figure, correct.

551
01:09:51,435 --> 01:09:51,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

552
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:54,016
[SPEAKER_17]: But what do we anticipate to have as a surplus?

553
01:09:54,855 --> 01:09:56,475
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something I don't have that figure with me.

554
01:09:56,515 --> 01:09:58,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd have to get you don't have a ballpark estimate.

555
01:09:58,996 --> 01:10:03,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't bring that paperwork with me, but I do have it from when we did the water and sewer commission.

556
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:08,059
[SPEAKER_12]: When we're looking at rates, we did look at the what the projected would be.

557
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:12,460
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can get that to you, Mr. President, if I could.

558
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:19,142
[SPEAKER_17]: This council has requested on several occasions within the past six months.

559
01:10:20,822 --> 01:10:22,623
[SPEAKER_17]: One time we took a unanimous vote.

560
01:10:23,043 --> 01:10:23,663
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it was.

561
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:32,781
[SPEAKER_17]: to ask the Water and Sewer Commissioners whether or not they're looking to implement a connectivity fee in water and sewer.

562
01:10:33,621 --> 01:10:35,262
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have yet to get a response.

563
01:10:36,062 --> 01:10:42,264
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know Councilor Longo-Kern asked recently about new construction and having a connectivity fee.

564
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:52,327
[SPEAKER_17]: But the issue that I brought up several months ago was through a conversation I had regarding the Water and Sewer Commissioners voting

565
01:10:53,055 --> 01:10:55,756
[SPEAKER_17]: on creating what they refer to as a baseline charge.

566
01:10:56,376 --> 01:10:57,797
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.

567
01:10:57,817 --> 01:10:58,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you familiar with that?

568
01:10:58,697 --> 01:10:59,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I am.

569
01:11:00,358 --> 01:11:10,541
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as I know, Mr. President, the Water and Sewer Commission has just recently voted to implement the baseline charge to every water and sewer ratepayer in this community.

570
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:13,002
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can call it a baseline charge.

571
01:11:13,422 --> 01:11:14,883
[SPEAKER_17]: You can call it connectivity fee.

572
01:11:15,223 --> 01:11:16,563
[SPEAKER_17]: You can call it Mickey Mouse.

573
01:11:16,603 --> 01:11:18,044
[SPEAKER_17]: You can call it whatever you want to call it.

574
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:21,985
[SPEAKER_17]: What it is is a connection charge that they're charging.

575
01:11:22,913 --> 01:11:35,940
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've been told that this baseline charge is going to be roughly about $1.5 million, divided among all of our ratepayers in the community that pay water and sewer.

576
01:11:36,801 --> 01:11:51,429
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's extremely important now, before we change any accounts or consolidate any accounts, that we get a handle, Mr. President, not only on this paper and the ramifications this paper may have on the accounting and

577
01:11:52,002 --> 01:12:01,785
[SPEAKER_17]: tracking and transparency in this community, but also, Mr. President, on the recent vote by the Water and Sewer Commission on this baseline charge.

578
01:12:02,525 --> 01:12:04,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's extremely important.

579
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:10,167
[SPEAKER_17]: I would ask my fellow colleagues that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting with the Water and Sewer Commissioners, Ms.

580
01:12:10,207 --> 01:12:20,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Nunley, and anyone from the mayor's office to discuss the baseline charge and also discuss this paper, Mr. President, and see if really

581
01:12:20,513 --> 01:12:23,274
[SPEAKER_17]: It provides the benefits that's mentioned.

582
01:12:23,934 --> 01:12:31,436
[SPEAKER_17]: And what impact will the baseline charge have on residents in this community that are already overpaying?

583
01:12:32,197 --> 01:12:36,678
[SPEAKER_17]: We have surplus in the water and sewer enterprise accounts, over $8 million lost.

584
01:12:36,698 --> 01:12:38,979
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember the surplus account was.

585
01:12:39,419 --> 01:12:49,022
[SPEAKER_17]: And now we're adding what I refer to as another hidden charge that supposedly will eventually be used to offset rates.

586
01:12:51,124 --> 01:12:54,906
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this council really needs to get a handle on this, Mr. President.

587
01:12:55,246 --> 01:13:11,053
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would respectfully ask my colleagues to lay this on the table for two weeks until we have a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss this very important baseline issue, which has a lot to do with water and sewer charges on behalf of every ratepayer in this community.

588
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:16,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion by Councilor, Vice President Mox, to table this for two weeks, seconded by?

589
01:13:16,836 --> 01:13:17,556
[SPEAKER_18]: The Committee of the Whole.

590
01:13:17,676 --> 01:13:18,416
[SPEAKER_18]: The Committee of the Whole meeting.

591
01:13:18,557 --> 01:13:19,597
[SPEAKER_18]: And do we have a Committee of the Whole meeting?

592
01:13:20,405 --> 01:13:46,868
[SPEAKER_12]: seconded by is it okay if I make a comment to you through you the chair to councilmarks in regards to the connectivity fee councilmarks I just want to elaborate just a little bit that can I was at the water and sewer Commission meeting and the connectivity fee is actually for more of a maintenance fee we have to give them that service and provide that service to the people to give them the water in the sewer and the uptake in the upkeep of those pipes

593
01:13:47,308 --> 01:13:48,911
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually they need to have that.

594
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:52,599
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's actually a common theme throughout different cities.

595
01:13:52,659 --> 01:13:56,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now that's part of what we pay as water and sewer ratepayers.

596
01:13:56,828 --> 01:13:58,131
[SPEAKER_17]: We pay for personnel.

597
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:03,081
[SPEAKER_17]: We pay for maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure, and this is in addition.

598
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:11,224
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've been providing these services all along, and I don't buy the fact that this is now going to be used for upkeep of the system.

599
01:14:11,524 --> 01:14:13,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's been upkeeping the system?

600
01:14:13,305 --> 01:14:14,385
[SPEAKER_17]: We, the ratepayers, have been.

601
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:20,508
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a part of upkeep, and the administration and the people that are going out and tracking, that are maintaining, that's a part of it.

602
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:24,369
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do have the paperwork that shows the need for the fee that's included.

603
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:25,430
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not doubting that.

604
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:36,900
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this council should be privy when everyone gets their water bill and they're going to be built by the way, just so you know, it's depending on the size of the pipe that comes into your home and they're going to be built every pay period.

605
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:47,190
[SPEAKER_17]: So a residential homeowners could be seeing an additional 25 or $30 every pay period that's listed on their bill as a baseline charge.

606
01:14:47,751 --> 01:14:49,893
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are the things Mr. President,

607
01:14:50,273 --> 01:14:56,517
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that we have to discuss because we should be the first to know about when residents call us and say, hey, what's this?

608
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:57,478
[SPEAKER_17]: And believe me, they will.

609
01:14:57,898 --> 01:15:00,299
[SPEAKER_17]: What's this additional $30 that I'm seeing on my bill?

610
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:05,543
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we're going to have to explain, well, ma'am, that is for infrastructure and maintenance.

611
01:15:06,203 --> 01:15:08,024
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, why do you have $8 million surplus?

612
01:15:08,064 --> 01:15:08,665
[SPEAKER_17]: What's that for?

613
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:11,688
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are the questions I think we need answered.

614
01:15:11,928 --> 01:15:14,670
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not saying it's not a bad idea or a good idea.

615
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:18,312
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm saying it deserves deliberation and dialogue, Mr. President.

616
01:15:18,552 --> 01:15:19,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And we should be in the loop.

617
01:15:19,553 --> 01:15:21,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Did anyone know about this baseline charge?

618
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:23,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody know about this?

619
01:15:23,836 --> 01:15:24,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven counselors?

620
01:15:25,297 --> 01:15:26,117
[SPEAKER_17]: No one knew about it.

621
01:15:27,538 --> 01:15:28,378
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a good question.

622
01:15:28,498 --> 01:15:29,219
[SPEAKER_17]: When is it starting?

623
01:15:29,419 --> 01:15:31,120
[SPEAKER_17]: It was approved by the Water and Sewer Commission.

624
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:33,001
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know when it starts.

625
01:15:33,421 --> 01:15:34,542
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's a good question.

626
01:15:34,582 --> 01:15:36,783
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are the questions, Mr. President.

627
01:15:37,064 --> 01:15:39,225
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we should be quick to act on anything tonight.

628
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,498
[SPEAKER_17]: and get some answers on the motion by Mr. President.

629
01:15:42,578 --> 01:15:44,440
[SPEAKER_18]: The table is by Councilor Marks.

630
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:49,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, Councilor Marks has the floor to you.

631
01:15:50,026 --> 01:15:53,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I yield to the gentleman, Mr. President.

632
01:15:55,412 --> 01:15:56,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

633
01:15:57,074 --> 01:15:59,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, John Sterling, 20 Metcalfe Street.

634
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Dela Russo, point of order.

635
01:16:03,162 --> 01:16:04,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, he cannot speak.

636
01:16:05,223 --> 01:16:09,366
[SPEAKER_15]: There has been a motion made to table.

637
01:16:09,406 --> 01:16:11,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you read Robert's Rules of Debate?

638
01:16:13,088 --> 01:16:14,029
[SPEAKER_15]: He cannot do it.

639
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:18,471
[SPEAKER_15]: According to the Rules of Debate, he cannot speak and neither can Councilor Marks.

640
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:19,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody here can speak.

641
01:16:20,413 --> 01:16:21,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Once a motion is made,

642
01:16:22,554 --> 01:16:31,299
[SPEAKER_16]: to table, all debate is closed, and a vote must be taken immediately, and it's not even necessary to second.

643
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you should follow the rules.

644
01:16:37,122 --> 01:16:51,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, it was my intention, with all due respect, to kindly point out that there was a motion to table on this floor, which ended debate, yet we continued on in debate, and I wanted to kindly

645
01:16:52,332 --> 01:16:53,973
[SPEAKER_09]: and respectfully point that out.

646
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:58,655
[SPEAKER_09]: And hope that we can take a vote on this or dispose of the matter.

647
01:16:58,675 --> 01:17:01,556
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, the table for two weeks.

648
01:17:01,636 --> 01:17:07,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, if the gentleman would like to speak, I'll withdraw my motion and then I'll, uh, if you want to withdraw your motion, I'll withdraw my motion.

649
01:17:08,059 --> 01:17:09,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Marks has withdrawn his motion.

650
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,761
[SPEAKER_09]: May I speak as a member of this body, Mr. President.

651
01:17:15,122 --> 01:17:17,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, the motion has been made.

652
01:17:18,043 --> 01:17:19,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks has withdrawn his motion.

653
01:17:20,604 --> 01:17:21,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, if you withdraw your,

654
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:23,071
[SPEAKER_15]: He's withdrawing his motion.

655
01:17:23,091 --> 01:17:23,691
[SPEAKER_16]: I allow you to speak, John.

656
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:24,452
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to speak or no?

657
01:17:24,732 --> 01:17:25,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to speak?

658
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:25,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I do.

659
01:17:25,952 --> 01:17:26,752
[SPEAKER_16]: I am speaking.

660
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:26,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

661
01:17:27,533 --> 01:17:29,033
[SPEAKER_16]: He withdrew his motion so you can speak.

662
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:30,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, no interruptions.

663
01:17:31,894 --> 01:17:34,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, a motion has been made to table.

664
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:37,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Debate has to be closed immediately.

665
01:17:38,636 --> 01:17:39,997
[SPEAKER_16]: None of the councilors can speak.

666
01:17:40,937 --> 01:17:42,177
[SPEAKER_16]: A second is not needed.

667
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:48,459
[SPEAKER_16]: You should have a copy of Robert's rules here and a vote should be taken immediately.

668
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:50,920
[SPEAKER_16]: It is tabled or it is not tabled.

669
01:17:51,642 --> 01:17:53,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

670
01:17:53,443 --> 01:17:58,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Section 17 of Robert's Rules of Order would say to lay a matter on the table, you move to lay a question on the table.

671
01:17:59,286 --> 01:18:00,226
[SPEAKER_11]: A second is required.

672
01:18:00,527 --> 01:18:01,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

673
01:18:04,669 --> 01:18:07,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor March, do you want to take Councilor Del Rosso?

674
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:17,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Since the motion to table has been removed, I have a couple of things I'd like to point out and a question through the chair to Ms.

675
01:18:17,455 --> 01:18:17,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Nunley.

676
01:18:18,896 --> 01:18:20,917
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I'd like to say that

677
01:18:21,722 --> 01:18:34,207
[SPEAKER_09]: In recent years, we have not seen such activity, research, seriousness, and sophistication from the Water and Sewer Commission, and we should be grateful for that and for their efforts.

678
01:18:35,147 --> 01:18:48,312
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be helpful for us to have some information from them regarding what has been presented by my colleague as some sort of service fee, an additional fee.

679
01:18:51,132 --> 01:18:58,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I can only, uh, speculate at what that might be, uh, uh, directed towards, but, uh, I won't do that out loud.

680
01:18:58,616 --> 01:19:17,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I would like to request kindly, because what seems to me is this, the question isn't, uh, it doesn't necessitate, uh, uh, or prevent us from addressing a very pertinent issue, which my colleague has brought up a very serious issue that we need to address as a body.

681
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:18,165
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree.

682
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:19,066
[SPEAKER_09]: However,

683
01:19:19,766 --> 01:19:23,028
[SPEAKER_09]: we're dealing with what seems to me to be an accounting issue here.

684
01:19:24,249 --> 01:19:25,330
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we keep the books?

685
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:28,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what style do we use?

686
01:19:29,152 --> 01:19:48,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I can only imagine that when this water and sewer enterprise account, um, uh, was initiated some many decades ago, uh, that, uh, it was a style of accounting, uh, that might not be in practice, uh, today to have them divided yet they will on the books, uh, appear separately.

687
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:52,181
[SPEAKER_09]: The money will just be in one pot, if I understand correctly.

688
01:19:52,641 --> 01:19:53,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So, through the Chair, to Ms.

689
01:19:53,861 --> 01:19:57,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Nunley, if I could ask, is there precedent for this?

690
01:19:57,202 --> 01:19:59,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a new guideline that has come out from the Commonwealth?

691
01:20:00,243 --> 01:20:06,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a practice that is being adopted by cities and towns who have a water and sewer enterprise account?

692
01:20:07,485 --> 01:20:15,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the Chair, Councillor DelaRusso, yes, Winchester actually has a combined water and sewer fund, and it is permissible to combine it.

693
01:20:16,668 --> 01:20:16,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

694
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,729
[SPEAKER_12]: And just an accounting reporting.

695
01:20:18,769 --> 01:20:21,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, there would still be separate lines within the one fund.

696
01:20:21,471 --> 01:20:23,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

697
01:20:24,232 --> 01:20:42,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I have no problem with this, uh, uh, this, uh, matter before us as far as seeking permission, because we are the authorizing body, obviously, uh, to, uh, address this, uh, matter of bookkeeping, a matter of bookkeeping and account keeping.

698
01:20:43,310 --> 01:21:02,038
[SPEAKER_09]: it in no ways, in my opinion, abdicates or, uh, minimizes, uh, the matter that my colleague, uh, brought up, which we should have a clear and a significant, uh, uh, conversation with the water and sewing commission about, especially as we're entering the budget season.

699
01:21:02,578 --> 01:21:04,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So I move approval, Mr. President.

700
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:09,321
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, Councilor Knight.

701
01:21:09,901 --> 01:21:11,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

702
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:12,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

703
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:22,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Nunley, in reading the memorandum that you put together for the Water and Sewer Commission, it explains a little bit about a lot of duplication of efforts that your office performs now because you have these two separate funds.

704
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:25,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you go into that a little bit for me and make me understand it a little bit better, please?

705
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:26,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

706
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:31,292
[SPEAKER_12]: So as far as personnel is concerned, we have to split them between the two for reporting.

707
01:21:31,552 --> 01:21:40,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I had it in one fund, if they were working on the Enterprise Fund, they could be 100 percent just charged the Enterprise Fund instead of trying to figure out, okay, they're spending 60 percent of their time doing sewer work.

708
01:21:41,823 --> 01:21:45,584
[SPEAKER_12]: 40% of their time doing water, then trying to split out their benefits.

709
01:21:46,784 --> 01:21:52,746
[SPEAKER_12]: The different liens, when we're billing liens, we can now just put it in one fund instead of having to put liens into two separate items.

710
01:21:52,806 --> 01:21:54,286
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes it a lot easier, a lot cleaner.

711
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:58,968
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's in terms of operations and in terms of administration?

712
01:21:59,168 --> 01:21:59,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

713
01:22:04,389 --> 01:22:05,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Ms.

714
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:05,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Dunley.

715
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:06,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Very welcome.

716
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:08,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

717
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:10,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Mox.

718
01:22:11,683 --> 01:22:15,084
[SPEAKER_17]: As I stated originally, I'm not opposed to this, Mr. President.

719
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,544
[SPEAKER_17]: They're asking for a consolidation of accounts.

720
01:22:19,005 --> 01:22:20,705
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not saying whether it's a good or bad idea.

721
01:22:21,085 --> 01:22:30,047
[SPEAKER_17]: The issue that I brought up regarding the baseline charge, where this money actually goes into these accounts, I think is only appropriate at the time that we look at both, Mr. President.

722
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:33,927
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it only makes sense to me to review both issues.

723
01:22:34,267 --> 01:22:36,968
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this is an accounting issue or a bookkeeping issue.

724
01:22:37,443 --> 01:22:44,267
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's such a simple issue, why hasn't the administration been before us in the past 25 years saying, how do we simplify this?

725
01:22:44,748 --> 01:22:55,074
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's great that you're taking the initiative if it was your, if it came from the mayor, who knows, but I'm glad to see them streamlining Mr. President, but there's no rush to do this.

726
01:22:55,134 --> 01:23:00,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, this is how it existed for 25 years in this community and awaiting two weeks.

727
01:23:01,501 --> 01:23:09,768
[SPEAKER_17]: to sit down with all the interested parties and find out about this paper and also about the baseline charge, I think is prudent government, Mr. President.

728
01:23:10,288 --> 01:23:20,797
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will support tabling the issue, Mr. President, and ask for a roll call vote on the table and that we meet within two weeks as a committee of the whole.

729
01:23:21,117 --> 01:23:28,083
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Councilor Marks to table this for two weeks, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

730
01:23:28,243 --> 01:23:29,043
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

731
01:23:29,063 --> 01:23:29,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

732
01:23:33,748 --> 01:23:35,048
[SPEAKER_18]: The Chair seems to be in doubt.

733
01:23:35,089 --> 01:23:36,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

734
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor DelaRusso?

735
01:23:41,271 --> 01:23:41,571
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

736
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:43,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Felco?

737
01:23:43,392 --> 01:23:43,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

738
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:44,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Naik?

739
01:23:45,152 --> 01:23:45,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

740
01:23:46,353 --> 01:23:47,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor McKernan?

741
01:23:47,233 --> 01:23:47,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

742
01:23:48,514 --> 01:23:49,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Barks?

743
01:23:49,334 --> 01:23:49,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

744
01:23:50,054 --> 01:23:50,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scott Kelly?

745
01:23:51,295 --> 01:23:51,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

746
01:23:52,475 --> 01:23:53,195
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caviello?

747
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:53,656
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

748
01:23:53,676 --> 01:23:57,537
[SPEAKER_18]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

749
01:23:57,577 --> 01:23:58,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

750
01:24:04,613 --> 01:24:07,515
[SPEAKER_18]: I will do my best to get this done in the next two weeks, Vice President Marks.

751
01:24:07,555 --> 01:24:10,176
[SPEAKER_18]: We may have to do it on a Wednesday or a Monday night.

752
01:24:10,196 --> 01:24:11,117
[SPEAKER_18]: We just took a vote, right.

753
01:24:11,177 --> 01:24:15,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Because a lot of the Tuesdays are already full up until the end of the month.

754
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:17,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of personal interjection.

755
01:24:25,403 --> 01:24:38,831
[SPEAKER_08]: While the matter previously before us is closed, and while this has no parliamentary root whatever, I'll just kindly point out that for 25 years, people have been complaining about the way the books have been kept.

756
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:40,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm delighted we're having an update.

757
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:41,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

758
01:24:44,174 --> 01:24:45,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Miles.

759
01:24:46,396 --> 01:24:53,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, considering my fellow colleague has never spoken on the issue and has yet to recognize the taxpayers of this community,

760
01:24:53,827 --> 01:24:59,711
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel it's only appropriate, Mr. President, as an elected official in this community, to make sure each and every rate payer is heard.

761
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:01,572
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what we did tonight, Mr. President.

762
01:25:02,092 --> 01:25:02,673
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

763
01:25:02,713 --> 01:25:06,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

778
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:32,772
[SPEAKER_18]: The matter of a vote for a new designee to the Community Preservation Committee will be held at the earliest date possible.

[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, Mr. Fields name has been withdrawn, uh, from the community development board.

[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

784
01:26:47,695 --> 01:26:54,516
[SPEAKER_14]: In recent weeks, this council's requested that the administration provide us with a list of her appointments to the Community Preservation Commission.

785
01:26:55,178 --> 01:27:00,299
[SPEAKER_14]: which, uh, is a function of the community preservation act that was passed last November by the voters in this community.

786
01:27:00,999 --> 01:27:09,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, as we go through the list here and we see the individuals that have been appointed by the administration, uh, for these individuals are voluntary five or statutory, Mr. President.

787
01:27:09,701 --> 01:27:15,342
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, the council does have the power, um, to approve the appointees that the mayor has put forward.

788
01:27:15,982 --> 01:27:22,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, in reviewing the resumes that have attached and looking at the voluntary appointments that the mayor has put forward, we see Jones here from 40 Cedar road,

789
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,941
[SPEAKER_14]: appointed to a two-year term.

790
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:31,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Joan served on the CPA ad hoc subcommittee that helped craft the CPA language, the CPA ordinance here in our community.

791
01:27:32,184 --> 01:27:34,284
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's someone who I think did a great job also.

792
01:27:34,344 --> 01:27:39,026
[SPEAKER_14]: She was instrumental in getting the Community Preservation Act passed here in the community.

793
01:27:39,146 --> 01:27:42,988
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have, she also has a background in project management, Mr. President.

794
01:27:43,368 --> 01:27:47,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we see Roberta Cameron from North Street, also recommended for a three-year term.

795
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:53,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberta was also a member of the ad hoc committee that helped put together the ordinance that's been adopted by this council.

796
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:56,174
[SPEAKER_14]: and she has a long background in community planning.

797
01:27:57,574 --> 01:28:08,637
[SPEAKER_14]: The other two appointees that are before us this evening are Elizabeth Kerry Sewell from Douglas Road, appointed to a one-year term, and she has a very long and extensive history in landscape architecture, Mr. President.

798
01:28:09,097 --> 01:28:14,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we have Joseph Pecora, a resident from Adams Street, appointed to a one-year term, who is a real estate professional.

799
01:28:14,838 --> 01:28:22,640
[SPEAKER_14]: If we look at the Community Preservation Act and we see that there are certain aspects of the act that it's focused on, preservation of open space, the creation of affordable housing,

800
01:28:23,338 --> 01:28:38,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, the maintaining of our, uh, historic landmarks, Mr. President, I think that, um, the administration has done a great job in going through the applicants in presenting us with a group of, uh, or a team, I should say, of individuals that will move the city in the right direction.

801
01:28:38,844 --> 01:28:43,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so with that being said, I just wanted to have a brief moment to go over the individuals that were appointed, Mr. President.

802
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:45,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I'm comfortable this evening voting on them.

803
01:28:45,727 --> 01:28:49,729
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I'd open the floor up to deliberation to my council colleagues to see how they feel as though they'd like to proceed.

804
01:28:50,489 --> 01:28:50,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

805
01:28:50,729 --> 01:28:52,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor DelaRusso.

806
01:28:52,922 --> 01:28:59,843
[SPEAKER_09]: President, I, first of all, want to thank, uh, uh, Councilor Knight, uh, for his hard work in, uh, bringing us to this point.

807
01:29:00,323 --> 01:29:11,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to second to the motion for approval of the slate of these, uh, fine and highly qualified individuals who will, uh, be deciding how to spend the taxpayers money.

808
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:14,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Dela Rosa.

809
01:29:15,746 --> 01:29:20,867
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also want to, uh, commend the committee for the, uh, the, the amount of work that it took to get this,

810
01:29:21,337 --> 01:29:24,960
[SPEAKER_18]: from nothing up to where it is right now.

811
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,161
[SPEAKER_18]: They did an outstanding job and they should be commended.

812
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:28,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Falco.

813
01:29:28,522 --> 01:29:29,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

814
01:29:29,543 --> 01:29:46,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to also mention that, you know, I work with a number of these people when we put this committee together, and I know for one Joan Sierra and Roberta Cameron, they were extremely knowledgeable and instrumental in passing this.

815
01:29:47,817 --> 01:29:49,837
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in building the, uh, city ordinance.

816
01:29:50,178 --> 01:29:52,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I, I thank the, I thank them for the commitment.

817
01:29:52,818 --> 01:29:58,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is going to be a really, um, I think it's going to be a tough commission to be on, but I think they're up to the challenge.

818
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:00,460
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both smart, knowledgeable people.

819
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think, uh, they'll do a great job.

820
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:03,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

821
01:30:04,761 --> 01:30:05,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Counsel Scott, Billy.

822
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:07,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

823
01:30:07,181 --> 01:30:11,042
[SPEAKER_21]: I too echo, uh, my fellow counselors, uh, remarks.

824
01:30:11,382 --> 01:30:14,543
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that, um, how much time we put into this,

825
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:21,347
[SPEAKER_21]: process and especially Joan and Roberta who have been directly involved.

826
01:30:21,407 --> 01:30:35,376
[SPEAKER_21]: But I, I, I feel that the diversity and the, um, the different backgrounds and all of our appointees will lead us, um, and making great choices for our community moving forward.

827
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:43,020
[SPEAKER_21]: So I, uh, I applaud our representation and, um, and, uh, move forward.

828
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:43,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

829
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:43,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

830
01:30:44,368 --> 01:30:45,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

831
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:48,712
[SPEAKER_16]: John Sorella, 20 Metcalf Street.

832
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:58,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I would respectfully urge this council to table this motion, and I'll tell you why.

833
01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:05,686
[SPEAKER_16]: What we're doing here is appointing nine people to this preservation committee.

834
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:10,931
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, all of the taxpayers are going to pay this surtax.

835
01:31:10,971 --> 01:31:12,272
[SPEAKER_16]: This really is a surtax.

836
01:31:13,387 --> 01:31:16,408
[SPEAKER_16]: on the property tax, which, by the way, has a limitation.

837
01:31:18,049 --> 01:31:19,289
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is not sub-subject.

838
01:31:19,329 --> 01:31:20,910
[SPEAKER_16]: This exceeds the limitation.

839
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:24,311
[SPEAKER_16]: That's illegal, but they're doing it anyway.

840
01:31:25,032 --> 01:31:31,334
[SPEAKER_16]: But the point I want to make is that when you look at these lists of people, and it doesn't matter if someone was instrumental or not in passing it.

841
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:32,295
[SPEAKER_16]: That's history.

842
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:36,196
[SPEAKER_16]: What matters is who's on this preservation committee.

843
01:31:37,537 --> 01:31:39,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, we have eight wards in this city.

844
01:31:40,138 --> 01:31:42,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't you think all of those taxpayers should be represented?

845
01:31:43,377 --> 01:31:44,678
[SPEAKER_16]: We have nine appointments here.

846
01:31:45,618 --> 01:31:47,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

847
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:57,806
[SPEAKER_14]: When the ordinance was crafted, there's language that's included in the ordinance that says that the appointees that are put forward by the mayor will do their best to represent all geographic areas of the community.

848
01:31:57,866 --> 01:32:09,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we look at the individuals who have been appointed and where they live, um, we will see that the appointees that are before the city council, um, are spread out and relatively decently across the community in separate wards, Mr. President.

849
01:32:10,675 --> 01:32:10,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh,

850
01:32:12,012 --> 01:32:13,373
[SPEAKER_16]: I beg to differ, Councillor.

851
01:32:13,793 --> 01:32:15,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Half of the wards are not represented.

852
01:32:16,015 --> 01:32:17,316
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 16 precincts.

853
01:32:17,776 --> 01:32:19,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Half of those precincts are not represented.

854
01:32:20,018 --> 01:32:21,399
[SPEAKER_16]: These also pay taxes.

855
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of clarification, Councillor Knight.

856
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:26,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I never made a reference to a ward or a precinct.

857
01:32:26,363 --> 01:32:29,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I made reference to a geographic area, which is what the ordinance speaks to.

858
01:32:29,486 --> 01:32:30,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councillor Knight.

859
01:32:31,127 --> 01:32:38,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Mike, we vote by wards, and these people are all taxpayers, and they're in the wards.

860
01:32:38,989 --> 01:32:50,474
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at this list of nine people, half of them are from West Medford or from borderline areas of the city close to West Medford.

861
01:32:51,174 --> 01:32:54,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, that is not the way to do it in an equitable way.

862
01:32:54,975 --> 01:32:57,637
[SPEAKER_16]: What we should do is give everybody representation.

863
01:32:58,257 --> 01:33:04,679
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a new list should be offered, and we should have representation throughout the city.

864
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,621
[SPEAKER_16]: That way, a taxpayer will feel

865
01:33:09,603 --> 01:33:16,788
[SPEAKER_16]: that the people on this committee are offering solutions that will also benefit his particular area of the city.

866
01:33:17,268 --> 01:33:18,109
[SPEAKER_16]: And it should be so.

867
01:33:18,669 --> 01:33:21,111
[SPEAKER_16]: All areas should be benefited equally.

868
01:33:21,691 --> 01:33:32,018
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you have a group of nine people and maybe six of them come from West Medford or West Medford contiguous areas, that simply is not fair.

869
01:33:32,339 --> 01:33:38,463
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the reason I am urging a table on this motion and requesting the mayor to submit another list

870
01:33:39,665 --> 01:33:42,046
[SPEAKER_16]: that applies to all the people of the city.

871
01:33:42,066 --> 01:33:43,326
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a more democratic.

872
01:33:43,866 --> 01:33:44,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

873
01:33:44,566 --> 01:33:45,407
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Straw.

874
01:33:47,927 --> 01:33:48,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address of the record, please.

875
01:33:49,648 --> 01:33:49,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

876
01:33:49,968 --> 01:33:53,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Council President Andrew Castaneda, Cushing street method, Massachusetts.

877
01:33:54,629 --> 01:34:06,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not going to get into the West method and, and, and salt method or East Ford, although it's Dr. Surveillance may have brought up some, some reasonable points.

878
01:34:09,193 --> 01:34:19,102
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I would like to say the implication that Mr. Starrella made was it was in effect an override of Prop 2.5.

879
01:34:21,043 --> 01:34:23,345
[SPEAKER_00]: In effect, we could say that, but it really wasn't.

880
01:34:23,406 --> 01:34:27,729
[SPEAKER_00]: It was under the Massachusetts law of the Community Preservation Act, I believe.

881
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:36,157
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'd say when it was voted in by, however it was voted in, and that's,

882
01:34:37,516 --> 01:34:40,237
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an understatement of how it got approved.

883
01:34:42,078 --> 01:35:00,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just wanted to say, if I was had input to what to use as one and a half million dollars, if that's what it is, the first thing I would do is they talk about Chevalier auditorium as having being the crown jewel of the city.

884
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:23,726
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as you pull into Meffitt Square from the Rotary, Route 93, Interstate Route 93 on Salem Street, as you're going past the old Meffitt Cinema, which is now Elizabeth Grady, and on the right-hand side there, after that church is, I believe it's Martin Pastry, or Mike's, I think it's Martin.

885
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:30,469
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that steeple has not been there since, we should have been at Joe's Poolroom back in 68.

886
01:35:32,596 --> 01:35:40,299
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think maybe it's not a crown jewel that's missing, but at least put, as they say on a Christmas tree, a finial on top of that steeple.

887
01:35:40,879 --> 01:35:47,682
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a full blown out structure because it might come down with another windstorm or hurricane and get condemned.

888
01:35:48,102 --> 01:35:56,305
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a reasonable facsimile that goes up 20, 30, 40 feet, made of some sort of carbon or a plastic material.

889
01:35:57,486 --> 01:36:00,487
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the center of the square

890
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:07,204
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look a little bit more with a cap on top.

891
01:36:07,744 --> 01:36:13,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a better presentation to the outsiders and also to myself as I'm driving my bicycle around City Hall.

892
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:15,669
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a no-brainer.

893
01:36:16,049 --> 01:36:22,433
[SPEAKER_00]: People might think it's not important, but I think we'll make a big presentation.

894
01:36:22,453 --> 01:36:24,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I would thank you for listening.

895
01:36:24,774 --> 01:36:28,016
[SPEAKER_18]: The money gets appropriated into several different categories.

896
01:36:28,457 --> 01:36:30,678
[SPEAKER_18]: All the money does not get spent in one particular area.

897
01:36:30,974 --> 01:36:34,116
[SPEAKER_18]: There's different categories where it's a... Yes, I understand.

898
01:36:34,597 --> 01:36:40,601
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major parts of it, if I recollect, is architecture and housing, I believe.

899
01:36:41,702 --> 01:36:48,306
[SPEAKER_00]: But talk about architecture, historical society should have been on that one 25 years ago.

900
01:36:48,467 --> 01:36:49,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.

901
01:36:49,227 --> 01:36:49,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

902
01:36:50,348 --> 01:36:51,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Member O'Kurin.

903
01:36:51,729 --> 01:36:53,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Carviello.

904
01:36:53,610 --> 01:36:59,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to go back and review which sections of the city that everybody was...

905
01:37:01,106 --> 01:37:06,169
[SPEAKER_05]: lives in because I do, I agree with the language, with the way the ordinance was drafted.

906
01:37:06,209 --> 01:37:09,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I also agree with what Dr. Estrella had mentioned.

907
01:37:09,351 --> 01:37:12,654
[SPEAKER_05]: We want every geographic location represented.

908
01:37:12,694 --> 01:37:17,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know to do that would almost be close to impossible because we don't have enough nominees.

909
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:24,561
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you do look at it, you have four appointments from the mayor, which, you know, we do have the resumes attached tonight.

910
01:37:24,921 --> 01:37:26,222
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all very good resumes.

911
01:37:26,582 --> 01:37:30,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Two are up in the Heights, which everybody spoke about, Joan and Roberta.

912
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:33,028
[SPEAKER_05]: One, and then two are from the hillside.

913
01:37:33,769 --> 01:37:40,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And then with regards to the appointees that are picked by the commissions, you do have two West Medford, one South, one Wellington.

914
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:48,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's another West that was pulled because he's been hired by the OCD to work in City Hall.

915
01:37:48,491 --> 01:37:52,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there are, I think, another commission or two that are voting on their member this week.

916
01:37:53,052 --> 01:37:58,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty well, I always like to look at that myself, and it is pretty well represented.

917
01:37:59,614 --> 01:38:01,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have North.

918
01:38:01,587 --> 01:38:04,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Wellington, West, South, and the Hillside.

919
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:13,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've covered, you know, everything with the eight nominees that we're voting on tonight, and I just wanted to point that out for the public.

920
01:38:13,871 --> 01:38:14,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Council Member.

921
01:38:15,232 --> 01:38:16,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Mox.

922
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:18,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

923
01:38:18,713 --> 01:38:20,234
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with all my colleagues.

924
01:38:20,254 --> 01:38:25,456
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we have a great list of candidates that were presented by the mayor.

925
01:38:26,576 --> 01:38:29,037
[SPEAKER_17]: The one difference I do have, Mr. President, is

926
01:38:29,704 --> 01:38:49,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and, uh, I'm not sure about, uh, the new counselors, but it's been past practice of this council that for any appointments, whether it's a confirmation of the mayor's, uh, appointment or our own appointment, which we don't have many of, we've always requested that, uh, the person appeared before the council so we can thoroughly vet them out.

927
01:38:50,818 --> 01:38:59,745
[SPEAKER_17]: And even before that, Mr. President, dating back some 8 to 10 years ago, we used to have committee of the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings to interview.

928
01:38:59,785 --> 01:39:09,312
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember sitting across the table asking people questions on why they want the appointment, what do they plan on doing, what do you see the position as.

929
01:39:10,313 --> 01:39:12,494
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can get a feel of the person, Mr. President.

930
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:14,216
[SPEAKER_17]: It's great we got the resumes.

931
01:39:14,636 --> 01:39:17,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know many of these people, so this is not a dig on

932
01:39:17,672 --> 01:39:19,432
[SPEAKER_17]: who applied and so forth.

933
01:39:19,813 --> 01:39:22,233
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we have to be consistent, Mr. President.

934
01:39:22,573 --> 01:39:26,574
[SPEAKER_17]: We all talk about transparency, and I think we have to be consistent.

935
01:39:26,914 --> 01:39:37,957
[SPEAKER_17]: If I'm going to request that someone on the Liquor Board or someone on the Community Development Board appear before us for a confirmation, then you better believe any other confirmations should appear before us, Mr. President.

936
01:39:38,445 --> 01:39:41,046
[SPEAKER_17]: This council has been great over the last several years.

937
01:39:41,386 --> 01:39:46,027
[SPEAKER_17]: In particular, we have voted to tighten up our rules and regulations.

938
01:39:46,907 --> 01:39:57,070
[SPEAKER_17]: We no longer waive third readings, which does away with the public right to come up when we enact an ordinance.

939
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:01,491
[SPEAKER_17]: And the third reading would allow them to come up and stand before the council.

940
01:40:02,031 --> 01:40:03,391
[SPEAKER_17]: And we used to waive that.

941
01:40:03,431 --> 01:40:05,192
[SPEAKER_17]: We no longer waive that, Mr. President.

942
01:40:06,285 --> 01:40:16,750
[SPEAKER_17]: When we voted for Council President and Vice President, there's a conflict, an inherent conflict, because the Council President and Vice President used to vote on their own pay raise.

943
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:24,934
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not me saying it, that's the Ethics Commission saying there's a conflict of interest on voting on anything that you have a monetary gain to.

944
01:40:25,755 --> 01:40:30,537
[SPEAKER_17]: And we no longer do that, Mr. President, if you look at the way we handle our process.

945
01:40:31,188 --> 01:40:34,289
[SPEAKER_17]: All I would ask, Mr. President, no one wants to stall.

946
01:40:34,349 --> 01:40:35,770
[SPEAKER_17]: No one wants to remove these people.

947
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:52,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Give them the same opportunity to appear before us and let the council ask questions and thoroughly vet them out, Mr. President, not only for this council, but for the purview of the people watching at home, Mr. President, and the purview of transparency, Mr. President.

948
01:40:52,577 --> 01:40:54,118
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what I would offer tonight.

949
01:40:54,438 --> 01:40:55,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's invite them up before us.

950
01:40:56,539 --> 01:40:57,900
[SPEAKER_17]: This has been a long process.

951
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:00,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight and other councilors have done yeoman's work.

952
01:41:01,065 --> 01:41:03,387
[SPEAKER_17]: and pushing this forward to get to this point.

953
01:41:03,827 --> 01:41:09,491
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think vetting these candidates out, which will have the purse strings of every taxpayer.

954
01:41:09,871 --> 01:41:10,831
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a check and balance.

955
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:11,952
[SPEAKER_17]: We end up voting on it.

956
01:41:12,372 --> 01:41:14,774
[SPEAKER_17]: But they make the recommendation to the council.

957
01:41:15,454 --> 01:41:17,836
[SPEAKER_17]: And they do have the purse strings.

958
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:22,543
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think at the very least we have to do our due diligence.

959
01:41:22,903 --> 01:41:26,104
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor might have done hers and we have to do ours, Mr. President.

960
01:41:26,385 --> 01:41:29,686
[SPEAKER_17]: So I respectfully ask that, uh, this be laid on the table.

961
01:41:30,006 --> 01:41:35,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President told all the, uh, nominees appear before the council for proper vetting.

962
01:41:35,429 --> 01:41:36,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like that done by next week?

963
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:38,811
[SPEAKER_17]: As soon as we can get it scheduled.

964
01:41:38,831 --> 01:41:46,495
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President on the motion by council, by vice president marks that we laid this on the table, uh, until we can get everybody here.

965
01:41:47,336 --> 01:41:50,438
[SPEAKER_18]: to confirm them personally, seconded by?

966
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:53,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

967
01:41:54,201 --> 01:41:54,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by?

968
01:41:57,684 --> 01:41:58,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by?

969
01:42:02,888 --> 01:42:04,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councillor McLachlan.

970
01:42:04,629 --> 01:42:05,310
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favour?

971
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:05,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

972
01:42:06,891 --> 01:42:07,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

973
01:42:12,243 --> 01:42:14,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Del Russo and Councillor Knight are in opposition.

974
01:42:15,225 --> 01:42:18,067
[SPEAKER_18]: There will be five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

975
01:42:20,709 --> 01:42:24,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion by Councillor Scapelli to revert back to regular business.

976
01:42:25,353 --> 01:42:26,033
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favour?

977
01:42:28,615 --> 01:42:29,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

978
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:32,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Motions, orders and resolutions.

979
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:36,820
[SPEAKER_18]: 17, three, four, four offered by vice-president marks.

980
01:42:37,581 --> 01:42:45,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the city's information technology strategic plan be discussed.

981
01:42:46,205 --> 01:42:48,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks, vice-president Marks.

982
01:42:49,546 --> 01:42:51,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, president Caviello.

983
01:42:51,067 --> 01:42:53,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, it was back in July, 2016.

984
01:42:53,108 --> 01:42:59,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, the mayor came out with the city of method information technology strategic plan.

985
01:43:00,051 --> 01:43:03,032
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, that was in a plan was supposed to take place,

986
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:03,750
[SPEAKER_17]: from 2016 to 2018.

987
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:16,618
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were going to upgrade many of the computer systems at City Hall, which I think Microsoft Office was back in 2001 that they were using here at City Hall.

988
01:43:17,538 --> 01:43:19,760
[SPEAKER_17]: Needless to say, the systems were very outdated.

989
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:24,823
[SPEAKER_17]: They looked into a new phone system, which I believe they have currently on board.

990
01:43:25,243 --> 01:43:28,685
[SPEAKER_17]: And coupled with that, Mr. President, this new initiative was also to

991
01:43:29,152 --> 01:43:37,580
[SPEAKER_17]: trained employees that were used to working on outdated and archaic systems on the latest and greatest of technology.

992
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:45,186
[SPEAKER_17]: And as part of the proposal, Mr. President, and that's why I offer this tonight, is there was a section for open government.

993
01:43:45,867 --> 01:43:54,735
[SPEAKER_17]: And it stated, the city is in the process of studying the use of social networking for providing all city residents equal and timely access to information.

994
01:43:55,717 --> 01:43:57,298
[SPEAKER_17]: I have yet to see that, Mr. President.

995
01:43:57,438 --> 01:43:58,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe there is something in the works.

996
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,882
[SPEAKER_17]: But I can tell you right now, there's no social networking going on here at City Hall.

997
01:44:04,903 --> 01:44:08,165
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's no community outreach as far as I can see from City Hall.

998
01:44:08,665 --> 01:44:13,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Other than, Mr. President, maybe an inundation of reverse 9-1-1.

999
01:44:15,089 --> 01:44:19,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe, Mr. President, that we're still using wooden A-frame boards.

1000
01:44:20,173 --> 01:44:25,376
[SPEAKER_17]: There's one on Main Street in front of Dunkin' Donuts, alerting people that they're doing street sweeping.

1001
01:44:26,444 --> 01:44:34,286
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the A-frame boards we used back in the Depression, Mr. President, when people that were jobless were walking around with A-frame signs.

1002
01:44:34,887 --> 01:44:41,169
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're still using them in the city of Meffitt now to let residents know what is going on in the community.

1003
01:44:41,869 --> 01:44:48,151
[SPEAKER_17]: So one thing, Mr. President, I want to find out what the social networking that opens it up to every city resident.

1004
01:44:48,171 --> 01:44:49,871
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I got a call last week.

1005
01:44:50,852 --> 01:44:52,012
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be street sweeping.

1006
01:44:52,032 --> 01:44:52,912
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, this is great.

1007
01:44:52,932 --> 01:44:55,053
[SPEAKER_17]: They're alerting me when there's street sweeping.

1008
01:44:55,978 --> 01:44:57,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Go onto the city website, you'll find out.

1009
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:00,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Why call, Mr. President?

1010
01:45:01,282 --> 01:45:06,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Why call residents to let them know there's street sweeping if you're not gonna tell me when the street sweeping is?

1011
01:45:07,126 --> 01:45:15,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And the system has the ability and the capability of alerting residents by ward, precinct, street, address.

1012
01:45:15,992 --> 01:45:19,234
[SPEAKER_17]: It has all sorts of capability, and the city's not using it.

1013
01:45:19,554 --> 01:45:25,078
[SPEAKER_17]: I finally got a call tonight saying there's street sweeping in my neighborhood this, I think it's Wednesday or Thursday.

1014
01:45:25,442 --> 01:45:26,182
[SPEAKER_17]: to move the cars.

1015
01:45:26,622 --> 01:45:28,343
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's my first question, Mr. President.

1016
01:45:28,683 --> 01:45:36,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Where do we stand with the study that was proposed under the mayor's information technology strategic plan on social networking?

1017
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:38,827
[SPEAKER_17]: And the second one was customer service.

1018
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:44,030
[SPEAKER_17]: And it states information technology is studying the use of payments via the internet.

1019
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:45,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

1020
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:46,311
[SPEAKER_17]: That's unbelievable.

1021
01:45:47,051 --> 01:45:47,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine that.

1022
01:45:48,311 --> 01:45:49,932
[SPEAKER_17]: We just got a call waiting on the phones.

1023
01:45:51,032 --> 01:45:52,453
[SPEAKER_17]: So now you can call and leave a message.

1024
01:45:53,273 --> 01:45:54,134
[SPEAKER_17]: That must have been a new.

1025
01:45:55,128 --> 01:45:59,769
[SPEAKER_17]: creation, and now we're going to have the ability to make payments over the Internet.

1026
01:45:59,789 --> 01:46:03,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine if Amazon couldn't make payments over the Internet.

1027
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:06,391
[SPEAKER_17]: What would they do, carry a pigeon?

1028
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:08,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that how they deliver the money?

1029
01:46:09,592 --> 01:46:12,153
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Mr. President, it's great to put this stuff out.

1030
01:46:12,713 --> 01:46:13,753
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds great.

1031
01:46:13,813 --> 01:46:16,554
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, when you read it, open government, customer service.

1032
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:20,595
[SPEAKER_17]: We still have a C-click fix program that's not working.

1033
01:46:21,615 --> 01:46:27,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Anytime we ask for the administration to give us the statistics and reports on it, we get no results from it.

1034
01:46:28,418 --> 01:46:32,559
[SPEAKER_17]: And as far as I'm concerned, it's a complete and utter failure that see click fix.

1035
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:38,121
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, the mayor is talking about automatic transfers of payments and so forth.

1036
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:39,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Has that happened yet?

1037
01:46:39,522 --> 01:46:43,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, it's been a year and four months.

1038
01:46:44,443 --> 01:46:45,723
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been 16 months now.

1039
01:46:46,424 --> 01:46:47,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Has that happened yet?

1040
01:46:47,584 --> 01:46:59,227
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are my questions, Mr. President, regarding social networking and where we stand with a payment via the internet, uh, on this particular item that was offered by the mayor back in 2016.

1041
01:46:59,267 --> 01:47:02,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1042
01:47:03,108 --> 01:47:09,670
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't, I can't say that I do see a Facebook things coming from, uh, different departments here in the city.

1043
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:13,471
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know they do do some networking council Falco.

1044
01:47:14,151 --> 01:47:14,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1045
01:47:14,891 --> 01:47:22,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I just wanted to, uh, while we're on the topic of, uh, information technology, uh, budget season will be upon us soon.

1046
01:47:22,776 --> 01:47:35,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I'd like to, if we can, if I can amend the resolution, uh, just to see if we can get a report from the, uh, technology department here at city hall to find out, uh, basically what new software has been purchased this year and what is being planned for next year.

1047
01:47:40,267 --> 01:47:41,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can get an update as to, uh,

1048
01:47:42,932 --> 01:47:46,874
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as the current software that we're using, what version of software we're using.

1049
01:47:47,274 --> 01:47:49,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, 20, we're in the 21st century here.

1050
01:47:49,416 --> 01:47:52,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Our software should be fairly up to date.

1051
01:47:52,197 --> 01:47:58,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I know last year during the budget hearings, uh, we were lacking and, uh, I want to see what type of progress we made.

1052
01:47:59,441 --> 01:48:02,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's important to find out before we actually go into a budget hearing.

1053
01:48:03,063 --> 01:48:03,944
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

1054
01:48:04,324 --> 01:48:04,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1055
01:48:04,704 --> 01:48:11,028
[SPEAKER_18]: And if I could amend that to ask, uh, I, if I can recall, I thought we had hired a, um,

1056
01:48:12,652 --> 01:48:14,453
[SPEAKER_18]: a second person in the IT department.

1057
01:48:14,934 --> 01:48:22,158
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't seen that second person in the office yet.

1058
01:48:22,278 --> 01:48:25,240
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't seen anyone in there, so I don't know if that person has ever been hired.

1059
01:48:28,943 --> 01:48:31,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have any correspondence, so I can't say.

1060
01:48:33,286 --> 01:48:37,188
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Councillor Mox, second and by.

1061
01:48:39,050 --> 01:48:40,831
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Councillor Mox, second and by.

1062
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1063
01:48:44,161 --> 01:48:45,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1064
01:48:50,505 --> 01:48:51,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Dela Rousseau?

1065
01:48:51,566 --> 01:48:51,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1066
01:48:52,466 --> 01:48:53,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco?

1067
01:48:53,227 --> 01:48:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1068
01:48:53,887 --> 01:48:54,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Night?

1069
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:54,728
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1070
01:48:55,928 --> 01:48:56,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Kern?

1071
01:48:56,689 --> 01:48:56,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1072
01:48:57,629 --> 01:48:58,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Monk?

1073
01:48:58,630 --> 01:48:58,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1074
01:48:59,431 --> 01:49:00,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1075
01:49:00,411 --> 01:49:00,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1076
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,532
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caviello?

1077
01:49:03,253 --> 01:49:03,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1078
01:49:05,234 --> 01:49:07,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1079
01:49:07,195 --> 01:49:08,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

1080
01:49:09,882 --> 01:49:12,303
[SPEAKER_18]: 17, three, four, five offered by Councilor Falco.

1081
01:49:12,864 --> 01:49:24,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas the increased amount of traffic and speeding poses a major public safety concern being resolved that the chief of police increased patrols on Harvard Avenue to monitor the speed of vehicles.

1082
01:49:25,489 --> 01:49:26,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Falco.

1083
01:49:26,449 --> 01:49:27,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1084
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:33,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this issue came up last week during the community police meeting, um, in, uh, at the West Memphis community center.

1085
01:49:33,892 --> 01:49:38,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, during that time there was a lot of discussion regarding the traffic on, uh,

1086
01:49:38,932 --> 01:49:48,297
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like this has become a definite quality of life issue where it's getting to the point where it's really tough to even cross the street.

1087
01:49:49,338 --> 01:49:51,779
[SPEAKER_01]: The traffic is heavier, it's quicker, it's faster.

1088
01:49:51,819 --> 01:49:58,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just basically if we could contact the chief of police, have him increase patrols in that area.

1089
01:49:59,003 --> 01:50:06,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we could also have the portable radar unit put down there as well to monitor traffic and speed.

1090
01:50:07,452 --> 01:50:09,914
[SPEAKER_01]: to protect the residents in that neighborhood.

1091
01:50:10,334 --> 01:50:10,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1092
01:50:10,714 --> 01:50:11,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1093
01:50:11,675 --> 01:50:11,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1094
01:50:12,415 --> 01:50:12,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Counselor Knight.

1095
01:50:13,876 --> 01:50:16,778
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to amend the resolution, Mr. President, and request that Arlington street be included.

1096
01:50:19,059 --> 01:50:27,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, if you could amend the resolution to add Arlington street to that also vice president mocks.

1097
01:50:28,565 --> 01:50:29,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1098
01:50:29,445 --> 01:50:36,990
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank a council Falco first for providing a forum for people throughout the neighborhood to discuss issues of concern.

1099
01:50:37,738 --> 01:50:38,959
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's been very successful.

1100
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:44,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I'm going to once again ask, I think this is my fifth time that this council has voted on.

1101
01:50:44,903 --> 01:50:49,627
[SPEAKER_17]: We were promised as residents of this community that we would have a pilot program

1102
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:52,681
[SPEAKER_17]: with three raised crosswalks.

1103
01:50:53,321 --> 01:50:57,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember the issue about pedestrian safety that's been around for years?

1104
01:50:57,042 --> 01:50:59,923
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember the issues of speeding cars?

1105
01:51:00,544 --> 01:51:09,527
[SPEAKER_17]: We resolved this issue, or thought we were resolving part of the issue, by implementing a pilot program back some, I think it was three or four years ago, under the McGlynn administration.

1106
01:51:10,907 --> 01:51:15,789
[SPEAKER_17]: We carried out one of the three on Winthrop Street, which by the way, needs to be painted.

1107
01:51:15,829 --> 01:51:16,529
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't even see it.

1108
01:51:16,809 --> 01:51:19,450
[SPEAKER_17]: You go over it, it's like hitting just a giant hurdle.

1109
01:51:22,016 --> 01:51:36,163
[SPEAKER_17]: But, Mr. President, we were promised the Winthrop Street, which happened, Harvard Street, which is a very dangerous road and highly trafficked, and Central Ave, another long stretch that residents complain about quite frequently.

1110
01:51:36,503 --> 01:51:38,004
[SPEAKER_17]: I receive complaints, Mr. President.

1111
01:51:38,484 --> 01:51:43,366
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've sent this administration several requests, where do we stand, Mr. President?

1112
01:51:43,927 --> 01:51:48,289
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you can find a paper that responds to that request, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

1113
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:54,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, if you can find that paper, Mr. President, that talks with public safety.

1114
01:51:55,096 --> 01:51:58,360
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the mayor's preaching complete streets, we're doing this and that.

1115
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:02,044
[SPEAKER_17]: What about the basics, Madam Mayor, that we've already spoke about?

1116
01:52:02,845 --> 01:52:04,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Go to Ring Road back here, Mr. President.

1117
01:52:05,875 --> 01:52:11,898
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember we installed back some eight years ago the crosswalk that blinks for $50,000?

1118
01:52:12,899 --> 01:52:16,441
[SPEAKER_17]: We could have thermoplastic the whole city for $50,000, as you mentioned.

1119
01:52:17,081 --> 01:52:18,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Now go buy it, Mr. President.

1120
01:52:18,922 --> 01:52:21,203
[SPEAKER_17]: All the blinkers in the street were torn up.

1121
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:21,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Go buy it.

1122
01:52:22,144 --> 01:52:24,645
[SPEAKER_17]: There's all holes with no more blinkers in the street.

1123
01:52:24,945 --> 01:52:29,828
[SPEAKER_17]: We just spent $50,000 for that crosswalk, and it's gone, Mr. President.

1124
01:52:30,692 --> 01:52:33,354
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and you have the mayor touting about complete streets.

1125
01:52:33,794 --> 01:52:45,521
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it just doesn't make any sense, Mr. President, that when you talk public safety issues and you expect results or at least expect follow-up, you get no response from this administration.

1126
01:52:46,402 --> 01:52:47,943
[SPEAKER_17]: No response at all, Mr. President.

1127
01:52:48,262 --> 01:52:58,531
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to say it's four or five direct votes, I know I offered them personally, that were voted on by this council, and we have yet to get a request on where we stand with the raised crosswalks.

1128
01:52:58,831 --> 01:53:06,618
[SPEAKER_17]: The residents in those areas that were told, I just had a gentleman the other day at Stop It Shop say to me, when are we getting our raised crosswalk on Central Ave?

1129
01:53:07,477 --> 01:53:09,318
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, your guess is as good as mine.

1130
01:53:09,638 --> 01:53:10,779
[SPEAKER_17]: I've asked a dozen times.

1131
01:53:11,079 --> 01:53:15,602
[SPEAKER_17]: And honestly, I'm getting tired of asking the same question over and over again, Mr. President.

1132
01:53:15,842 --> 01:53:18,864
[SPEAKER_17]: So once again, I would ask my colleague if I can amend his paper.

1133
01:53:19,324 --> 01:53:25,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Once again, we'll send the paper to the mayor and ask, where are the other two raised crosswalks that were promised to this community?

1134
01:53:26,188 --> 01:53:29,850
[SPEAKER_17]: When are we going to see them implemented in the interest of public safety?

1135
01:53:31,211 --> 01:53:32,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1136
01:53:32,772 --> 01:53:33,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco.

1137
01:53:34,132 --> 01:53:36,934
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, Mr. President, another issue did come up

1138
01:53:38,071 --> 01:53:39,513
[SPEAKER_01]: during the meeting, a number of issues came up.

1139
01:53:39,573 --> 01:53:43,937
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually a very productive meeting, a great conversation, but a number of issues.

1140
01:53:43,997 --> 01:53:58,711
[SPEAKER_01]: But speed did come up, and the point that Councilor Marks had made earlier in the year about lowering the speed limit to 25, that we all voted for, and it was a great resolution and something that we all supported.

1141
01:53:59,591 --> 01:54:03,435
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, when are those 25 mile per hour signs coming in?

1142
01:54:04,332 --> 01:54:07,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I'm hearing, they haven't been procured yet.

1143
01:54:07,373 --> 01:54:13,075
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could get an update as to when they're going to be procured and installed, that'd be great.

1144
01:54:13,275 --> 01:54:14,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Spring is here.

1145
01:54:14,876 --> 01:54:20,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know, people, you know, tend to get out and drive and there's a lot more people walking around.

1146
01:54:20,218 --> 01:54:25,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's in everybody's best interest that we get those signs installed as soon as possible.

1147
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:28,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could get an update on that, greatly appreciate it.

1148
01:54:28,421 --> 01:54:28,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1149
01:54:28,941 --> 01:54:29,842
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councillor Bailão.

1150
01:54:29,882 --> 01:54:30,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Knight.

1151
01:54:31,298 --> 01:54:33,139
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to further amend the paper.

1152
01:54:33,579 --> 01:54:45,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I request that Tufts University be contacted and that we request they take the appropriate steps to properly improve the visibility of the raised crosswalk that they have on Boston Ave.

1153
01:54:45,165 --> 01:54:46,586
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like Mount Everest.

1154
01:54:46,626 --> 01:54:49,728
[SPEAKER_14]: You come up the hill on it and you can't even see that it's there, Mr. President.

1155
01:54:49,768 --> 01:54:56,931
[SPEAKER_14]: I've witnessed cars going at a normal and acceptable rate of speed still bottom out on it because of the size of it, Mr. President.

1156
01:54:57,051 --> 01:55:00,093
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that we might need to do a little bit better work over there

1157
01:55:00,863 --> 01:55:06,267
[SPEAKER_14]: denoting the fact that there is a raised crosswalk on the street on Boston Avenue right before the old post office.

1158
01:55:06,867 --> 01:55:07,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1159
01:55:08,008 --> 01:55:14,973
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Councilor Falco as amended by President Marks and Councilor Knight.

1160
01:55:15,213 --> 01:55:15,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Do I have a second?

1161
01:55:17,435 --> 01:55:19,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

1162
01:55:19,156 --> 01:55:19,836

01:55:22,278 --> 01:55:24,460

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1169
01:55:57,691 --> 01:56:01,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to, uh, say congratulations to the middle school orchestra.

1172
01:56:12,219 --> 01:56:14,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it'd be great if it could come down.

1173
01:56:14,161 --> 01:56:17,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when I was in the school committee, they came down to a number of meetings and played before us.

1174
01:56:18,223 --> 01:56:21,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, miss Chang does a fabulous job with the children.

1175
01:56:22,465 --> 01:56:25,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you listen to them, it's hard to believe that it's actually,

1178
01:56:39,013 --> 01:56:44,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the eight years that Medford has been involved, they've won six gold and two silver.

1179
01:56:44,576 --> 01:56:45,756
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's pretty impressive.

1180
01:56:45,817 --> 01:56:47,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to say, congratulations.

1181
01:56:48,278 --> 01:56:48,578

1204
01:58:04,447 --> 01:58:05,628
[SPEAKER_18]: 17 3 5 3 offered by council night.

1205
01:58:05,948 --> 01:58:09,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the engineering department report to the council the status and

1206
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:20,486
[SPEAKER_18]: in necessary for service interruption of electricity on Harvard Avenue and what notification systems are in place to inform the affected residents of status thereof.

1207
01:58:21,807 --> 01:58:22,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Knight.

1208
01:58:22,827 --> 01:58:24,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1209
01:58:24,148 --> 01:58:33,093
[SPEAKER_14]: I filed this resolution in response to some frustration that the neighbors had in the area relative to advertised power outages that never happened, Mr. President.

1210
01:58:34,033 --> 01:58:39,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Last week, residents were notified that the power would be out in the evening hours between 8 and 10 p.m.

1211
01:58:39,297 --> 01:58:40,378
[SPEAKER_14]: The power never went out.

1212
01:58:40,979 --> 01:58:44,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Two days later, residents are notified the power is going to go out between certain hours.

1213
01:58:44,781 --> 01:58:45,702
[SPEAKER_14]: The power never goes out.

1214
01:58:46,182 --> 01:58:49,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Three days later, residents are notified the power is going to go out during certain hours.

1215
01:58:50,185 --> 01:58:51,667
[SPEAKER_14]: The power never goes out, Mr. President.

1216
01:58:51,687 --> 01:59:01,314
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm wondering what the situation is on Harvard Avenue and what notification systems are in place to inform the residents, number one, if the power is going to be shut off, but number two, if they're not going to do the scheduled and performed work.

1217
01:59:01,875 --> 01:59:11,664
[SPEAKER_14]: so that individuals that may have made dinner plans to go out that night, as opposed to staying home and opening their refrigerator back and forth, let the freezing cold air out, would be in a little bit of a situation, Mr. President.

1218
01:59:11,684 --> 01:59:17,229
[SPEAKER_14]: So I raise the issue based out of real frustration on behalf of the neighborhood residents especially.

1219
01:59:17,756 --> 01:59:23,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, those residing in the condominium, I have it Avenue that were notified multiple times and contact national grid.

1220
01:59:23,821 --> 01:59:33,550
[SPEAKER_14]: I am Dan Cameron is the individual and I have a place to phone call him into, into him, Mr. President, but I'd like to ask that we send this to the engineering department for an update and I'll make my phone calls to Mr. Cameron and hopefully I can get an answer.

1221
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:34,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1222
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:38,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Personally on the motion by counselor night, seconded by counselor Falco.

1223
01:59:39,214 --> 01:59:39,795
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor.

1224
01:59:39,815 --> 01:59:40,275
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1225
01:59:42,257 --> 01:59:43,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

1226
01:59:46,713 --> 01:59:51,976
[SPEAKER_18]: 17 three, five, four offered by counselor night, be resolved to the code for code enforcement officer.

1227
01:59:52,316 --> 02:00:07,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Meet the entity located at one eight six with the, with the street doing business as stone and skillet on the, on the ongoing violations of city audiences related to the hours of operation, parking and neighborhood concerns related to the cleanliness.

1228
02:00:07,464 --> 02:00:08,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Counselor night.

1229
02:00:08,464 --> 02:00:09,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mr. President.

1230
02:00:09,304 --> 02:00:12,286
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been an ongoing issue in the community for quite some time now.

1231
02:00:13,187 --> 02:00:19,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like every 90 days I'm making a phone call to Code Enforcement or the Board of Health to go down and take a look at Stone and Skillet and what's going on.

1232
02:00:20,728 --> 02:00:27,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Now don't get me wrong, Stone and Skillet's a great business and they're doing a great business and they've absolutely outgrown the location that they're currently located at.

1233
02:00:28,490 --> 02:00:40,492
[SPEAKER_14]: If you aren't familiar, Stone and Skillet right now is located at the old Marty's for Parties, the old Pranzi's location, right on Winthrop Street on the corner of Winthrop and West Street, Mr. President, and in past months we've seen

1234
02:00:41,561 --> 02:00:45,544
[SPEAKER_14]: 18 wheelers double parking on Winthrop Street to load up the truck with product from Stone and Skillet.

1235
02:00:46,224 --> 02:00:50,567
[SPEAKER_14]: We've seen grease trap problems and border health issues that have been rectified in the past.

1236
02:00:50,607 --> 02:00:53,869
[SPEAKER_14]: We've seen rodent problems because of the border health issues in the past, Mr. President.

1237
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:58,672
[SPEAKER_14]: And quite frankly, the neighborhood's a little bit frustrated with it, and they've had enough.

1238
02:00:59,873 --> 02:01:02,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I had the opportunity last Thursday evening at 1 a.m.

1239
02:01:02,515 --> 02:01:08,799
[SPEAKER_14]: with a screaming child in the backseat of my car to drive by Stone and Skillet and see that all the lights were on, the place looked like a nightclub.

1240
02:01:09,475 --> 02:01:13,758
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's something that's not suitable or appropriate for residential neighborhood, Mr. President.

1241
02:01:13,798 --> 02:01:21,684
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm asking that the code enforcement officer go down and meet with the individuals that operate Stone and Skillett and reiterate the city ordinances that are in place.

1242
02:01:22,485 --> 02:01:24,706
[SPEAKER_14]: And if need be, levy citation.

1243
02:01:26,087 --> 02:01:31,051
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also been brought to my attention, Mr. President, that at that location there were late hours when Prenzies was there.

1244
02:01:31,865 --> 02:01:45,889
[SPEAKER_14]: And any special permit or any approval that the city council issued relative to late hours should really go with that business, Pranzi's, and not a muffin wholesale that's operating through all hours of the night that's really far outgrown its location, Mr. President.

1245
02:01:46,449 --> 02:01:49,390
[SPEAKER_14]: We're seeing legitimate 18 wheelers parked on the corner of West Street.

1246
02:01:49,690 --> 02:01:58,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Legitimate 18 wheelers parked right in front of Molten Seafood in the address 186 Winthrop Street during rush hour, normal business hours, blocking the street.

1247
02:01:59,010 --> 02:02:03,674
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gotten to the point of frustration that something needs to happen, something needs to happen sooner rather than later.

1248
02:02:04,314 --> 02:02:05,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to thank Ms.

1249
02:02:05,115 --> 02:02:10,038
[SPEAKER_14]: O'Connor at the Board of Health and Mr. Bavuso and Code Enforcement because they've been working with me for the past year on this issue.

1250
02:02:11,179 --> 02:02:14,661
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've spoken with them both relative to the filing of this resolution.

1251
02:02:15,201 --> 02:02:17,023
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time that something happens down there, Mr. President.

1252
02:02:17,043 --> 02:02:18,784
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm asking that my colleagues support this initiative.

1253
02:02:20,265 --> 02:02:21,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

1254
02:02:21,085 --> 02:02:22,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dela Rousseau.

1255
02:02:22,627 --> 02:02:27,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Just by way of point of information, Mr. President, if I remember correctly, the

1256
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:40,790
[SPEAKER_09]: extended operation hours to the previous occupant of that property were indeed restricted to that occupant and not to the location.

1257
02:02:41,350 --> 02:02:51,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this council has consistently adopted the policy of doing such with any of those applications.

1258
02:02:52,299 --> 02:02:56,122
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Councillor Nays, seconded by Councillor DelaRusso, all those in favour?

1259
02:02:57,062 --> 02:02:58,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes seven, zero.

1260
02:03:00,325 --> 02:03:04,408
[SPEAKER_18]: We have, uh, we have one more councilor.

1261
02:03:04,488 --> 02:03:22,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, actually we, uh, yeah, we have one more, uh, offered by president Caribbean would be a resolve that the city council requests that the DPW clean the rear parking lot of city hall as there's garbage bags and litter that is piled by the melting stove bank.

1262
02:03:22,783 --> 02:03:23,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval.

1263
02:03:23,424 --> 02:03:26,026
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if anyone's, anyone's looked out the back window here.

1264
02:03:26,619 --> 02:03:31,641
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, I was, I was, uh, yeah, I was, uh, third world.

1265
02:03:31,801 --> 02:03:32,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1266
02:03:32,061 --> 02:03:33,281
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks, it looks very bad.

1267
02:03:33,921 --> 02:03:41,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, if the DPW can take care of that immediately, it would be a greatly appreciated while we're under suspension.

1268
02:03:41,984 --> 02:03:45,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks, vice president marks motion.

1269
02:03:45,885 --> 02:03:46,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I moved approval.

1270
02:03:46,605 --> 02:03:49,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Uh, motion by Councilor Dela Rousseau, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1271
02:03:50,166 --> 02:03:50,806
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor.

1272
02:03:51,447 --> 02:03:52,147
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

1273
02:03:53,421 --> 02:03:54,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Mox.

1274
02:03:54,161 --> 02:03:56,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Just if I could, Mr. President, a public announcement.

1275
02:03:56,783 --> 02:04:01,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, a very worthy cause on April 13th at the mall than Irish American.

1276
02:04:01,606 --> 02:04:05,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, they're having the first annual music bingo fundraiser.

1277
02:04:05,888 --> 02:04:14,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, the Volk alumni put this together in the hopes and anticipation to raise some funding as we heard from, uh, miss Richie.

1278
02:04:14,894 --> 02:04:16,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that was a director Richie.

1279
02:04:16,635 --> 02:04:17,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that was,

1280
02:04:17,451 --> 02:04:23,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Before us, I believe it was last week, regarding all the great initiatives that are taking place at the vocational school.

1281
02:04:24,414 --> 02:04:37,679
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the alumni, I think it's the first of its kind as far as I know, reaching out to the community on behalf of the vocational students and the school itself to improve the vocational education in our community.

1282
02:04:37,719 --> 02:04:43,621
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would urge anyone in the community that has a few extra dollars in their pocket, 7 p.m.

1283
02:04:43,701 --> 02:04:44,581
[SPEAKER_17]: to 11 p.m.

1284
02:04:44,981 --> 02:04:46,842
[SPEAKER_17]: April 13th, Irish American,

1285
02:04:47,481 --> 02:04:49,082
[SPEAKER_17]: Music bingo, Mr. President.

1286
02:04:49,562 --> 02:04:51,103
[SPEAKER_17]: And I heard you're one of the singers there.

1287
02:04:51,303 --> 02:04:51,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that true?

1288
02:04:51,943 --> 02:04:52,203
[SPEAKER_17]: I am.

1289
02:04:52,523 --> 02:04:53,064
[SPEAKER_17]: I will be there.

1290
02:04:53,904 --> 02:04:54,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1291
02:04:54,284 --> 02:04:57,126
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to urge everyone to get out there, Mr. President.

1292
02:04:57,706 --> 02:04:59,227
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1293
02:04:59,427 --> 02:05:03,068
[SPEAKER_21]: If I can't thank you for a vice president marks for bringing that up.

1294
02:05:03,128 --> 02:05:04,329
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's a great event.

1295
02:05:04,629 --> 02:05:15,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I think I believe so people understand it's not for the school, but it's actually for the tools that I believe that part of it is going for the

1296
02:05:15,696 --> 02:05:20,038
[SPEAKER_21]: our students as they graduate to assist them in purchasing the tools they need in their trade.

1297
02:05:20,098 --> 02:05:20,838
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's what Ms.

1298
02:05:20,858 --> 02:05:21,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Riccio said.

1299
02:05:21,359 --> 02:05:22,319
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought that was very important.

1300
02:05:22,759 --> 02:05:34,665
[SPEAKER_21]: And the other thing is that evening right around the block is at John Brewer's is the HEMO fundraiser for the buzz off where I've been banned.

1301
02:05:34,765 --> 02:05:38,947
[SPEAKER_21]: They won't allow me in there, but I suggest everybody, everybody,

1302
02:05:39,588 --> 02:05:51,916
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody there, there'll be two events that would be great to stop over and play a little musical bingo and then see some great people over at John Brewer's for a great cause for the buzz off.

1303
02:05:51,956 --> 02:05:53,277
[SPEAKER_21]: So, thank you.

1304
02:05:55,698 --> 02:05:57,379
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I say, because you want to look good.

1305
02:05:57,680 --> 02:05:58,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1306
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:02,022
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't get anything buzzed off?

1307
02:06:02,663 --> 02:06:03,223
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to bring.

1308
02:06:03,243 --> 02:06:03,823
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to bring.

1309
02:06:03,843 --> 02:06:07,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Knight.

1310
02:06:08,226 --> 02:06:09,167
[SPEAKER_18]: Move approval, Mr. President.

1311
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:14,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion by Council, by Vice President Marks.

1312
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:14,881
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1313
02:06:16,501 --> 02:06:18,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

1314
02:06:20,341 --> 02:06:22,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

1315
02:06:23,162 --> 02:06:26,443
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1316
02:06:26,623 --> 02:06:38,985
[SPEAKER_18]: 17348 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of the late Senator, State Senator Charles E. Shannon as for, as April 5th, 2017 marks the 12th anniversary

1317
02:06:41,185 --> 02:06:41,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Office passing.

1318
02:06:42,346 --> 02:06:43,047
[SPEAKER_18]: Counselor Knight.

1319
02:06:44,127 --> 02:06:45,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1320
02:06:45,529 --> 02:06:47,190
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing how time flies.

1321
02:06:47,210 --> 02:06:53,575
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember walking into Senator Shannon's office when I was 19 years old and getting my first big boy job as I like to call it.

1322
02:06:53,715 --> 02:06:55,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And I sat down at a desk next to your son, Richard.

1323
02:06:56,513 --> 02:07:02,540
[SPEAKER_14]: And I logged on to a computer that Councilman Moxley used to sit at, and I began my career in public service, Mr. President.

1324
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:14,614
[SPEAKER_14]: And through the relationship I have with Senator Shannon and the many moments of teaching that he allowed me to participate in through his guidance and his wisdom, I really

1325
02:07:15,981 --> 02:07:20,104
[SPEAKER_14]: miss him and bring this matter forward annually in his remembrance.

1326
02:07:20,384 --> 02:07:22,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Senator Shannon did a great deal of work for the city of Medford.

1327
02:07:22,586 --> 02:07:26,388
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a gentleman who, as they like to say, brought home the bacon to the district.

1328
02:07:27,029 --> 02:07:31,232
[SPEAKER_14]: And that type of representation is something that we need here in the city.

1329
02:07:31,792 --> 02:07:34,974
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was pleased to be a part of it in the Senator's office.

1330
02:07:35,014 --> 02:07:41,939
[SPEAKER_14]: He worked on a number of important issues that we're seeing come to fruition now, like the extension of the Green Line marriage equality, just to name a few, Mr. President.

1331
02:07:42,684 --> 02:07:46,646
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's with a heavy heart that I bring this resolution forward this evening.

1332
02:07:47,287 --> 02:07:52,089
[SPEAKER_14]: However, it's important to me to remember somebody that's meant so much to me and so much to this community.

1333
02:07:52,709 --> 02:07:56,071
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I'd ask that my colleagues join me in endorsing the resolution.

1334
02:07:56,771 --> 02:08:02,574
[SPEAKER_18]: And if I could reiterate that, Councilor, Senator Sheehan and I first got involved with him when I was involved with youth hockey.

1335
02:08:03,335 --> 02:08:09,598
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's the one back in the early 90s when the state was going to tear down that La Conte rink.

1336
02:08:10,491 --> 02:08:13,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Senator Shannon stepped in and got the funding to keep that building open.

1337
02:08:13,872 --> 02:08:17,654
[SPEAKER_18]: And since then, he became both a friend and a mentor to me and my family.

1338
02:08:17,694 --> 02:08:19,274
[SPEAKER_18]: So, again, I commend him for that.

1339
02:08:19,294 --> 02:08:20,895
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could all stand for a moment of silence.

1340
02:08:32,379 --> 02:08:35,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1341
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:39,862
[SPEAKER_18]: 17349, petition by John Sterrella, 20 Metcalf Street, Medford.

1342
02:08:40,293 --> 02:08:46,434
[SPEAKER_18]: to address the council with a template for the upcoming 2018 budget.

1343
02:08:48,654 --> 02:08:49,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1344
02:08:50,695 --> 02:09:06,678
[SPEAKER_16]: John Starella, residing at 20 Metcalf Street.

1345
02:09:07,038 --> 02:09:08,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your patience, Mr. President.

1346
02:09:10,062 --> 02:09:10,904
[SPEAKER_16]: I do appreciate it.

1347
02:09:13,290 --> 02:09:14,011
[SPEAKER_16]: I did want to

1348
02:10:04,174 --> 02:10:06,534
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1349
02:10:08,075 --> 02:10:10,535
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you all six counselors.

1350
02:10:12,795 --> 02:10:17,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I appreciate this opportunity to speak to you and I want to thank you all.

1351
02:10:17,896 --> 02:10:25,538
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to say the title of my discourse tonight is a template for the upcoming 2018 budget.

1352
02:10:26,978 --> 02:10:33,059
[SPEAKER_16]: In January, 2016, the Medford city council under the leadership of counselor

1353
02:10:33,688 --> 02:10:38,810
[SPEAKER_16]: John Falco voted unanimously for a template for the 2017 budget.

1354
02:10:39,931 --> 02:10:40,651
[SPEAKER_16]: I had to look it up.

1355
02:10:41,112 --> 02:10:45,694
[SPEAKER_16]: According to the dictionary template means a guide or a model.

1356
02:10:47,815 --> 02:10:50,316
[SPEAKER_16]: The template was never provided by the administration.

1357
02:10:51,397 --> 02:10:56,819
[SPEAKER_16]: So I am offering my anticipation of the fiscal year 2018 budget.

1358
02:10:56,939 --> 02:11:02,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Now the city of Boston has already put forth its budget.

1359
02:11:04,898 --> 02:11:11,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, this is not so difficult to do because there are legal parameters for proposed budgets.

1360
02:11:13,145 --> 02:11:16,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it too early now to discuss a budget to be passed at the end of June?

1361
02:11:17,889 --> 02:11:18,629
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think so.

1362
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:31,920
[SPEAKER_16]: It is never too early to discuss the budget because the budget is a lifeblood of the people of Medford in a material sense, of course, not in a spiritual sense.

1363
02:11:35,003 --> 02:11:36,944
[SPEAKER_16]: There are senior citizens on fixed income.

1364
02:11:38,565 --> 02:11:40,085
[SPEAKER_16]: There are handicapped young people.

1365
02:11:41,446 --> 02:11:43,287
[SPEAKER_16]: There are under-educated people.

1366
02:11:44,627 --> 02:11:47,569
[SPEAKER_16]: There are drug-addicted people, and so on.

1367
02:11:48,489 --> 02:11:54,592
[SPEAKER_16]: And the department heads all tell us of how they all need more money.

1368
02:11:56,573 --> 02:12:04,096
[SPEAKER_16]: The budget, as presented by the executive, will be passed automatically by a majority of this council in the last week of June.

1369
02:12:05,232 --> 02:12:05,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

1370
02:12:06,953 --> 02:12:11,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that is what has happened every year for almost 30 years.

1371
02:12:13,839 --> 02:12:16,361
[SPEAKER_16]: This year will not be an exception.

1372
02:12:18,483 --> 02:12:25,388
[SPEAKER_16]: The council, as is well known, can shape the budget with a majority line item veto.

1373
02:12:26,729 --> 02:12:28,610
[SPEAKER_16]: But alas, it does not.

1374
02:12:29,771 --> 02:12:34,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Forgetting that it has taken an oath to serve the people of Medford

1375
02:12:35,357 --> 02:12:36,658
[SPEAKER_16]: not the administration.

1376
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:44,584
[SPEAKER_16]: The council and the audience have been given a copy of the anticipated 2018 budget.

1377
02:12:44,604 --> 02:12:46,926
[SPEAKER_16]: This year's 2017 budget is $162 million.

1378
02:12:46,946 --> 02:12:50,729
[SPEAKER_16]: The anticipated 2018 budget, this is the budget that I am suggesting will be in effect, is $169 million.

1379
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:10,244
[SPEAKER_16]: That is $7 million more, a 4.3% increase.

1380
02:13:10,844 --> 02:13:14,087
[SPEAKER_16]: How can a 4.3% increase be justified?

1381
02:13:15,688 --> 02:13:21,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Social security payments to our seniors are flat or diminished.

1382
02:13:21,292 --> 02:13:23,994
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 year United States bonds pay only 2%.

1383
02:13:25,936 --> 02:13:31,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Local banks pay interest to savers as low as one hundredth of 1%.

1384
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:31,480
[SPEAKER_16]: And inflation,

1385
02:13:34,892 --> 02:13:35,272
[SPEAKER_16]: is only 1.3%.

1386
02:13:37,493 --> 02:13:41,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Yet our city needs 4.3% to operate.

1387
02:13:43,314 --> 02:13:45,914
[SPEAKER_16]: How can we rationalize such an inequity?

1388
02:13:46,934 --> 02:13:52,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Now look at the template for the 2018 budget.

1389
02:13:54,136 --> 02:13:55,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Look at how we arrive at these numbers.

1390
02:13:57,357 --> 02:14:03,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Some numbers are rounded numbers and some numbers are estimated because we do not have access to official numbers.

1391
02:14:05,261 --> 02:14:11,524
[SPEAKER_16]: But we will find that we are near accurate because they are based on historical numbers.

1392
02:14:13,784 --> 02:14:19,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Now about this budget, if you look at it, this is how it happens every year.

1393
02:14:19,587 --> 02:14:20,267
[SPEAKER_16]: It's routine.

1394
02:14:20,407 --> 02:14:24,089
[SPEAKER_16]: You can predict what's going to happen because it happens this way every single year.

1395
02:14:24,569 --> 02:14:28,230
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's when Councilor Falco asked about it.

1396
02:14:29,271 --> 02:14:34,673
[SPEAKER_16]: He could have followed this here and anticipated the budget as it's going to be presented, by the way.

1397
02:14:35,633 --> 02:14:39,656
[SPEAKER_16]: We start out with the last levy, which was $104 million.

1398
02:14:40,397 --> 02:14:48,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, we add to that Proposition 2.5%, which is a law, by the way, which is another $2.5 million.

1399
02:14:49,044 --> 02:14:50,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, new growth I had to estimate.

1400
02:14:51,326 --> 02:14:54,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Usually, new growth comes to about $1 million a year.

1401
02:14:55,370 --> 02:15:00,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I'm estimating for this year $1.5 million because we have a lot of building going on in the city.

1402
02:15:01,595 --> 02:15:03,637
[SPEAKER_16]: So we arrive at a levy limit.

1403
02:15:04,498 --> 02:15:06,460
[SPEAKER_16]: of $108 million.

1404
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:12,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, that levy limit of $180 million is what the homeowners pay.

1405
02:15:12,784 --> 02:15:15,546
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the real estate tax, $108 million.

1406
02:15:16,147 --> 02:15:22,472
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is what the people of Medford who own homes will be paying, $108 million.

1407
02:15:23,272 --> 02:15:33,460
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to add to that all the other taxes, like, for instance, local fees, state aid, school grants.

1408
02:15:34,682 --> 02:15:37,404
[SPEAKER_16]: return earnings and the enterprise fund.

1409
02:15:37,524 --> 02:15:39,745
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm putting the enterprise fund in at $25 million.

1410
02:15:40,986 --> 02:15:43,668
[SPEAKER_16]: We discussed that earlier as you remember council marks.

1411
02:15:44,268 --> 02:15:47,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason I'm putting that in is because every year it's about that.

1412
02:15:47,290 --> 02:15:49,451
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 24 million or 25 million or so.

1413
02:15:49,972 --> 02:15:56,456
[SPEAKER_16]: And because of water and sewer rates are being raised, I'm estimating in $25 million.

1414
02:15:56,476 --> 02:16:00,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we arrive at an available budget of $169 million.

1415
02:16:03,642 --> 02:16:08,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember that number $169 million.

1416
02:16:10,684 --> 02:16:16,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Now about this budget, this budget means tax increases in all our taxes.

1417
02:16:17,226 --> 02:16:22,068
[SPEAKER_16]: After all, the $7 billion must come from somewhere.

1418
02:16:24,549 --> 02:16:31,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Only the city council can reduce the budget as presented, but there are many items that cannot be legally reduced like

1419
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:51,406
[SPEAKER_16]: contracted compensation for our worthy employees, like principal and interest on borrowed money of bonds, like insurance, like pension contributions, like state assessments, like legal liabilities.

1420
02:16:54,327 --> 02:17:01,570
[SPEAKER_16]: So the only item, as far as I can see, that we can reduce is the cost

1421
02:17:02,610 --> 02:17:04,071
[SPEAKER_16]: of waste in government.

1422
02:17:05,091 --> 02:17:06,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, waste.

1423
02:17:07,492 --> 02:17:08,452
[SPEAKER_16]: And there is waste.

1424
02:17:09,553 --> 02:17:12,994
[SPEAKER_16]: And it could add up to that $7 million that we were talking about.

1425
02:17:13,314 --> 02:17:16,335
[SPEAKER_16]: After all, it is now only 4% of the $169 million budget, not 4.3%.

1426
02:17:16,375 --> 02:17:18,396
[SPEAKER_16]: There is surely at least 4% waste in our government.

1427
02:17:18,456 --> 02:17:19,757
[SPEAKER_16]: The people of Medford expect honesty,

1428
02:17:32,050 --> 02:17:33,490
[SPEAKER_16]: and truthfulness from our government.

1429
02:17:35,371 --> 02:17:38,292
[SPEAKER_16]: That requires an expenditure of time and energy.

1430
02:17:39,812 --> 02:17:45,574
[SPEAKER_16]: The people expect generosity and kindness from our government.

1431
02:17:48,094 --> 02:17:53,316
[SPEAKER_16]: That requires, well, the other was truthfulness that required transparency.

1432
02:17:54,256 --> 02:17:54,816
[SPEAKER_16]: That was another.

1433
02:17:55,436 --> 02:18:00,938
[SPEAKER_16]: But generosity and kindness require the expenditure of time and energy.

1434
02:18:01,525 --> 02:18:03,765
[SPEAKER_16]: The people expect humility from our government.

1435
02:18:04,606 --> 02:18:08,046
[SPEAKER_16]: That means no arrogance, no elitism.

1436
02:18:09,366 --> 02:18:11,747
[SPEAKER_16]: The people expect courage from our government.

1437
02:18:12,947 --> 02:18:15,127
[SPEAKER_16]: That means taking some personal risk.

1438
02:18:16,268 --> 02:18:23,489
[SPEAKER_16]: And finally, the people expect devotion to the people from our government.

1439
02:18:24,929 --> 02:18:30,110
[SPEAKER_16]: And that requires altruism, honesty,

1440
02:18:31,771 --> 02:18:38,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Generosity, humility, courage, devotion.

1441
02:18:39,797 --> 02:18:55,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Individuals who do not embrace those qualities should not be in government because in the pact with government, the people surrender part of their most precious right in return for some service.

1442
02:18:57,389 --> 02:19:00,091
[SPEAKER_16]: That most precious right is

1443
02:19:01,127 --> 02:19:01,727
[SPEAKER_16]: their liberty.

1444
02:19:03,928 --> 02:19:10,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Marcus Aurelius, who died in 180 AD, said, life is short.

1445
02:19:12,253 --> 02:19:13,453
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all there is to say.

1446
02:19:14,914 --> 02:19:20,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Get what we can from the present, thoughtfully, justly.

1447
02:19:20,417 --> 02:19:22,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, the two most important words there are thoughtfully, justly.

1448
02:19:23,999 --> 02:19:29,562
[SPEAKER_16]: And he says, get what we can from the present, with thought and with justice.

1449
02:19:31,596 --> 02:19:45,203
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we talk about, I've said this before to the council, they're probably tired of hearing it, but someone must expect responsibility for the increase in taxes constantly year after year.

1450
02:19:47,384 --> 02:19:48,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry to say this.

1451
02:19:49,665 --> 02:19:56,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I like all of you personally, believe it or not, but sometimes I regret your political actions.

1452
02:19:59,409 --> 02:20:00,250
[SPEAKER_16]: You can depend on me.

1453
02:20:01,900 --> 02:20:04,542
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you'll never need me, but if you do, I'm available.

1454
02:20:05,782 --> 02:20:14,487
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to say that the increase in taxes is unfortunate responsibility of the city council.

1455
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:20,131
[SPEAKER_16]: The city council can do something about it, but it doesn't.

1456
02:20:21,331 --> 02:20:27,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Therefore, when taxes are increased on the poor, on the people cannot afford it,

1457
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:31,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Other people find difficulty, not the prosperous people in Medford.

1458
02:20:31,523 --> 02:20:33,405
[SPEAKER_16]: There are many, they can afford it.

1459
02:20:34,305 --> 02:20:39,310
[SPEAKER_16]: If they want to pay more taxes, they should, but they should not impose it on the poor people.

1460
02:20:41,011 --> 02:20:42,653
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one thing that I'm sorry about.

1461
02:20:44,014 --> 02:20:49,739
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the flaws of human nature is that people want to control other people.

1462
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:51,740
[SPEAKER_16]: They ought not do that.

1463
02:20:52,901 --> 02:20:54,663
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to pay more taxes, go ahead.

1464
02:20:55,739 --> 02:20:58,641
[SPEAKER_16]: but don't compel other people to do the same thing.

1465
02:20:59,921 --> 02:21:00,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1466
02:21:00,722 --> 02:21:01,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Counsel's.

1467
02:21:01,322 --> 02:21:01,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1468
02:21:01,602 --> 02:21:07,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Thank you.

1469
02:21:21,052 --> 02:21:22,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1470
02:21:25,157 --> 02:21:27,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street.

1471
02:21:29,898 --> 02:21:32,658
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to follow Dr. Starella.

1472
02:21:32,738 --> 02:21:34,219
[SPEAKER_00]: He's so eloquent.

1473
02:21:36,999 --> 02:21:40,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And my education is not so good.

1474
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:43,280
[SPEAKER_00]: From Tuspac, I was educated at Woodstock.

1475
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:44,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to BU once.

1476
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:49,361
[SPEAKER_00]: I did go to BU once, Boston University, I think it's called.

1477
02:21:49,761 --> 02:21:50,522
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was closed.

1478
02:21:52,302 --> 02:21:52,722
[SPEAKER_00]: However,

1479
02:21:53,775 --> 02:22:19,566
[SPEAKER_00]: What really fries my backside is this new growth, let's project it at the past history, about $1.5 million, it is not, never has been deducted from Prop 2.5 before you raise the real estate tax.

1480
02:22:20,507 --> 02:22:21,887
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did last year, the $1.7 million,

1481
02:22:25,105 --> 02:22:33,991
[SPEAKER_00]: of new growth deducted that first from the 2.5% of $100 million, $2.5 million, you would have had like $800,000 increase instead of $2, $3, $4 million.

1482
02:22:34,011 --> 02:22:34,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately, I would say,

1483
02:22:52,902 --> 02:22:54,743
[SPEAKER_00]: The real estate tax was never going up like $400.

1484
02:22:54,903 --> 02:22:56,925
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably would have went up $80.

1485
02:22:57,025 --> 02:23:02,468
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably would have saved 80% on the tax increase.

1486
02:23:04,070 --> 02:23:05,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why it's not being done.

1487
02:23:08,933 --> 02:23:19,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, I don't understand why we can't do what Somerville, Everett, Malden does, Boston, Brookline, and I believe Martha's Vineyard.

1488
02:23:21,852 --> 02:23:31,635
[SPEAKER_00]: to give the owner-occupied who live in their one home, doesn't matter if it's a condo, single, two, three-family, or 100-family marauder home.

1489
02:23:32,455 --> 02:23:32,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter.

1490
02:23:32,975 --> 02:23:35,996
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to get the same 20% exemption.

1491
02:23:36,936 --> 02:23:43,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, now I'm talking, since it's never been done here, 35% to make it worthwhile.

1492
02:23:43,878 --> 02:23:51,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one's real estate tax will go up, even if you live in it, because the cap would be

1493
02:23:52,025 --> 02:23:57,606
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher than last year's projected $600,000 or thereabouts, it'll go up to $1 million.

1494
02:23:58,626 --> 02:24:04,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does go up, because you live in a house that's valued over $1 million, it's going to be a minuscule increase.

1495
02:24:05,367 --> 02:24:17,989
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget, at 20%, if that was adopted, it would have been, I don't know,

1496
02:24:21,955 --> 02:24:24,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm losing track because it's highly unfair.

1497
02:24:26,517 --> 02:24:28,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of understand it.

1498
02:24:28,298 --> 02:24:32,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give the city more money, even on the side, I'm sure they'll take it.

1499
02:24:35,602 --> 02:24:37,463
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dr. Sorella brings up some good points.

1500
02:24:38,944 --> 02:24:49,569
[SPEAKER_00]: I still understand why we don't use that new growth because the new growth, we might as well not have it because we don't need more congestion in East Ford, South Medford because

1501
02:24:50,645 --> 02:24:54,768
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't help the real estate tax because it's been carrying the load for decades.

1502
02:24:55,529 --> 02:24:56,049
[SPEAKER_00]: They hurt us.

1503
02:24:57,250 --> 02:25:06,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Need more police, more fire, schools, school teachers, infrastructure, things of that nature.

1504
02:25:07,597 --> 02:25:08,698
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does that come from?

1505
02:25:10,119 --> 02:25:10,960
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more money.

1506
02:25:12,021 --> 02:25:17,464
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real estate tax, thanks to Barbara Anderson, rest her soul, is about two and a half.

1507
02:25:18,185 --> 02:25:19,426
[SPEAKER_00]: But like Dr. Stirella says,

1508
02:25:19,876 --> 02:25:24,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year's increase, or his projected increase for 2018, will be like over 4%.

1509
02:25:24,497 --> 02:25:26,478
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a fallacy also, Prop 2.5.

1510
02:25:30,059 --> 02:25:32,439
[SPEAKER_00]: How much more can you tax the lower middle class?

1511
02:25:32,499 --> 02:25:34,660
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't care too much for rich people.

1512
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:37,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not really in the poor people's corner either.

1513
02:25:39,201 --> 02:25:40,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm for the lower middle class.

1514
02:25:40,941 --> 02:25:46,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Because without the lower middle class, which is the majority, you're not going to have a society worth a damn.

1515
02:25:47,563 --> 02:25:48,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And I repeat.

1516
02:25:48,536 --> 02:25:50,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be time for a second revolution.

1517
02:25:51,677 --> 02:25:54,218
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how this country was founded when we threw out the English.

1518
02:25:56,179 --> 02:25:56,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a break.

1519
02:25:58,699 --> 02:26:03,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help the taxpayer, the average person.

1520
02:26:03,521 --> 02:26:04,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help them for a change.

1521
02:26:05,422 --> 02:26:05,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Just once.

1522
02:26:06,462 --> 02:26:07,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

1523
02:26:09,443 --> 02:26:15,045
[SPEAKER_18]: The records were passed to suspension of the rules by Councilor Marks.
