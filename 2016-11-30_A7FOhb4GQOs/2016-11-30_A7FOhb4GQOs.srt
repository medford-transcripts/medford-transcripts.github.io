[SPEAKER_07]: At the same meeting, Dom's Motor Service will be petitioning for a class four automotive repair license at 83 Mystic Avenue, Medford, Mass.

24
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:06,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And a public hearing is a very simple process.

25
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:09,458
[SPEAKER_07]: It's divided into two parts.

26
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:15,550
[SPEAKER_07]: One part for those in favor of the petition, one part for those in opposition.

27
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:24,313
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the public hearing process, all we want to do is hear if you are opposed or in favor.

28
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:36,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And so as we call you forward and you wish to express your opinion of being either in favor or being in opposition, you do so at that proper time.

29
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:39,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after the public hearing portion is closed,

30
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:41,244
[SPEAKER_07]: then we have discussion on the matter.

31
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:47,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So I declare the public hearing opened and open it up to those in favor of the petition.

32
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:53,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in favor of presenting yourself to the podium and state so.

[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else in favor?

42
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,961

[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in opposition?

[SPEAKER_07]: And the chairman of the zoning committee, do you have anything to add to this councilor?

53
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:58,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think councilor Caraviello gave us a great synopsis and I too would be supporting this paper and would second his motion for approval.

[SPEAKER_07]: You run a classy operation.

99
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:23,828
[SPEAKER_07]: motions, orders, and resolutions offered by Councilor Marks being resolved at the mass port community advisory committee CAC be discussed.

100
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:24,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

101
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

102
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I was 16, seven 48.

103
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

104
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:33,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

105
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:45,296
[SPEAKER_14]: I offer this a resolution tonight as many members of this council have brought up, uh, before me, uh, concerns regarding, uh, increased, um, airplane,

106
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:46,955
[SPEAKER_14]: traffic over the community.

107
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:51,056
[SPEAKER_14]: And this has been an issue for many, many years.

108
00:06:51,736 --> 00:07:00,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, one in which, uh, the council has requested representatives from Massport to appear before the council, which has yet to happen.

109
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:13,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, the council has requested that, uh, the noise monitors that are located throughout, uh, 30 communities that, uh, directly, um, in the path of Logan airport, um,

110
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,942
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, that the monitors be, uh, relooked at in the community and maybe replaced in different locations.

111
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:24,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, that has yet to happen, Mr. President.

112
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:42,272
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've asked, at least I've put on three separate occasions that the appointment to the, uh, Logan airport community advisory committee, which is known as CAC, C A C, um, that our representative from the city of method that's appointed by the mayor,

113
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:48,339
[SPEAKER_14]: appear before the Medford city council and give us an update on what is happening.

114
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,202
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think I put one on originally, it was about four or five years back.

115
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:58,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we never got a response from the representative at the time that the mayor appointed recently.

116
00:07:58,147 --> 00:07:59,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I think it was two years ago.

117
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:11,337
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked again, I know council Lungo, uh, current has asked, um, uh, for representative to appear before, uh, this council, uh, to give not only the council, but the residents of this community,

118
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:14,152
[SPEAKER_14]: an update on what is happening.

119
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:19,756
[SPEAKER_14]: As we all know, there's been some work done to the runways at Logan Airport.

120
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:28,942
[SPEAKER_14]: And in particular, runway 15 and 33 has a major impact on this community.

121
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,684
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're experiencing it right now.

122
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,806
[SPEAKER_14]: We're hearing from residents.

123
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:40,150
[SPEAKER_14]: And those that are not familiar, the Logan Airport Community Advisory Committee

124
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:48,286
[SPEAKER_14]: which I refer to as CAC, represents over 30 communities, cities and towns within the greater Boston area.

125
00:08:49,147 --> 00:09:01,377
[SPEAKER_14]: CAC worked jointly with the FFA, I'm sorry, FAA and Massport to develop the scope of work for the noise study and will identify and evaluate potential runway use measures.

126
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:04,860
[SPEAKER_14]: CAC represents those communities which have authorized

127
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:10,916
[SPEAKER_14]: representatives in which are or may be affected by airport-related aircraft noise.

128
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:27,525
[SPEAKER_14]: The primary role of CAC involvement during the study is to provide the FAA and Massport with input on aircraft noise issues related to the airport, particularly as it relates to the identification of potential noise abatement measures.

129
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:32,488
[SPEAKER_14]: It also is a mission to provide input on suggested criteria

130
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:44,134
[SPEAKER_14]: to be used in evaluating and comparing those measures, and also recommend to Massport those measures that might be recommended to the FAA for implementation.

131
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:51,484
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a very important body that was created by the state legislature.

132
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:57,326
[SPEAKER_14]: to act on behalf of local cities and towns that may otherwise not have a voice.

133
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:18,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can tell you firsthand that in this community, even though we're not direct abutters to Logan Airport like Winthrop and Revere and East Boston, we're experiencing the same, in my opinion, the same air traffic and noise over our community and much more frequent.

134
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:20,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, that's not just me saying it.

135
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:28,805
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go onto the Logan Airport Massport site, they have a list of complaints, and it's quite easy.

136
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:29,785
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a PDF file.

137
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:37,647
[SPEAKER_14]: You click on it, and it lists all the communities, and it does it year by year, the number of complaints filed for each community.

138
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:42,568
[SPEAKER_14]: And I took it back to 2014, and there were 81 in 2014 communities that someone from that community

139
00:10:48,502 --> 00:10:53,365
[SPEAKER_14]: filed a complaint with Massport about the noise of the aircraft.

140
00:10:54,306 --> 00:11:01,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I found it ironic, Mr. President, that Medford, out of 81 communities, had the fifth highest reported complaints.

141
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:03,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Fifth out of 81.

142
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:04,953
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was in 2014.

143
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:17,642
[SPEAKER_14]: You look in 2015, year to date, which is January to December, Medford, out of 84 communities that lodged complaints, Medford had the eighth highest

144
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:20,733
[SPEAKER_14]: complaint total in 2015.

145
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:29,657
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, it only gives year to date for this year, so it was January to September, nine months worth of complaints.

146
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:35,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And Method is out of 77 communities so far that have called and complained.

147
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Method has the fourth highest complaint total out of 77 communities.

148
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:46,185
[SPEAKER_14]: I find it, Mr. President, over the last two and a half years,

149
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:50,049
[SPEAKER_14]: stunning these particular numbers that we're seeing.

150
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:59,694
[SPEAKER_14]: And it validates the calls and emails that I've received over the last several years, and that's why I've brought the issue up time and time again over the last several years.

151
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:15,363
[SPEAKER_14]: So I, you know, knowing that we don't have a representative on this board, or we have one that doesn't show up to the meetings, I find it disheartening, at the very least, Mr. President.

152
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:43,273
[SPEAKER_14]: that not only the representative that's not showing up, that's one thing, and they're appointed by the mayor, but to have the administration not check to see if someone they're appointing, I know we have very few appointments, but we vet out the person, we ask why does the person wanna get involved, and you don't appoint someone to the community advisory board at Logan Airport if they're interested in making muffins.

153
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:45,997
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what you appoint them to.

154
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:49,418
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not the committee they'd be interested in, Mr. President.

155
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:57,061
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not quite sure why our representative for many years has failed to attend the meetings.

156
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:04,284
[SPEAKER_14]: You could also go online and find out the minutes from each meeting they had.

157
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:08,926
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first meeting minutes I was able to obtain was September 30th, 2014.

158
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:09,647
[SPEAKER_14]: This is in direct concert with

159
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:31,565
[SPEAKER_14]: of the complaints that I pulled up from 2014 and I'm not going to go through the agenda, but the agendas from 2014 to today all deal with runway reconfiguration, how to do noise abatement, concerns about

160
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,720
[SPEAKER_14]: noise, concern about communities.

161
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,922
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's vital to have a seat at the table so Medford has a voice.

162
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:49,229
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't rely on other communities to say, well, you know what, Medford may have that concern too, or we'll speak on behalf of Medford because they're not represented.

163
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:59,696
[SPEAKER_14]: And in September 30th, 2014, Marshfield was there, Marblehead, Scituate, Belmont, Arlington, Nahant, Braintree, Milton, Revere,

164
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:03,445
[SPEAKER_14]: They were all present, and many, many more, Mr. President.

165
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,947
[SPEAKER_14]: But Medford is nowhere to be found.

166
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:21,180
[SPEAKER_14]: The minutes from January 15, 2015, Watertown, Hull, High Park, Cohasset, Watertown, Somerville, Dorchester, Milton, Marblehead, Belmont, Beverly, no Medford person.

167
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they were too busy, Mr. President, to attend that meeting.

168
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:26,104
[SPEAKER_14]: July 6, 2015.

169
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Hull, Marshfield, Belmont, Scituate.

170
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,201
[SPEAKER_14]: These are all representatives, Mr. President, from their community that were appointed.

171
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,583
[SPEAKER_14]: No method delegate there.

172
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:43,164
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can also appoint a delegate too.

173
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:53,828
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if you're unable to make it, you can appoint a delegate and they list the delegates that show up on behalf of the actual appointment that was unable to make it.

174
00:14:54,692 --> 00:15:00,955
[SPEAKER_14]: September 10th, 2015, Howell, Winthrop, Belmont, no method again, Mr. President.

175
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:07,557
[SPEAKER_14]: November 12th, 2015, need I say, no method resident?

176
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't go through the list of other communities that took the time to attend the meeting.

177
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:21,043
[SPEAKER_14]: January 14th, 2016, different administration, same results, no method resident.

178
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:23,353
[SPEAKER_14]: March 10, 2016.

179
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:26,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Nowhere to be found.

180
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:33,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if the time we didn't have someone who was at the transition when it's very difficult.

181
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:42,245
[SPEAKER_14]: If you call up Massport and say, do you know when our representative was appointed by the mayor and what term and so forth, they have no information on it.

182
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,906
[SPEAKER_14]: They rely on the city.

183
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:49,390
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, if you go back to the city, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing.

184
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:49,610
[SPEAKER_14]: So

185
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:54,977
[SPEAKER_14]: April 13, 2016, The Minutes, no Medford resident again.

186
00:15:55,858 --> 00:16:05,425
[SPEAKER_14]: But let me tell you some really important issues being discussed about runway arrivals, noise exposure, historic baseline five-year projections.

187
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,667
[SPEAKER_14]: These are very important issues, Mr. President.

188
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:12,821
[SPEAKER_14]: that if you don't want to brief us as a council, fine, the mayor appointed you.

189
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,085
[SPEAKER_14]: At the very least, you should be briefing the mayor on these issues.

190
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:18,406
[SPEAKER_14]: At the very least.

191
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,728
[SPEAKER_14]: And that hasn't happened, Mr. President.

192
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:26,733
[SPEAKER_14]: May 12th, 2016, no Medford resident appointment.

193
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:33,219
[SPEAKER_14]: July 14th, 2016, again, no Medford appointment on this list.

194
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Nowhere to be found.

195
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:41,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, we've asked time and time again for a meeting with the administration.

196
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:48,021
[SPEAKER_14]: We've asked time and time again to have Massport come before us and give us an update.

197
00:16:48,722 --> 00:17:02,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, the appointment, for whatever reason over the last several years, has not attended any of the meetings that they asked to be appointed to this particular community advisory committee and the administration

198
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:08,136
[SPEAKER_14]: has failed to recognize this, and it's just going on as business as usual.

199
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:21,360
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we received an email today, I think many council members were on it from some very involved citizens that are interested in this issue because it impacts their daily life.

200
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,161
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're being told that there's a very important meeting December 1st.

201
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:31,263
[SPEAKER_14]: And these residents went out on their own, sent a letter to the mayor,

202
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:38,869
[SPEAKER_14]: the city council and said, please, Madam Mayor, can someone be there on behalf of the community?

203
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:45,895
[SPEAKER_14]: We realized that the representative that was appointed has yet to attend any meetings or provide any feedback.

204
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:47,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Can someone be there?

205
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:54,142
[SPEAKER_14]: And I still haven't received a response on that, Mr. President, but we need to get a response.

206
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:58,265
[SPEAKER_14]: We've asked time and time again, this is an important issue.

207
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,227
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a very important issue.

208
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,029
[SPEAKER_14]: in this community, it's a quality of life issue.

209
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:12,858
[SPEAKER_14]: And I take it very serious that when residents call me, whether it's one, two, or a thousand, that I take their concern very seriously.

210
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:15,500
[SPEAKER_14]: And I take this very seriously, Mr. President.

211
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:22,126
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I think it was two weeks ago we asked myself and Councilor Longo, asked for a meeting with the administration.

212
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:23,847
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure where that stands.

213
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:26,049
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you probably have a lot on your plate to set up.

214
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,741
[SPEAKER_14]: This needs to happen sooner than later.

215
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:39,790
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to get an answer about this very important meeting that's taking place regarding two particular runways that have a tremendous impact on the flights over this community.

216
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:50,258
[SPEAKER_14]: And for us not to have a representative on board at this particular time that can be there on behalf of our city is a disgrace as far as I'm concerned.

217
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,580
[SPEAKER_14]: And it needs to be addressed immediately.

218
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,802
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask Mr. President once again,

219
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,916
[SPEAKER_14]: that we have a meeting with the administration, with the mayor.

220
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:04,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the mayor vowed when she ran for office that she was gonna be present to be with this council.

221
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:06,100
[SPEAKER_14]: She was gonna be a face that we see.

222
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,381
[SPEAKER_14]: She was gonna provide a representative that appears before the council.

223
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:12,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Is the mayor's representative here?

224
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:14,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't see the way in the back.

225
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:18,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, no representative from the mayor here tonight.

226
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, another broken promise, another broken promise.

227
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:31,777
[SPEAKER_14]: 11 months into the year, the mayor's appointment to the council has yet to come to one city council meeting.

228
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:34,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

229
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

230
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:49,749
[SPEAKER_07]: For a point of information to the councilors, I've spoken in some detail about this matter with the mayor.

231
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,791
[SPEAKER_07]: She and the city solicitor will be

232
00:19:53,342 --> 00:20:11,155
[SPEAKER_07]: attending this week, a meeting with the, uh, federal aviation administration regarding this matter, uh, because, uh, she does, uh, take this very seriously and will, um, uh, be addressing this, uh, with the FAA.

233
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:19,802
[SPEAKER_07]: She is also, uh, spearheaded a collaborative drive with, uh, local municipal leaders in other communities.

234
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:44,222
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, to express their concern to the FAA on this very matter, as well as has undertaken, uh, an effort to, uh, uh, build relationships and engage, uh, the congressional, uh, uh, delegation, uh, senators and our state, uh, our representative to the United States Congress, uh, on the matter.

235
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:47,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, she shared that with me today in conference.

236
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be attending a meeting on Friday, I believe it is.

237
00:20:54,879 --> 00:21:00,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully, they'll be able to report back to us some of the results from that meeting.

238
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:03,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

239
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:05,506
[SPEAKER_14]: From what I've been told, that meeting was canceled.

240
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:07,107
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

241
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,913
[SPEAKER_07]: The chair recognizes Vice President Alango-Kern.

242
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:21,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks, the FAA meeting is on Friday in Burlington at 10 a.m.

243
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:32,193
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a more important meeting on Thursday night in Boston at Logan Airport to discuss a vote that's going to be taken to reroute the Milton air traffic through Medford.

244
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:37,955
[SPEAKER_12]: That's been postponed, I believe, until December 1.

245
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:39,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

246
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:41,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this.

247
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:48,411
[SPEAKER_12]: to the table again, I think it's important that we speak about it as much as we can and to educate the public.

248
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:52,495
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a number of residents that have been emailing us.

249
00:21:52,855 --> 00:22:01,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Some are just complaints, and there are actually a few with some residents who are more educated than anybody else in the community.

250
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:08,167
[SPEAKER_12]: And thankfully, they're educating the council through letting us know when meetings are, sending us air flight patterns.

251
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:11,970
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you name it, we've received in it, especially the last

252
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:24,999
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd say really in the last month or two, even though this issue has been the last few years, especially since runway 33 L it's something that is happening in my neighborhood.

253
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,241
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm, you know, obviously very concerned about it.

254
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:37,649
[SPEAKER_12]: But like I said, I think last week of the week, two weeks ago, this is affecting 30,000 Medford residents, if not everybody in Medford, because no matter where you live, you hear it, whether it's right above

255
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:44,264
[SPEAKER_12]: whether it's right above your home or whether you're at the pivot point or a little bit away from it.

256
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,866
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's happening at all hours of the night and all hours in the morning.

257
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:59,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't notice it much during the day, but when you, it's hard to get to bed, it wakes you up at night and it's in the morning, it's starting at four or five in the morning from what I hear and the complaints that I'm getting.

258
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,410
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's extremely important.

259
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And Councilor Marks is right.

260
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:08,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I can be correct, stand corrected, but we have two reps from what I've learned over the last couple of weeks.

261
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:13,158
[SPEAKER_12]: One rep, um, Mr. And Mrs. Miso is the CAC rep.

262
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:17,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And from what I understand has never attended a meeting like Councilor Marks pointed out.

263
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:30,644
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have a rep that this council has requested numerous times of the last nine months to appear before the council to just let us know what has gone on, what communication, even if you haven't attended a meeting, what communication have you had with our state delegation?

264
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:38,262
[SPEAKER_12]: to let us know that something is in the works, that there is a meeting that will be attended, that the mayor is on top of it, and nothing.

265
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:39,563
[SPEAKER_12]: We've received nothing.

266
00:23:39,683 --> 00:23:54,692
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're forced to have triple the amount of air traffic if this vote comes to fruition in December, which is, I believe, the vote is being pushed, and they want to take this vote by December.

267
00:23:57,267 --> 00:24:01,870
[SPEAKER_12]: tremendously affect the city of Medford, and it's something that we do need a seat at the table.

268
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:21,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I do have confirmation myself as well that the mayor and city solicitor Rumley will be at the Friday meeting, but that December 1st meeting, I'm unaware if anybody will be in attendance, and that is gonna be a far more, they're all important, but of far more importance, because the city of Milton is complaining.

269
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:26,885
[SPEAKER_12]: They have created, whether the residents and the elected officials have created

270
00:24:28,337 --> 00:24:34,201
[SPEAKER_12]: such a base of complaints and obviously have been on the forefront of pushing the issue.

271
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:38,564
[SPEAKER_12]: And from what I understand, they have air traffic about 6,000 feet above.

272
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:43,347
[SPEAKER_12]: We're here in Medford, and I'll thank constituents who have educated me.

273
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:45,209
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at 2,500 feet.

274
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,412
[SPEAKER_12]: At times, it feels like planes are going to land on your home.

275
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:56,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Children, it's affecting everybody, children, the elderly, and just every single person that lives in a home.

276
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Some homes are shaking.

277
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:10,595
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to get, and I'm glad to hear, I thought we weren't up there with the complaints, but I'm glad to hear tonight that Medford is complaining, and I urge every resident to continue complaining.

278
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:16,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there was a resident here probably a couple months ago who said the complaints are gonna come into play.

279
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:25,722
[SPEAKER_12]: And we obviously, the residents, it's great to hear that the residents are complaining, but we need our administration and we need to get involved and make sure that we're complaining too.

280
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I do plan on going to the meeting on Friday.

281
00:25:28,591 --> 00:25:31,351
[SPEAKER_12]: I can let anybody know what time that will be.

282
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,952
[SPEAKER_12]: That's at 10, and I'm not sure.

283
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:39,754
[SPEAKER_12]: The city solicitor is looking into a timeframe to see if it was an ending time for that meeting, because I know a lot of us do have to work as well.

284
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:49,416
[SPEAKER_12]: But that December 1st meeting, if we can get an update from the mayor, and also while we're talking about it tonight, a request to see if our city solicitor will be at that meeting as well.

285
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:55,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure I missed a number of things, and I know we have residents here that maybe want to educate us a little more.

286
00:25:56,442 --> 00:26:03,025
[SPEAKER_12]: But what is coming down the line with regards to that vote is substantially going to impact this community.

287
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:22,335
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you talk about being fourth and highest out of 77, we're going to, once that happens, if we don't start complaining now and getting involved, we're going to be number one and our phones are going to ring off the hook and people are going to be quite upset with regards to the traffic above our neighborhoods.

288
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:32,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

289
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, you know, part of my work is at Massport all the time.

290
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:44,039
[SPEAKER_15]: And if the people who don't go there on a regular basis like I do, you'll see this construction is always ongoing there.

291
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:53,606
[SPEAKER_15]: And right now, they're redoing Terminal E to accommodate the largest plane out there, which is the A380, which is a two-story airplane.

292
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:54,907
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're putting in new

293
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:03,041
[SPEAKER_15]: jetways and everything, and I can only imagine the noise that's going to make when it's coming in and taking off.

294
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:07,902
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if they have a flight plan for that, but they are doing construction for that.

295
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:13,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I know for personal basis, planes land as early as 4.30 a.m.

296
00:27:13,503 --> 00:27:21,465
[SPEAKER_15]: now, and they take off as late as 2.30 a.m., and coming in the next couple of years,

297
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:34,382
[SPEAKER_15]: We-Massport anticipates 11 more airlines, mostly European, coming into Boston Airport as part of their business stimulation plan.

298
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:38,903
[SPEAKER_15]: So, again, I don't see the noise getting any better.

299
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:45,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, I can only imagine the noise that the A380 is going to make when it's taking off and landing.

300
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:49,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President, do you have the address of where the meeting is on Friday?

301
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:56,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the chair, Councilor Caraviello.

302
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:01,097
[SPEAKER_12]: It's at the FAA office in Burlington.

303
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:03,398
[SPEAKER_12]: City Solicitor Rumley is getting the address.

304
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:05,560
[SPEAKER_12]: He's not sure exactly where the office is.

305
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,481
[SPEAKER_15]: The December 1st meeting is at the same place?

306
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:09,182
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that will be in Boston.

307
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:10,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know where that is in Boston?

308
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,165
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in my email, but I don't have it written down yet.

309
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:15,646
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can get to me, I don't have any problem attending that.

310
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:21,150
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want, I'll attend for the city if nobody volunteers to attend.

311
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

312
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:25,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you all set?

313
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:26,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

314
00:28:26,383 --> 00:28:30,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President's chair recognizes counseling.

315
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:31,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

316
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:46,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to amend the paper to request that the administration consider appointing one of the members of the council as either the representative to the mass port advisory commission or as the alternate delegate to fill in when that person is unable to attend the meetings as amended by Councilor Knight.

317
00:28:53,184 --> 00:28:55,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor cafe yellow.

318
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,401
[SPEAKER_07]: on the motion for approval by Councilor Marks.

319
00:28:59,162 --> 00:28:59,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

320
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:00,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

321
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:02,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

322
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:04,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

323
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:13,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street and I'm glad that this issue is coming out, but I think what's really important is we don't have the mass support community advisory committee person.

324
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:14,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they do meet,

325
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:20,044
[SPEAKER_01]: They ask everyone who's there, I would assume, are you suffering from noise?

326
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:26,432
[SPEAKER_01]: And if no one from Medford raises their hand, then when they give mitigation to others, they'll give punishment to us.

327
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:32,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to be really on top of this because I've followed this since they changed the traffic.

328
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:37,949
[SPEAKER_01]: over two years ago now, and Milton was the first one at the charge that complained.

329
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:46,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they're very close to the airport, because I hear a lot of complaints from the city that, oh, it's OK, we're in the city, and that's the price of living in the city is airplane noise.

330
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Milton is closer than we are to the airport.

331
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:50,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Their lowest plane is 6,000 feet.

332
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Our lowest plane is 2,500 feet.

333
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:56,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have already gotten it raised.

334
00:29:56,924 --> 00:30:01,988
[SPEAKER_01]: When the initial findings came out, their planes were supposed to be at 5,000 feet, and they complained.

335
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:04,232
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were elevated to 6,000 feet.

336
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:10,294
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big question is, how come they can go to 6,000 feet there, but we can't even hit 5,000 here?

337
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,154
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need to start complaining.

338
00:30:12,774 --> 00:30:19,156
[SPEAKER_01]: And if nobody wants to go to that meeting on December 1st, I would love to attend that meeting, because my daughter is on daily medication from the plane noise.

339
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:25,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night as we laid in bed at 11.30 at night, we got a symphony of planes that lasted for approximately one hour.

340
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:27,418
[SPEAKER_01]: We're tired.

341
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,980
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like the planes to be quiet.

342
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,701
[SPEAKER_01]: We're tired of it being our turn.

343
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:31,782
[SPEAKER_01]: We're tired of the 6 a.m.

344
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:32,583
[SPEAKER_01]: wake-up calls.

345
00:30:32,603 --> 00:30:37,228
[SPEAKER_01]: We're tired of the 60 to 90-second intervals of the low-flying planes.

346
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:39,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need somebody that's going to beat the drum for us.

347
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need to beat it loudly.

348
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:43,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I really encourage somebody to go.

349
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:46,835
[SPEAKER_01]: As many people as can go, let's send all those people there.

350
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:50,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try and tell them that, you know, Medford isn't the dumping ground.

351
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:51,818
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the pivot point for these planes.

352
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:56,000
[SPEAKER_01]: These planes fly over Medford, they accelerate, and they turn onto other areas.

353
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:56,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do they turn?

354
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,921
[SPEAKER_01]: They turn to Belmont.

355
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:00,843
[SPEAKER_01]: So Belmont gets a fraction of the planes that fly over Medford.

356
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:02,344
[SPEAKER_01]: They turn to Watertown.

357
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:05,405
[SPEAKER_01]: They turn to all these towns that are going in and complaining.

358
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:12,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting nine, ten times the amount of planes that they're getting and we're just saying that's all right because this is the price of living in the city.

359
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:14,650
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the price of living in the city.

360
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not willing to give you my quality of life because I live in the city.

361
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody needs to stand up for us.

362
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:21,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

363
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:29,598
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello as amended,

364
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:33,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, welcome.

365
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:36,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

366
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:38,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke Prisner, 140 Forest Street.

367
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:49,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to get up here and maybe clarify something about these groups.

368
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:55,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got the Logan CAC, the Massport CAC, and the 33L Working Group.

369
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,487
[SPEAKER_06]: The Logan CAC has been around for two decades.

370
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:01,188
[SPEAKER_06]: They were formed as a result of a courtroom.

371
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:06,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the late, mid-90s, South Boston and other communities put up a stink.

372
00:32:06,906 --> 00:32:07,787
[SPEAKER_06]: There's litigation.

373
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Logan CAC was formed.

374
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:16,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And their sort of mandate was to carry out noise abatement studies.

375
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:17,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come back to that.

376
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:24,440
[SPEAKER_06]: The Massport CAC was created as a result of legislation at the state level.

377
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're kind of spinning up right now.

378
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:30,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to be the persistent entity

379
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,322
[SPEAKER_06]: for years to come.

380
00:32:34,363 --> 00:32:40,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to be the sort of interface between the community and the airport, passports to the airport operator.

381
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:46,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the third group is the 33L working group, which was formed this summer.

382
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:52,122
[SPEAKER_06]: It includes officials from neighboring communities.

383
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:57,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the group that's meeting with the FAA, because they weren't getting satisfaction.

384
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:11,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So they got their state representatives, they got federal representatives to write letters, to write a couple letters, and win an audience with the FAA.

385
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:12,478
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be meeting on Friday.

386
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:20,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they're going to be talking about are kind of the rough outline of a study that FAA, MIT,

387
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:23,888
[SPEAKER_06]: and Massport are going to conduct together.

388
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:30,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And that study is going to look at what can we do to mitigate the noise created by RNAV.

389
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,830
[SPEAKER_06]: RNAV is this navigation system.

390
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the reason why the planes seem so loud.

391
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:50,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Logan CAC, I want to come back to that because they're kind of important in the current near-term period.

392
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,832
[SPEAKER_06]: The Logan CAC has been around for two decades, and they're about to dissolve.

393
00:33:55,512 --> 00:34:00,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Their charter is about to run out, and they're going to vanish at the end of the year.

394
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:02,397
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to have any money.

395
00:34:02,477 --> 00:34:03,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Their charter's done.

396
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:10,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they're trying to put together are a series of recommendations related to runway use.

397
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:16,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's people on that CAC that strongly advocate for their communities, right?

398
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:17,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford doesn't have an advocate.

399
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:20,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And so those folks,

400
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:30,499
[SPEAKER_06]: doing what they need to do, what they feel they need to do for their constituents, are trying to push a runway use plan that is equitable.

401
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:37,704
[SPEAKER_06]: And what that can mean for us is the activation of runway 15 for routine use.

402
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:43,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And what that would result in is maybe a doubling of air traffic.

403
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:47,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would be concentrated over Fulton Heights and Wellington.

404
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:49,792
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest of Medford wouldn't really see it,

405
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:53,268
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd really feel it in Fulton Heights and Wellington.

406
00:34:53,988 --> 00:35:03,733
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be in addition to the departure traffic from 33L, which a lot of us feel, with the exception of maybe up by the high school.

407
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:12,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Logan CAC is working on this runway use plan, and they want to have a vote.

408
00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:15,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were going to vote on Thursday, and that meeting is

409
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:18,055
[SPEAKER_06]: been canceled, it's been pushed to December 1st.

410
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:27,417
[SPEAKER_06]: But that meeting on December 1st is going to be important because they're going to vote on a redistribution of runway use for arrivals.

411
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:34,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And that recommendation is then going to be pushed up to Massport and FAA, and they may take it.

412
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:38,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they take it, then what you're going to see is regular use of runway 15.

413
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why that meeting is important.

414
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:44,482
[SPEAKER_06]: The meeting on Friday is with the 33L working group.

415
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:49,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And my understanding is the mayor and the city solicitor will be present.

416
00:35:50,548 --> 00:36:07,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm very thankful that they're going to be there because Medford needs a seat at the table because they're going to be laying out the plan for how to address the noise problems that we're all complaining about.

417
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:12,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be a really important meeting with this third group.

418
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:19,820
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really important, and I really want to thank you all for bringing this up, because it's an important matter for the city.

419
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:29,744
[SPEAKER_06]: It directly affects quality of life, because it's our way of offering feedback to the airport operator.

420
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:42,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do need a Massport rep, for sure, the Massport CAC, because moving forward, that's going to be the group that's going to present the feedback to the airport.

421
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:52,364
[SPEAKER_06]: We need someone present at this Logan CAC meeting to make sure that we're not railroaded with an unequitable runway distribution.

422
00:36:53,444 --> 00:37:07,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need someone at this 33L working group meeting to make sure that our concerns are factored in to whatever FAA and MIT and Massport choose to do moving forward with their study.

423
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:10,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all I have.

424
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:21,147
[SPEAKER_06]: make it clear that the Logan CAC was created as a result of litigation 20 years ago, and their focus is runway use plans.

425
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:30,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Massport CAC was created as a result of state legislation, and it's going to be the sort of community advocacy group moving forward.

426
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:40,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we've got this ad hoc group that was put together because the other groups weren't basically meeting the needs of or listening to the concerns of

427
00:37:41,152 --> 00:37:43,973
[SPEAKER_06]: or at least being able to address the concerns of people.

428
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:46,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all I have.

429
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:47,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the three groups.

430
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:51,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

431
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:52,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

432
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:59,636
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe last time you were at our meeting a couple months ago, you had mentioned how the amount of complaints does factor in.

433
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:02,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you just reiterate what you stated?

434
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:03,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, sure, yeah.

435
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:09,218
[SPEAKER_06]: When Massport looks at the number of callers,

436
00:38:10,076 --> 00:38:16,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And the number of complaints, you know, they, that's their main form of feedback.

437
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:17,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the numbers.

438
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:28,831
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, in the letter that was written by Senator Warren, which referenced the letter that our state legislators all signed, saying we've got a problem with noise.

439
00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:32,834
[SPEAKER_06]: In Senator Warren's letter, she referenced the number of complaints.

440
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:41,415
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably the clearest indication that the complaints are, like, people are looking at them and they mean something.

441
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:48,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'll say is, you know, Milton has by far the most complaints.

442
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:52,453
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of callers and they have a lot of complaints from each caller kind of thing.

443
00:38:54,375 --> 00:39:00,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we've got, I think, one of the highest, the fourth highest.

444
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's important to get complaints from a lot of callers.

445
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:09,246
[SPEAKER_06]: That carries more weight than a thousand, you know, a thousand complaints from one person.

446
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:11,488
[SPEAKER_06]: You can kind of dismiss that.

447
00:39:11,568 --> 00:39:14,690
[SPEAKER_06]: But one complaint from 1,000 people, you can't ignore.

448
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:19,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll make that judgment there.

449
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:23,538
[SPEAKER_06]: So the complaints are important, and people do look at them.

450
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:36,609
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes distinguished citizen at the podium.

451
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

452
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:40,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Mr. President, uh, members of the city council.

453
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:45,095
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Paul Camuso, a resident of one 14 Lincoln road in Medford.

454
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:50,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you this evening on this particular matter.

455
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:56,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, as we all know, we've seen an increase in air traffic over our community and uh,

456
00:39:57,033 --> 00:40:01,534
[SPEAKER_10]: My personal opinions, being this close to Boston, we're going to see things of that nature.

457
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:06,096
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what makes us one of the components of making a great community.

458
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:08,577
[SPEAKER_10]: It's having the proximity to Boston.

459
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:21,141
[SPEAKER_10]: But with that comes the responsibility of our elected officials to advocate on behalf of our residents to make sure that we can do the best that we can as far as mitigating circumstances.

460
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:23,822
[SPEAKER_10]: The interesting part of this conversation, I think,

461
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:27,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, runway 15 right at Logan Airport.

462
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:34,181
[SPEAKER_10]: They're looking to, as the gentleman said, to possibly divert more of the traffic to 15 right.

463
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:49,267
[SPEAKER_10]: For those of you that don't realize it, 15 right is the landing path when it comes over like Winchester, right over the Lawrence Memorial Hospital in the Lawrence Estates, and then over the lower part of the Fulton Heights in Wellington.

464
00:40:50,751 --> 00:41:06,662
[SPEAKER_10]: and that will certainly increase if, um, if the changes go through, uh, I'd be remissed if I don't thank, um, the mayor as well as the city council for, um, for making sure that we have a seat at the table next week, um, at these very important meetings.

465
00:41:07,282 --> 00:41:18,270
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the, uh, the FAA, uh, they're more worried about safety and things of that magnitude rather than noise complaints because at the end of the day, uh, safety is their paramount, um,

466
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,932
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, thoughts and feelings when it comes to, um, these type of decisions.

467
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:26,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I'm learning a lot more about the air traffic patterns and stuff.

468
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:31,097
[SPEAKER_10]: My brother is a commercial pilot for a major airline that flies out of Logan airport.

469
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:39,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, and, uh, like he was explaining to me, certain winds and stuff dictate the runway takes off and takeoffs and landings, uh, as well.

470
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:44,184
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not just saying we're going to bury Medford with all the noise and give Milton a break.

471
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:47,286
[SPEAKER_10]: It all depends on some, uh, extenuating circumstances.

472
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:54,669
[SPEAKER_10]: As someone that does like to fly to go on vacation, I would rather take the safest route out of the airport.

473
00:41:56,653 --> 00:41:59,274
[SPEAKER_10]: given the nature of being in an aircraft.

474
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:00,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's common sense.

475
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:17,620
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just wanted to get up here and thank the Mayor, Mayor Burke, as well as the City Council on this particular matter, because I think one of the best things that we have going for us is voices of reason sitting at the table and discussing topics.

476
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:24,503
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing I know that should be a priority of people is if we're going to get more air traffic over our community,

477
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:34,046
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be entitled to more funding to put additional measures in people's homes, similar to Winthrop, similar to East Boston.

478
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:37,669
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that that's another important piece of the puzzle.

479
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:47,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just think it's very important that we look at this as a safety issue and as well as an issue of quality of life at the same time.

480
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:51,018
[SPEAKER_10]: One should not trump the other, as far as I'm concerned.

481
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:54,500
[SPEAKER_10]: but I'm just a one of many citizens in our community.

482
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,042
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this distinguished body this evening.

483
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:04,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look forward to seeing how this goes along and the next coming months.

484
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:05,384
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Mr. President.

485
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:06,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

486
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:13,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Citizen on the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by councilor Caraviello as amended by councilor night.

487
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:14,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

488
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:16,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

489
00:43:16,604 --> 00:43:22,327
[SPEAKER_12]: And do we have a resident that knows exactly where to complain to so we could maybe announce that publicly?

490
00:43:23,108 --> 00:43:25,329
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a phone.

491
00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:27,270
[SPEAKER_12]: City website.

492
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,130
[SPEAKER_12]: City website has.

493
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,211
[SPEAKER_07]: City website.

494
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,832
[SPEAKER_07]: City website has the information.

495
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:36,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Massachusetts Port Authority website has a hotline number that one can call upon.

496
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:37,355
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

497
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:39,276
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the front page of the website.

498
00:43:39,356 --> 00:43:41,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's important just to educate the public and let them know.

499
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:42,858
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the contact section.

500
00:43:43,273 --> 00:43:43,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

501
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:43,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

502
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:45,475
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion.

503
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,016
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

504
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:48,617
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed.

505
00:43:48,637 --> 00:44:01,867
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-seven 49 offered by Councilor Falco be resolved that the department of public works repaint the yellow center line on central Avenue in the interest of public safety.

506
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:03,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

507
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:05,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Oop.

508
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:06,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

509
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:07,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

510
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:11,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the, the following resolutions are our result from our

511
00:44:11,977 --> 00:44:16,280
[SPEAKER_11]: latest community police meeting held last week at St.

512
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:16,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis.

513
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:18,802
[SPEAKER_11]: We had, we had a good turnout.

514
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:22,264
[SPEAKER_11]: We had about 50, 60 residents from the community came to the meeting.

515
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, big thank you to the Medford police department.

516
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:32,692
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the police officers that actually patrol that neighborhood were in attendance to meet the residents.

517
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:37,796
[SPEAKER_11]: It was nice to see the police engaging the residents to find out what the issues are in the neighborhood.

518
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,738
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a, it was a good exchange of ideas.

519
00:44:41,322 --> 00:44:43,163
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was interesting.

520
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:47,606
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a lot of topics that came up, everything from traffic, parking.

521
00:44:49,247 --> 00:44:50,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Talked about airplane noise.

522
00:44:50,808 --> 00:44:52,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Airplane noise came up during the police meeting.

523
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:54,390
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a gentleman that stood up.

524
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:59,032
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, I'm not sure if I can speak about this here, but he wanted to talk about airplane noise.

525
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:01,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is something that came up as well.

526
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:06,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Talked about opiates, the staffing levels at the Medford Police Department.

527
00:45:06,557 --> 00:45:08,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And we talked about speed bumps again.

528
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:10,059
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was a good meeting.

529
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:17,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, but, uh, this issue did come up with regard to, um, the, uh, the yellow center line at central lab.

530
00:45:17,642 --> 00:45:24,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, at one point there was a center line, uh, in a sense faded in one end in, in most of the streets, non-existent.

531
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:35,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so if we could have the DPW come down and, uh, repaint the line, uh, in the interest of public safety, I think it'd be nice to actually, I think it'd be a way of narrowing the road to make it safer for everyone in that neighborhood.

532
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:40,535
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion that the yellow center line on central lab be repainted.

533
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:41,739
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

534
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:42,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

535
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:43,440
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

536
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,261
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion carries.

537
00:45:45,562 --> 00:45:59,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools and the Medford Police Department work together to review and propose improvements to the morning and afternoon drop-off procedure and traffic patterns at the Roberts Elementary School.

538
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:05,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Furthermore, that the final plan be communicated to the surrounding neighborhoods and parents.

539
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:06,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

540
00:46:08,428 --> 00:46:09,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

541
00:46:09,328 --> 00:46:10,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, this issue came up as well.

542
00:46:10,669 --> 00:46:13,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, this is an ongoing issue at the Roberts elementary school.

543
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:18,131
[SPEAKER_11]: It was corrected a few years ago with the help of the police department and active parents in the community.

544
00:46:18,711 --> 00:46:25,634
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, they put a system in place where they had, uh, actually soft horses that they put in the street to, uh, uh, stop some of the traffic.

545
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:31,055
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, since the, over the past year or so, the soft horses have now been removed.

546
00:46:31,115 --> 00:46:34,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're using cones, but it's not as efficient as it was in the past.

547
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:36,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seems that, um,

548
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:40,740
[SPEAKER_11]: there are a lot of new parents as well that are driving through the parking lot when they shouldn't.

549
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,202
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a, once again, this is one of the most populated schools in the city.

550
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:47,883
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a public safety issue.

551
00:46:47,903 --> 00:46:52,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, a lot of, uh, young kids are in that area and, uh, it needs to be addressed.

552
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:54,205
[SPEAKER_11]: And furthermore, it needs to be addressed.

553
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:56,146
[SPEAKER_11]: The communication needs to go out to the parents.

554
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think communication has gone out this year.

555
00:46:58,487 --> 00:46:59,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, it should go out.

556
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:04,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it actually needs to be communication should be set to the residents in the neighborhood as well.

557
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:05,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So they know,

558
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:10,299
[SPEAKER_11]: what streets they can access and what streets they cannot access during pickup and drop off.

559
00:47:10,899 --> 00:47:13,581
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank you for your time and I move approval.

560
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:15,782
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval, Councilor Knight.

561
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:24,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and ask that we include the school committee in the decision making process, Mr. President, whether the policy making body for issues that are affecting the school department.

562
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:26,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that would be the courteous thing to do.

563
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:33,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, number two, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to expand it, not just to the Roberts Elementary School, but to all schools.

564
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think if we're going to be looking at

565
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:38,127
[SPEAKER_04]: improvements to the morning and afternoon drop offs at schools.

566
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:41,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And each school does have a different in, in, in particular set of issues that they're dealing with.

567
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:47,991
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that if we're looking to improve things in the interest of public safety, that we should be doing it across the board, not just that one location, Mr. President.

568
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd ask that a, in addition to the Rob's elementary school, we do take a look at all of the schools in the community on the motion of council.

569
00:47:55,054 --> 00:47:58,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Falco as amended twice by council night chair recognizes council.

570
00:47:59,136 --> 00:48:00,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. President.

571
00:48:01,597 --> 00:48:03,318
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank council Falco for this recommendation.

572
00:48:04,497 --> 00:48:07,138
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm there a couple of days a week picking up my grandchildren.

573
00:48:07,738 --> 00:48:12,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And part of the problem is, you know, it needs a little bit of a police presence there.

574
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,921
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we can't expect our crossing guards also to be traffic policemen also.

575
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:23,604
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's part of the problem, is they're busy watching the kids, and that's true.

576
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:28,545
[SPEAKER_15]: There's so many cars coming around that they can't direct the traffic and do kids.

577
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:32,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been there when there's been a policeman there, and it's better.

578
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:36,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, but very rarely is there a policeman there.

579
00:48:36,638 --> 00:48:44,404
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, my recommendation, if we could put it, that, um, a police would be there at least for the, the morning hour and the afternoon hour.

580
00:48:45,725 --> 00:48:54,471
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can amend that motion on that motion as amended by council Caraviello chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

581
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:55,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

582
00:48:55,411 --> 00:48:57,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

583
00:48:58,025 --> 00:48:59,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

584
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:00,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park street.

585
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:02,591
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter attends the Roberts elementary.

586
00:49:02,632 --> 00:49:08,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I was part of the first parent group that helped to deal with the drop off patterns.

587
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:11,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get everything that I wanted, but I did get some of the things.

588
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:12,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

589
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:23,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm back because I think that some of the places that we went wrong, we should probably include parents in this as well, this meeting, because we're the ones that are dropping off the kids.

590
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:30,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of the parents that have to drop off on the street now are concerned that they're not able to go into the loop anymore.

591
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:38,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have the sawhorses at either side of the parking lot, but it's big enough that people can go around and people are using it as a cut-through.

592
00:49:40,702 --> 00:49:48,990
[SPEAKER_01]: The kindergartners have to be brought in hand into the school and so that's over 100 parents that are dropping off every morning and picking up every afternoon.

593
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:57,538
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hopeful that if we do do something we can notify the neighbors because like I said I do live on Park Street and I see my neighbors backing out of their driveways in the morning.

594
00:49:58,179 --> 00:50:16,348
[SPEAKER_01]: and off until close to 840, the traffic is backed up to the Fellsway, and they're not aware that we had a meeting to discuss having the street be one way towards Salem, so they try to duck and play a little Tetris game to get down the street to get to the Fellsway because they were not made aware of that pattern.

595
00:50:16,948 --> 00:50:20,330
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really not useful if we're not notifying anyone around.

596
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,912
[SPEAKER_01]: The crossing guard will turn her back and someone will take a right down park.

597
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:28,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I do encourage anything that we do not only go to the parents but also to the neighbours.

598
00:50:28,636 --> 00:50:29,857
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for putting that forward.

599
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:36,983
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scappelli, as amended by Councilors Knight and Caraviello.

600
00:50:38,425 --> 00:50:39,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, sir.

601
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:41,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome and please state your name and address for the record.

602
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:47,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, here in our lovely community of Medford.

603
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:49,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

604
00:50:49,653 --> 00:50:57,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I just would like to get up and thank this city council, as well as Mayor Burke and the DPW, the safety improvements at the Brooks School.

605
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:02,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And as many of you are aware, my son is a second grader at the Brooks School.

606
00:51:06,903 --> 00:51:09,305
[SPEAKER_10]: When you look at just those minor changes,

607
00:51:10,078 --> 00:51:20,089
[SPEAKER_10]: It certainly changed the whole traffic patterns down there, not as far as cut-throughs and all that, but as far as people traversing Route 60, those lights are incredible.

608
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Incredible.

609
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:26,576
[SPEAKER_10]: And to see them go up so quickly is a testament to our local government working together.

610
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:28,618
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just, it's really good.

611
00:51:28,938 --> 00:51:30,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's more long-term

612
00:51:30,626 --> 00:51:45,213
[SPEAKER_10]: planning that's going on in that particular area through West Medford Square and the like, but in the immediate, the immediate changes have gone over very, very big with the parents and it's certainly given us a safer environment.

613
00:51:45,253 --> 00:51:47,674
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to get up and thank you all as well.

614
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

615
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:55,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilors

616
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:57,807
[SPEAKER_07]: In Caraviello, all those in favour?

617
00:51:58,387 --> 00:51:59,108
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

618
00:51:59,948 --> 00:52:01,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Carries.

619
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:13,916
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-751 offered by Councilor Falco be resolved that the superintendent of schools and police chief contact Eastern Bus to address reports of unoccupied speeding buses.

620
00:52:15,397 --> 00:52:17,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, who's driving these buses?

621
00:52:18,879 --> 00:52:21,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the driver, let me, let me, I guess, be clear.

622
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,022
[SPEAKER_11]: This, this is, well, it came up during the community meeting.

623
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:29,794
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's basically as the buses go from one route to the next.

624
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:33,997
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, the conclusion of the route, they're flying to get to the next route.

625
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:43,064
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's no one, we don't have students on the bus at that time, but still they should be adhering to this local speed limits that are in place.

626
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:49,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sounds like they're not, I got a number of complaints about this from residents and it came up at the meeting as well.

627
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:54,373
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to have either the police chief or the superintendent of schools reach out to Eastern bus,

628
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:58,902
[SPEAKER_11]: and just to remind their drivers to drive safely at all times.

629
00:52:59,722 --> 00:53:00,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

630
00:53:01,102 --> 00:53:02,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

631
00:53:02,742 --> 00:53:03,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

632
00:53:04,303 --> 00:53:05,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up.

633
00:53:07,303 --> 00:53:16,045
[SPEAKER_15]: At the meetings at the school, this is something that I brought to Chief Sacco's attention on multiple occasions along with the community meetings.

634
00:53:16,765 --> 00:53:23,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I live on a street over by the Brooks School where the buses go by after they drop the kids off and for the past

635
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:25,904
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a couple of years now.

636
00:53:26,605 --> 00:53:40,457
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been complaining to the chief about the buses roaring by my house in the morning, with nobody in them, and totally ignoring the stop signs a lot of times, and they just head up Prescott Street with no regard for anybody.

637
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,960
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, thank you, Councilor Falco.

638
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I've been on the chief about this in the past, but the buses still seem to be speeding by.

639
00:53:49,285 --> 00:53:50,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything?

640
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:51,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

641
00:53:53,973 --> 00:53:54,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

642
00:53:54,573 --> 00:53:56,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

643
00:53:56,174 --> 00:54:01,595
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight.

644
00:54:01,635 --> 00:54:02,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approved, Mr. President.

645
00:54:02,996 --> 00:54:04,436
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion, all those in favour?

646
00:54:04,556 --> 00:54:04,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

647
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:05,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Those opposed?

648
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:08,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

649
00:54:08,137 --> 00:54:09,978
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-756, offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

650
00:54:11,258 --> 00:54:22,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the MBTA be contacted to see what they can do about speeding buses on our city roads, such as on South Street, where residents are complaining that buses are driving faster

651
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,241
[SPEAKER_07]: than the posted speed limit.

652
00:54:25,881 --> 00:54:26,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

653
00:54:26,782 --> 00:54:28,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

654
00:54:28,142 --> 00:54:29,463
[SPEAKER_12]: This is along the same lines.

655
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:41,029
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a complaint this week about the MBTA buses unoccupied besides the driver, obviously, especially especially at night after it's gotten dark, just speeding down South Street.

656
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,551
[SPEAKER_12]: It goes along with, obviously, the speeding issue we spoke about two weeks ago.

657
00:54:45,111 --> 00:54:52,115
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we can just try to work on eliminating speeding wherever we can, if there's any chance we can have the administration send a letter

658
00:54:52,549 --> 00:55:07,158
[SPEAKER_12]: to the MBTA just to reduce speeding, especially obviously on our main roads, but all over the city, if we can just remind the MBTA bus drivers to reduce their speed to the speed limit, that would be extremely helpful.

659
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:09,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you on that motion.

660
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

661
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:12,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

662
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:20,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in recent weeks, it's been brought to my attention that some of our neighboring communities have implemented a universal 25 mile per hour speed limit.

663
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:23,374
[SPEAKER_04]: um, on all city controlled and operated roadways.

664
00:55:24,014 --> 00:55:26,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, this may or may not work in the city of Medford.

665
00:55:26,495 --> 00:55:35,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to amend the paper requesting that the traffic commission examined the feasibility of putting in a universal speed limit across, uh, the, the board here in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

666
00:55:35,477 --> 00:55:44,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's my understanding that I believe the city of Somerville has adopted a 25 mile per hour speed limit across the board at all, um, portions of the city, unless otherwise posted.

667
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,300
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um,

668
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:53,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're facing a significant issue right now with traffic and speeding vehicles and the like, uh, as evident by the last six or seven agendas of the city council.

669
00:55:53,907 --> 00:56:06,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request the traffic commission to examine the feasibility as to whether or not it would make sense to implement a standard and universal speed limit across the board for all city controlled streets and roadways.

670
00:56:07,071 --> 00:56:07,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

671
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:15,113
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion for approval by vice president, longer, the current is amended and seconded by council night chair recognizes

672
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:16,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

673
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:17,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

674
00:56:17,905 --> 00:56:31,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I just, uh, had a brief discussion with, uh, Sergeant Hodnett and, uh, discussion and the implementation of that 25 mile an hour speed limit is, is being looked at right now actively in Medford.

675
00:56:31,537 --> 00:56:43,227
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's interesting is, uh, the state, it seems like the state is pretty, um, pretty aware of our concerns and they're actually looking to abide by our recommendation of dropping

676
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:47,520
[SPEAKER_13]: all of our streets and roadways in the city of Medford, 25 miles an hour.

677
00:56:47,560 --> 00:57:05,429
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know that's something that the city is looking at, but what I really, if you've listened to the tone of our council, especially the last few weeks, the consistent cry is resolutions for, can we have police here?

678
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we have police there?

679
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we have police?

680
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:12,933
[SPEAKER_13]: And what, again, I think we need to revisit the number of policemen we have on the streets right now.

681
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:18,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I think our biggest concerns that we should be talking about is the lack of offices on the streets.

682
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:29,675
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, again, I'd like to amend the paper asking the chief, if he can, is to give us the numbers of actual offices on the streets.

683
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:40,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the number of 104 have been thrown around, but I want to know the actual number of offices on the streets that we have on a weekly basis, because I think that's where

684
00:57:41,288 --> 00:57:42,849
[SPEAKER_13]: the problem falls.

685
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:52,435
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, especially with the Brooks issue coming up, we see them actively there, but we've seen them on Salem Street with issues.

686
00:57:52,475 --> 00:57:55,377
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're out there and they're out there doing the best they can.

687
00:57:55,417 --> 00:58:08,906
[SPEAKER_13]: But talking to some of these police officers, a simple car accident in one side of the city could take two or three cruises off the areas that's needed for up to a half hour to an hour and 45 minutes.

688
00:58:10,378 --> 00:58:13,319
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's important that we need to address the bigger concern.

689
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:28,002
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nice that we're asking the chief to come back and give us all these reports and stuff, but the truth of the matter is I think we as a council have to take more of a proactive approach in getting more policemen on the streets.

690
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:31,543
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that would stop a lot of our phone calls.

691
00:58:31,723 --> 00:58:37,665
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, one thing we talked about that we've been talking about privately is how many times

692
00:58:38,373 --> 00:58:40,554
[SPEAKER_13]: how many phone calls we've gotten, the biggest issues we've had.

693
00:58:41,094 --> 00:58:46,757
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the biggest issue is, is speeding and traffic issues.

694
00:58:46,797 --> 00:58:52,439
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know that council faculties brought up, uh, you know, a traffic, um, engineer and that sounds great.

695
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:57,901
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and, and, and we've done some great things in the Brooks area, the Brooks school area.

696
00:58:58,262 --> 00:59:05,905
[SPEAKER_13]: But the truth of the matter is to make this work, we need, we need an identified traffic department that's going to have their, you know, the, the,

697
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:10,266
[SPEAKER_13]: the wheels on the ground and working toward making sure that these can get done.

698
00:59:10,286 --> 00:59:13,928
[SPEAKER_13]: And right now, I don't think we have the levels of policing that we need to get that done.

699
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:21,552
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, I applaud my fellow Councilors because I think we're all working very hard to make sure that these issues are out and put forth.

700
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:31,298
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think we as a council should really sit with the chief and bring the mayor a true number of, of, of, uh, of police officers on the streets.

701
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:34,840
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you can amend that and asking the chief for,

702
00:59:35,695 --> 00:59:40,478
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, an updated number of police officers on, on the streets and working directly with the traffic.

703
00:59:41,118 --> 00:59:46,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, not, not the sector cars that are sitting at a traffic light, but identified traffic offices.

704
00:59:46,642 --> 00:59:48,242
[SPEAKER_13]: So that'd be appreciated.

705
00:59:48,282 --> 00:59:48,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

706
00:59:50,544 --> 00:59:54,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, as amended by council Scarpelli chair recognizes vice president local current.

707
00:59:54,746 --> 00:59:55,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

708
00:59:55,247 --> 01:00:01,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, just briefly, um, through the chair, I agree with Councilor Scarpelli and I'm thankful Sergeant Hartnett came to our meeting.

709
01:00:01,604 --> 01:00:09,006
[SPEAKER_12]: At six o'clock, it was good to have him there to discuss traffic up at the Malden Hospital site and obviously in the Heights.

710
01:00:10,387 --> 01:00:20,030
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think concerning is the fact that we as a city only have five officers, and that includes Sergeant Hartnett in our traffic division.

711
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's just truly not enough in a community our size.

712
01:00:23,951 --> 01:00:27,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was mentioned, and you could probably correct me,

713
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:32,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli, Somerville has about 18 in their traffic division.

714
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:40,197
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was good to hear from Sergeant Hartnett, you know, different things that have been going on in the last few weeks, but obviously we need a bigger department.

715
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:46,241
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to, I think we need more than 65 officers and we also need more than five in our traffic division.

716
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:53,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the, the amount of speeding complaints, whether it be at a community meeting or people emailing or giving us, sending us phone calls,

717
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:54,686
[SPEAKER_12]: is speeding.

718
01:00:54,986 --> 01:01:07,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Speeding is, I believe somebody just heard tonight, somebody was hitting on Salem Street over the weekend, and obviously we know what happened at the Brooke School, but there's also, you know, other areas that are hot spots, and we have a problem.

719
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:18,947
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the probably sixth week in a row that we've spoken about it, and hopefully the mayor hears us loud and clearly, and we can work some numbers and try to hire some more men and women, and specifically put

720
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:27,872
[SPEAKER_12]: one or two more in the traffic department so that we can curb the speeding because more people are just going to get hurt and it's not safe.

721
01:01:29,194 --> 01:01:35,360
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn as seconded and amended by Councilor Knight and amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

722
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,100
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favour?

723
01:01:36,461 --> 01:01:38,162
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

724
01:01:38,202 --> 01:01:39,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

725
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:43,588
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-752 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the City of Medford

726
01:01:47,423 --> 01:01:53,306
[SPEAKER_07]: is made up of many different neighborhoods, whereas each neighborhood has its own issues and concerns.

727
01:01:54,146 --> 01:02:05,511
[SPEAKER_07]: The resolve of the Metro Police Department used the reverse 911 system to inform residents of specific neighborhoods of issues or concerns related to that part of the city.

728
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:06,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

729
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:07,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

730
01:02:07,612 --> 01:02:13,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the reverse time one, uh, nine one one system is a valuable tool that we use in the community for,

731
01:02:14,427 --> 01:02:21,129
[SPEAKER_11]: different events that we, you know, usually, usually use to, um, spread word, you know, about different events that are coming up in the community.

732
01:02:21,689 --> 01:02:36,154
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, uh, there were a few people that I mentioned at the community, community police meeting, um, that, you know, it'd be good to actually have some more neighborhood focused type messages with regard to anything that's happening with regard to like crime or that type of thing.

733
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:40,275
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have a number of break-ins in the neighborhood or, or, you know, you know, car break-ins,

734
01:02:40,743 --> 01:02:45,826
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, it'd be nice to actually isolate the messages to specific neighborhoods to say, you know, keep an eye out.

735
01:02:46,446 --> 01:02:50,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, uh, your neighborhood, there's various issues going on.

736
01:02:51,008 --> 01:03:01,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could just start to use the 911 reverse 911 system in a way that's neighborhood specific, uh, I think that'd be very beneficial to each neighborhood throughout a community.

737
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:03,095
[SPEAKER_11]: So move approval.

738
01:03:03,255 --> 01:03:03,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

739
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:09,332
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

740
01:03:09,372 --> 01:03:10,092
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

741
01:03:10,192 --> 01:03:10,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

742
01:03:10,512 --> 01:03:11,673
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

743
01:03:11,713 --> 01:03:12,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

744
01:03:13,194 --> 01:03:17,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Falco.

745
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:31,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the pedestrian at 16-553, be it resolved that the pedestrian crossing signs be added to the crosswalk at the intersection of Essex and High Streets in the interest of public safety.

746
01:03:31,783 --> 01:03:32,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

747
01:03:33,312 --> 01:03:34,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

748
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:43,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I received a number of phone calls about this issue here near the Winthrop Street Rotary, which we've talked about on many occasions over the past month with regard to traffic and safety.

749
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:52,626
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a crosswalk at the intersection of Essex and High Street and near Schoolhouse Road as well.

750
01:03:53,686 --> 01:03:57,649
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a crosswalk that's in that area that's extremely dangerous to cross at.

751
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:02,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could put up some pedestrian signs just to illustrate to drivers just

752
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:15,297
[SPEAKER_11]: just to bring some more attention to it, that it's a place where people do cross, there's a school nearby, there's a lot of traffic in that area with regard to basically five roads coming into one area.

753
01:04:15,378 --> 01:04:25,024
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could put up those pedestrian signs, I think it'd be just a great way to help out with public safety at that intersection.

754
01:04:25,044 --> 01:04:26,585
[SPEAKER_11]: So move approval, thank you.

755
01:04:26,886 --> 01:04:30,208
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion for approval, chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

756
01:04:30,815 --> 01:04:32,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

757
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:36,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having grown up on Whitman road, which is the next street up from Essex street.

758
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:48,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've had a lot of experience with this crosswalk and I can appreciate councilor Falco bringing forward a resolution, uh, asking the pedestrian crossing signs be added at that location.

759
01:04:49,328 --> 01:04:52,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But quite frankly, Mr. President, that is a very dangerous location.

760
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:55,093
[SPEAKER_04]: And I questioned as to whether or not a crosswalk should be there at all.

761
01:04:55,573 --> 01:04:58,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on a blind curve coming down a gradient that's very steep.

762
01:04:58,989 --> 01:05:06,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're coming from West Medford square towards the Winthrop street rotary, as you're coming around a blind bend downhill, you're now going to see a crosswalk.

763
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I think it's very dangerous location, Mr. President.

764
01:05:09,975 --> 01:05:17,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd ask that the traffic commission examine the feasibility of removing the crosswalk as to whether or not that's a good idea before investing any funds into putting up any signs.

765
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:26,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to amend the paper, um, and ask the traffic commission to take a look and see if that crosswalk is actually feasible location for a crosswalk and whether or not there's a safer alternative.

766
01:05:26,775 --> 01:05:33,980
[SPEAKER_04]: um, prior to investing in implementing any money, um, to connotate a mark where the crosswalk would be at this point in time.

767
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:43,245
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of councilor Falco as amended by councilor Knight, councilor Caraviello.

768
01:05:43,586 --> 01:05:44,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

769
01:05:44,406 --> 01:05:48,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I, uh, I haven't, I live in that area too.

770
01:05:48,168 --> 01:05:50,490
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is, it's a very dangerous crosswalk where the,

771
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:58,942
[SPEAKER_15]: whether you're coming from Method Square, because it's on the blind turn and that's where cars are speeding up to make it up the hill.

772
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:06,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if a sign is sufficient, if it's not lit or something to make people know.

773
01:06:06,024 --> 01:06:09,205
[SPEAKER_15]: As soon as you come out of the roadway, the crosswalk is right there.

774
01:06:09,605 --> 01:06:15,327
[SPEAKER_15]: And the same thing coming down, you have people coming down that hill at an accelerated speed.

775
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:18,228
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, that's from another blind turn.

776
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:20,969
[SPEAKER_15]: So unless there's a sign up a lot further,

777
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:34,098
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe flashing or something, that sidewalk, I mean that crosswalk is extremely dangerous, especially in the evening, because it's right on the bus stop and people are crossing there.

778
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:36,760
[SPEAKER_15]: That makes it a little bit more dangerous than other crosswalks.

779
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,662
[SPEAKER_15]: So if that can be taken into consideration too.

780
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:46,786
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Falco, amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Falco.

781
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:47,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

782
01:06:48,227 --> 01:06:50,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the concern of my fellow colleagues

783
01:06:51,222 --> 01:07:02,709
[SPEAKER_11]: but the bottom line is there's a crosswalk there and it's a safety issue and the sign should go up until it's determined by the traffic commission to take them, to take them down or to eliminate the sidewalk.

784
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:04,910
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to keep our pedestrians safe.

785
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:13,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Putting up signs is a low cost option and if we don't use them there and they're taken down, I'm sure we can use them at some other crosswalk in the, in our city.

786
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:20,980
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean in the time being, for the time being it should be about public safety and making sure that the residents of our community is safe crossing the street.

787
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:23,293
[SPEAKER_11]: If it should come down, I'm fine with that.

788
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:28,215
[SPEAKER_11]: If the crosswalk should be eliminated and the traffic commission decides to do that, that's fine.

789
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,756
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the meantime, it's about keeping the residents of our community safe.

790
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:36,738
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, I, uh, I believe the sign should go up as soon as possible.

791
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:40,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you on that motion as amended.

792
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:40,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

793
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:44,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Mr. President, we talk about a traffic engineer.

794
01:07:44,302 --> 01:07:48,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We started this discussion about a traffic engineer in the budget debates, uh, back in 2015.

795
01:07:50,255 --> 01:07:52,276
[SPEAKER_04]: and the conversation continues.

796
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:57,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is the perfect location where a traffic engineer would come in very handy to take a look at this and examine this feasibility.

797
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we don't have one on staff here at the city.

798
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:05,984
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for approval as amended, all those in favor.

799
01:08:08,886 --> 01:08:12,648
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, could we read back the amendments just because it sounds like it's contradictory now.

800
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:15,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like it's,

801
01:08:16,795 --> 01:08:30,560
[SPEAKER_07]: On motion for approval that Councilor Falco, that there be pedestrian crossing signs added to the crosswalk at the intersection of Essex and High Street.

802
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Amended by Councilor Knight.

803
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:34,821
[SPEAKER_07]: What was his amendment?

804
01:08:34,841 --> 01:08:35,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Traffic Commission examined.

805
01:08:36,642 --> 01:08:38,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether or not to remove the crosswalk.

806
01:08:39,063 --> 01:08:44,865
[SPEAKER_07]: That the Traffic Commission examine whether to remove the crosswalk.

807
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:48,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And further amended by Councilor.

808
01:08:48,835 --> 01:08:49,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it further amended?

809
01:08:49,656 --> 01:08:49,696
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

810
01:08:50,236 --> 01:08:53,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I think contradictory in nature.

811
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:54,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

812
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:59,386
[SPEAKER_11]: We're asking, well, I'm asking for signs to be put up and my colleagues asking, which is right.

813
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: President to clear the record.

814
01:09:00,627 --> 01:09:01,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem with the signs going up.

815
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:04,071
[SPEAKER_04]: If the traffic commission feels as though it's a safe location.

816
01:09:04,992 --> 01:09:07,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I understood it just to be, to look at all the options.

817
01:09:08,563 --> 01:09:12,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I, I can see how it could be seen as contradictory.

818
01:09:12,972 --> 01:09:13,594
[SPEAKER_07]: The signs go up.

819
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:14,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no problem with that.

820
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:15,698
[SPEAKER_07]: The traffic commission takes a look at it.

821
01:09:15,738 --> 01:09:18,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, is there a consensus that

822
01:09:19,945 --> 01:09:26,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I would actually like, if Council and I wouldn't mind putting it in as a separate resolution, because to me it seems contradictory.

823
01:09:26,646 --> 01:09:30,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'd rather have the science go on.

824
01:09:30,147 --> 01:09:43,829
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the B paper that the Traffic Commission re-examined the location of the crosswalk to see if it's at all appropriate to be there in the interest of public safety.

825
01:09:44,209 --> 01:09:44,970
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

826
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:47,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

827
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposed?

828
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:52,204
[SPEAKER_07]: The ayes have it.

829
01:09:53,746 --> 01:10:02,816
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the main paper offered by Councilor Falco, that pedestrian crossing signs be added in the interest of public safety to the aforementioned crosswalk.

830
01:10:02,936 --> 01:10:03,637
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favour?

831
01:10:10,552 --> 01:10:14,233
[SPEAKER_12]: then I think if you were voting on this, we just have to be clear to the traffic commission.

832
01:10:14,273 --> 01:10:20,434
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd like the signs to go up, even though it may take months to move or eliminate the crosswalk because we know.

833
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:29,695
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion I think speaks for itself that we're asking for pedestrian signs at that location.

834
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:38,457
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask council Falco if he would like to say as soon as possible, as soon as possible,

835
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,882
[SPEAKER_07]: as amended by Councilor Falco himself as soon as possible.

836
01:10:46,604 --> 01:10:47,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that clarify?

837
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:49,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

838
01:10:49,486 --> 01:10:50,267
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

839
01:10:50,527 --> 01:10:50,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

840
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:51,388
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

841
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:55,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

842
01:10:55,571 --> 01:10:57,312
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-754 offered by Councilor Knight.

843
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:08,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the paper entitled Providing Safe Access to Medical Marijuana in the City of Medford is presently under review by the Medford City Council and whereas

844
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:20,515
[SPEAKER_07]: On November 8, 2016, the voters of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved the passage of referendum question number four, legalizing the retailing of marijuana and its byproducts for recreational purposes.

845
01:11:20,615 --> 01:11:38,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And whereas, question number four in section 3A1 specifically reads, zoning ordinances or bylaws should not prohibit placing a marijuana establishment which cultivates, manufactures, or sells marijuana or marijuana products in any area with a medicinal marijuana treatment center as registered

846
01:11:39,258 --> 01:12:07,112
[SPEAKER_07]: to engage in the same type of activity, and whereas with the passage of question four comes a limit on local control over the zoning and licensing of recreational marijuana establishments directly related to the substance and subject matter of the aforementioned paper entitled Providing Safe Access to Medical Marijuana in the City of Medford, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request an opinion from the city solicitor concerning the impact of the passage of question four has on local

847
01:12:08,559 --> 01:12:29,049
[SPEAKER_07]: control governing the zoning and licensing of medicinal and recreational marijuana establishments and be a further resolved and opinion be provided as to what options are available in order to hold the issuance of any license for this purpose and abeyance until such impact can be determined.

848
01:12:29,469 --> 01:12:30,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor.

849
01:12:31,591 --> 01:12:32,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

850
01:12:33,233 --> 01:12:44,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this council, uh, the zoning in ordinance subcommittee and this council have worked on, um, the paper providing safe access to medicinal marijuana in the city of Medford for the better part of the last year.

851
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:47,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, with the passage of question four comes some uncertainty.

852
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:58,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, uh, the department of public health at the state level, um, is now required to issue some public health guidelines in the form of regulations to guide us in the implementation of question four.

853
01:12:59,037 --> 01:13:11,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on the language that I read in the proposal underneath question four, there is a direct correlation between the medicinal marijuana establishments and that of the recreational marijuana establishments.

854
01:13:11,306 --> 01:13:12,827
[SPEAKER_04]: They go hand in hand, Mr. President.

855
01:13:13,388 --> 01:13:20,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And the language included in the passenger question for limited local control, it restricted some of the decision-making powers that the municipality had.

856
01:13:20,847 --> 01:13:35,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as such, Mr. President, this paper is nothing more than a request from the city to the city solicitor to ask him what effect he sees coming out of the passage of question four in relation to the proposal that was before the council, uh, entitled providing safe access to medicinal marijuana in the city of Medford.

857
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:48,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and also, Mr. President, we'd ask that, uh, until this opinion is made available by the city solicitor that, um, we determine what options are available to us to hold the issuances of licenses in abeyance until it can be determined what impact it's going to have on the local level of government.

858
01:13:50,351 --> 01:13:52,372
[SPEAKER_07]: on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

859
01:13:54,214 --> 01:13:56,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Second by Councilor Scarpelli.

860
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:57,356
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

861
01:13:58,076 --> 01:13:58,797
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

862
01:13:58,817 --> 01:14:02,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries off by Councilor Knight.

863
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:18,410
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-755, whereas on September 23rd, 2016, Mayor Burke introduced the paper entitled Home Rule Petition, increasing the number of licenses available for the sale of wine and malt beverages for consideration by the Medford City Council.

864
01:14:18,972 --> 01:14:48,083
[SPEAKER_07]: And whereas this matter appeared on the November 4th, 2016 council agenda as paper 16-706, and was subsequently disposed of by majority vote of the council to refer to the subcommittee on licensing, whereas this action is duly reflected in the approved minutes of the October 4th, 2016 regular meeting of the city council, be it so ordered, the Medford City Council rescind vote

865
01:14:48,883 --> 01:14:59,908
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-seven zero six to allow paper to be reintroduced to the council agenda absent of committee report and the subcommittee on licensing council night.

866
01:15:00,308 --> 01:15:01,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

867
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:05,210
[SPEAKER_04]: This paper came before the Medford city council as outlined in the resolution.

868
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:14,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, at the time I had several questions relative to why we were asking just for a beer and wine, an expansion of the beer and wine licenses, but not the full liquor licenses.

869
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:20,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I wanted to do a little bit more investigation and I motioned to move the matter to the subcommittee on licensing.

870
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:20,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

871
01:15:21,332 --> 01:15:30,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, ultimately I picked up the phone and made several phone calls, spoke with the commissioner of the licensing commission as well as, um, our economic development office, a city solicitor.

872
01:15:31,658 --> 01:15:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, my questions were answered and I was satisfied.

873
01:15:34,599 --> 01:15:37,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I wanted to know why we weren't asking for more full liquor licenses.

874
01:15:37,761 --> 01:15:41,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer was because there were 32 available full liquor licenses here in the community right now.

875
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:43,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my thinking behind the whole, um,

876
01:15:44,587 --> 01:15:50,491
[SPEAKER_04]: my first referral to subcommittee was that, uh, full liquor licenses seem to be more of a driver in economic development.

877
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:56,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we are in the city of Medford and we discuss the economic development of our downtowns rather frequently.

878
01:15:56,454 --> 01:16:07,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to be sure that if we were going to be sending a homeroom petition to the legislature, asking them to pass legislation, that we took a look at everything that was possible, Mr. President, before bringing the matter to the legislature.

879
01:16:08,601 --> 01:16:13,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, since the time of the motion to refer the matter to the subcommittee, my questions have been answered as such.

880
01:16:14,732 --> 01:16:21,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I spoke with Chairman Caraviello was the chairman of licensing committee and I, um, suggested that I put a paper forward to rescind the vote.

881
01:16:22,058 --> 01:16:24,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, councilor Caraviello was in support of that matter when I brought it up.

882
01:16:25,401 --> 01:16:27,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as such, I did some research, Mr. President.

883
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:35,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, if you put on the council agenda with notice to rescind the vote, then a majority vote is required to rescind the vote.

884
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:38,932
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was no notice, then a two thirds vote is required to rescind the vote.

885
01:16:39,392 --> 01:16:41,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I put the paper on the,

886
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:48,942
[SPEAKER_04]: agenda this evening, Mr. President, for us to be notified that the vote for our rescinding, uh, would be taking place this evening.

887
01:16:49,142 --> 01:17:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would ask my colleagues to support rescinding the vote and introducing the matter back to the council floor for approval on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight to rescind first to rescind.

888
01:17:01,364 --> 01:17:04,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I hear a second?

889
01:17:06,146 --> 01:17:07,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

890
01:17:09,786 --> 01:17:12,769
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a roll call on this, Mr. Clerk.

891
01:17:15,211 --> 01:17:16,292
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

892
01:17:16,313 --> 01:17:19,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll move for a roll call, Mr. President, just to be procedurally sound.

893
01:17:19,716 --> 01:17:20,537
[SPEAKER_07]: On motion for a roll call.

894
01:17:21,157 --> 01:17:23,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to rescind this.

895
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,581

896
01:17:24,621 --> 01:17:24,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

897
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:25,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco?

898
01:17:26,262 --> 01:17:26,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

899
01:17:26,983 --> 01:17:27,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Nate?

900
01:17:27,503 --> 01:17:27,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

901
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:29,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Long and Curran?

902
01:17:29,285 --> 01:17:29,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:17:31,928 --> 01:17:32,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

906
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:33,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

908
01:17:34,574 --> 01:17:36,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, with a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

909
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:37,716
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

910
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:39,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the matter is before us.

911
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:44,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, paper 166, homework petition.

912
01:17:47,442 --> 01:17:55,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Entitled, increasing the number of licenses available for the sale of wine and malt beverages.

913
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:02,530
[SPEAKER_07]: This was presented to us in council

914
01:18:03,601 --> 01:18:26,034
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, on October 4th, uh, with an introductory letter, uh, dated September 18th, uh, from her honor, the mayor, uh, requesting and recommending that our honor body approve the following home rule petition to be sent to the general court to increase the number of licenses available for the sale of wines and malt beverages in the city of Medford.

915
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:30,817
[SPEAKER_07]: As you know, the number of such licenses, licenses,

916
01:18:31,425 --> 01:18:35,166
[SPEAKER_07]: is presently limited by chapter two 10 of the acts of 2008 to 25.

917
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:49,328
[SPEAKER_07]: If this home rule petition is approved by the council and later by the general court, it will increase the available number of these licenses in the city of Medford to 40.

918
01:18:53,969 --> 01:18:56,830
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a motion on the floor to

919
01:18:59,788 --> 01:19:00,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Council coffee.

920
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:01,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Mr. President.

921
01:19:01,209 --> 01:19:03,609
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we have a incorrect number here.

922
01:19:03,629 --> 01:19:07,911
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it should be a 16 7 0 2 versus 7 0 6.

923
01:19:08,071 --> 01:19:12,812
[SPEAKER_15]: We're looking back in the minutes.

924
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:13,873
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the minutes right there.

925
01:19:14,913 --> 01:19:16,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a paper.

926
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:23,759
[SPEAKER_07]: 16702 in the hand of the clerk, but on the council's night on the paper, we have Scribner's hour, Mr. President.

927
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:26,201
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a seven Oh seven Oh, we have seven Oh six.

928
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:27,081
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be seven Oh two.

929
01:19:27,522 --> 01:19:28,062
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

930
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:39,270
[SPEAKER_07]: So on Mr. Clerk, if you would let the agenda record know that it is to be considered a item number 16-seven Oh two that is before us.

931
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:41,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there a motion?

932
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:45,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval on the motion for approval by Councilor.

933
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:48,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Second, Mr. Knight, seconded by councilor Caraviello.

934
01:19:48,781 --> 01:19:49,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Councilor Marks.

935
01:19:50,102 --> 01:19:53,004
[SPEAKER_07]: This is for a home rule petition process to be started.

936
01:19:53,504 --> 01:19:54,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

937
01:19:54,685 --> 01:19:57,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I wasn't aware and I'm thankful.

938
01:19:57,147 --> 01:20:02,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight brought it up that, did you say there were 34 full liquor licenses available?

939
01:20:03,251 --> 01:20:06,253
[SPEAKER_05]: One that are currently available in the city.

940
01:20:12,839 --> 01:20:17,961
[SPEAKER_14]: And what was reported to me with beer and wine, there is currently three that is available right now.

941
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:23,782
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I hope this helps stimulate business districts.

942
01:20:24,782 --> 01:20:33,544
[SPEAKER_14]: But knowing the availability that's out there right now, and there's not a waiting list to get a liquor license in the community, I'm not sure how much this is going to help, Mr. President.

943
01:20:34,345 --> 01:20:40,066
[SPEAKER_14]: I, you know, would like to see more than just an empty promise regarding the revitalization

944
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:54,520
[SPEAKER_14]: of our business districts that, uh, has been discussed in this community ad nauseum for the last 20 years, three separate commission reports, uh, to revitalize our downtown business district.

945
01:20:55,021 --> 01:20:58,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And here we are still asking for improved lighting.

946
01:20:59,242 --> 01:21:03,063
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pitch dark in the square after, after hours.

947
01:21:03,823 --> 01:21:09,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, there is, uh, really, uh, no reason, uh, to come into our business districts.

948
01:21:09,775 --> 01:21:13,357
[SPEAKER_14]: in my opinion, because there's no attractions, to be quite frank.

949
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:17,459
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sorry if people get offended when I say that, but that's the way I feel.

950
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:23,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, we have an office of community development that's staffed with, I believe, three people.

951
01:21:24,063 --> 01:21:31,647
[SPEAKER_14]: And in my opinion, they've done very little to nothing to entice businesses into this community.

952
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:38,833
[SPEAKER_14]: And every time I drive through the square, it's a thorn in my side when I look around and I don't see any foot traffic.

953
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:42,674
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any business in the square, no matter what the hours is.

954
01:21:44,555 --> 01:21:46,855
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we have to do a better job.

955
01:21:47,255 --> 01:21:49,256
[SPEAKER_14]: The liquor's fine and so forth.

956
01:21:49,356 --> 01:21:57,199
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've made a lot of headway because for years in this community, you had to have 250 seat restaurant to have a liquor license.

957
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And that just, in this day and age, people aren't building 250 seat

958
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,301
[SPEAKER_14]: restaurants anymore.

959
01:22:03,761 --> 01:22:14,627
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we made some great headway in that fact, but we still haven't made any headway regarding community development, regarding offering incentives for businesses to come into this community.

960
01:22:15,328 --> 01:22:17,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Our location, you can't beat our location.

961
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:19,930
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't beat our public transportation.

962
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:23,112
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a river that runs through the heart of our community.

963
01:22:23,493 --> 01:22:30,817
[SPEAKER_14]: We have so many things going for us, but yet we have for some reason an inability

964
01:22:31,748 --> 01:22:36,631
[SPEAKER_14]: to improve our business districts, not just the square, all our business districts.

965
01:22:37,331 --> 01:22:42,715
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the square, Mr. President, we have a lot right behind City Hall, city-owned.

966
01:22:43,355 --> 01:22:47,357
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the old Roots parking lot across from the senior center, city-owned.

967
01:22:47,637 --> 01:22:55,102
[SPEAKER_14]: We have three giant parcels of land that are undeveloped in our downtown business district that's owned by the city of Medford.

968
01:22:55,622 --> 01:22:59,604
[SPEAKER_14]: And still, we can't move this square forward, Mr. President.

969
01:22:59,644 --> 01:23:00,945
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know,

970
01:23:01,335 --> 01:23:07,156
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an attempt by the administration to bring additional business into the square.

971
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:09,036
[SPEAKER_14]: We have liquor licenses.

972
01:23:09,737 --> 01:23:13,717
[SPEAKER_14]: We have beer and wine licenses that are still available right now.

973
01:23:14,377 --> 01:23:25,099
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we have to do more of a focus on community development, on offering incentives, on maybe improving the square so when businesses come in and say, you know what, geez, this square is dark.

974
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:26,580
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, there's no crosswalks.

975
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,280
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, you take your life in your hand,

976
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:32,101
[SPEAKER_14]: when you cross High Street or Main Street or Riverside Ave.

977
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:40,664
[SPEAKER_14]: These are the things I think we have to look at before we can say a few liquor licenses is going to help our business districts.

978
01:23:41,404 --> 01:23:47,266
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I'm not sold on this as a stimulus at all.

979
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:48,907
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll support it tonight.

980
01:23:49,448 --> 01:24:09,347
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we have to sit down and really, rather than just getting feedback from these committees the mayor set up, you know, Business Economic Committee and Community Committee and Government Relations Committee and Economic Development, all these different committees, and I haven't seen one result from any of these committees.

981
01:24:10,088 --> 01:24:12,790
[SPEAKER_14]: They've done yeoman's work, but I haven't seen any results.

982
01:24:15,095 --> 01:24:17,196
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I'm not sold on this.

983
01:24:17,256 --> 01:24:18,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I will vote for it tonight, Mr. President.

984
01:24:19,217 --> 01:24:32,462
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd rather hear more out of the mayor on what we're going to do to be business friendly and attract businesses to our business district, rather than just put together a quick fix on adding more liquor licenses, which

985
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,564
[SPEAKER_14]: We have liquor licenses right now that are available, both beer and wine and full liquor licenses.

986
01:24:38,984 --> 01:24:43,748
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's not preventing quality restaurants from coming into our community.

987
01:24:44,008 --> 01:24:44,768
[SPEAKER_14]: They can pick one up.

988
01:24:45,089 --> 01:24:51,473
[SPEAKER_14]: What's preventing them from coming in is the way we do business in this community and the way our business districts look.

989
01:24:51,713 --> 01:24:57,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Who wants to open or spend 100 or 200 grand in Medford Square when after six o'clock the sidewalks roll up?

990
01:24:58,638 --> 01:25:00,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's gonna in their right mind invest in the square?

991
01:25:03,088 --> 01:25:11,274
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to invest, Mr. President, we have to invest in the square first and all our business districts because they all need some severe help.

992
01:25:11,294 --> 01:25:11,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Believe me.

993
01:25:12,395 --> 01:25:12,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

994
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:13,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

995
01:25:13,836 --> 01:25:14,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor.

996
01:25:15,317 --> 01:25:23,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And before we take the vote, we invite our esteemed, uh, uh, citizen of East Medford to share his name and dress for the record.

997
01:25:24,644 --> 01:25:24,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

998
01:25:24,984 --> 01:25:27,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew Castaneri, Cushman street, Medford.

999
01:25:27,946 --> 01:25:29,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, two one five five.

1000
01:25:29,127 --> 01:25:29,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh,

1001
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:44,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate Councilor Marx's words and I believe some, some of these extra liquor licenses will probably help a lot of the restaurant businesses presently and in the future.

1002
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:57,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, although I believe in the thirties or forties, uh, there was a bar room on Salem street and there was a miss misfortunate incident that took place and someone lost a life.

1003
01:25:59,004 --> 01:26:06,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that's the point when method met Ford became a dry town from what I understand from my elders.

1004
01:26:07,846 --> 01:26:21,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if I was making the, the delusion, the vision of Medford square to make it a, uh, one or five, uh, hop in place like Davis square.

1005
01:26:22,689 --> 01:26:28,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And my opinion, if Tufts this week, you will ever gets their green line station,

1006
01:26:30,298 --> 01:26:54,691
[SPEAKER_08]: it would make sense instead of redundantly on phase two going to West Medford towards the river because West Method already has a commuter line to a North station and Winchester center has that same line into downtown Winchester, even at trains at four o'clock in the morning, although they told him to shut the whistles down at that hour.

1007
01:26:55,831 --> 01:26:58,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Malden center has the orange line,

1008
01:26:59,893 --> 01:27:20,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't it be wonderful to, as the crow flies, I can see it behind Mr. Finn's window, I can see the smokestack at College Ave in Winthrop, and it seems like three quarters of a mile as the crow flies, and if you did it underground, there's no such thing as eminent domain, except you could disturb a few rodents.

1009
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:27,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And then behind you, Councilor, President, Mr. Dello Russo,

1010
01:27:28,402 --> 01:27:47,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I would take away that red brick building via eminent domain and give them fair market value, or even pay them double if I had the dimes to pay them, and have the Medford Commons, a la Winchester Commons, not quite the Boston Commons.

1011
01:27:49,846 --> 01:27:51,686
[SPEAKER_08]: While I'm at it, I would throw in a clipper ship.

1012
01:27:51,806 --> 01:27:54,947
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I'd claim the fame, right over the bridge and left the drum.

1013
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:57,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Over 500 clipper ships were built.

1014
01:27:58,554 --> 01:28:02,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe over 50 were over a football field long.

1015
01:28:04,396 --> 01:28:04,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Incredible.

1016
01:28:05,476 --> 01:28:07,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Sea of the Ocean, all the seas.

1017
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,398
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have one as a museum.

1018
01:28:09,418 --> 01:28:15,520
[SPEAKER_08]: They have one in Salem Harbor, which is only 200 feet.

1019
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:21,902
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd have the eternal stimulus of all times, forever and a day.

1020
01:28:22,963 --> 01:28:26,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should turn our back towards the river and not turn our backs on the river

1021
01:28:28,004 --> 01:28:34,229
[SPEAKER_08]: As we did, if we did it like Georgetown, Virginia, we'd be sitting pretty today.

1022
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And Councilor Marks brought up a good point.

1023
01:28:37,492 --> 01:28:38,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Location.

1024
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:46,540
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably the best location of all of Massachusetts if you want to do commerce because of Route 93.

1025
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,522
[SPEAKER_08]: It's better than fighting the traffic down to Braintree.

1026
01:28:51,424 --> 01:28:54,066
[SPEAKER_08]: This land is the most valuable asset you could ever have.

1027
01:28:54,086 --> 01:28:55,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever had a Chelsea fire?

1028
01:28:56,765 --> 01:29:00,769
[SPEAKER_08]: or two of those fires they had, and most of these houses burnt down.

1029
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:04,172
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sitting on Donald Trump type of a land.

1030
01:29:04,192 --> 01:29:06,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for listening.

1031
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:07,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1032
01:29:07,254 --> 01:29:13,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, on the home rule petition 16-702.

1033
01:29:17,043 --> 01:29:18,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1034
01:29:19,905 --> 01:29:20,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello?

1035
01:29:20,946 --> 01:29:21,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1036
01:29:21,567 --> 01:29:22,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco?

1037
01:29:22,408 --> 01:29:22,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1038
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight?

1039
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:23,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1040
01:29:24,351 --> 01:29:25,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

1041
01:29:25,631 --> 01:29:25,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1042
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:26,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Martz?

1043
01:29:27,212 --> 01:29:27,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1044
01:29:27,832 --> 01:29:28,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1045
01:29:28,752 --> 01:29:29,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1046
01:29:29,673 --> 01:29:30,573
[SPEAKER_03]: President Dello Russo?

1047
01:29:30,633 --> 01:29:30,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1048
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:37,136
[SPEAKER_07]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

1049
01:29:37,156 --> 01:29:39,717
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-757 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1050
01:29:40,377 --> 01:29:51,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Be resolved that the Traffic Commission discuss allowing buses and trucks to take a right from Winthrop Street to Route 16 in order for them to get on 93 without

1051
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:54,244
[SPEAKER_07]: having to use South Street or Harvard Street.

1052
01:29:55,264 --> 01:30:05,047
[SPEAKER_07]: This is in addition to our approved amendment on October 25th, 2016, requesting that South Street be a no-trucking street.

1053
01:30:05,307 --> 01:30:06,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

1054
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1055
01:30:08,468 --> 01:30:20,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Since the speeding on South Street and the heavy trucking was discussed on October 25th, I received additional phone calls from concerned residents who live in and around South Street

1056
01:30:20,554 --> 01:30:24,356
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is one recommendation that was put forth, and I think it's a good resolve.

1057
01:30:24,396 --> 01:30:37,942
[SPEAKER_12]: And it would alleviate the heavy trucking, help alleviate the heavy trucking from South Harvard, Boston Ave, a number of different roadways in South Medford that are getting hit with heavy trucking.

1058
01:30:38,943 --> 01:30:43,265
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure right now, Route 16, there's no trucking allowed.

1059
01:30:43,325 --> 01:30:47,927
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we could change that, I don't see a reason why we couldn't.

1060
01:30:48,347 --> 01:30:49,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, we need the help of

1061
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:56,209
[SPEAKER_12]: traffic commission in the state, but if we could have the traffic commission look into this, I think it would alleviate the heavy trucking.

1062
01:30:56,409 --> 01:31:13,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually went in a gentleman's home over the last week, and the pitchers, I mean, the heavy trucking is going over the catch basins so heavily that the pitchers are being, you know, obviously crooked on the walls, the inner wall facing South Street.

1063
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:13,859
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think

1064
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:20,108
[SPEAKER_12]: They definitely need some resolve in that area, and I think this would help alleviate our main thoroughfares from the trucking.

1065
01:31:22,131 --> 01:31:23,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1066
01:31:23,673 --> 01:31:24,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1067
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:39,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yes, Mr. President, it's my understanding that that portion of route 16 is entitled Sleepy Hollow and it's part of what's known as the Emerald Necklace, which is a system of parkways and boulevards, uh, that would go from Medford and reach into all the way to the Jamaica way.

1068
01:31:39,768 --> 01:31:42,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I believe that it has historic value as well.

1069
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:46,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might've been designed by, uh, Frederick Law Olmsted, Mr. President.

1070
01:31:46,552 --> 01:31:52,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it was also famous for, I believe if I'm not mistaken, the design of the Boston common and a central park in New York city.

1071
01:31:53,207 --> 01:32:05,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that the control and jurisdiction over Route 16 and that roadway falls under the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and I do believe there's a longstanding trucking ban on that roadway, Mr. President.

1072
01:32:06,531 --> 01:32:08,492
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm off exploring options.

1073
01:32:09,252 --> 01:32:16,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm off exploring feasible options as to how we can address the heavy trucking on South Street and surrounding streets.

1074
01:32:17,514 --> 01:32:19,075
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I don't know if this is

1075
01:32:20,298 --> 01:32:31,227
[SPEAKER_04]: option that's going to be available to us based upon the historic nature of, um, the roadway and the history surrounding, um, the allowance of trucking on that roadway.

1076
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:34,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but I guess, Mr. President, you don't get a kiss unless you ask.

1077
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:35,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not going to hurt to ask.

1078
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:49,001
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, I personally am not too, um, optimistic that this is going to be something that's authorized, uh, from the department of conservation and recreation, but move for approval on the motion approval.

1079
01:32:49,021 --> 01:32:49,702
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

1080
01:32:50,373 --> 01:32:51,033
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1081
01:32:51,693 --> 01:32:52,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

1082
01:32:53,594 --> 01:32:54,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved.

1083
01:32:54,354 --> 01:32:58,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor, Vice President Lungo-Koehn, 16-758.

1084
01:32:59,475 --> 01:33:08,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the administration provide the city council with an update on what the fall street sweeping policies are with regards to ticketing and towing.

1085
01:33:09,156 --> 01:33:09,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

1086
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:11,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1087
01:33:11,997 --> 01:33:15,398
[SPEAKER_12]: The good news is that we're doing some street sweeping in the city of Medford.

1088
01:33:15,418 --> 01:33:17,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen the crews out and it looks like they're doing a

1089
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:24,123
[SPEAKER_12]: diligent effort, but I did receive a couple complaints that are going around some cars.

1090
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:28,525
[SPEAKER_12]: And from what I understand, a few people have called the mayor's office to complain.

1091
01:33:28,585 --> 01:33:32,947
[SPEAKER_12]: And at this point, there would be no tagging and towing from what I understand.

1092
01:33:33,387 --> 01:33:35,668
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanted to see if that was truly the case.

1093
01:33:35,788 --> 01:33:38,950
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it is, is this going to be just for the fall?

1094
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:41,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to do something different in the spring?

1095
01:33:41,131 --> 01:33:46,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, people are upset that if you do go around a car, obviously you're leaving, you know,

1096
01:33:48,284 --> 01:33:55,288
[SPEAKER_12]: heavy leaves, now wet leaves that are in our roadways to obviously clog catch basins.

1097
01:33:55,549 --> 01:33:59,691
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously it's not cleanly in front of certain people's homes.

1098
01:33:59,771 --> 01:34:12,779
[SPEAKER_12]: So just want to see if there is a policy in place, what we're doing during the fall street sweeping and what we plan on doing in the spring so that we can educate the residents with regard when we do get a call that why is my street dirty?

1099
01:34:13,019 --> 01:34:13,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

1100
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:17,542
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we can tell them there must've been cars parked there and the policy this fall.

1101
01:34:18,309 --> 01:34:20,831
[SPEAKER_12]: part of the administration is that we're not tagging and towing.

1102
01:34:20,871 --> 01:34:22,152
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just going around the cars.

1103
01:34:22,533 --> 01:34:29,478
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just good for the council to know the residents to know, um, because I, most residents want their entire street clean.

1104
01:34:29,519 --> 01:34:30,900
[SPEAKER_12]: They want in front of their home cleaned.

1105
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:36,605
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's just important question that we need answered and the residents, um, want the answer to.

1106
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:46,513
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully whether that's a policy in the fall, hopefully we do educate the residents, let them know ahead of schedule when the streets sweeping will be in the spring.

1107
01:34:47,087 --> 01:34:51,129
[SPEAKER_12]: and we do what we can to make sure the whole street is swept, whether we have to take it in tow.

1108
01:34:51,309 --> 01:34:56,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I think that's sometimes a necessary element of, um, street sweeping.

1109
01:34:57,071 --> 01:35:06,355
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously people need fair warning, many different ways to be warned, but it's something that the residents are calling and questioning and they deserve an answer.

1110
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:07,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1111
01:35:07,475 --> 01:35:09,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam vice president chair recognizes constant.

1112
01:35:09,896 --> 01:35:10,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1113
01:35:10,236 --> 01:35:10,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President's approval.

1114
01:35:11,557 --> 01:35:14,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I got more than my fair share of complaints on, um,

1115
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:17,449
[SPEAKER_15]: on why the cows were just ticketed and not towed.

1116
01:35:18,189 --> 01:35:27,236
[SPEAKER_15]: I did call, and the answer I got was that the administration felt that the streets weren't as bad as anticipated.

1117
01:35:28,257 --> 01:35:34,261
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the spring, there would be more of a considered effort in the spring with all the salt and sand in there.

1118
01:35:35,102 --> 01:35:38,004
[SPEAKER_15]: And at that time, there will be ticketing and towing.

1119
01:35:38,884 --> 01:35:42,627
[SPEAKER_15]: But like I said, no matter where I went, everybody complained that

1120
01:35:44,318 --> 01:35:49,642
[SPEAKER_15]: The streets weren't swept, uh, in front of the houses and will the truck be coming back to clean in front of the house?

1121
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:51,603
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

1122
01:35:51,643 --> 01:35:54,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1123
01:35:55,266 --> 01:35:56,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1124
01:35:56,707 --> 01:36:03,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's safe to say that everyone behind this rail could say that we can do a better job when it comes to street sweeping in the city of Medford.

1125
01:36:03,712 --> 01:36:07,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, year in and year out, we have the same conversations every spring and every fall.

1126
01:36:08,416 --> 01:36:09,137
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

1127
01:36:09,337 --> 01:36:10,337
[SPEAKER_04]: When's it going to be posted?

1128
01:36:10,357 --> 01:36:11,018
[SPEAKER_04]: The big sweep.

1129
01:36:11,628 --> 01:36:15,531
[SPEAKER_04]: check the city website, how people have been notified, so on and so forth, Mr. President.

1130
01:36:15,551 --> 01:36:17,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So I certainly think that we can do a better job.

1131
01:36:17,673 --> 01:36:26,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is a good step towards us being provided with information to maybe sit down and take a look at the job we're doing and come up with some suggestions as to how we can improve upon that, Mr. President.

1132
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So I move for approval and I support the resolution on that motion.

1133
01:36:30,263 --> 01:36:31,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Council marks.

1134
01:36:32,605 --> 01:36:33,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, here we go again.

1135
01:36:34,387 --> 01:36:34,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1136
01:36:34,967 --> 01:36:40,732
[SPEAKER_14]: For the last 10 years, this city council has spoken about the lack of consistency

1137
01:36:41,553 --> 01:36:42,933
[SPEAKER_14]: on behalf of the administration.

1138
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:46,174
[SPEAKER_14]: In particular, the Street Sweepin' program.

1139
01:36:47,294 --> 01:36:52,195
[SPEAKER_14]: And last year, a message was sent out to the residents, we're gonna tag in tow.

1140
01:36:53,115 --> 01:36:56,036
[SPEAKER_14]: This year, a message is being sent out, we're just gonna tag.

1141
01:36:57,016 --> 01:36:59,176
[SPEAKER_14]: The lack of consistency, Mr. President.

1142
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:05,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, if you go on the city website, it says, Street Sweepin' begins November 9th.

1143
01:37:06,277 --> 01:37:09,878
[SPEAKER_14]: The electronic billboard in the square, Street Sweepin' begins

1144
01:37:10,755 --> 01:37:11,576
[SPEAKER_14]: November 9th.

1145
01:37:12,596 --> 01:37:16,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Riverside Ave, street sweeping begins November 6th.

1146
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:21,802
[SPEAKER_14]: They can't even get the two electronic billboards right, Mr. President.

1147
01:37:22,162 --> 01:37:26,045
[SPEAKER_14]: They can't get the dates right on the electronic billboard.

1148
01:37:26,865 --> 01:37:28,206
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't make any sense.

1149
01:37:28,947 --> 01:37:30,268
[SPEAKER_14]: We receive every year

1150
01:37:31,207 --> 01:37:35,772
[SPEAKER_14]: and the mayor gets out there and takes a picture, the distinction of Tree City, USA.

1151
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:42,118
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a lot of trees in our community, we take care of our trees, and we plant a lot of trees.

1152
01:37:42,419 --> 01:37:43,860
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we get the distinction.

1153
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:49,466
[SPEAKER_14]: But yet the mayor says she doesn't see a need to have cars moved off the street.

1154
01:37:50,106 --> 01:37:52,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Madam Mayor, come by my house,

1155
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,002
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll show you the thousands of leaves in front of my house alone.

1156
01:37:57,782 --> 01:38:02,765
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can assure you that that's in front of many people's homes in this community.

1157
01:38:03,145 --> 01:38:05,646
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do need a full sweeping.

1158
01:38:06,207 --> 01:38:11,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Why have a program where you're going to say, well, if people don't want to move their car, that's fine.

1159
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:13,610
[SPEAKER_14]: People don't want to move.

1160
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:14,531
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all right.

1161
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:18,311
[SPEAKER_14]: We need consistency in this community, Mr. President.

1162
01:38:18,992 --> 01:38:29,077
[SPEAKER_14]: And to only have it done twice a year, and then not to do a full-fledged sweeping, I don't even know what to call it.

1163
01:38:29,977 --> 01:38:32,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Because those leaves are gonna end up in the catch basins.

1164
01:38:33,419 --> 01:38:37,281
[SPEAKER_14]: The catch basins are gonna clog, and they're gonna cause flooding throughout our community.

1165
01:38:38,301 --> 01:38:41,643
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the mayor's gonna say, I'm not sure why our community's flooding.

1166
01:38:43,162 --> 01:38:44,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, Mr. President.

1167
01:38:44,225 --> 01:38:46,251
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been talking about this for years.

1168
01:38:46,772 --> 01:38:47,956
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a simple fix.

1169
01:38:48,477 --> 01:38:50,182
[SPEAKER_14]: They do it in every other community.

1170
01:38:51,495 --> 01:38:54,636
[SPEAKER_14]: You post signs, permanent signs.

1171
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:56,796
[SPEAKER_14]: For years they used to put them on trees.

1172
01:38:57,116 --> 01:38:58,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Then they stopped putting them on trees.

1173
01:38:58,677 --> 01:39:00,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Then they'd have the police go by with the blowhorns.

1174
01:39:00,957 --> 01:39:01,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Then they stopped doing that.

1175
01:39:02,817 --> 01:39:05,378
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been a lack of consistency every year.

1176
01:39:05,758 --> 01:39:10,159
[SPEAKER_14]: This particular street sweeping program changes every year.

1177
01:39:10,379 --> 01:39:13,040
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you expect residents to know what's gonna go on?

1178
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Because every year it changes.

1179
01:39:16,808 --> 01:39:37,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I can guarantee you, Mr. President, that we're gonna get the calls like Councilor Caraviello got, saying, you know what, I took the time to take my car off the road that was parked in front of my home to make sure the front of my home got swept, because we only do it twice a year, and then someone else parked in the spot and the sweeping truck went around it.

1180
01:39:38,065 --> 01:39:39,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that a great way of doing business?

1181
01:39:40,927 --> 01:39:44,790
[SPEAKER_14]: And the mayor knows, she's as cute as Mayor McGlynn.

1182
01:39:45,934 --> 01:39:47,396
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't want to give people tickets.

1183
01:39:47,897 --> 01:39:48,959
[SPEAKER_14]: They won't vote for us.

1184
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,122
[SPEAKER_14]: But guess what, Madam Mayor?

1185
01:39:51,563 --> 01:39:52,585
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to stand up.

1186
01:39:53,266 --> 01:39:54,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And leadership starts from the top.

1187
01:39:56,377 --> 01:40:07,959
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're gonna take some stances that aren't popular, and maybe having people move their cars off the street for sweet streepin' is not popular, but it's something you have to do in order to run a community.

1188
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:10,960
[SPEAKER_14]: They do it in every other community, and they're successful.

1189
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:14,961
[SPEAKER_14]: The city of Somerville does theirs a dozen times a year, and maybe even more.

1190
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:23,743
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're a highly congested area in the city of Somerville, and they're able to sweep their streets in a systematic way in getting their streets clean.

1191
01:40:23,983 --> 01:40:24,863
[SPEAKER_14]: The city of Boston,

1192
01:40:25,263 --> 01:40:27,605
[SPEAKER_14]: But the city of Medford, who knows what will happen?

1193
01:40:27,986 --> 01:40:28,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

1194
01:40:28,846 --> 01:40:31,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Next year's election year, geez, maybe we won't even ticket.

1195
01:40:32,249 --> 01:40:34,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we'll just say the trucks were out.

1196
01:40:36,092 --> 01:40:36,513
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

1197
01:40:36,533 --> 01:40:37,433
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just say they were out.

1198
01:40:37,874 --> 01:40:39,535
[SPEAKER_14]: We won't even need to gas them up.

1199
01:40:39,695 --> 01:40:41,997
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll leave them in the DPW yard, Mr. President.

1200
01:40:43,098 --> 01:40:44,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Every year, it's the same tune.

1201
01:40:46,381 --> 01:40:48,042
[SPEAKER_14]: What does it take to put together a program?

1202
01:40:48,881 --> 01:40:49,721
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand.

1203
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:55,543
[SPEAKER_14]: You set up all these committees, advisory committees, you know, and nothing results.

1204
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:59,084
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard about resident permit parking.

1205
01:41:00,185 --> 01:41:02,405
[SPEAKER_14]: All the chiefs working on that for the last three years.

1206
01:41:04,426 --> 01:41:10,868
[SPEAKER_14]: What's it going to take to get resident citywide permit parking or have it done by zones like they do in other communities?

1207
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:13,369
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not rocket science.

1208
01:41:14,329 --> 01:41:16,430
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what it's going to take, Mr. President.

1209
01:41:17,228 --> 01:41:23,811
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very disappointed again on how this, I got the call tonight, they're gonna come out and they're gonna sweep and they're gonna ticket.

1210
01:41:23,891 --> 01:41:26,853
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't say anything about towing, and they're gonna ticket if your car's out there.

1211
01:41:28,133 --> 01:41:29,554
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what they're gonna do, Mr. President.

1212
01:41:31,555 --> 01:41:31,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1213
01:41:33,616 --> 01:41:34,316
[SPEAKER_15]: No, thank you.

1214
01:41:34,496 --> 01:41:35,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caffiello.

1215
01:41:35,497 --> 01:41:37,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1216
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:40,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Mark said we talk about this every year, and the fix is a very simple fix.

1217
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:45,722
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, if the city doesn't wanna go out and buy some sweepers,

1218
01:41:46,115 --> 01:41:51,456
[SPEAKER_15]: There are plenty of companies that come in and they do street sweeping on a subcontracting basis.

1219
01:41:51,476 --> 01:41:57,377
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can go out and buy a couple of sweepers, but we need to sweep all the time, not two times a year.

1220
01:41:58,257 --> 01:42:02,758
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not too hard to figure out.

1221
01:42:03,238 --> 01:42:07,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Either do it in-house or send it out of house.

1222
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:11,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Once a month, twice a month, that's how you do it.

1223
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:13,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Not rocket science.

1224
01:42:16,292 --> 01:42:19,436
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1225
01:42:20,338 --> 01:42:20,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1226
01:42:20,558 --> 01:42:24,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, can you have them update the electronic billboard on Riverside Ave?

1227
01:42:24,804 --> 01:42:27,928
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended by Councilman Monks to update the electronic billboard.

1228
01:42:28,713 --> 01:42:31,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, billboard on Riverside Ave to turn it right side up.

1229
01:42:31,435 --> 01:42:34,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone from the city would drive by and see that billboard that's been up for two weeks.

1230
01:42:35,098 --> 01:42:35,938
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the wrong date.

1231
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:38,620
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor of that section of the city.

1232
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:44,064
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed.

1233
01:42:44,084 --> 01:42:45,885
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-759 offered by vice president Lungo-Koehn.

1234
01:42:46,525 --> 01:42:57,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the administration provide us with an update regarding the expenditures for property, for property, the city council approved, uh, since,

1235
01:42:57,772 --> 01:42:58,452
[SPEAKER_07]: January 1st, 2016.

1236
01:42:58,932 --> 01:43:00,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I say that right?

1237
01:43:01,153 --> 01:43:01,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Close enough.

1238
01:43:01,973 --> 01:43:02,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Deller.

1239
01:43:02,913 --> 01:43:04,994
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to table this till next week.

1240
01:43:05,014 --> 01:43:06,014
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank the clerk.

1241
01:43:06,194 --> 01:43:07,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Got me some information I need.

1242
01:43:07,815 --> 01:43:12,916
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to do a little more research because I'm trying to pull paperwork at my house that I can't find on this one.

1243
01:43:13,056 --> 01:43:14,377
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll table this till next week.

1244
01:43:14,737 --> 01:43:16,437
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion to table, all those in favor?

1245
01:43:16,837 --> 01:43:18,858
[SPEAKER_07]: All those against?

1246
01:43:18,898 --> 01:43:20,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

1247
01:43:20,138 --> 01:43:25,500
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-756 petition by Gene Mark to Cummings Street, Metro Mass to address this council on traffic safety

1248
01:43:26,273 --> 01:43:27,894
[SPEAKER_07]: on the roads and sidewalks.

1249
01:43:28,975 --> 01:43:29,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, citizen.

1250
01:43:29,975 --> 01:43:30,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

1251
01:43:30,416 --> 01:43:32,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1252
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:32,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

1253
01:43:32,977 --> 01:43:34,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Jean Martin, Tancreda Street.

1254
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:44,024
[SPEAKER_09]: This city was founded in 1630 and has had an ever-increasing population ever since.

1255
01:43:44,624 --> 01:43:47,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Our streets and sidewalks cannot accommodate everyone's wishes.

1256
01:43:48,407 --> 01:43:49,427
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just the way it is.

1257
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:52,129
[SPEAKER_09]: The people who are on bicycles

1258
01:43:53,777 --> 01:43:59,141
[SPEAKER_09]: want to put bikes legitimately on the streets in Medford in the same lanes with cars, trucks, and buses.

1259
01:44:00,042 --> 01:44:01,803
[SPEAKER_09]: It is an accident waiting to happen.

1260
01:44:03,645 --> 01:44:05,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone is going to get injured or killed.

1261
01:44:06,908 --> 01:44:07,988
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only a matter of time.

1262
01:44:08,769 --> 01:44:13,133
[SPEAKER_09]: When a car hits a truck, the car driver stands a chance of survival.

1263
01:44:13,633 --> 01:44:14,754
[SPEAKER_09]: A bicyclist does not.

1264
01:44:16,058 --> 01:44:21,861
[SPEAKER_09]: A 19-year-old Taunton woman was charged in connection with a fatal hit-and-run Thursday night.

1265
01:44:22,861 --> 01:44:27,323
[SPEAKER_09]: A Taunton man died after being hit by a car while riding his bike Thursday night.

1266
01:44:29,575 --> 01:44:37,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not want to be responsible for someone else's death, and I'm not trying to hit a bicyclist.

1267
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:41,159
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that I have been more aware of bicyclists.

1268
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I look in my rearview mirror more often, and they'll come up on my right.

1269
01:44:46,981 --> 01:44:52,683
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll come up in between the two cars, and it's very, very dangerous.

1270
01:44:52,723 --> 01:44:53,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm in a car.

1271
01:44:53,644 --> 01:44:57,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even imagine if a bus, if they're coming up along a truck or a bus,

1272
01:44:58,522 --> 01:45:02,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's, and the bus or truck is trying to take a right.

1273
01:45:02,688 --> 01:45:03,589
[SPEAKER_09]: They will not see that.

1274
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:06,073
[SPEAKER_09]: That bicyclist moves very, very fast.

1275
01:45:08,777 --> 01:45:14,705
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a bicyclist in Medford from here on out, I'm letting you know that I don't want to hurt you.

1276
01:45:18,449 --> 01:45:20,311
[SPEAKER_09]: And we need to do something about this policy.

1277
01:45:22,573 --> 01:45:24,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be up for my manslaughter charges.

1278
01:45:24,574 --> 01:45:25,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't.

1279
01:45:25,435 --> 01:45:26,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not intending to.

1280
01:45:26,976 --> 01:45:28,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I try to pay attention as much as I can.

1281
01:45:28,998 --> 01:45:33,262
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thought of hitting somebody on a bike is just frightening to me.

1282
01:45:34,423 --> 01:45:42,550
[SPEAKER_09]: You're risking the lives of others as well, as I may swerve not to hit you, and I may hit another car or, heaven forbid, a pedestrian.

1283
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:44,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize that you do not.

1284
01:45:45,292 --> 01:45:47,693
[SPEAKER_09]: even belong on the sidewalk these days either.

1285
01:45:48,354 --> 01:45:55,577
[SPEAKER_09]: And I talked to somebody that was a proponent of bicycles on the roads so that I could, you know, figure stuff out.

1286
01:45:55,677 --> 01:45:59,018
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, a bike doesn't belong on a sidewalk today either.

1287
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:05,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason for that is if you look at Riverside Ave, everybody's turned their front yards into parking spaces.

1288
01:46:06,902 --> 01:46:09,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have to go in and they have to back out.

1289
01:46:09,223 --> 01:46:11,164
[SPEAKER_09]: They couldn't see a bike if the car was coming out.

1290
01:46:13,485 --> 01:46:18,667
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only so much room on the roads in Medford, and there's only so much room on the sidewalks.

1291
01:46:18,707 --> 01:46:20,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody wants a tree on the sidewalk.

1292
01:46:20,528 --> 01:46:23,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody wants strollers and wheelchairs on the sidewalk.

1293
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:29,491
[SPEAKER_09]: There is so much competition for space that it's just, I don't even think they belong on the sidewalks now.

1294
01:46:29,531 --> 01:46:31,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to say, oh, just put them on the sidewalks.

1295
01:46:31,852 --> 01:46:33,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's safe for bikes on the sidewalks either.

1296
01:46:34,352 --> 01:46:34,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't.

1297
01:46:37,575 --> 01:46:39,376
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realized, okay, so anyway, whatever.

1298
01:46:39,616 --> 01:46:46,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, the argument that I hear is that bicyclists actually have a right to be on the road.

1299
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

1300
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Not on the street.

1301
01:46:50,321 --> 01:46:50,761
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why?

1302
01:46:51,461 --> 01:46:55,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a pedestrian, and I have no right to be walking down the middle of Riverside Ave.

1303
01:46:56,188 --> 01:46:56,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not.

1304
01:46:56,849 --> 01:46:57,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have that permission.

1305
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:59,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know why?

1306
01:46:59,151 --> 01:47:01,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'll get hit by a car.

1307
01:47:03,655 --> 01:47:07,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Unmotorized vehicles should not be on the road with motorized vehicles.

1308
01:47:07,939 --> 01:47:10,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand that people like their bikes and everything else.

1309
01:47:10,142 --> 01:47:13,205
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know that you guys aren't going to change your policy.

1310
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:18,089
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to feel better when I go home tonight, because this is an issue of public safety.

1311
01:47:20,432 --> 01:47:20,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, go ahead.

1312
01:47:22,831 --> 01:47:28,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe it's the City of Medford's policy that authorizes cyclists to ride their cycles on the roadways.

1313
01:47:28,222 --> 01:47:31,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's state law that authorizes such.

1314
01:47:31,489 --> 01:47:32,451
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not our policy.

1315
01:47:32,972 --> 01:47:33,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.

1316
01:47:34,185 --> 01:47:41,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at any rate, they're going to be on the roads, but if I hit you, sorry, I'm telling you right now, I just, I don't like it.

1317
01:47:43,527 --> 01:47:53,289
[SPEAKER_09]: You're endangering the mental well-being of people like me who have the excessive worry that I am going to hit you on a road unable to accommodate you.

1318
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:57,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's strong language, but I just feel that way.

1319
01:47:57,911 --> 01:48:04,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Bicyclists, this is from a lawyer's website, bicyclists have rights to roadways that are similar to other vehicles.

1320
01:48:04,833 --> 01:48:13,700
[SPEAKER_09]: By not properly sharing the road, frustrated motorists who are unfamiliar with rules and regulations can cause serious injuries to bicyclists.

1321
01:48:14,721 --> 01:48:19,525
[SPEAKER_09]: We can help you recover compensation for damages and injuries incurred in bicycle accidents.

1322
01:48:21,007 --> 01:48:30,495
[SPEAKER_09]: If you incur an injury such as a head trauma, neck injury, fractures or broken bones, rotocuff injuries, scars or catastrophic injuries,

1323
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:34,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Take the necessary steps to protect yourself and build a case for compensation.

1324
01:48:35,362 --> 01:48:38,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Gather contact information from witnesses and people involved in the accident.

1325
01:48:39,384 --> 01:48:49,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Take photos of damages and injuries and avoid making statements regarding the accident until you have contacted an experienced attorney at our firm.

1326
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:51,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the real kicker.

1327
01:48:52,191 --> 01:48:55,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Compensation that goes beyond immediate medical bills.

1328
01:48:56,394 --> 01:48:59,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on the circumstances surrounding your bicycle accident,

1329
01:48:59,569 --> 01:49:10,794
[SPEAKER_09]: The at-fault party's automobile insurance could cover a large portion of lost wages, medical bills, ambulance fees, bicycle replacement services, and wrongful death claims.

1330
01:49:11,394 --> 01:49:13,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Homeowner's insurance, this is the kicker.

1331
01:49:14,776 --> 01:49:20,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only is my car insurance going to go up, because we all are on a group system.

1332
01:49:21,278 --> 01:49:22,559
[SPEAKER_09]: You have an accident, I pay for it.

1333
01:49:23,179 --> 01:49:24,680
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just the way the insurance

1334
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:25,691
[SPEAKER_09]: process works.

1335
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:32,696
[SPEAKER_09]: My homeowner's insurance could also be involved in the accident was caused by negligent behavior on another person's property.

1336
01:49:35,556 --> 01:49:52,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that you guys aren't going to change your policy, but the least you can do is make a permit process in the city where somebody that wants to go on the roads has to pass a class, is going to be heavily fined, is going to have to deal with the rules of the road.

1337
01:49:52,708 --> 01:49:54,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're not going to change the policy.

1338
01:49:54,109 --> 01:49:54,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1339
01:49:54,570 --> 01:49:56,611
[SPEAKER_09]: The bike people, they're a strong lobby.

1340
01:49:57,426 --> 01:50:04,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's very, very stupid, dangerous, and especially given the light that our city has so many cars on it.

1341
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:12,814
[SPEAKER_09]: We not only have our own cars to worry about, we got people going through our city to Boston via 16 or Salem Street or whatever.

1342
01:50:13,175 --> 01:50:15,176
[SPEAKER_09]: We have cars, cars, cars, and more cars.

1343
01:50:15,616 --> 01:50:18,297
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do have a car problem parked on the Fulton Street.

1344
01:50:18,337 --> 01:50:19,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to Fulton Street.

1345
01:50:19,478 --> 01:50:22,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time I drive up there, there's cars on the sidewalk.

1346
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they're so bold, they're actually on the street.

1347
01:50:25,618 --> 01:50:27,639
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, I'm not picking on just the bike people.

1348
01:50:28,919 --> 01:50:42,605
[SPEAKER_09]: The car people, they need to be responsible too because, you know, if they're in the car, if they're on the street and I have to go into the other person oncoming traffics to go around them, you're putting me at danger in that too.

1349
01:50:42,725 --> 01:50:47,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So you need to get the cars off the streets, off the sidewalks and the like.

1350
01:50:47,047 --> 01:50:48,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not just the bike people.

1351
01:50:48,528 --> 01:50:54,811
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's the bike people that bother me the most because you're not going to win in a fight on the road with a bike.

1352
01:50:56,023 --> 01:51:00,964
[SPEAKER_09]: You're taking your life into your own hands, but you're also taking my life into my hands, because I don't want to be in jail for manslaughter.

1353
01:51:01,124 --> 01:51:01,765
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't.

1354
01:51:03,285 --> 01:51:03,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1355
01:51:04,525 --> 01:51:05,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, citizen.

1356
01:51:05,866 --> 01:51:09,047
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Falco to receive and place on file, all those in favor?

1357
01:51:10,747 --> 01:51:11,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor?

1358
01:51:12,087 --> 01:51:13,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1359
01:51:13,068 --> 01:51:16,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate, Gene, you bringing up the issue.

1360
01:51:16,889 --> 01:51:23,850
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've had the same conversations with the members of the Bicycle Committee in the city of Medford.

1361
01:51:23,971 --> 01:51:25,691
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think one of the issues is that

1362
01:51:26,192 --> 01:51:30,313
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, we as a community, uh, still not, uh, bicycle friendly.

1363
01:51:31,174 --> 01:51:38,556
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, the city has made movement over the last few years in creating some bike lanes, but there's no connectivity.

1364
01:51:39,336 --> 01:51:44,238
[SPEAKER_14]: And for instance, you have the bike lane that starts off on the Winchester line, coming down Winthrop street.

1365
01:51:44,738 --> 01:51:47,559
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes for about 200 yards and stops at Wildwood road.

1366
01:51:48,039 --> 01:51:49,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the end of the bike lane.

1367
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Not sure where that takes you unless you just want to go down 200 yards.

1368
01:51:53,928 --> 01:52:00,830
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is an issue, because I think what we do by just appeasing people by saying, you know what?

1369
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:01,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you want a bike lane?

1370
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:05,011
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll throw a bike lane on Winthrop Street for 200 yards.

1371
01:52:06,971 --> 01:52:11,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they're going to put one on Boston Ave, a bike lane, under the mayor's new policy.

1372
01:52:12,472 --> 01:52:19,134
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think rather than having a full-fledged program that addresses connectivity, not with chastity,

1373
01:52:19,487 --> 01:52:28,494
[SPEAKER_14]: but enabling our bikers because for the most part, they're looking to get to Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, they're looking to get to other areas and connect with these bike lanes.

1374
01:52:29,334 --> 01:52:36,220
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've fallen short of the mark to really move this issue forward.

1375
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:42,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe, and I appreciate what you're saying, I think we could share our streets, but we have to do it in a safe way.

1376
01:52:42,905 --> 01:52:45,747
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to make it so it's safe for everyone to be on our streets.

1377
01:52:46,187 --> 01:52:55,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if someone opts to use a bicycle and not an automobile or use their feet, they should have every right to gain access to where they have to go and so forth.

1378
01:52:55,335 --> 01:53:11,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's incumbent upon the city to create lanes that are, first of all, safe, that work for not only drivers but also cyclists to make sure it's safe for both, and make sure there's connectivity, which currently doesn't exist.

1379
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:16,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, this is, you know, I think what we're seeing right now is a movement.

1380
01:53:16,893 --> 01:53:20,495
[SPEAKER_14]: We're seeing more people now hop on a bike and get to where they have to go.

1381
01:53:21,196 --> 01:53:25,719
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we as a community have to move forward like they've done in other communities.

1382
01:53:26,019 --> 01:53:31,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Although there's been accidents, you know, the same way I lost a friend on Route 16 about a year and a half ago.

1383
01:53:31,323 --> 01:53:34,425
[SPEAKER_14]: He was struck on his bicycle, you know.

1384
01:53:35,712 --> 01:53:37,573
[SPEAKER_14]: These are things that are happening.

1385
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:39,014
[SPEAKER_14]: It happens to pedestrians.

1386
01:53:39,294 --> 01:53:41,354
[SPEAKER_14]: It happens motor vehicle fatalities.

1387
01:53:41,654 --> 01:53:43,895
[SPEAKER_14]: People get killed all the time in driving vehicles.

1388
01:53:44,275 --> 01:53:51,238
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a reason to stop us from driving vehicles or a reason to stop walking because pedestrians are getting struck.

1389
01:53:51,558 --> 01:53:54,519
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a reason to create safer ways for transportation.

1390
01:53:54,839 --> 01:53:56,500
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's what we have to move upon.

1391
01:53:57,003 --> 01:54:00,205
[SPEAKER_14]: rather than having the mayor sit back and say, wow, we're bike friendly.

1392
01:54:00,245 --> 01:54:01,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at the lane I created.

1393
01:54:02,025 --> 01:54:03,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Look what I've done over here.

1394
01:54:03,406 --> 01:54:10,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the president doesn't drive a bicycle, and it's probably good for business for him if someone does get struck.

1395
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:18,393
[SPEAKER_14]: But for the rest of us that want to maintain our safety, this is a very serious issue, and I think we have to do more as a city.

1396
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:25,432
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to respond.

1397
01:54:26,172 --> 01:54:28,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Around Winthrop Street or something, that's fine.

1398
01:54:28,994 --> 01:54:34,278
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going up Riverside Avenue, you have to be in the lane that the cars are in, and that is my problem.

1399
01:54:34,298 --> 01:54:39,361
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it'll work out that you have that many rural routes in Medford, but I don't see how that's gonna work.

1400
01:54:39,461 --> 01:54:40,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't.

1401
01:54:40,762 --> 01:54:42,163
[SPEAKER_09]: And I appreciate it, though.

1402
01:54:42,663 --> 01:54:44,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that they're gonna be doing this.

1403
01:54:44,184 --> 01:54:48,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I want my voice to be heard that this is very dangerous.

1404
01:54:48,967 --> 01:54:51,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I want pedestrians to feel safe crossing the street.

1405
01:54:51,389 --> 01:54:52,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna amp up.

1406
01:54:52,567 --> 01:54:55,269
[SPEAKER_09]: all the crosswalks so that pedestrians can cross the street.

1407
01:54:56,831 --> 01:55:00,113
[SPEAKER_09]: And I truly believe that we need the sidewalk system that we have.

1408
01:55:00,654 --> 01:55:03,516
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that, you know, I believe in a priority system.

1409
01:55:04,497 --> 01:55:06,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Wheelchairs before trees on the sidewalk.

1410
01:55:06,739 --> 01:55:07,279
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just me.

1411
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:10,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a priority list.

1412
01:55:11,203 --> 01:55:18,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that bikes get to the, if you want to save the environment, then you got to commute with other people to work.

1413
01:55:19,108 --> 01:55:20,188
[SPEAKER_09]: get out to take the bus.

1414
01:55:20,228 --> 01:55:21,289
[SPEAKER_09]: We have other ways.

1415
01:55:21,369 --> 01:55:21,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk.

1416
01:55:22,069 --> 01:55:23,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk to the bus stop.

1417
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:31,411
[SPEAKER_09]: The bike thing on the roads on Riverside Ave, this road is 350, 400 years old.

1418
01:55:31,991 --> 01:55:35,672
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just cannot accommodate everybody's wishes.

1419
01:55:36,012 --> 01:55:36,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It just cannot.

1420
01:55:36,912 --> 01:55:40,653
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why you can't park on Riverside Ave is because there's not enough room.

1421
01:55:40,693 --> 01:55:41,733
[SPEAKER_09]: There's two lanes.

1422
01:55:42,374 --> 01:55:47,915
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point, decisions have to be made where you say we can't do this for someone.

1423
01:55:48,288 --> 01:55:49,108
[SPEAKER_09]: even if it's a wheelchair.

1424
01:55:49,328 --> 01:55:51,289
[SPEAKER_09]: You might not have the room to go in with a wheelchair.

1425
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:56,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see that, but if there's absolutely no way, then you have to say, well, I'm sorry, we can't do it with a wheelchair.

1426
01:55:57,432 --> 01:56:00,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thank you so much for listening to my anxiety on this.

1427
01:56:01,033 --> 01:56:02,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the city for listening to me.

1428
01:56:03,374 --> 01:56:05,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to be watching out for the bikes.

1429
01:56:05,955 --> 01:56:06,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.

1430
01:56:06,415 --> 01:56:10,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I check my rearview mirror a whole lot more now than I ever did.

1431
01:56:11,451 --> 01:56:17,034
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just fear that I'm going to take a right, the bike's going to be up there, and I'm going to hit them.

1432
01:56:17,074 --> 01:56:22,758
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just going to happen, especially at night, the rain, and all the other factors that come into being.

1433
01:56:23,178 --> 01:56:27,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm all for bike paths in certain areas, like the river and stuff like that.

1434
01:56:27,741 --> 01:56:28,201
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

1435
01:56:28,802 --> 01:56:32,204
[SPEAKER_09]: But take your car, take your bike with your car to the river.

1436
01:56:32,524 --> 01:56:33,445
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my advice.

1437
01:56:33,745 --> 01:56:34,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1438
01:56:48,053 --> 01:56:58,040
[SPEAKER_07]: City Council asked for a status, the status on the crosswalk at the intersection of Grove Street and Russell Bustle Road, which was brought forward in May.

1439
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

1440
01:56:59,461 --> 01:57:00,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1441
01:57:01,282 --> 01:57:01,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1442
01:57:01,603 --> 01:57:01,903
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1443
01:57:02,503 --> 01:57:03,324
[SPEAKER_15]: May or March.

1444
01:57:03,784 --> 01:57:05,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was May.

1445
01:57:05,705 --> 01:57:06,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1446
01:57:06,566 --> 01:57:10,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I, uh, it's something I had proposed before and we never heard anything about that.

1447
01:57:11,349 --> 01:57:17,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, that intersection at Bustle and Grove is a, is a very, uh,

1448
01:57:18,147 --> 01:57:20,388
[SPEAKER_15]: heavily traveled by the children going to the playset park.

1449
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:24,651
[SPEAKER_15]: And cars, again, just have total disregard.

1450
01:57:25,091 --> 01:57:31,015
[SPEAKER_15]: They cut off a grove to get down to the playset, and they just go right by there.

1451
01:57:31,195 --> 01:57:32,076
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a crosswalk there.

1452
01:57:32,096 --> 01:57:35,878
[SPEAKER_15]: It'd be a lot safer for the children to use.

1453
01:57:36,218 --> 01:57:39,981
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, I ask again that a crosswalk be painted right there, Mr. President.

1454
01:57:41,622 --> 01:57:43,103
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1455
01:57:43,663 --> 01:57:44,283
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1456
01:57:44,404 --> 01:57:45,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

1457
01:57:45,542 --> 01:57:52,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Council Marks, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for longtime Metro resident Rita Curtin on her recent passing constant.

1458
01:57:54,406 --> 01:57:55,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1459
01:57:55,727 --> 01:57:58,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Mrs. Curtin was a staple at, uh, St.

1460
01:57:58,428 --> 01:58:01,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Rayfields as a lunch mother for a number of years.

1461
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:08,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, she, uh, was a terrific person, mother, grandmother, um, and just a dear friend.

1462
01:58:09,553 --> 01:58:13,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, her husband, if anyone recalls, uh, Mickey Curtin who passed away some years ago,

1463
01:58:14,419 --> 01:58:21,082
[SPEAKER_14]: was the head of forestry in the city for a number of years, and Rita will be very sorely missed, Mr. President.

1464
01:58:21,782 --> 01:58:23,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Please stand for a moment of silence.

1465
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:42,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Marks, it resolved that the parking kiosk be discussed.

1466
01:58:45,047 --> 01:58:46,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1467
01:58:46,448 --> 01:58:55,695
[SPEAKER_14]: I received a number of complaints regarding the kiosk and the fact that this has been an issue of contention.

1468
01:58:58,117 --> 01:59:11,368
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been an issue of contention for a number of years now that this council has requested on federal holidays that the kiosk not have the ability to accept money.

1469
01:59:12,281 --> 01:59:28,588
[SPEAKER_14]: And it happened, I believe, eight months ago, and the company told us at the time they were going to rectify the issue and that they were also — we, as a council, requested that they reimburse anyone that put money in the machine during that period of time.

1470
01:59:29,248 --> 01:59:35,911
[SPEAKER_14]: And on Veterans Day this past Friday, sure enough, the kiosks were accepting money once again, Mr. President.

1471
01:59:36,611 --> 01:59:40,233
[SPEAKER_14]: And business owners were telling customers that were coming up

1472
01:59:40,724 --> 01:59:44,386
[SPEAKER_14]: that don't worry about the kiosk, that you don't have to feed them.

1473
01:59:44,987 --> 01:59:47,548
[SPEAKER_14]: And people were saying, well, it accepted my money.

1474
01:59:47,568 --> 01:59:49,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure you don't have to feed them?

1475
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:54,793
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it left people at a real disadvantage on what to do.

1476
01:59:55,273 --> 02:00:09,302
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I would ask, Mr. President, that we receive a response from the parking method on the fact that the kiosks, once again, were accepting money on a federal holiday.

1477
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:17,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And once again, that, uh, the, whoever put money in these machines because we have their plate number be reimbursed, Mr. President.

1478
02:00:18,502 --> 02:00:24,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, and I would ask that we get a response immediately from, uh, park method regarding this issue.

1479
02:00:24,744 --> 02:00:25,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good on that motion.

1480
02:00:25,764 --> 02:00:29,725
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor of those opposed motion care records of the meeting, November 6, 2016.

1481
02:00:30,025 --> 02:00:32,565
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll pass to counsel Falco.

1482
02:00:32,645 --> 02:00:34,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Councilor, how'd you find those records?

1483
02:00:34,486 --> 02:00:37,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I asked that those records be tabled.

1484
02:00:37,167 --> 02:00:38,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually did not receive a copy.

1485
02:00:39,547 --> 02:00:40,147
