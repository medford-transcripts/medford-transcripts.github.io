    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=387.469s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=388.75s">Um,</a>  I was 16, seven 48. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=390.89s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=392.931s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=393.632s">I</a>  offer this a resolution tonight as many members of this council have brought up, uh, before me, uh, concerns regarding, uh, increased, um, airplane, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=405.735s">traffic</a>  over the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=407.675s">And</a>  this has been an issue for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=411.736s">Uh,</a>  one in which, uh, the council has requested representatives from Massport to appear before the council, which has yet to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=420.838s">Uh,</a>  the council has requested that, uh, the noise monitors that are located throughout, uh, 30 communities that, uh, directly, um, in the path of Logan airport, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=434.399s">uh,</a>  that the monitors be, uh, relooked at in the community and maybe replaced in different locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=441.703s">Um,</a>  that has yet to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=444.764s">And</a>  we've asked, at least I've put on three separate occasions that the appointment to the, uh, Logan airport community advisory committee, which is known as CAC, C A C, um, that our representative from the city of method that's appointed by the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=462.995s">appear</a>  before the Medford city council and give us an update on what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=469.06s">And</a>  I think I put one on originally, it was about four or five years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=472.763s">Uh,</a>  we never got a response from the representative at the time that the mayor appointed recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=478.147s">Uh,</a>  I think it was two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=479.828s">I</a>  asked again, I know council Lungo, uh, current has asked, um, uh, for representative to appear before, uh, this council, uh, to give not only the council, but the residents of this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=492.071s">an</a>  update on what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=495.013s">As</a>  we all know, there's been some work done to the runways at Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=500.377s">And</a>  in particular, runway 15 and 33 has a major impact on this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=509.663s">And</a>  we're experiencing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=512.265s">We're</a>  hearing from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=514.566s">And</a>  those that are not familiar, the Logan Airport Community Advisory Committee <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=520.56s">which</a>  I refer to as CAC, represents over 30 communities, cities and towns within the greater Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=529.147s">CAC</a>  worked jointly with the FFA, I'm sorry, FAA and Massport to develop the scope of work for the noise study and will identify and evaluate potential runway use measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=542.238s">CAC</a>  represents those communities which have authorized <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=545.413s">representatives</a>  in which are or may be affected by airport-related aircraft noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=551.596s">The</a>  primary role of CAC involvement during the study is to provide the FAA and Massport with input on aircraft noise issues related to the airport, particularly as it relates to the identification of potential noise abatement measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=568.145s">It</a>  also is a mission to provide input on suggested criteria <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=573.821s">to</a>  be used in evaluating and comparing those measures, and also recommend to Massport those measures that might be recommended to the FAA for implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=584.755s">So</a>  this is a very important body that was created by the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=591.962s">to</a>  act on behalf of local cities and towns that may otherwise not have a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=598.326s">And</a>  I can tell you firsthand that in this community, even though we're not direct abutters to Logan Airport like Winthrop and Revere and East Boston, we're experiencing the same, in my opinion, the same air traffic and noise over our community and much more frequent. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=618.863s">Now,</a>  that's not just me saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=620.643s">If</a>  you go onto the Logan Airport Massport site, they have a list of complaints, and it's quite easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=628.825s">It's</a>  a PDF file. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=630.125s">You</a>  click on it, and it lists all the communities, and it does it year by year, the number of complaints filed for each community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=638.447s">And</a>  I took it back to 2014, and there were 81 in 2014 communities that someone from that community <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=648.502s">filed</a>  a complaint with Massport about the noise of the aircraft. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=654.306s">I</a>  found it ironic, Mr. President, that Medford, out of 81 communities, had the fifth highest reported complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=662.231s">Fifth</a>  out of 81. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=663.452s">And</a>  that was in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=665.334s">You</a>  look in 2015, year to date, which is January to December, Medford, out of 84 communities that lodged complaints, Medford had the eighth highest <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=678.072s">complaint</a>  total in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=681.814s">And</a>  then, it only gives year to date for this year, so it was January to September, nine months worth of complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=690.258s">And</a>  Method is out of 77 communities so far that have called and complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=695.78s">Method</a>  has the fourth highest complaint total out of 77 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=702.603s">I</a>  find it, Mr. President, over the last two and a half years, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=707.227s">stunning</a>  these particular numbers that we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=710.709s">And</a>  it validates the calls and emails that I've received over the last several years, and that's why I've brought the issue up time and time again over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=720.275s">So</a>  I, you know, knowing that we don't have a representative on this board, or we have one that doesn't show up to the meetings, I find it disheartening, at the very least, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=735.895s">that</a>  not only the representative that's not showing up, that's one thing, and they're appointed by the mayor, but to have the administration not check to see if someone they're appointing, I know we have very few appointments, but we vet out the person, we ask why does the person wanna get involved, and you don't appoint someone to the community advisory board at Logan Airport if they're interested in making muffins. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=764.496s">That's</a>  not what you appoint them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=766.297s">That's</a>  not the committee they'd be interested in, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=769.838s">So</a>  I'm not quite sure why our representative for many years has failed to attend the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=778.382s">You</a>  could also go online and find out the minutes from each meeting they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=784.845s">So</a>  the first meeting minutes I was able to obtain was September 30th, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=788.966s">This</a>  is in direct concert with <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=793.698s">of</a>  the complaints that I pulled up from 2014 and I'm not going to go through the agenda, but the agendas from 2014 to today all deal with runway reconfiguration, how to do noise abatement, concerns about <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=812.799s">noise,</a>  concern about communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=815.14s">And</a>  it's vital to have a seat at the table so Medford has a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=819.563s">We</a>  can't rely on other communities to say, well, you know what, Medford may have that concern too, or we'll speak on behalf of Medford because they're not represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=830.05s">And</a>  in September 30th, 2014, Marshfield was there, Marblehead, Scituate, Belmont, Arlington, Nahant, Braintree, Milton, Revere, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=840.743s">They</a>  were all present, and many, many more, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=844.066s">But</a>  Medford is nowhere to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=847.208s">The</a>  minutes from January 15, 2015, Watertown, Hull, High Park, Cohasset, Watertown, Somerville, Dorchester, Milton, Marblehead, Belmont, Beverly, no Medford person. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=861.66s">Maybe</a>  they were too busy, Mr. President, to attend that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=865.784s">July</a>  6, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=868.678s">Hull,</a>  Marshfield, Belmont, Scituate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=871.039s">These</a>  are all representatives, Mr. President, from their community that were appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=877.141s">No</a>  method delegate there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=881.343s">And</a>  you can also appoint a delegate too. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=883.684s">You</a>  know, if you're unable to make it, you can appoint a delegate and they list the delegates that show up on behalf of the actual appointment that was unable to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=894.692s">September</a>  10th, 2015, Howell, Winthrop, Belmont, no method again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=901.675s">November</a>  12th, 2015, need I say, no method resident? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=908.078s">I</a>  won't go through the list of other communities that took the time to attend the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=913.3s">January</a>  14th, 2016, different administration, same results, no method resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=922.813s">March</a>  10, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=926.095s">Nowhere</a>  to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=928.256s">I</a>  don't know if the time we didn't have someone who was at the transition when it's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=933.58s">If</a>  you call up Massport and say, do you know when our representative was appointed by the mayor and what term and so forth, they have no information on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=942.565s">They</a>  rely on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=944.667s">And</a>  again, if you go back to the city, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=949.47s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=950.534s">April</a>  13, 2016, The Minutes, no Medford resident again. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=955.858s">But</a>  let me tell you some really important issues being discussed about runway arrivals, noise exposure, historic baseline five-year projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=966.365s">These</a>  are very important issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=969.118s">that</a>  if you don't want to brief us as a council, fine, the mayor appointed you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=973.222s">At</a>  the very least, you should be briefing the mayor on these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=977.465s">At</a>  the very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=979.047s">And</a>  that hasn't happened, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=981.869s">May</a>  12th, 2016, no Medford resident appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=987.154s">July</a>  14th, 2016, again, no Medford appointment on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=993.679s">Nowhere</a>  to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=996.613s">Mr.</a>  President, we've asked time and time again for a meeting with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1002.657s">We've</a>  asked time and time again to have Massport come before us and give us an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1008.722s">Unfortunately,</a>  the appointment, for whatever reason over the last several years, has not attended any of the meetings that they asked to be appointed to this particular community advisory committee and the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1023.374s">has</a>  failed to recognize this, and it's just going on as business as usual. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1028.956s">And</a>  now we received an email today, I think many council members were on it from some very involved citizens that are interested in this issue because it impacts their daily life. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1042.56s">And</a>  we're being told that there's a very important meeting December 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1046.921s">And</a>  these residents went out on their own, sent a letter to the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1052.143s">the</a>  city council and said, please, Madam Mayor, can someone be there on behalf of the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1059.269s">We</a>  realized that the representative that was appointed has yet to attend any meetings or provide any feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1066.615s">Can</a>  someone be there? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1068.437s">And</a>  I still haven't received a response on that, Mr. President, but we need to get a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1075.263s">We've</a>  asked time and time again, this is an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1078.866s">This</a>  is a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1080.507s">in</a>  this community, it's a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1083.97s">And</a>  I take it very serious that when residents call me, whether it's one, two, or a thousand, that I take their concern very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1093.398s">And</a>  I take this very seriously, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1095.981s">So,</a>  you know, I think it was two weeks ago we asked myself and Councilor Longo, asked for a meeting with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1102.486s">I'm</a>  not sure where that stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1103.908s">I</a>  know you probably have a lot on your plate to set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1107.02s">This</a>  needs to happen sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1109.082s">We</a>  need to get an answer about this very important meeting that's taking place regarding two particular runways that have a tremendous impact on the flights over this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1120.411s">And</a>  for us not to have a representative on board at this particular time that can be there on behalf of our city is a disgrace as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1130.679s">And</a>  it needs to be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1133.081s">So</a>  I would ask Mr. President once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1135.235s">that</a>  we have a meeting with the administration, with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1138.696s">I</a>  mean, the mayor vowed when she ran for office that she was gonna be present to be with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1144.499s">She</a>  was gonna be a face that we see. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1146.58s">She</a>  was gonna provide a representative that appears before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1151.582s">Is</a>  the mayor's representative here? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1153.743s">I</a>  can't see the way in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1155.604s">Nope,</a>  no representative from the mayor here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1159.725s">Mr.</a>  President, another broken promise, another broken promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1164.752s">11</a>  months into the year, the mayor's appointment to the council has yet to come to one city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1173.478s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1176.24s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1180.783s">For</a>  a point of information to the councilors, I've spoken in some detail about this matter with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1190.71s">She</a>  and the city solicitor will be <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1193.342s">attending</a>  this week, a meeting with the, uh, federal aviation administration regarding this matter, uh, because, uh, she does, uh, take this very seriously and will, um, uh, be addressing this, uh, with the FAA. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1211.716s">She</a>  is also, uh, spearheaded a collaborative drive with, uh, local municipal leaders in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1220.71s">uh,</a>  to express their concern to the FAA on this very matter, as well as has undertaken, uh, an effort to, uh, uh, build relationships and engage, uh, the congressional, uh, uh, delegation, uh, senators and our state, uh, our representative to the United States Congress, uh, on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1244.722s">Uh,</a>  she shared that with me today in conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1248.255s">And</a>  we'll be attending a meeting on Friday, I believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1254.879s">And</a>  hopefully, they'll be able to report back to us some of the results from that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1261.504s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1263.605s">From</a>  what I've been told, that meeting was canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1266.907s">No?</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1273.171s">The</a>  chair recognizes Vice President Alango-Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1277.268s">Councilor</a>  Marks, the FAA meeting is on Friday in Burlington at 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1281.109s">There</a>  was a more important meeting on Thursday night in Boston at Logan Airport to discuss a vote that's going to be taken to reroute the Milton air traffic through Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1292.293s">That's</a>  been postponed, I believe, until December 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1298.116s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1299.596s">I</a>  just want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1302.787s">to</a>  the table again, I think it's important that we speak about it as much as we can and to educate the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1308.552s">I</a>  know there's a number of residents that have been emailing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1312.855s">Some</a>  are just complaints, and there are actually a few with some residents who are more educated than anybody else in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1321.882s">And</a>  thankfully, they're educating the council through letting us know when meetings are, sending us air flight patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1328.587s">I</a>  mean, you name it, we've received in it, especially the last <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1332.47s">I'd</a>  say really in the last month or two, even though this issue has been the last few years, especially since runway 33 L it's something that is happening in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1345.039s">So</a>  I'm, you know, obviously very concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1347.321s">But</a>  like I said, I think last week of the week, two weeks ago, this is affecting 30,000 Medford residents, if not everybody in Medford, because no matter where you live, you hear it, whether it's right above <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1358.462s">whether</a>  it's right above your home or whether you're at the pivot point or a little bit away from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1364.364s">I</a>  mean, it's happening at all hours of the night and all hours in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1367.886s">I</a>  don't notice it much during the day, but when you, it's hard to get to bed, it wakes you up at night and it's in the morning, it's starting at four or five in the morning from what I hear and the complaints that I'm getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1379.45s">So</a>  I think it's extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1381.43s">And</a>  Councilor Marks is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1383.635s">I</a>  can be correct, stand corrected, but we have two reps from what I've learned over the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1388.557s">One</a>  rep, um, Mr. And Mrs. Miso is the CAC rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1393.198s">And</a>  from what I understand has never attended a meeting like Councilor Marks pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1397.72s">We</a>  also have a rep that this council has requested numerous times of the last nine months to appear before the council to just let us know what has gone on, what communication, even if you haven't attended a meeting, what communication have you had with our state delegation? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1411.338s">to</a>  let us know that something is in the works, that there is a meeting that will be attended, that the mayor is on top of it, and nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1418.302s">We've</a>  received nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1419.683s">And</a>  now we're forced to have triple the amount of air traffic if this vote comes to fruition in December, which is, I believe, the vote is being pushed, and they want to take this vote by December. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1437.267s">tremendously</a>  affect the city of Medford, and it's something that we do need a seat at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1442.65s">I</a>  know I do have confirmation myself as well that the mayor and city solicitor Rumley will be at the Friday meeting, but that December 1st meeting, I'm unaware if anybody will be in attendance, and that is gonna be a far more, they're all important, but of far more importance, because the city of Milton is complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1461.842s">They</a>  have created, whether the residents and the elected officials have created <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1468.337s">such</a>  a base of complaints and obviously have been on the forefront of pushing the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1474.221s">And</a>  from what I understand, they have air traffic about 6,000 feet above. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1479.005s">We're</a>  here in Medford, and I'll thank constituents who have educated me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1483.828s">We're</a>  at 2,500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1485.669s">At</a>  times, it feels like planes are going to land on your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1490.232s">Children,</a>  it's affecting everybody, children, the elderly, and just every single person that lives in a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1497.629s">Some</a>  homes are shaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1499.25s">We</a>  need to get, and I'm glad to hear, I thought we weren't up there with the complaints, but I'm glad to hear tonight that Medford is complaining, and I urge every resident to continue complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1510.695s">And</a>  I know there was a resident here probably a couple months ago who said the complaints are gonna come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1516.418s">And</a>  we obviously, the residents, it's great to hear that the residents are complaining, but we need our administration and we need to get involved and make sure that we're complaining too. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1526.51s">I</a>  do plan on going to the meeting on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1528.591s">I</a>  can let anybody know what time that will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1531.551s">That's</a>  at 10, and I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1533.332s">The</a>  city solicitor is looking into a timeframe to see if it was an ending time for that meeting, because I know a lot of us do have to work as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1540.214s">But</a>  that December 1st meeting, if we can get an update from the mayor, and also while we're talking about it tonight, a request to see if our city solicitor will be at that meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1551.197s">I'm</a>  sure I missed a number of things, and I know we have residents here that maybe want to educate us a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1556.442s">But</a>  what is coming down the line with regards to that vote is substantially going to impact this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1563.145s">And</a>  when you talk about being fourth and highest out of 77, we're going to, once that happens, if we don't start complaining now and getting involved, we're going to be number one and our phones are going to ring off the hook and people are going to be quite upset with regards to the traffic above our neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1591.469s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1592.19s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, part of my work is at Massport all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1595.892s">And</a>  if the people who don't go there on a regular basis like I do, you'll see this construction is always ongoing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1604.699s">And</a>  right now, they're redoing Terminal E to accommodate the largest plane out there, which is the A380, which is a two-story airplane. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1614.126s">And</a>  they're putting in new <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1616.299s">jetways</a>  and everything, and I can only imagine the noise that's going to make when it's coming in and taking off. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1623.081s">I</a>  don't know if they have a flight plan for that, but they are doing construction for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1628.942s">I</a>  know for personal basis, planes land as early as 4.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1633.503s">now,</a>  and they take off as late as 2.30 a.m., and coming in the next couple of years, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1642.14s">We-Massport</a>  anticipates 11 more airlines, mostly European, coming into Boston Airport as part of their business stimulation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1655.122s">So,</a>  again, I don't see the noise getting any better. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1658.923s">Like</a>  I said, I can only imagine the noise that the A380 is going to make when it's taking off and landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1666.324s">Madam</a>  Vice President, do you have the address of where the meeting is on Friday?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1687.781s">No,</a>  that will be in Boston.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1689.202s">Do</a>  you know where that is in Boston?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1711.727s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper to request that the administration consider appointing one of the members of the council as either the representative to the mass port advisory commission or as the alternate delegate to fill in when that person is unable to attend the meetings as amended by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1743.044s">Hi,</a>  my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1744.525s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street and I'm glad that this issue is coming out, but I think what's really important is we don't have the mass support community advisory committee person. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1753.789s">So</a>  when they do meet, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1755.338s">They</a>  ask everyone who's there, I would assume, are you suffering from noise? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1760.124s">And</a>  if no one from Medford raises their hand, then when they give mitigation to others, they'll give punishment to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1767.013s">So</a>  we need to be really on top of this because I've followed this since they changed the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1773.626s">over</a>  two years ago now, and Milton was the first one at the charge that complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1778.39s">Now,</a>  they're very close to the airport, because I hear a lot of complaints from the city that, oh, it's OK, we're in the city, and that's the price of living in the city is airplane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1787.036s">Milton</a>  is closer than we are to the airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1789.018s">Their</a>  lowest plane is 6,000 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1791.38s">Our</a>  lowest plane is 2,500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1794.362s">So</a>  they have already gotten it raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1796.924s">When</a>  the initial findings came out, their planes were supposed to be at 5,000 feet, and they complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1802.372s">and</a>  they were elevated to 6,000 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1804.753s">So</a>  the big question is, how come they can go to 6,000 feet there, but we can't even hit 5,000 here? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1810.714s">So</a>  we really need to start complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1812.774s">And</a>  if nobody wants to go to that meeting on December 1st, I would love to attend that meeting, because my daughter is on daily medication from the plane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1819.496s">Last</a>  night as we laid in bed at 11.30 at night, we got a symphony of planes that lasted for approximately one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1826.577s">We're</a>  tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1827.498s">We</a>  would like the planes to be quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1829.34s">We're</a>  tired of it being our turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1830.721s">We're</a>  tired of the 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1831.843s">wake-up</a>  calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1832.603s">We're</a>  tired of the 60 to 90-second intervals of the low-flying planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1837.548s">And</a>  we need somebody that's going to beat the drum for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1840.271s">And</a>  they need to beat it loudly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1842.553s">I</a>  really encourage somebody to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1843.974s">As</a>  many people as can go, let's send all those people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1846.875s">Let's</a>  try and tell them that, you know, Medford isn't the dumping ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1850.277s">We</a>  are the pivot point for these planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1851.838s">These</a>  planes fly over Medford, they accelerate, and they turn onto other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1856.32s">Where</a>  do they turn? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1857.021s">They</a>  turn to Belmont. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1857.961s">So</a>  Belmont gets a fraction of the planes that fly over Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1861.223s">They</a>  turn to Watertown. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1862.724s">They</a>  turn to all these towns that are going in and complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1865.826s">So</a>  we're getting nine, ten times the amount of planes that they're getting and we're just saying that's all right because this is the price of living in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1873.269s">It's</a>  not the price of living in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1874.89s">I'm</a>  not willing to give you my quality of life because I live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1878.592s">So</a>  somebody needs to stand up for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1881.013s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1896.423s">Luke</a>  Prisner, 140 Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1900.004s">So</a>  I just wanted to get up here and maybe clarify something about these groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1909.666s">So</a>  you've got the Logan CAC, the Massport CAC, and the 33L Working Group. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1916.207s">The</a>  Logan CAC has been around for two decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1919.308s">They</a>  were formed as a result of a courtroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1921.802s">So</a>  in the late, mid-90s, South Boston and other communities put up a stink. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1926.906s">There's</a>  litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1928.527s">And</a>  the Logan CAC was formed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1930.629s">And</a>  their sort of mandate was to carry out noise abatement studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1936.794s">I'll</a>  come back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1938.355s">The</a>  Massport CAC was created as a result of legislation at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1945.28s">And</a>  so they're kind of spinning up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1948.843s">And</a>  they're going to be the persistent entity <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1951.6s">for</a>  years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1954.363s">And</a>  they're going to be the sort of interface between the community and the airport, passports to the airport operator. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1961.971s">And</a>  then the third group is the 33L working group, which was formed this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1968.197s">It</a>  includes officials from neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1973.262s">And</a>  that's the group that's meeting with the FAA, because they weren't getting satisfaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1978.506s">So</a>  they got their state representatives, they got federal representatives to write letters, to write a couple letters, and win an audience with the FAA. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1991.177s">They're</a>  going to be meeting on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=1993.198s">And</a>  what they're going to be talking about are kind of the rough outline of a study that FAA, MIT, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2001.648s">and</a>  Massport are going to conduct together. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2004.789s">And</a>  that study is going to look at what can we do to mitigate the noise created by RNAV. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2011.47s">RNAV</a>  is this navigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2013.15s">It's</a>  the reason why the planes seem so loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2018.791s">So</a>  the Logan CAC, I want to come back to that because they're kind of important in the current near-term period. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2031.109s">The</a>  Logan CAC has been around for two decades, and they're about to dissolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2035.512s">Their</a>  charter is about to run out, and they're going to vanish at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2040.656s">They're</a>  not going to have any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2042.477s">Their</a>  charter's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2044.158s">And</a>  what they're trying to put together are a series of recommendations related to runway use. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2050.943s">And</a>  there's people on that CAC that strongly advocate for their communities, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2056.367s">Medford</a>  doesn't have an advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2058.748s">And</a>  so those folks, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2062.193s">doing</a>  what they need to do, what they feel they need to do for their constituents, are trying to push a runway use plan that is equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2071.099s">And</a>  what that can mean for us is the activation of runway 15 for routine use. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2078.084s">And</a>  what that would result in is maybe a doubling of air traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2083.688s">And</a>  it would be concentrated over Fulton Heights and Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2088.231s">The</a>  rest of Medford wouldn't really see it, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2090.887s">you'd</a>  really feel it in Fulton Heights and Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2093.988s">This</a>  would be in addition to the departure traffic from 33L, which a lot of us feel, with the exception of maybe up by the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2106.274s">So</a>  the Logan CAC is working on this runway use plan, and they want to have a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2112.997s">And</a>  they were going to vote on Thursday, and that meeting is <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2115.734s">been</a>  canceled, it's been pushed to December 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2118.655s">But</a>  that meeting on December 1st is going to be important because they're going to vote on a redistribution of runway use for arrivals. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2128.658s">And</a>  that recommendation is then going to be pushed up to Massport and FAA, and they may take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2134.819s">And</a>  if they take it, then what you're going to see is regular use of runway 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2139.28s">So</a>  that's why that meeting is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2141.881s">The</a>  meeting on Friday is with the 33L working group. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2145.387s">And</a>  my understanding is the mayor and the city solicitor will be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2150.548s">And</a>  I'm very thankful that they're going to be there because Medford needs a seat at the table because they're going to be laying out the plan for how to address the noise problems that we're all complaining about. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2168.231s">So</a>  that's going to be a really important meeting with this third group. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2174.198s">It's</a>  really important, and I really want to thank you all for bringing this up, because it's an important matter for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2180.48s">It</a>  directly affects quality of life, because it's our way of offering feedback to the airport operator. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2190.724s">And</a>  we do need a Massport rep, for sure, the Massport CAC, because moving forward, that's going to be the group that's going to present the feedback to the airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2202.981s">We</a>  need someone present at this Logan CAC meeting to make sure that we're not railroaded with an unequitable runway distribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2213.444s">And</a>  we need someone at this 33L working group meeting to make sure that our concerns are factored in to whatever FAA and MIT and Massport choose to do moving forward with their study. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2228.368s">So</a>  that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2232.262s">make</a>  it clear that the Logan CAC was created as a result of litigation 20 years ago, and their focus is runway use plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2242.308s">Massport</a>  CAC was created as a result of state legislation, and it's going to be the sort of community advocacy group moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2251.113s">And</a>  then we've got this ad hoc group that was put together because the other groups weren't basically meeting the needs of or listening to the concerns of <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2261.152s">or</a>  at least being able to address the concerns of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2264.873s">So</a>  that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2266.793s">Those</a>  are the three groups.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2270.454s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2271.374s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2272.874s">And</a>  I believe last time you were at our meeting a couple months ago, you had mentioned how the amount of complaints does factor in. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2279.716s">Could</a>  you just reiterate what you stated?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2282.596s">Well,</a>  sure, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2284.037s">When</a>  Massport looks at the number of callers, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2290.076s">And</a>  the number of complaints, you know, they, that's their main form of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2296.801s">Those</a>  are the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2297.542s">In</a>  fact, in the letter that was written by Senator Warren, which referenced the letter that our state legislators all signed, saying we've got a problem with noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2309.311s">In</a>  Senator Warren's letter, she referenced the number of complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2314.717s">That's</a>  probably the clearest indication that the complaints are, like, people are looking at them and they mean something. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2323.147s">And</a>  what I'll say is, you know, Milton has by far the most complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2329.371s">They</a>  have a lot of callers and they have a lot of complaints from each caller kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2334.375s">And,</a>  you know, we've got, I think, one of the highest, the fourth highest. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2341.76s">And,</a>  you know, it's important to get complaints from a lot of callers. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2345.743s">That</a>  carries more weight than a thousand, you know, a thousand complaints from one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2349.786s">You</a>  can kind of dismiss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2351.568s">But</a>  one complaint from 1,000 people, you can't ignore. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2355.291s">So</a>  I'll make that judgment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2360.936s">So</a>  the complaints are important, and people do look at them.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2365.48s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes distinguished citizen at the podium.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2376.81s">Oh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2377.887s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, uh, members of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2380.47s">My</a>  name is Paul Camuso, a resident of one 14 Lincoln road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2385.916s">Um,</a>  thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you this evening on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2391.102s">Um,</a>  as we all know, we've seen an increase in air traffic over our community and uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2397.033s">My</a>  personal opinions, being this close to Boston, we're going to see things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2402.495s">That's</a>  what makes us one of the components of making a great community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2406.296s">It's</a>  having the proximity to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2409.377s">But</a>  with that comes the responsibility of our elected officials to advocate on behalf of our residents to make sure that we can do the best that we can as far as mitigating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2421.821s">The</a>  interesting part of this conversation, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2424.978s">Currently,</a>  runway 15 right at Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2428.859s">They're</a>  looking to, as the gentleman said, to possibly divert more of the traffic to 15 right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2435.562s">For</a>  those of you that don't realize it, 15 right is the landing path when it comes over like Winchester, right over the Lawrence Memorial Hospital in the Lawrence Estates, and then over the lower part of the Fulton Heights in Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2450.751s">and</a>  that will certainly increase if, um, if the changes go through, uh, I'd be remissed if I don't thank, um, the mayor as well as the city council for, um, for making sure that we have a seat at the table next week, um, at these very important meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2467.282s">I</a>  think the, uh, the FAA, uh, they're more worried about safety and things of that magnitude rather than noise complaints because at the end of the day, uh, safety is their paramount, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2479.15s">uh,</a>  thoughts and feelings when it comes to, um, these type of decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2483.513s">Um,</a>  I'm learning a lot more about the air traffic patterns and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2486.915s">My</a>  brother is a commercial pilot for a major airline that flies out of Logan airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2491.317s">And,</a>  um, and, uh, like he was explaining to me, certain winds and stuff dictate the runway takes off and takeoffs and landings, uh, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2500.442s">So</a>  it's not just saying we're going to bury Medford with all the noise and give Milton a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2504.624s">It</a>  all depends on some, uh, extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2507.77s">As</a>  someone that does like to fly to go on vacation, I would rather take the safest route out of the airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2516.653s">given</a>  the nature of being in an aircraft. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2519.354s">I</a>  mean, it's common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2521.175s">But</a>  I just wanted to get up here and thank the Mayor, Mayor Burke, as well as the City Council on this particular matter, because I think one of the best things that we have going for us is voices of reason sitting at the table and discussing topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2537.961s">The</a>  other thing I know that should be a priority of people is if we're going to get more air traffic over our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2545.28s">We</a>  should be entitled to more funding to put additional measures in people's homes, similar to Winthrop, similar to East Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2554.627s">So</a>  I know that that's another important piece of the puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2558.269s">And</a>  I just think it's very important that we look at this as a safety issue and as well as an issue of quality of life at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2568.776s">One</a>  should not trump the other, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2571.399s">but</a>  I'm just a one of many citizens in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2574.96s">So</a>  I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this distinguished body this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2579.522s">And</a>  I look forward to seeing how this goes along and the next coming months. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2584.364s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2833.901s">On</a>  the motion for approval, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2836.542s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to amend the paper and ask that we include the school committee in the decision making process, Mr. President, whether the policy making body for issues that are affecting the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2844.766s">I</a>  think that that would be the courteous thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2847.187s">Number</a>  one, number two, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to expand it, not just to the Roberts Elementary School, but to all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2853.09s">Cause</a>  I think if we're going to be looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2855.165s">improvements</a>  to the morning and afternoon drop offs at schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2858.167s">And</a>  each school does have a different in, in, in particular set of issues that they're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2862.268s">But</a>  I think that if we're looking to improve things in the interest of public safety, that we should be doing it across the board, not just that one location, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2868.031s">So</a>  I'd ask that a, in addition to the Rob's elementary school, we do take a look at all of the schools in the community on the motion of council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2879.136s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2881.597s">I</a>  thank council Falco for this recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2884.497s">I'm</a>  there a couple of days a week picking up my grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2887.738s">And</a>  part of the problem is, you know, it needs a little bit of a police presence there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2893.18s">You</a>  know, we can't expect our crossing guards also to be traffic policemen also. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2897.882s">And</a>  that's part of the problem, is they're busy watching the kids, and that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2903.624s">There's</a>  so many cars coming around that they can't direct the traffic and do kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2910.486s">I've</a>  been there when there's been a policeman there, and it's better. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2914.757s">Uh,</a>  but very rarely is there a policeman there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2916.638s">So,</a>  uh, my recommendation, if we could put it, that, um, a police would be there at least for the, the morning hour and the afternoon hour.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2925.725s">If</a>  I can amend that motion on that motion as amended by council Caraviello chair recognizes the citizen at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2934.891s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2935.411s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2938.025s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2939.167s">I</a>  live at 281 Park street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2940.889s">My</a>  daughter attends the Roberts elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2942.632s">I</a>  was part of the first parent group that helped to deal with the drop off patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2949.261s">I</a>  didn't get everything that I wanted, but I did get some of the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2952.025s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2952.592s">I'm</a>  back because I think that some of the places that we went wrong, we should probably include parents in this as well, this meeting, because we're the ones that are dropping off the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2963.86s">I</a>  know a lot of the parents that have to drop off on the street now are concerned that they're not able to go into the loop anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2970.745s">We</a>  do have the sawhorses at either side of the parking lot, but it's big enough that people can go around and people are using it as a cut-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2980.702s">The</a>  kindergartners have to be brought in hand into the school and so that's over 100 parents that are dropping off every morning and picking up every afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2989.53s">So</a>  I'm hopeful that if we do do something we can notify the neighbors because like I said I do live on Park Street and I see my neighbors backing out of their driveways in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2998.179s">and</a>  off until close to 840, the traffic is backed up to the Felsway, and they're not aware that we had a meeting to discuss having the street be one way towards Salem, so they try to duck and play a little Tetris game to get down the street to get to the Felsway because they were not made aware of that pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3016.948s">So</a>  it's really not useful if we're not notifying anyone around. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3020.87s">The</a>  crossing guard will turn her back and someone will take a right down park. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3025.032s">I</a>  do encourage anything that we do not only go to the parents but also to the neighbours. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3028.636s">So</a>  thank you for putting that forward.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3138.879s">Well,</a>  the driver, let me, let me, I guess, be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3141.56s">This,</a>  this is, well, it came up during the community meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3145.571s">And</a>  it's basically as the buses go from one route to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3149.914s">So,</a>  you know, the conclusion of the route, they're flying to get to the next route. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3154.858s">So</a>  there's no one, we don't have students on the bus at that time, but still they should be adhering to this local speed limits that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3163.525s">And</a>  it sounds like they're not, I got a number of complaints about this from residents and it came up at the meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3169.99s">So</a>  I just wanted to have either the police chief or the superintendent of schools reach out to Eastern bus, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3175.021s">and</a>  just to remind their drivers to drive safely at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3179.722s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3266.782s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3268.142s">This</a>  is along the same lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3269.483s">I</a>  got a complaint this week about the MBTA buses unoccupied besides the driver, obviously, especially especially at night after it's gotten dark, just speeding down South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3281.069s">It</a>  goes along with, obviously, the speeding issue we spoke about two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3285.111s">But</a>  if we can just try to work on eliminating speeding wherever we can, if there's any chance we can have the administration send a letter <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3292.549s">to</a>  the MBTA just to reduce speeding, especially obviously on our main roads, but all over the city, if we can just remind the MBTA bus drivers to reduce their speed to the speed limit, that would be extremely helpful.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3308.739s">Thank</a>  you on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3310.14s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3311.121s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3312.542s">Um,</a>  in recent weeks, it's been brought to my attention that some of our neighboring communities have implemented a universal 25 mile per hour speed limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3321.153s">um,</a>  on all city controlled and operated roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3324.014s">And,</a>  um, this may or may not work in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3326.495s">And</a>  I'd like to amend the paper requesting that the traffic commission examined the feasibility of putting in a universal speed limit across, uh, the, the board here in the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3335.477s">Um,</a>  it's my understanding that I believe the city of Somerville has adopted a 25 mile per hour speed limit across the board at all, um, portions of the city, unless otherwise posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3344.78s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3345.965s">I</a>  think that we're facing a significant issue right now with traffic and speeding vehicles and the like, uh, as evident by the last six or seven agendas of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3353.907s">Um,</a>  so with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request the traffic commission to examine the feasibility as to whether or not it would make sense to implement a standard and universal speed limit across the board for all city controlled streets and roadways.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3367.071s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3367.471s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by vice president, longer, the current is amended and seconded by council night chair recognizes <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3375.523s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3376.784s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3377.905s">Um,</a>  I just, uh, had a brief discussion with, uh, Sergeant Hodnett and, uh, discussion and the implementation of that 25 mile an hour speed limit is, is being looked at right now actively in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3391.537s">And</a>  what's interesting is, uh, the state, it seems like the state is pretty, um, pretty aware of our concerns and they're actually looking to abide by our recommendation of dropping <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3403.818s">all</a>  of our streets and roadways in the city of Medford, 25 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3407.56s">So</a>  I know that's something that the city is looking at, but what I really, if you've listened to the tone of our council, especially the last few weeks, the consistent cry is resolutions for, can we have police here? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3425.509s">Can</a>  we have police there? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3426.61s">Can</a>  we have police? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3427.95s">And</a>  what, again, I think we need to revisit the number of policemen we have on the streets right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3433.445s">I</a>  think our biggest concerns that we should be talking about is the lack of offices on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3439.188s">And</a>  with that, again, I'd like to amend the paper asking the chief, if he can, is to give us the numbers of actual offices on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3450.355s">I</a>  know that the number of 104 have been thrown around, but I want to know the actual number of offices on the streets that we have on a weekly basis, because I think that's where <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3461.288s">the</a>  problem falls. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3463.95s">You</a>  know, especially with the Brooks issue coming up, we see them actively there, but we've seen them on Salem Street with issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3472.475s">So</a>  they're out there and they're out there doing the best they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3475.417s">But</a>  talking to some of these police officers, a simple car accident in one side of the city could take two or three cruises off the areas that's needed for up to a half hour to an hour and 45 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3490.378s">I</a>  think it's important that we need to address the bigger concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3493.719s">It's</a>  nice that we're asking the chief to come back and give us all these reports and stuff, but the truth of the matter is I think we as a council have to take more of a proactive approach in getting more policemen on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3508.103s">I</a>  think that would stop a lot of our phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3511.723s">I</a>  mean, one thing we talked about that we've been talking about privately is how many times <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3518.373s">how</a>  many phone calls we've gotten, the biggest issues we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3521.094s">And</a>  one of the biggest issue is, is speeding and traffic issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3526.797s">So</a>  I know that council faculties brought up, uh, you know, a traffic, um, engineer and that sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3532.519s">And,</a>  and, and, and we've done some great things in the Brooks area, the Brooks school area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3538.262s">But</a>  the truth of the matter is to make this work, we need, we need an identified traffic department that's going to have their, you know, the, the, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3546.464s">the</a>  wheels on the ground and working toward making sure that these can get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3550.286s">And</a>  right now, I don't think we have the levels of policing that we need to get that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3554.008s">So,</a>  um, I applaud my fellow Councilors because I think we're all working very hard to make sure that these issues are out and put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3561.633s">But</a>  I think we as a council should really sit with the chief and bring the mayor a true number of, of, of, uh, of police officers on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3571.838s">So</a>  if you can amend that and asking the chief for, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3575.695s">uh,</a>  an updated number of police officers on, on the streets and working directly with the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3581.118s">Uh,</a>  not, not the sector cars that are sitting at a traffic light, but identified traffic offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3586.642s">So</a>  that'd be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3588.282s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3590.544s">Uh,</a>  as amended by council Scarpelli chair recognizes vice president local current.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3594.746s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3595.247s">Uh,</a>  just briefly, um, through the chair, I agree with Councilor Scarpelli and I'm thankful Sergeant Hartnett came to our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3601.604s">At</a>  six o'clock, it was good to have him there to discuss traffic up at the Malden Hospital site and obviously in the Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3610.387s">But</a>  I think concerning is the fact that we as a city only have five officers, and that includes Sergeant Hartnett in our traffic division. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3620.05s">And</a>  that's just truly not enough in a community our size. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3623.951s">I</a>  think it was mentioned, and you could probably correct me, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3628.85s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, Somerville has about 18 in their traffic division. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3632.732s">So</a>  it was good to hear from Sergeant Hartnett, you know, different things that have been going on in the last few weeks, but obviously we need a bigger department. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3640.537s">We</a>  need to, I think we need more than 65 officers and we also need more than five in our traffic division. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3646.441s">Um,</a>  the, the amount of speeding complaints, whether it be at a community meeting or people emailing or giving us, sending us phone calls, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3654.125s">is</a>  speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3654.986s">Speeding</a>  is, I believe somebody just heard tonight, somebody was hitting on Salem Street over the weekend, and obviously we know what happened at the Brooke School, but there's also, you know, other areas that are hot spots, and we have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3667.077s">This</a>  is the probably sixth week in a row that we've spoken about it, and hopefully the mayor hears us loud and clearly, and we can work some numbers and try to hire some more men and women, and specifically put <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3679.384s">one</a>  or two more in the traffic department so that we can curb the speeding because more people are just going to get hurt and it's not safe.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3870.815s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3872.176s">I'm</a>  having grown up on Whitman road, which is the next street up from Essex street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3876.98s">Um,</a>  I've had a lot of experience with this crosswalk and I can appreciate councilor Falco bringing forward a resolution, uh, asking the pedestrian crossing signs be added at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3889.328s">But</a>  quite frankly, Mr. President, that is a very dangerous location. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3892.531s">And</a>  I questioned as to whether or not a crosswalk should be there at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3895.573s">It's</a>  on a blind curve coming down a gradient that's very steep. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3898.989s">So</a>  if you're coming from West Medford square towards the Winthrop street rotary, as you're coming around a blind bend downhill, you're now going to see a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3906.694s">Um,</a>  and I think it's very dangerous location, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3909.975s">And</a>  I'd ask that the traffic commission examine the feasibility of removing the crosswalk as to whether or not that's a good idea before investing any funds into putting up any signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3917.58s">So</a>  I'd like to amend the paper, um, and ask the traffic commission to take a look and see if that crosswalk is actually feasible location for a crosswalk and whether or not there's a safer alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3926.775s">um,</a>  prior to investing in implementing any money, um, to connotate a mark where the crosswalk would be at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3934.96s">On</a>  the motion of councilor Falco as amended by councilor Knight, councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3943.586s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3944.406s">Um,</a>  I, uh, I haven't, I live in that area too. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3948.168s">And</a>  that is, it's a very dangerous crosswalk where the, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3951.459s">whether</a>  you're coming from Method Square, because it's on the blind turn and that's where cars are speeding up to make it up the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3960.102s">I</a>  don't know if a sign is sufficient, if it's not lit or something to make people know. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3966.024s">As</a>  soon as you come out of the roadway, the crosswalk is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3969.605s">And</a>  the same thing coming down, you have people coming down that hill at an accelerated speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3975.367s">And</a>  again, that's from another blind turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3978.248s">So</a>  unless there's a sign up a lot further, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3981.37s">maybe</a>  flashing or something, that sidewalk, I mean that crosswalk is extremely dangerous, especially in the evening, because it's right on the bus stop and people are crossing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3994.779s">That</a>  makes it a little bit more dangerous than other crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3996.78s">So</a>  if that can be taken into consideration too.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4000.763s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Falco, amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4007.087s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4008.227s">I</a>  understand the concern of my fellow colleagues <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4011.222s">but</a>  the bottom line is there's a crosswalk there and it's a safety issue and the sign should go up until it's determined by the traffic commission to take them, to take them down or to eliminate the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4023.109s">We</a>  want to keep our pedestrians safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4025.21s">Putting</a>  up signs is a low cost option and if we don't use them there and they're taken down, I'm sure we can use them at some other crosswalk in the, in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4033.976s">So</a>  I mean in the time being, for the time being it should be about public safety and making sure that the residents of our community is safe crossing the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4041.772s">If</a>  it should come down, I'm fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4043.833s">If</a>  the crosswalk should be eliminated and the traffic commission decides to do that, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4048.795s">But</a>  in the meantime, it's about keeping the residents of our community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4052.417s">So</a>  I, I, uh, I believe the sign should go up as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4061.921s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, we talk about a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4064.302s">We</a>  started this discussion about a traffic engineer in the budget debates, uh, back in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4070.255s">and</a>  the conversation continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4072.336s">And</a>  I think that this is the perfect location where a traffic engineer would come in very handy to take a look at this and examine this feasibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4077.92s">Unfortunately,</a>  we don't have one on staff here at the city.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4166.646s">I</a>  mean, I'd rather have the science go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4170.147s">So</a>  on the B paper that the Traffic Commission re-examined the location of the crosswalk to see if it's at all appropriate to be there in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4184.209s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4186.99s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4188.5s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4191.503s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4193.746s">And</a>  on the main paper offered by Councilor Falco, that pedestrian crossing signs be added in the interest of public safety to the aforementioned crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4202.936s">All</a>  those in favour?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4210.552s">then</a>  I think if you were voting on this, we just have to be clear to the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4214.273s">We'd</a>  like the signs to go up, even though it may take months to move or eliminate the crosswalk because we know.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4500.308s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4502.069s">This</a>  paper came before the Medford city council as outlined in the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4505.57s">Um,</a>  at the time I had several questions relative to why we were asking just for a beer and wine, an expansion of the beer and wine licenses, but not the full liquor licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4515.468s">Um,</a>  I wanted to do a little bit more investigation and I motioned to move the matter to the subcommittee on licensing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4520.231s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4521.332s">Um,</a>  ultimately I picked up the phone and made several phone calls, spoke with the commissioner of the licensing commission as well as, um, our economic development office, a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4531.658s">And,</a>  um, my questions were answered and I was satisfied. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4534.599s">Mr.</a>  President, I wanted to know why we weren't asking for more full liquor licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4537.761s">And</a>  the answer was because there were 32 available full liquor licenses here in the community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4542.164s">Um,</a>  my thinking behind the whole, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4544.587s">my</a>  first referral to subcommittee was that, uh, full liquor licenses seem to be more of a driver in economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4550.591s">And</a>  here we are in the city of Medford and we discuss the economic development of our downtowns rather frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4556.454s">So</a>  I wanted to be sure that if we were going to be sending a homeroom petition to the legislature, asking them to pass legislation, that we took a look at everything that was possible, Mr. President, before bringing the matter to the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4568.601s">Um,</a>  since the time of the motion to refer the matter to the subcommittee, my questions have been answered as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4574.732s">I</a>  spoke with Chairman Caraviello was the chairman of licensing committee and I, um, suggested that I put a paper forward to rescind the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4582.058s">Um,</a>  councilor Caraviello was in support of that matter when I brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4585.401s">Um,</a>  as such, I did some research, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4587.963s">And,</a>  um, if you put on the council agenda with notice to rescind the vote, then a majority vote is required to rescind the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4595.209s">If</a>  there was no notice, then a two thirds vote is required to rescind the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4599.392s">Um,</a>  so I put the paper on the, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4602.46s">agenda</a>  this evening, Mr. President, for us to be notified that the vote for our rescinding, uh, would be taking place this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4609.142s">And</a>  I would ask my colleagues to support rescinding the vote and introducing the matter back to the council floor for approval on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight to rescind first to rescind.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4680.048s">This</a>  was presented to us in council <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4683.601s">uh,</a>  on October 4th, uh, with an introductory letter, uh, dated September 18th, uh, from her honor, the mayor, uh, requesting and recommending that our honor body approve the following home rule petition to be sent to the general court to increase the number of licenses available for the sale of wines and malt beverages in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4706.915s">As</a>  you know, the number of such licenses, licenses, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4711.425s">is</a>  presently limited by chapter two 10 of the acts of 2008 to 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4717.846s">If</a>  this home rule petition is approved by the council and later by the general court, it will increase the available number of these licenses in the city of Medford to 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4733.969s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor to</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4752.832s">You</a>  get the minutes right there.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4754.913s">I</a>  have a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4759.296s">16702</a>  in the hand of the clerk, but on the council's night on the paper, we have Scribner's hour, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4764.139s">It's</a>  a seven Oh seven Oh, we have seven Oh six. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4766.241s">It</a>  should be seven Oh two. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4767.522s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4768.202s">So</a>  on Mr. Clerk, if you would let the agenda record know that it is to be considered a item number 16-seven Oh two that is before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4780.851s">Was</a>  there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4782.777s">Move</a>  approval on the motion for approval by Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4785.539s">Second,</a>  Mr. Knight, seconded by councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4788.781s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4790.102s">This</a>  is for a home rule petition process to be started.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4793.504s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4794.685s">Uh,</a>  I wasn't aware and I'm thankful. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4797.147s">Councilor</a>  Knight brought it up that, did you say there were 34 full liquor licenses available?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4803.251s">One</a>  that are currently available in the city.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4812.839s">And</a>  what was reported to me with beer and wine, there is currently three that is available right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4818.801s">So,</a>  you know, I hope this helps stimulate business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4824.782s">But</a>  knowing the availability that's out there right now, and there's not a waiting list to get a liquor license in the community, I'm not sure how much this is going to help, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4834.345s">I,</a>  you know, would like to see more than just an empty promise regarding the revitalization <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4840.536s">of</a>  our business districts that, uh, has been discussed in this community ad nauseum for the last 20 years, three separate commission reports, uh, to revitalize our downtown business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4855.021s">And</a>  here we are still asking for improved lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4859.242s">It's</a>  pitch dark in the square after, after hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4863.823s">Um,</a>  there is, uh, really, uh, no reason, uh, to come into our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4869.775s">in</a>  my opinion, because there's no attractions, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4874.057s">And</a>  I'm sorry if people get offended when I say that, but that's the way I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4878.26s">And,</a>  you know, we have an office of community development that's staffed with, I believe, three people. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4884.063s">And</a>  in my opinion, they've done very little to nothing to entice businesses into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4892.491s">And</a>  every time I drive through the square, it's a thorn in my side when I look around and I don't see any foot traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4899.233s">I</a>  don't see any business in the square, no matter what the hours is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4904.555s">And</a>  I think we have to do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4907.255s">The</a>  liquor's fine and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4909.356s">And</a>  we've made a lot of headway because for years in this community, you had to have 250 seat restaurant to have a liquor license. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4918.079s">And</a>  that just, in this day and age, people aren't building 250 seat <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4922.38s">restaurants</a>  anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4923.761s">And</a>  so we made some great headway in that fact, but we still haven't made any headway regarding community development, regarding offering incentives for businesses to come into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4935.328s">Our</a>  location, you can't beat our location. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4937.729s">You</a>  can't beat our public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4940.511s">We</a>  have a river that runs through the heart of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4943.493s">We</a>  have so many things going for us, but yet we have for some reason an inability <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4951.748s">to</a>  improve our business districts, not just the square, all our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4957.331s">And</a>  in the square, Mr. President, we have a lot right behind City Hall, city-owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4963.355s">We</a>  have the old Roots parking lot across from the senior center, city-owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4967.637s">We</a>  have three giant parcels of land that are undeveloped in our downtown business district that's owned by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4975.622s">And</a>  still, we can't move this square forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4979.644s">So,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4981.335s">This</a>  is an attempt by the administration to bring additional business into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4987.696s">We</a>  have liquor licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4989.737s">We</a>  have beer and wine licenses that are still available right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4994.377s">I</a>  think we have to do more of a focus on community development, on offering incentives, on maybe improving the square so when businesses come in and say, you know what, geez, this square is dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5005.119s">You</a>  know what, there's no crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5006.8s">You</a>  know what, you take your life in your hand, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5008.52s">when</a>  you cross High Street or Main Street or Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5012.681s">These</a>  are the things I think we have to look at before we can say a few liquor licenses is going to help our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5021.404s">So,</a>  you know, I'm not sold on this as a stimulus at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5027.927s">I'll</a>  support it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5029.448s">But</a>  I think we have to sit down and really, rather than just getting feedback from these committees the mayor set up, you know, Business Economic Committee and Community Committee and Government Relations Committee and Economic Development, all these different committees, and I haven't seen one result from any of these committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5050.088s">They've</a>  done yeoman's work, but I haven't seen any results. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5055.095s">You</a>  know, I'm not sold on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5057.256s">I</a>  will vote for it tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5059.217s">I'd</a>  rather hear more out of the mayor on what we're going to do to be business friendly and attract businesses to our business district, rather than just put together a quick fix on adding more liquor licenses, which <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5073.0s">We</a>  have liquor licenses right now that are available, both beer and wine and full liquor licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5078.984s">So</a>  that's not preventing quality restaurants from coming into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5084.008s">They</a>  can pick one up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5085.089s">What's</a>  preventing them from coming in is the way we do business in this community and the way our business districts look. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5091.713s">Who</a>  wants to open or spend 100 or 200 grand in Medford Square when after six o'clock the sidewalks roll up? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5098.638s">Who's</a>  gonna in their right mind invest in the square? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5103.088s">We</a>  have to invest, Mr. President, we have to invest in the square first and all our business districts because they all need some severe help. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5111.294s">Believe</a>  me. <a

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5406.868s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5408.468s">Since</a>  the speeding on South Street and the heavy trucking was discussed on October 25th, I received additional phone calls from concerned residents who live in and around South Street <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5420.554s">And</a>  this is one recommendation that was put forth, and I think it's a good resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5424.396s">And</a>  it would alleviate the heavy trucking, help alleviate the heavy trucking from South Harvard, Boston Ave, a number of different roadways in South Medford that are getting hit with heavy trucking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5438.943s">I'm</a>  pretty sure right now, Route 16, there's no trucking allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5443.325s">So</a>  if we could change that, I don't see a reason why we couldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5448.347s">Obviously,</a>  we need the help of <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5450.125s">traffic</a>  commission in the state, but if we could have the traffic commission look into this, I think it would alleviate the heavy trucking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5456.409s">I</a>  actually went in a gentleman's home over the last week, and the pitchers, I mean, the heavy trucking is going over the catch basins so heavily that the pitchers are being, you know, obviously crooked on the walls, the inner wall facing South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5473.539s">So</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5474.399s">They</a>  definitely need some resolve in that area, and I think this would help alleviate our main thoroughfares from the trucking.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5485.5s">Um,</a>  yes, Mr. President, it's my understanding that that portion of route 16 is entitled Sleepy Hollow and it's part of what's known as the Emerald Necklace, which is a system of parkways and boulevards, uh, that would go from Medford and reach into all the way to the Jamaica way. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5499.768s">Um,</a>  I believe that it has historic value as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5502.81s">I</a>  think it might've been designed by, uh, Frederick Law Olmsted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5506.552s">Uh,</a>  it was also famous for, I believe if I'm not mistaken, the design of the Boston common and a central park in New York city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5513.207s">So</a>  I think that the control and jurisdiction over Route 16 and that roadway falls under the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and I do believe there's a longstanding trucking ban on that roadway, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5526.531s">You</a>  know, I'm off exploring options. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5529.252s">I'm</a>  off exploring feasible options as to how we can address the heavy trucking on South Street and surrounding streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5537.514s">However,</a>  I don't know if this is <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5540.298s">option</a>  that's going to be available to us based upon the historic nature of, um, the roadway and the history surrounding, um, the allowance of trucking on that roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5551.667s">Uh,</a>  but I guess, Mr. President, you don't get a kiss unless you ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5554.249s">So</a>  it's not going to hurt to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5555.51s">But,</a>  um, I personally am not too, um, optimistic that this is going to be something that's authorized, uh, from the department of conservation and recreation, but move for approval on the motion approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5590.217s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5591.997s">The</a>  good news is that we're doing some street sweeping in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5595.418s">I've</a>  seen the crews out and it looks like they're doing a <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5598.4s">diligent</a>  effort, but I did receive a couple complaints that are going around some cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5604.223s">And</a>  from what I understand, a few people have called the mayor's office to complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5608.585s">And</a>  at this point, there would be no tagging and towing from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5613.387s">And</a>  I just wanted to see if that was truly the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5615.788s">And</a>  if it is, is this going to be just for the fall? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5619.35s">Are</a>  we going to do something different in the spring? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5621.131s">I</a>  just, people are upset that if you do go around a car, obviously you're leaving, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5628.284s">heavy</a>  leaves, now wet leaves that are in our roadways to obviously clog catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5635.549s">And</a>  obviously it's not cleanly in front of certain people's homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5639.771s">So</a>  just want to see if there is a policy in place, what we're doing during the fall street sweeping and what we plan on doing in the spring so that we can educate the residents with regard when we do get a call that why is my street dirty? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5653.019s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5653.66s">And</a>  then we can tell them there must've been cars parked there and the policy this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5658.309s">part</a>  of the administration is that we're not tagging and towing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5660.871s">We're</a>  just going around the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5662.533s">I</a>  think it's just good for the council to know the residents to know, um, because I, most residents want their entire street clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5669.519s">They</a>  want in front of their home cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5671.36s">So</a>  I think it's just important question that we need answered and the residents, um, want the answer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5676.625s">And</a>  hopefully whether that's a policy in the fall, hopefully we do educate the residents, let them know ahead of schedule when the streets sweeping will be in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5687.087s">and</a>  we do what we can to make sure the whole street is swept, whether we have to take it in tow. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5691.309s">Um,</a>  I think that's sometimes a necessary element of, um, street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5697.071s">And</a>  obviously people need fair warning, many different ways to be warned, but it's something that the residents are calling and questioning and they deserve an answer.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5794.967s">For</a>  the last 10 years, this city council has spoken about the lack of consistency <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5801.553s">on</a>  behalf of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5803.833s">In</a>  particular, the Street Sweepin' program. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5807.294s">And</a>  last year, a message was sent out to the residents, we're gonna tag in tow. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5813.115s">This</a>  year, a message is being sent out, we're just gonna tag. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5817.016s">The</a>  lack of consistency, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5819.736s">Also,</a>  if you go on the city website, it says, Street Sweepin' begins November 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5826.277s">The</a>  electronic billboard in the square, Street Sweepin' begins <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5830.755s">November</a>  9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5832.596s">Riverside</a>  Ave, street sweeping begins November 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5837.679s">They</a>  can't even get the two electronic billboards right, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5842.162s">They</a>  can't get the dates right on the electronic billboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5846.865s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5848.947s">We</a>  receive every year <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5851.207s">and</a>  the mayor gets out there and takes a picture, the distinction of Tree City, USA. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5856.512s">We</a>  have a lot of trees in our community, we take care of our trees, and we plant a lot of trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5862.419s">That's</a>  why we get the distinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5864.26s">But</a>  yet the mayor says she doesn't see a need to have cars moved off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5870.106s">Well,</a>  Madam Mayor, come by my house, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5873.28s">And</a>  I'll show you the thousands of leaves in front of my house alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5877.782s">And</a>  I can assure you that that's in front of many people's homes in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5883.145s">And</a>  we do need a full sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5886.207s">Why</a>  have a program where you're going to say, well, if people don't want to move their car, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5892.67s">People</a>  don't want to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5893.891s">That's</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5895.45s">We</a>  need consistency in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5898.992s">And</a>  to only have it done twice a year, and then not to do a full-fledged sweeping, I don't even know what to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5909.977s">Because</a>  those leaves are gonna end up in the catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5913.419s">The</a>  catch basins are gonna clog, and they're gonna cause flooding throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5918.301s">And</a>  then the mayor's gonna say, I'm not sure why our community's flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5923.162s">I</a>  don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5924.225s">We've</a>  been talking about this for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5926.772s">It's</a>  a simple fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5928.477s">They</a>  do it in every other community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5931.495s">You</a>  post signs, permanent signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5935.096s">For</a>  years they used to put them on trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5937.116s">Then</a>  they stopped putting them on trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5938.677s">Then</a>  they'd have the police go by with the blowhorns. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5940.957s">Then</a>  they stopped doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5942.817s">There's</a>  been a lack of consistency every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5945.758s">This</a>  particular street sweeping program changes every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5950.379s">How</a>  do you expect residents to know what's gonna go on? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5953.32s">Because</a>  every year it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5956.808s">Now</a>  I can guarantee you, Mr. President, that we're gonna get the calls like Councilor Caraviello got, saying, you know what, I took the time to take my car off the road that was parked in front of my home to make sure the front of my home got swept, because we only do it twice a year, and then someone else parked in the spot and the sweeping truck went around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5978.065s">Isn't</a>  that a great way of doing business? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5980.927s">And</a>  the mayor knows, she's as cute as Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5985.934s">We</a>  don't want to give people tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5987.897s">They</a>  won't vote for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5989.9s">But</a>  guess what, Madam Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5991.563s">You</a>  have to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5993.266s">And</a>  leadership starts from the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=5996.377s">And</a>  you're gonna take some stances that aren't popular, and maybe having people move their cars off the street for sweet streepin' is not popular, but it's something you have to do in order to run a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6008.219s">They</a>  do it in every other community, and they're successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6011.34s">The</a>  city of Somerville does theirs a dozen times a year, and maybe even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6015.301s">And</a>  they're a highly congested area in the city of Somerville, and they're able to sweep their streets in a systematic way in getting their streets clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6023.983s">The</a>  city of Boston, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6025.263s">But</a>  the city of Medford, who knows what will happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6027.986s">Who</a>  knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6028.846s">Next</a>  year's election year, geez, maybe we won't even ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6032.249s">Maybe</a>  we'll just say the trucks were out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6036.092s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6036.533s">We'll</a>  just say they were out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6037.874s">We</a>  won't even need to gas them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6039.695s">We'll</a>  leave them in the DPW yard, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6043.098s">Every</a>  year, it's the same tune. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6046.381s">What</a>  does it take to put together a program? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6048.881s">I</a>  don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6050.462s">You</a>  set up all these committees, advisory committees, you know, and nothing results. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6057.384s">We</a>  heard about resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6060.185s">All</a>  the chiefs working on that for the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6064.426s">What's</a>  it going to take to get resident citywide permit parking or have it done by zones like they do in other communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6071.989s">This</a>  is not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6074.329s">I</a>  don't know what it's going to take, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6077.228s">I'm</a>  very disappointed again on how this, I got the call tonight, they're gonna come out and they're gonna sweep and they're gonna ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6083.891s">They</a>  didn't say anything about towing, and they're gonna ticket if your car's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6088.133s">That's</a>  what they're gonna do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6091.555s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6093.616s">No,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6094.496s">Councilor</a>  Caffiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6095.497s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6097.198s">Councilor</a>  Mark said we talk about this every year, and the fix is a very simple fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6101.64s">It's</a>  just, if the city doesn't wanna go out and buy some sweepers, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6106.115s">There</a>  are plenty of companies that come in and they do street sweeping on a subcontracting basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6111.476s">So</a>  you can go out and buy a couple of sweepers, but we need to sweep all the time, not two times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6118.257s">That's</a>  not too hard to figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6123.238s">Either</a>  do it in-house or send it out of house. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6128.039s">Once</a>  a month, twice a month, that's how you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6132.94s">Not</a>  rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6136.292s">On</a>  the motion for approval, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6140.338s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6140.558s">Mr.</a>  President, can you have them update the electronic billboard on Riverside Ave?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6144.804s">As</a>  amended by Councilman Monks to update the electronic billboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6148.713s">Uh,</a>  billboard on Riverside Ave to turn it right side up.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6151.435s">Someone</a>  from the city would drive by and see that billboard that's been up for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6155.098s">That's</a>  the wrong date. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6156.779s">All</a>  those in favor of that section of the city.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6158.94s">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6164.084s">16-759</a>  offered by vice president Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6166.525s">Be</a>  it resolved that the administration provide us with an update regarding the expenditures for property, for property, the city council approved, uh, since, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6177.772s">January</a>  1st, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6178.932s">Did</a>  I say that right?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6181.153s">Close</a>  enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6181.973s">Thank</a>  you, President Deller. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6182.913s">So</a>  I just want to table this till next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6185.014s">I</a>  want to thank the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6186.194s">Got</a>  me some information I need. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6187.815s">And</a>  I just want to do a little more research because I'm trying to pull paperwork at my house that I can't find on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6193.056s">So</a>  I'll table this till next week.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6194.737s">On</a>  the motion to table, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6196.837s">All</a>  those against? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6198.898s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6200.138s">16-756</a>  petition by Gene Mark to Cummings Street, Metro Mass to address this council on traffic safety <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6206.273s">on</a>  the roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6208.975s">Good</a>  evening, citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6209.975s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6210.416s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6217.42s">This</a>  city was founded in 1630 and has had an ever-increasing population ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6224.624s">Our</a>  streets and sidewalks cannot accommodate everyone's wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6228.407s">That's</a>  just the way it is. <a

the same lanes with cars, trucks, and buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6240.042s">It</a>  is an accident waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6243.645s">Someone</a>  is going to get injured or killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6246.908s">It's</a>  only a matter of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6248.769s">When</a>  a car hits a truck, the car driver stands a chance of survival. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6253.633s">A</a>  bicyclist does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6256.058s">A</a>  19-year-old Taunton

Thursday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6269.575s">I</a>  do not want to be responsible for someone else's death, and I'm not trying to hit a bicyclist. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6277.458s">It's</a>  just that I have been more aware of bicyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6281.92s">I</a>  look in my rearview mirror more often, and they'll come up on my right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6286.981s">They'll</a>  come up in between the two cars, and it's very, very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6292.723s">And</a>  I'm in a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6293.644s">I</a>  can't even imagine if a bus, if they're coming up along a truck or a bus, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6298.522s">It's</a>  just, it's, and the bus or truck is trying to take a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6302.688s">They</a>  will not see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6303.79s">That</a>  bicyclist moves very, very fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6308.777s">If</a>  you're a bicyclist in Medford from here on out, I'm letting you know that I don't want to hurt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6318.449s">And</a>  we need to do something about this policy. <a

href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6328.998s">But</a>  the thought of hitting somebody on a bike is just frightening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6334.423s">You're</a>  risking the lives of others as well, as I may swerve not to hit you, and I may hit another car or, heaven forbid, a pedestrian. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6343.33s">And</a>  I realize that you do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6345.292s">even</a>  belong on the sidewalk these days either. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6348.354s">And</a>  I talked to somebody that was a proponent of bicycles on the roads so that I could, you know, figure stuff out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6355.677s">And</a>  really, a bike doesn't belong on a sidewalk today either. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6359.119s">And</a>  the reason for that is if you look at Riverside Ave, everybody's turned their front yards into parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6366.902s">And</a>  they have to go in and they have to back out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6369.223s">They</a>  couldn't see a bike if the car was coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6373.485s">There's</a>  only so much room on the roads in Medford, and there's only so much room on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6378.707s">Everybody</a>  wants a tree on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6380.528s">Everybody</a>  wants strollers and wheelchairs on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6383.669s">There</a>  is so much competition for space that it's just, I don't even think they belong on the sidewalks now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6389.531s">I</a>  used to say, oh, just put them on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6391.852s">I</a>  don't think it's safe for bikes on the sidewalks either. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6394.352s">I</a>  just don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6397.575s">And</a>  I realized, okay, so anyway, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6399.616s">And</a>  now, the argument that I hear is that bicyclists actually have a right to be on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6408.56s">Not</a>  really. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6409.6s">Not</a>  on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6410.321s">You</a>  know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6411.461s">I'm</a>  a pedestrian, and I have no right to be walking down the middle of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6416.188s">I</a>  do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6416.849s">I</a>  do not have that permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6418.55s">Do</a>  you know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6419.151s">Because</a>  I'll get hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6423.655s">Unmotorized</a>  vehicles should not be on the road with motorized vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6427.939s">And</a>  I understand that people like their bikes and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6430.142s">But</a>  I know that you guys aren't going to change your policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6433.625s">But</a>  I'm going to feel better when I go home tonight, because this is an issue of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6440.432s">Sure,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6442.831s">I</a>  don't believe it's the City of Medford's policy that authorizes cyclists to ride their cycles on the roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6448.222s">I</a>  believe it's state law that authorizes such. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6451.489s">It's</a>  not our policy.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6452.972s">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6454.185s">Well,</a>  at any rate, they're going to be on the roads, but if I hit you, sorry, I'm telling you right now, I just, I don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6463.527s">You're</a>  endangering the mental well-being of people like me who have the excessive worry that I am going to hit you on a road unable to accommodate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6473.71s">I</a>  know that's strong language, but I just feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6477.911s">Bicyclists,</a>  this is from a lawyer's website, bicyclists have rights to roadways that are similar to other vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6484.833s">By</a>  not properly sharing the road, frustrated motorists who are unfamiliar with rules and regulations can cause serious injuries to bicyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6494.721s">We</a>  can help you recover compensation for damages and injuries incurred in bicycle accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6501.007s">If</a>  you incur an injury such as a head trauma, neck injury, fractures or broken bones, rotocuff injuries, scars or catastrophic injuries, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6511.02s">Take</a>  the necessary steps to protect yourself and build a case for compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6515.362s">Gather</a>  contact information from witnesses and people involved in the accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6519.384s">Take</a>  photos of damages and injuries and avoid making statements regarding the accident until you have contacted an experienced attorney at our firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6530.71s">Then</a>  the real kicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6532.191s">Compensation</a>  that goes beyond immediate medical bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6536.394s">Depending</a>  on the circumstances surrounding your bicycle accident, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6539.569s">The</a>  at-fault party's automobile insurance could cover a large portion of lost wages, medical bills, ambulance fees, bicycle replacement services, and wrongful death claims. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6551.394s">Homeowner's</a>  insurance, this is the kicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6554.776s">Not</a>  only is my car insurance going to go up, because we all are on a group system. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6561.278s">You</a>  have an accident, I pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6563.179s">That's</a>  just the way the insurance <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6565.07s">process</a>  works. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6566.191s">My</a>  homeowner's insurance could also be involved in the accident was caused by negligent behavior on another person's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6575.556s">So</a>  I know that you guys aren't going to change your policy, but the least you can do is make a permit process in the city where somebody that wants to go on the roads has to pass a class, is going to be heavily fined, is going to have to deal with the rules of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6592.708s">I</a>  know you're not going to change the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6594.109s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6594.57s">The</a>  bike people, they're a strong lobby. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6597.426s">I</a>  think it's very, very stupid, dangerous, and especially given the light that our city has so many cars on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6604.97s">We</a>  not only have our own cars to worry about, we got people going through our city to Boston via 16 or Salem Street or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6613.175s">We</a>  have cars, cars, cars, and more cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6615.616s">And</a>  we do have a car problem parked on the Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6618.337s">Go</a>  to Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6619.478s">Every</a>  time I drive up there, there's cars on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6622.56s">Now</a>  they're so bold, they're actually on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6625.618s">And</a>  by the way, I'm not picking on just the bike people. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6628.919s">The</a>  car people, they need to be responsible too because, you know, if they're in the car, if they're on the street and I have to go into the other person oncoming traffics to go around them, you're putting me at danger in that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6642.725s">So</a>  you need to get the cars off the streets, off the sidewalks and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6647.047s">So</a>  it's not just the bike people. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6648.528s">But</a>  it's the bike people that bother me the most because you're not going to win in a fight on the road with a bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6656.023s">You're</a>  taking your life into your own hands, but you're also taking my life into my hands, because I don't want to be in jail for manslaughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6661.124s">I</a>  just don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6663.285s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6664.525s">Thank</a>  you, citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6665.866s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Falco to receive and place on file, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6670.747s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6672.087s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6673.068s">And</a>  I appreciate, Gene, you bringing up the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6676.889s">And</a>  I've had the same conversations with the members of the Bicycle Committee in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6683.971s">And</a>  I think one of the issues is that <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6686.192s">uh,</a>  we as a community, uh, still not, uh, bicycle friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6691.174s">And,</a>  uh, the city has made movement over the last few years in creating some bike lanes, but there's no connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6699.336s">And</a>  for instance, you have the bike lane that starts off on the Winchester line, coming down Winthrop street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6704.738s">It</a>  goes for about 200 yards and stops at Wildwood road. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6708.039s">And</a>  that's the end of the bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6709.76s">Not</a>  sure where that takes you unless you just want to go down 200 yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6713.928s">But</a>  this is an issue, because I think what we do by just appeasing people by saying, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6721.15s">Oh,</a>  you want a bike lane? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6722.15s">We'll</a>  throw a bike lane on Winthrop Street for 200 yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6726.971s">Now</a>  they're going to put one on Boston Ave, a bike lane, under the mayor's new policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6732.472s">And</a>  I think rather than having a full-fledged program that addresses connectivity, not with chastity, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6739.487s">but</a>  enabling our bikers because for the most part, they're looking to get to Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, they're looking to get to other areas and connect with these bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6749.334s">And</a>  we've fallen short of the mark to really move this issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6756.76s">And</a>  I believe, and I appreciate what you're saying, I think we could share our streets, but we have to do it in a safe way. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6762.905s">We</a>  have to make it so it's safe for everyone to be on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6766.187s">Because</a>  if someone opts to use a bicycle and not an automobile or use their feet, they should have every right to gain access to where they have to go and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6775.335s">So</a>  I think it's incumbent upon the city to create lanes that are, first of all, safe, that work for not only drivers but also cyclists to make sure it's safe for both, and make sure there's connectivity, which currently doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6791.869s">And,</a>  you know, this is, you know, I think what we're seeing right now is a movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6796.893s">We're</a>  seeing more people now hop on a bike and get to where they have to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6801.196s">And</a>  I think we as a community have to move forward like they've done in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6806.019s">Although</a>  there's been accidents, you know, the same way I lost a friend on Route 16 about a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6811.323s">He</a>  was struck on his bicycle, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6815.712s">These</a>  are things that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6817.853s">It</a>  happens to pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6819.294s">It</a>  happens motor vehicle fatalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6821.654s">People</a>  get killed all the time in driving vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6824.275s">It's</a>  not a reason to stop us from driving vehicles or a reason to stop walking because pedestrians are getting struck. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6831.558s">It's</a>  a reason to create safer ways for transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6834.839s">And</a>  I think that's what we have to move upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6837.003s">rather</a>  than having the mayor sit back and say, wow, we're bike friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6840.245s">Look</a>  at the lane I created. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6842.025s">Look</a>  what I've done over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6843.406s">I</a>  know the president doesn't drive a bicycle, and it's probably good for business for him if someone does get struck. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6851.33s">But</a>  for the rest of us that want to maintain our safety, this is a very serious issue, and I think we have to do more as a city.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6862.35s">If</a>  I may, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6866.172s">Around</a>  Winthrop Street or something, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6868.994s">If</a>  you're going up Riverside Avenue, you have to be in the lane that the cars are in, and that is my problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6874.298s">And</a>  maybe it'll work out that you have that many rural routes in Medford, but I don't see how that's gonna work. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6879.461s">I</a>  just don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6880.762s">And</a>  I appreciate it, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6882.663s">I</a>  know that they're gonna be doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6884.184s">I</a>  just, I want my voice to be heard that this is very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6888.967s">I</a>  want pedestrians to feel safe crossing the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6891.389s">I</a>  wanna amp up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6892.567s">all</a>  the crosswalks so that pedestrians can cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6896.831s">And</a>  I truly believe that we need the sidewalk system that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6900.654s">And</a>  I believe that, you know, I believe in a priority system. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6904.497s">Wheelchairs</a>  before trees on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6906.739s">That's</a>  just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6907.7s">I</a>  mean, there's a priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6911.203s">And</a>  I think that bikes get to the, if you want to save the environment, then you got to commute with other people to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6919.108s">get</a>  out to take the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6920.228s">We</a>  have other ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6921.369s">Walk.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6922.069s">Walk</a>  to the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6925.37s">The</a>  bike thing on the roads on Riverside Ave, this road is 350, 400 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6931.991s">And</a>  it just cannot accommodate everybody's wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6936.012s">It</a>  just cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6936.912s">The</a>  reason why you can't park on Riverside Ave is because there's not enough room. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6940.693s">There's</a>  two lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6942.374s">At</a>  some point, decisions have to be made where you say we can't do this for someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6948.288s">even</a>  if it's a wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6949.328s">You</a>  might not have the room to go in with a wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6952.15s">I</a>  want to see that, but if there's absolutely no way, then you have to say, well, I'm sorry, we can't do it with a wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6957.432s">So</a>  I thank you so much for listening to my anxiety on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6961.033s">I</a>  appreciate the city for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6963.374s">And</a>  I'm going to be watching out for the bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6965.955s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6966.415s">I</a>  mean, I check my rearview mirror a whole lot more now than I ever did. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6971.451s">But</a>  I just fear that I'm going to take a right, the bike's going to be up there, and I'm going to hit them. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6977.074s">It's</a>  just going to happen, especially at night, the rain, and all the other factors that come into being. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6983.178s">And</a>  I'm all for bike paths in certain areas, like the river and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6987.741s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6988.802s">But</a>  take your car, take your bike with your car to the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6992.524s">That's</a>  my advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=6993.745s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7021.282s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7021.603s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7022.503s">May</a>  or March. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7023.784s">I</a>  think it was May. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7025.705s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7026.566s">I,</a>  uh, it's something I had proposed before and we never heard anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7031.349s">Um,</a>  that intersection at Bustle and Grove is a, is a very, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7038.147s">heavily</a>  traveled by the children going to the playset park. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7041.189s">And</a>  cars, again, just have total disregard. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7045.091s">They</a>  cut off a grove to get down to the playset, and they just go right by there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7051.195s">There's</a>  a crosswalk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7052.096s">It'd</a>  be a lot safer for the children to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7056.218s">So</a>  again, I ask again that a crosswalk be painted right there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7061.622s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7063.663s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7064.404s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7065.542s">Offered</a>  by Council Marks, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for longtime Metro resident Rita Curtin on her recent passing constant.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7074.406s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7075.727s">Uh,</a>  Mrs. Curtin was a staple at, uh, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7078.428s">Rayfields</a>  as a lunch mother for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7082.07s">Um,</a>  she, uh, was a terrific person, mother, grandmother, um, and just a dear friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7089.553s">Uh,</a>  her husband, if anyone recalls, uh, Mickey Curtin who passed away some years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7094.419s">was</a>  the head of forestry in the city for a number of years, and Rita will be very sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7101.782s">Please</a>  stand for a moment of silence.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7118.79s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Marks, it resolved that the parking kiosk be discussed.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7125.047s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7126.448s">I</a>  received a number of complaints regarding the kiosk and the fact that this has been an issue of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7138.117s">This</a>  has been an issue of contention for a number of years now that this council has requested on federal holidays that the kiosk not have the ability to accept money. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7152.281s">And</a>  it happened, I believe, eight months ago, and the company told us at the time they were going to rectify the issue and that they were also — we, as a council, requested that they reimburse anyone that put money in the machine during that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7169.248s">And</a>  on Veterans Day this past Friday, sure enough, the kiosks were accepting money once again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7176.611s">And</a>  business owners were telling customers that were coming up <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7180.724s">that</a>  don't worry about the kiosk, that you don't have to feed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7184.987s">And</a>  people were saying, well, it accepted my money. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7187.568s">Are</a>  you sure you don't have to feed them? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7189.77s">So,</a>  it left people at a real disadvantage on what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7195.273s">So,</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that we receive a response from the parking method on the fact that the kiosks, once again, were accepting money on a federal holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7210.0s">And</a>  once again, that, uh, the, whoever put money in these machines because we have their plate number be reimbursed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7218.502s">Uh,</a>  and I would ask that we get a response immediately from, uh, park method regarding this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7224.744s">Very</a>  good on that motion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7225.764s">All</a>  those in favor of those opposed motion care records of the meeting, November 6, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7230.025s">We'll</a>  pass to counsel Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7232.645s">Mr.</a>  Councilor, how'd you find those records? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7234.486s">Mr.</a>  President, I asked that those records be tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7237.167s">I</a>  actually did not receive a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7239.547s">in</a>  my package.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7241.128s">On</a>  the motion of the Council of Faculty that the approval process be tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7245.05s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7246.211s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7247.412s">Meeting</a>  is adjourned.</p>
