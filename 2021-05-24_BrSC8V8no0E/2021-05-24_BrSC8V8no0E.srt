147
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:31,151

157
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:29,309
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, that there are pre and post assignments.

158
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,472
[SPEAKER_09]: At high school health, it's taught by health teachers.

159
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:36,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it's half a year of health, half a year of physical education.

160
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:47,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Freshman year is introduction to health, sophomore year is healthy decision making, junior year is healthy lifestyles, and senior year is transition to adulthood.

161
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:58,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Rousseau asked whether gender identity was covered in grade six to eight, and Ms.

162
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Perry answered that it was covered briefly in grade six.

163
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:09,485
[SPEAKER_09]: National guidelines on sexuality and gender identity just changed and we're adapting to those.

164
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:17,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Rousseau followed, said that he was concerned it wasn't presented until senior year, but Ms.

165
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Perry assured us that it's also presented during the freshman year.

166
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:24,099
[SPEAKER_09]: We also talked about the right language for consent.

167
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ms.

168
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Perry said that the students are taught appropriate touch guidelines.

169
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:39,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Russo said, do we ever talk about sex in a positive way?

170
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:40,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ms.

171
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Perry said that the age of consent is 16.

172
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,470
[SPEAKER_09]: So we talk about abstinence to adhere to that guideline.

173
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:51,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

174
00:20:51,083 --> 00:21:03,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Graham questions about the Michigan model and spoke about her concern that a consumer product video is used to introduce puberty.

175
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:15,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was quite a bit of discussion about this and seeing the hopos that we could see whether there is a better film or introduction that's out there.

176
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:20,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's sort of on the table to explore.

177
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:29,672
[SPEAKER_09]: In physical education, in each of the grades, really introduction to basic skills and concepts.

178
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:36,977
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that we talked about the most is what's needed.

179
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:41,421
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to hire a middle school health teacher.

180
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,203
[SPEAKER_09]: We need an adaptive PE teacher.

181
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:49,127
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to provide professional development for sex education.

182
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:58,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And we need to provide professional development for adaptive physical education for the entire physical education staff.

183
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:13,582
[SPEAKER_09]: We did talk more about the adaptive PE and asked how we're meeting the needs of all of our students.

184
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:17,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

185
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:28,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Perry said that some students say sub-separate, some go into full class, and we're looking into using something called the flash curriculum.

186
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:30,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

187
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:35,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Graham followed and asked more questions about the Michigan model, and Ms.

188
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Perry assured us that it's a skills-based model.

189
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remembered from our, when we,

190
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:51,539
[SPEAKER_09]: used it when we approved it, there was a great deal of discussion about it at the time.

191
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent said the Michigan model is definitely one of the most respected skills-based models.

192
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:05,645
[SPEAKER_09]: We do need to pay attention to the national standards until DESE updates theirs.

193
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:09,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Girls are hitting puberty at younger ages, especially children of color.

194
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:14,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Research tells us that we need to emphasize healthy eating.

195
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:22,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, it was a good evening, and many of the things that we talked about in terms of needs, we've picked up in our budget discussions.

196
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:23,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

197
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:27,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a- Motion to adjourn?

198
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:28,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve?

199
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:30,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn, seconded by- I can.

200
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

201
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

202
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call, please.

203
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:38,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, member Graham?

204
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:39,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

205
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:41,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

206
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:42,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

207
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:43,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

208
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:43,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

209
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:44,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone?

210
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

211
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:48,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

212
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:48,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

213
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:50,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot?

214
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:51,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

215
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:52,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

216
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:54,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

217
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:56,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

218
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:57,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Minutes are approved.

219
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:00,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have May 5th, 2021 rules

220
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:09,381
[SPEAKER_04]: and equity subcommittee meeting member Ruseau table from May 10th, 2021 policy on harassment table from May 10th, 2021.

221
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:10,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

222
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:11,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you mayor.

223
00:24:12,523 --> 00:24:17,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do the minutes first and then we can do the policy, which we had tabled as well.

224
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:23,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So on May 5th, yes, sorry.

225
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:28,932
[SPEAKER_01]: On May 5th, the rules policy and equity subcommittee met with member Graham and member McLaughlin.

226
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:37,570
[SPEAKER_01]: and we had a number of members of the community joining us, as well as our leadership team.

227
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were reviewing, we had three things on our agenda.

228
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:45,455
[SPEAKER_01]: One was policy BEDH, which is our public participation policy.

229
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:48,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Our current policy is remarkably brief.

230
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:56,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went through line by line the proposed update.

231
00:24:57,343 --> 00:24:58,624
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about how

232
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:07,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of the law and the current policies really don't consider remote participation very well.

233
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:18,120
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about speech and how mute or kicking somebody out of a meeting on Zoom or putting them into a waiting room.

234
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,681
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things are sort of unconsidered at this point in time.

235
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:28,364
[SPEAKER_01]: And they felt very much like suppression, frankly, to many of the members.

236
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:37,580
[SPEAKER_01]: the members of the school committee that were in the meeting, we were very adamant about ensuring people had their three minutes.

237
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,942
[SPEAKER_01]: We did discuss going to two minutes, but we felt strongly that three minutes made more sense.

238
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:53,166
[SPEAKER_01]: We also discussed some language around, let's see, there was a lot of discussion, sorry.

239
00:25:54,563 --> 00:26:09,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So we discussed different language options to put on our actual agendas, because one of the confusions that appear to be very common today is that public participation and community participation are two different things.

240
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:19,456
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that section on our agenda that we occasionally have where somebody does a presentation, and the other one is where people speak on items on the agenda.

241
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:23,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've drafted new language that is quite

242
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:31,133
[SPEAKER_01]: explicit so there's less confusion about which one is which and what the members can and can't do during those times.

243
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,394
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, let's see.

244
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:44,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also compared our own process to the state house when they have subcommittee meetings and other types of hearings.

245
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:50,917
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably won't have anything quite as robust as that without having a whole lot more staff at technology

246
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:53,727
[SPEAKER_01]: in every space.

247
00:26:54,287 --> 00:27:05,853
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did approve an updated policy, but due to community feedback, that will actually be getting re-reviewed on our June 16th at 4.30 p.m.

248
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:07,614
[SPEAKER_01]: subcommittee meeting.

249
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:13,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe it's posted, but the agenda has been created and sent to the superintendent.

250
00:27:13,997 --> 00:27:19,539
[SPEAKER_01]: So that particular policy is not ready for prime time with the school committee.

251
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:20,860
[SPEAKER_01]: The second item

252
00:27:21,627 --> 00:27:26,391
[SPEAKER_01]: addressed was the agenda creation and format for regular meetings.

253
00:27:27,692 --> 00:27:40,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, we have over the last couple of months talked extensively about how to improve the meetings, whether it's making them shorter or getting rid of items that don't need to ever be there, moving things around.

254
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:47,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And it finally became too much to try and incrementally change things we end up.

255
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:50,630
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an entirely new format for our agenda.

256
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:53,877
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not going to startle anybody or anything.

257
00:27:55,118 --> 00:28:05,127
[SPEAKER_01]: So we worked on and made clarifications to the proposed new agenda format, as well as some process for the public on how to get on the agenda.

258
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:18,558
[SPEAKER_01]: We made that robust by adding, putting it right into the policy issues of what if somebody asks the superintendent to put something on the agenda that is not legal.

259
00:28:19,228 --> 00:28:23,251
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, personnel matters are not school committee within school committee authority.

260
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:28,235
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody wants to come and speak on that, the answer is no, that's not legal.

261
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:39,244
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put a whole process in there for how the public can, if they are rejected by the superintendent, what can they do about it?

262
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:45,209
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they get the school committee to be aware of the rejection and actually

263
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:49,940
[SPEAKER_01]: allow us to override the superintendent if we should decide that that's the right thing to do.

264
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:58,785
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was, I think almost completely ready to go, but it dovetailed with some of the public participation policy.

265
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:04,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one will not be coming before the school committee until after the June 16th meeting as well.

266
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:12,493
[SPEAKER_01]: These two policies really are related to each other so much so that we couldn't put them forward yet.

267
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:21,740
[SPEAKER_01]: The other policy is the sexual harassment procedures policy, which is just called harassment, the policy on harassment.

268
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We discussed some boilerplate texts that we received.

269
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:34,345
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all related to the 2020 changes that the former administration made to Title IX.

270
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:39,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to have all of this stuff approved

271
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:44,736
[SPEAKER_01]: to protect us, frankly, as a school system in cases of sexual harassment.

272
00:29:45,656 --> 00:29:56,682
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also didn't want to spend too much time on it because we fully acknowledged that the new administration will be in all likelihood reverting back to the prior Title IX language.

273
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:06,948
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of spending weeks or more, we are just gonna accept the boilerplate language and then

274
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:11,342
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do it all over again, hopefully in September when there's new language.

275
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:12,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the minutes.

276
00:30:13,182 --> 00:30:16,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody wants to motion to approve those?

277
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:19,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve.

278
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:20,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

279
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:27,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member Graham.

280
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:28,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call, please.

281
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:29,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

282
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:32,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

283
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:33,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

284
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:33,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

285
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:35,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

286
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:36,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

287
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

288
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:37,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

289
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

290
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:41,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

291
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:44,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van de Kloof.

292
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

293
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Longo-Khan.

294
00:30:49,351 --> 00:30:50,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven in the affirmative.

295
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:52,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Negative.

296
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:54,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Minutes are approved.

297
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor, shall I just keep going with the policy on harassment?

298
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:00,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.

299
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:01,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

300
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:08,678
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our last meeting, I believe the policy on harassment had not been included in our packets, that's why it was tabled,

301
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So the language is in our packets at this point.

302
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:32,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing I would comment, unless you have questions, of course, on this, is that on the last page, the text that we have in front of us includes sort of three pieces of information that need to be filled in by the superintendent's office prior to it being sent up to the policy service.

303
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:37,696
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just ask that if there could be a motion to approve this

304
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:52,568
[SPEAKER_01]: it be amended to include the proper phone number and address for the high school, middle school and elementary level reporting individuals to report harassment to.

305
00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:03,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve with amendments for the correct phone numbers for reporting at all levels.

373
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:53,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so Mayor, we did receive a letter from Mr. Giglio in regards to the Columbus School.

374
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,232
[SPEAKER_09]: We could take it up

375
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:58,107
[SPEAKER_09]: later in the agenda when we speak?

376
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:00,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you want to hear it now?

377
00:35:01,288 --> 00:35:02,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you think is appropriate.

378
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:11,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think under the Columbus School, we have a resolution under the Columbus School, so we can take it then.

379
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:11,651
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

380
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:15,352
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, if we perhaps did it at the forefront of that, it would be helpful.

381
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:16,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

382
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:17,572
OK.

383
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:17,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor?

384
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:20,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

385
00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:21,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

386
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:38,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to make a motion to send to the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee to draft a policy on how we are supposed, a recommendation for a policy on inclusion of community participation emails in our minutes.

387
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:49,528
[SPEAKER_01]: This appears to be an entirely new thing since COVID began, and I've contacted two other school committees, and minutes do not typically include

388
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:57,465
[SPEAKER_01]: the emails as written, which would be quite a problem if those emails were in fact vulgar.

389
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:02,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to write that up as a resolution for our June 7th meeting?

390
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:05,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I can do that and put it on the agenda.

391
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can do that.

392
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:07,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

393
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

394
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We have number eight, reporter superintendent.

395
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, superintendent's updates and comments.

396
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:16,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Maurice Edward-Vinson.

397
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,584

00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:36,593

400
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:49,221

401
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:56,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So today our seniors, they dressed up as their favorite musician or TV or film star.

402
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomorrow is tie dye day.

403
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:09,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday is where you are going day, meaning wearing a college t-shirt or a t-shirt from the military or future employment.

404
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:18,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday is throwback style day and Friday, the seniors last day of school is senior t-shirt day.

405
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:26,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether students are remote or in school, the class advisors are urging all to participate in this fun week.

[SPEAKER_06]: you must be tested in order to be able to participate in graduation and prom.

410
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:56,983
[SPEAKER_06]: What an exciting time for our class of 2021.

411
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:14,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week, the senior awards took place in person, and last Thursday, it was wonderful to be able to attend the scholarship night in person, where over 115 scholarships were awarded to members of the class of 2021.

412
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:23,990
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the scholarships totaled to nearly $200,000 in scholarship monies.

413
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:36,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I was honored to help present, along with Mayor Lungo-Koehn and Dr. Cushing, the nearly 40 James and Thelma Connors scholarships to our deserving students.

414
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:39,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Each scholarship awarded was in the amount of $3,000.

415
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:54,682
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford Public Schools appreciates all of our alumni, businesses, and community groups who, for so many years, have funded these generous scholarships which help our students pursue their dreams.

[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to send a special thank you to Stacey Shulman, our Director of Counseling and Behavioral Health, and all of our guidance Councilors.

420
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:34,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also pleased to announce some very good news for both our Mustang Girls cross-country team and our Mustang Girls volleyball team.

421
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:40,079
[SPEAKER_06]: both of those teams won the greater Boston league championships.

422
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And so congratulations to both of our teams.

423
00:39:43,902 --> 00:39:50,425

[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations to them.

425
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:57,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanna just thank them for their hard work on those teams.

426
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanna recognize

427
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:09,268
[SPEAKER_06]: that this past week was EMS week, emergency medical services, and the theme was caring for our communities.

428
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:17,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Our local EMS partner is Armstrong Ambulance, who has long been caring for our school community.

429
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:33,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Prior to COVID-19, Armstrong had provided our schools and athletic fields with AEDs, as well as taught our senior classes CPR, first aid, and the proper use of Narcan.

430
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this year, we are so very grateful for their assistance, staffing our COVID testing sites and now staffing the COVID vaccine sites.

431
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:48,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just would like to thank EMS Armstrong Ambulance for their support.

433
00:40:51,044 --> 00:41:04,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I also would like to commend two of our CCSR students, Kayden Colasano and Lily Began, who have chosen to honor teachers in their final CCSR project for the school year.

434
00:41:05,612 --> 00:41:09,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Their Thank a Teacher Week began today and will continue throughout the week.

435
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:22,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Their hope is that all students will take a moment to send a card or even a quick email to thank their teachers for their help and support during this difficult school year.

436
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:36,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Additionally, CCSR is working to refresh all of our little free libraries as a way to ensure that people throughout Medford are able to read

437
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:37,678
[SPEAKER_06]: anytime they want.

438
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:52,521
[SPEAKER_06]: For those interested in making a book donation, bins can be found in the front courtyard of the Columbus Elementary School, the main entrance of the McGlynn Middle School, and in the Andrews Middle School.

439
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:58,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Attention for all of our rising fifth graders.

443

[SPEAKER_06]: So interested students who want to join our award-winning music programs, please email Ms.

444

[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, next Monday is Memorial Day, a day that commemorates the men and women who died while in military service to our country.

446
00:42:40,985 --> 00:42:47,707
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of Memorial Day is to memorialize those veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.

447

451
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:22,040

452
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:33,470
[SPEAKER_06]: At the Medford Public Schools, we wholeheartedly agree and emphasize the importance of reaching out to students and staff alike, especially during the pandemic.

453
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:41,676

454
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:47,161
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford Public Schools realize that it is okay to not be okay.

455
00:43:47,998 --> 00:43:56,922
[SPEAKER_06]: We will continue to work together to offer support and resources to our Mustang community so that everyone can live healthy and fulfilling lives.

456
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:00,824

457
00:44:04,406 --> 00:44:08,347

[SPEAKER_06]: There will be more details of this grant at our next meeting, but I wanted to share the good news with you tonight and thank the Cummings Foundation for their extreme generosity in awarding our CCSR program $350,000.

466
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:23,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was really, really outstanding news.

467
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:29,095
[SPEAKER_06]: My final remarks are going to be, in closing,

468
00:45:29,582 --> 00:45:41,111
[SPEAKER_06]: that tomorrow marks the one year anniversary of the death of Mr. George Floyd, which did lead to protests across the nation around racism.

469
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:50,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna leave you with the words of the late Robert F. Kennedy, who spoke about this in the late 1960s.

470
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:59,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time we turn our heads the other way, when we see the law flouted,

471
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:20,798
[SPEAKER_06]: When we tolerate what we know to be wrong, when we close our eyes and ears to the corrupt because we are too busy or too frightened, when we fail to speak up and speak out, we strike a blow against freedom, decency, and justice.

472
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that his words are fitting for this time

473
00:46:27,632 --> 00:46:34,876
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that in Medford, we are continuing to do good work and just advocating for the rights of all.

575
00:57:11,143 --> 00:57:14,565

576
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:40,753
[SPEAKER_06]: They leave, there is some flexibility with how the funding is used, but it will definitely be used to supplement what the schools are doing.

577
00:57:40,813 --> 00:57:51,001
[SPEAKER_06]: And normally we share, I would say normally it is shared, a shared benefit between the schools.

578
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:53,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is something that,

579
00:57:54,893 --> 00:58:06,496
[SPEAKER_06]: We normally do and the official the official statement which we shared it is shared between both the McGlynn and between both the elementary school.

580
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:08,805
[SPEAKER_06]: and the middle school.

581
00:58:09,645 --> 00:58:17,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And what Pastor Zenzo said is that it's an honor for us to be able to bring a blessing to your school.

582
00:58:17,848 --> 00:58:22,029
[SPEAKER_06]: We are grateful to be part of your team and we support everything you do.

583
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:25,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are committed to touching the families of Medford together.

584
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:30,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, thank you for allowing us the opportunity to be a blessing.

585
00:58:30,732 --> 00:58:31,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And so,

586
00:58:33,658 --> 00:58:48,049
[SPEAKER_06]: That is, it's really open-ended and the schools really get to decide how they will use that funding as supplemental things that are in need.

587
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:50,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

588
00:58:54,494 --> 00:58:56,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more questions or a motion for approval?

589
00:58:58,658 --> 00:59:00,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

590
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:01,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by

591
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,950
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a tie, but.

592
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:07,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau said it way before that earlier.

593
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:08,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so roll call, please.

594
00:59:09,432 --> 00:59:10,012

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

601
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:20,536

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

603
00:59:24,317 --> 00:59:25,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

606
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:30,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

607
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Impact Church.

608
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:33,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion has been approved.

609
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

610
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:49,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, I just wanted to say to member Van der Kloot that some of the monies will be used towards specialized technology enhancements, but we don't have specifically what it is.

611
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:50,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of open-ended.

612
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:56,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to let you know that some of it will go toward technology, but there is some flexibility for the school.

613
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:57,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks.

614
00:59:58,034 --> 00:59:58,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just curious.

615
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:00,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

616
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:07,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five, we have highlights of Brooks Elementary School presentation by Principal Shannon Demos.

617
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:18,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, prior to Miss Deimos, I just want to say as we hear from Miss Deimos and from Dr. K, I am very excited to have the schools just present their highlights.

618
01:00:19,895 --> 01:00:30,638
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes we spend so much time focusing on what's happening with the pandemic that we don't get an opportunity to hear the great things that are just happening in our schools.

619
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:35,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say those few remarks and

620
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:37,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

621
01:00:37,205 --> 01:00:41,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Galussi will be screen sharing with us, but I thank Ms.

622
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:50,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Deimos in advance and the Brooks School team, and I thank Dr. Kaye in advance and the Columbus School team for the presentations that are going to take place today.

623
01:00:51,036 --> 01:00:51,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

624
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:04,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just make sure.

625
01:01:04,986 --> 01:01:05,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

626
01:01:05,146 --> 01:01:06,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Deimos, can you unmute?

627
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:30,142
[SPEAKER_13]: say okay here we go i'm gonna you see it there there you go thank you mayor it wasn't letting me so i apologize for that but good evening um madam mayor and members of the school committee i thank you very much for allowing me in today to share all some highlights of the brooks elementary school this this year um it's definitely been

628
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:35,344
[SPEAKER_13]: a busy year and I'm just excited to share all those highlights with you.

629
01:01:36,904 --> 01:01:41,866
[SPEAKER_13]: As you see with the slides that I shared with you, the first I thought would be important to share would be our mission statement.

630
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:49,469
[SPEAKER_13]: To sum up the mission statement of the Brooks Elementary School, the Brooks focuses on educating the whole child.

631
01:01:49,549 --> 01:01:54,611
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in the forefront of our daily instruction and learning and it drives all of our decision making.

632
01:01:58,069 --> 01:02:03,393
[SPEAKER_14]: This 2020-2021 school year, the teachers and the staff worked tirelessly.

633
01:02:04,374 --> 01:02:08,137
[SPEAKER_14]: They met the social, emotional, and academic needs of all of our students.

634
01:02:09,138 --> 01:02:15,243
[SPEAKER_14]: The key word that I would say for our staff would be flexibility and dedication this year.

635
01:02:16,004 --> 01:02:19,406
[SPEAKER_14]: It was incredible to watch them on a daily basis.

636
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Day in, day out, weekends, they really put

637
01:02:24,313 --> 01:02:26,334
[SPEAKER_14]: the time and effort in and should be commended for that.

638
01:02:26,834 --> 01:02:28,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm proud and humbled to be their leader.

639
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:33,237
[SPEAKER_14]: This year will definitely be one that I never forget as a first year principal.

640
01:02:34,678 --> 01:02:38,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Our custodial and kitchen staff should also be commended for the efforts they've displayed this year.

641
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:41,240
[SPEAKER_14]: They maintained two cafeterias for us this year.

642
01:02:41,661 --> 01:02:49,504
[SPEAKER_14]: We turned the gym into a cafeteria for grades three, four, and five, and our K1 and 2 stayed in the cafeteria as usual.

643
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,785
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, you know, it sounds,

644
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:56,110
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, pretty manageable, but it's a pretty big feat each day.

645
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:58,411
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to say a great big thank you to them.

646
01:02:59,252 --> 01:03:00,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Also a great big thank you to our nurses.

647
01:03:00,832 --> 01:03:10,897
[SPEAKER_14]: They worked night and day COVID tracking over the weekend at nighttime during the testing twice a week, in addition to their daily duties.

648
01:03:12,117 --> 01:03:15,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Our assistant principal Mitzi Galante exceeded expectations in every way.

649
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:16,999
[SPEAKER_14]: And for that, I'm truly grateful.

650
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:21,001
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, a great big thank you to our secretary who kept the office running smoothly

651
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:24,743
[SPEAKER_14]: been a constant contact for our families on a daily basis.

652
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:33,988
[SPEAKER_14]: This year, in order to continue open and frequent communication, I sent out a daily memo that I call a lie from the hive.

653
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:43,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Every morning goes out, gives us the happenings of the day, the absent teachers of the day, who's substituting for those teachers for the day at important upcoming dates.

654
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:46,314
[SPEAKER_14]: just anything that I think we need to share.

655
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:53,357
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes it just even has that happy quote of the day with a smiley face just to get your day started on the right foot.

656
01:03:54,698 --> 01:04:03,002
[SPEAKER_14]: This would be something that really kind of united us because it was sent to in-person and remote members of the community.

657
01:04:03,922 --> 01:04:07,104
[SPEAKER_14]: We implemented grade level materials pickup regularly outside the school.

658
01:04:07,704 --> 01:04:13,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Some teachers even went door to door all year long for students who couldn't come to the school

659
01:04:14,068 --> 01:04:18,910
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that is just, like I said, flexible, dependable, dedicated.

660
01:04:20,391 --> 01:04:30,155
[SPEAKER_14]: We're planning another materials book return for the remote students at the end of the year for their science books and their Chromebooks and things that information will be passed out at a later date.

661
01:04:31,436 --> 01:04:33,256
[SPEAKER_14]: We did our picture day outside this year.

662
01:04:33,277 --> 01:04:34,417
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually kind of neat.

663
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,438
[SPEAKER_14]: We had two tents out the front of the school.

664
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:41,180
[SPEAKER_14]: The remote students and the in-person students both had time slots within that time.

665
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,181
[SPEAKER_14]: We just got word

666
01:04:43,937 --> 01:04:51,721
[SPEAKER_14]: pretty quickly that O'Connor's can come back on Wednesday, the 26th for anyone that has to wants to retake their, their pictures.

667
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:55,803
[SPEAKER_14]: So if anyone out there is listening, I'm going to push that out in the morning as well.

668
01:04:56,003 --> 01:04:58,785
[SPEAKER_14]: We just got a heads up that there'll be back for retake.

669
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:06,248
[SPEAKER_14]: So this was just a quick picture, a couple of pictures I wanted to share with the community.

670
01:05:07,308 --> 01:05:16,210
[SPEAKER_14]: The picture on the left of your screen is our cafeteria that is spaced socially distance for the kiddos that are K1 and 2, that's where they're eating.

671
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:24,752
[SPEAKER_14]: You notice the stage, we put up some cute little decorations just to block all the storage that's back there.

672
01:05:25,892 --> 01:05:29,733
[SPEAKER_14]: The picture on the right is really kind of what I wanted to show you that I think really is,

673
01:05:31,645 --> 01:05:32,325
[SPEAKER_14]: very creative.

674
01:05:32,826 --> 01:05:38,490
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a parent, Johanna Lynch, who was very good and created these fountain covers for us.

675
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:47,516
[SPEAKER_14]: So instead of just putting a trash bag over it and saying, don't use, they have the bees, the Brooks bees, for our motto.

676
01:05:47,596 --> 01:05:50,878
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of them say, be kind, be safe, be responsible.

677
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:55,621
[SPEAKER_14]: They're on every floor, and it just kind of follows through with our theme.

678
01:05:56,442 --> 01:06:00,805
[SPEAKER_14]: In front of the water bubbles, you'll notice that a lot of the way of keeping

679
01:06:02,026 --> 01:06:16,980
[SPEAKER_14]: distance we had those markers on the floor with their feet to show the kiddos where to stand when they're waiting to go in and out of the bathrooms, as well as you can see the yellow stickers on the floor that we had he's down to show which direction we're walking down the hallway.

680
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:25,363
[SPEAKER_14]: These are two example classrooms of the Brooks this year I thought it would be important to just kind of get your eyes on what it looks like in there.

681
01:06:26,384 --> 01:06:40,498
[SPEAKER_14]: We were very creative in our storage, and the way that we had to have things separated and stored this year was unlike any other year not using the lockers for a long time and so we had those white baskets that you'll see beside.

682
01:06:41,399 --> 01:06:47,024
[SPEAKER_14]: The desks, they really worked well to put our backpacks, the student backpacks in, lunchboxes in.

683
01:06:47,064 --> 01:06:49,806
[SPEAKER_14]: It kept it so that nobody was really tripping over each other.

684
01:06:50,586 --> 01:06:54,990
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just was one of those tricks that we found for storage this year.

685
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:59,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Academics this year, we really focused on FOSS.

686
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:05,043
[SPEAKER_14]: The students had an opportunity to get their life science in for the spring.

687
01:07:05,864 --> 01:07:10,568
[SPEAKER_14]: At the moment, we have some living butterflies and crawdads in the building.

688
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:13,611
[SPEAKER_14]: They're definitely interesting to watch.

689
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:15,012
[SPEAKER_14]: The students are very excited.

690
01:07:15,713 --> 01:07:20,537
[SPEAKER_14]: The kindergartners are just waiting to let those butterflies fly in a couple more days.

691
01:07:22,503 --> 01:07:26,147
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers have participated in ECRI and Lexia training.

692
01:07:26,748 --> 01:07:30,111
[SPEAKER_14]: We have several teachers that are joining the math piloting team.

693
01:07:30,712 --> 01:07:33,615
[SPEAKER_14]: We have had training in PD on the culture of bias.

694
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:36,078
[SPEAKER_14]: We've worked on better lessons, Pear Deck.

695
01:07:36,438 --> 01:07:37,779
[SPEAKER_14]: We've done some project-based learning.

696
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:44,328
[SPEAKER_14]: I showed this picture right here just as one of the examples, because it's one of our fourth grade projects that we did.

697
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:53,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And these pictures here, it's a mixture of some of the remote students and the in-person students that we had displayed.

698
01:07:57,074 --> 01:08:04,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Social-emotional really was at the forefront of every day, every lesson this year.

699
01:08:04,938 --> 01:08:12,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Responsive classroom is an initiative that is not new to the Brooks, but we fully implemented with fidelity.

700
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:21,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Zones of regulation, Michigan model, those grade level morning meetings were key to keeping us connected as a community.

701
01:08:22,528 --> 01:08:33,535
[SPEAKER_14]: The grade level morning meeting would be that the students in the remote model and the students in person would all zoom into the same morning meeting.

702
01:08:34,356 --> 01:08:45,404
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers would have the students mixed up into different breakout rooms and they could kind of see their friends that they don't necessarily see all the time because their friend is at home learning remotely and they're in the building.

703
01:08:45,964 --> 01:08:50,708
[SPEAKER_14]: It was something that the students really did look forward to and it was

704
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,882
[SPEAKER_14]: it was welcomed, it went very well.

705
01:08:53,702 --> 01:08:58,664
[SPEAKER_14]: We had grade level and department common planning times around social emotional learning.

706
01:08:59,124 --> 01:09:10,770
[SPEAKER_14]: We had remote common planning times that was separate from the grade level and department because the remote teachers felt as though they had some questions that only each other could really kind of help out with.

707
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:17,893
[SPEAKER_14]: So in addition to our grade level common planning times, I began an implementation of the remote CPT.

708
01:09:18,953 --> 01:09:23,495
[SPEAKER_14]: in order to give them a chance to plan and discuss things together.

709
01:09:24,216 --> 01:09:29,758
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we have our Brooks Bees, be kind, be safe, be responsible.

710
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:34,881
[SPEAKER_14]: When they're caught being good, they get recognized for those Brooks Bees behavior.

711
01:09:35,701 --> 01:09:46,606
[SPEAKER_14]: These really just, they're not a new initiative this year, but it really speaks to the Brooks tradition and social emotional and the culture of our school.

712
01:09:49,388 --> 01:10:03,503
[SPEAKER_14]: These coping skill posters was something that I thought would be important to share with you our guidance staff, along with our nursing staff had put these posters throughout the buildings as visuals for the students, you know, it really

713
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:12,183
[SPEAKER_14]: helped all the kids from kindergarten up when you would be able to see them visually looking and doing their square breathing.

714
01:10:12,683 --> 01:10:17,045
[SPEAKER_14]: You knew that they were looking at those posters as they're walking through the hallways.

715
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:25,969
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they breathe it for four, they hold it for four, they breathe, and they actually, it helps them with their calming down.

716
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:32,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of them prefer the lazy eight, but these were coping skills and visual aids that we had up and around all the floors of the school this year.

717
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,491
[SPEAKER_14]: our school events and culture.

718
01:10:38,393 --> 01:10:40,555
[SPEAKER_14]: This year we had a lot of, we had our spirit days.

719
01:10:40,855 --> 01:10:42,016
[SPEAKER_14]: They connected the community.

720
01:10:42,356 --> 01:10:43,737
[SPEAKER_14]: An example was the PJ day.

721
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:44,218
[SPEAKER_14]: You see Ms.

722
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:48,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Galante and myself donning our best PJs in front of the front wall.

723
01:10:49,942 --> 01:10:52,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And I didn't want to put any student faces on there.

724
01:10:52,304 --> 01:10:55,207
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thought I would show the staff.

725
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:58,249
[SPEAKER_14]: The Brooks PTO has been very generous.

726
01:10:58,309 --> 01:11:01,772
[SPEAKER_14]: They're helpful in planning enrichment and community engagement opportunities.

727
01:11:02,232 --> 01:11:03,954
[SPEAKER_14]: They really did help keep us connected.

728
01:11:04,274 --> 01:11:05,515
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a family trivia night.

729
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:06,596
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really fun.

730
01:11:07,356 --> 01:11:09,357
[SPEAKER_14]: was not on the winning team, but I had a good time.

731
01:11:10,758 --> 01:11:12,839
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a family concert with Alistair Mook.

732
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:19,023
[SPEAKER_14]: We had family yoga night, teacher appreciation lunches and gift cards, virtual book fair, virtual read-a-thon.

733
01:11:19,703 --> 01:11:21,324
[SPEAKER_14]: They really didn't miss a beat this year.

734
01:11:22,164 --> 01:11:26,927
[SPEAKER_14]: We just kind of took what we would do on a regular year and did what we could to make it a virtual way.

735
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:33,060
[SPEAKER_14]: The Brooks School was part of the Great Kindness Challenge.

736
01:11:33,441 --> 01:11:36,103
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a special time for both the students and the staff.

737
01:11:36,743 --> 01:11:43,570
[SPEAKER_14]: These hearts of gratitudes and kind words hung around the windows, in the hallways, in the rooms at home to share.

738
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:49,695
[SPEAKER_14]: And those Google Classroom pages and backgrounds of the remote students really kind of tied into the whole

739
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:55,364
[SPEAKER_14]: mood of the week of the Great Kindness Challenge.

740
01:11:56,845 --> 01:12:07,288
[SPEAKER_14]: This challenge really, truly filled the buckets of many members of our school community, and we received that kindness certified school recognition just a few weeks ago.

741
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:15,225
[SPEAKER_14]: The Winter Olympics, I couldn't go through this without sharing this with you.

742
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:20,474
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't play it here tonight, but you'll have access to it on your screen.

743
01:12:22,477 --> 01:12:23,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Miss Galante and I

744
01:12:24,077 --> 01:12:30,502
[SPEAKER_14]: we went through and we had some minute to win it type activities that we taped each other with.

745
01:12:31,102 --> 01:12:34,885
[SPEAKER_14]: And the students are still talking about it today, even though it was in the winter.

746
01:12:36,446 --> 01:12:40,930
[SPEAKER_14]: They still want my trick on how I won the tissue box game.

747
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:42,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

748
01:12:42,311 --> 01:12:46,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Jen Ellis, a third grade teacher, did a really great job

749
01:12:47,334 --> 01:12:49,635
[SPEAKER_14]: taping this and making this possible.

750
01:12:50,095 --> 01:12:53,217
[SPEAKER_14]: We had the third grade teachers introducing all the events.

751
01:12:53,337 --> 01:12:53,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

752
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:58,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Galussi helped out to start the whole thing out at the beginning.

753
01:12:58,739 --> 01:13:06,482
[SPEAKER_14]: It just really was one of those things where it was a grade level meeting again and we showed this during the morning meeting and then the kids got to talk about it.

754
01:13:11,673 --> 01:13:13,254
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a community outreach day.

755
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:16,257
[SPEAKER_14]: We had some hive helpers volunteer their time.

756
01:13:16,457 --> 01:13:23,363
[SPEAKER_14]: They donated all these supplies, and we created deployment bags for Massachusetts soldiers being deployed overseas.

757
01:13:24,784 --> 01:13:32,911
[SPEAKER_14]: We created 975 bags in total, but we had so many extra supplies left over that one of our teachers, Ms.

758
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:36,314
[SPEAKER_14]: McIsaac, took them home and created even more bags to send along.

759
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:42,843
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was definitely a remarkable feat to see all of that created.

760
01:13:43,123 --> 01:13:49,637
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were actually just mailed out this week to all the different countries that the soldiers were deployed to.

761
01:13:52,816 --> 01:13:58,219
[SPEAKER_14]: We stayed connected through PTO enrichment programs and visual visitors, virtual visitors, sorry.

762
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Terry Cotter came to visit us, Rob Surrett and his hero art.

763
01:14:03,262 --> 01:14:05,883
[SPEAKER_14]: K-2 had Tanglewood Marionettes just on Friday.

764
01:14:06,904 --> 01:14:10,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Curious Creatures is always been a favorite.

765
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:16,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Grades three to five did Walker Between Worlds Storytelling by Leland Faulkner.

766
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:20,231
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had some really big hits with those mystery readers.

767
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:31,966
[SPEAKER_14]: We had the mayor and the superintendent, Dr. Cushing, we had Suzanne Glusi, all come as mystery readers to different classrooms throughout the year.

768
01:14:34,047 --> 01:14:35,448
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna be ending the year strong.

769
01:14:36,049 --> 01:14:40,172
[SPEAKER_14]: The kindergarten meet and greet is Wednesday for all of our incoming kindergarten students.

770
01:14:40,192 --> 01:14:43,914
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna be welcoming them to our hive from two to 245 this Wednesday.

771
01:14:45,699 --> 01:14:51,022
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the moving on ceremony for grade five coming up on June 16th with a rain date of the 17th.

772
01:14:52,002 --> 01:14:55,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Fun day is coming up on the 14th with a rain date of the 15th.

773
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:58,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Kindergarten end of the year celebration is gonna be held in June.

774
01:14:58,586 --> 01:15:01,787
[SPEAKER_14]: We just determined today that that's going to be Wednesday, June 9th.

775
01:15:03,328 --> 01:15:05,429
[SPEAKER_14]: The ice cream socials coming up on June 3rd.

776
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:08,811
[SPEAKER_14]: That is going to be a drive-through event.

777
01:15:09,231 --> 01:15:10,812
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have CB scoops.

778
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,812
[SPEAKER_14]: has provided some pints of ice cream.

779
01:15:14,832 --> 01:15:20,436
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe it's like some jimmies, excuse me, or some candies or something that are going in with that.

780
01:15:21,037 --> 01:15:27,122
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when your family orders it, you get two little pints and some toppings, and it comes bagged up.

781
01:15:27,583 --> 01:15:30,165
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you pull through our loop during your grade level time,

782
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,683
[SPEAKER_14]: your mystery guests will deliver it to your car.

783
01:15:35,584 --> 01:15:40,888
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have some surprise guests all lined up to deliver that drive-through kind of ice cream.

784
01:15:40,908 --> 01:15:48,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we were sad to not be able to have the ice cream social, but with everything being socially distanced and things, we couldn't be scooping ice cream this year.

785
01:15:48,255 --> 01:15:49,216
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had to be creative.

786
01:15:49,736 --> 01:15:51,317
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's going to be a drive-through style.

787
01:15:52,338 --> 01:15:55,941
[SPEAKER_14]: The last day of school, we're going to have a fifth grade clap out on June 18th.

788
01:15:56,742 --> 01:16:05,809
[SPEAKER_14]: The students will line the hallways and outside the steps and clap out our grade five as a good luck in middle school.

789
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:11,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Camp Mustang and the summer readers will be held at the Brooks this August.

790
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're excited to welcome the students and staff back in for that.

791
01:16:18,461 --> 01:16:24,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, School Committee Mayor, Superintendent, Central Administration, and the community for allowing me the opportunity to share this information.

792
01:16:25,142 --> 01:16:28,443
[SPEAKER_14]: It's truly a pleasure to be a member of Mustang Nation.

793
01:16:29,703 --> 01:16:30,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

794
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:33,264
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.

795
01:16:33,304 --> 01:16:34,024
[SPEAKER_14]: I tried to be quick.

796
01:16:34,564 --> 01:16:35,164
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

797
01:16:35,404 --> 01:16:36,165
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was perfect.

798
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:36,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ms.

799
01:16:36,645 --> 01:16:37,005
[SPEAKER_04]: DeMos.

800
01:16:37,085 --> 01:16:40,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Great to hear all the wonderful things happening at the Brooks.

801
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:47,727
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I think we're going to hear about highlights from the Columbus Elementary School from Principal Kathy Kaye.

802
01:16:47,847 --> 01:16:47,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

803
01:16:48,027 --> 01:16:48,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaye.

804
01:16:52,076 --> 01:16:52,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, good evening, everybody.

805
01:16:53,436 --> 01:16:56,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for inviting me to share all the good things that happened at the Columbus.

806
01:16:57,338 --> 01:17:01,099
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Mrs. glues he's going to share my PowerPoint as well.

807
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:02,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct, Suzanne.

808
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, she's shaking her head.

809
01:17:05,361 --> 01:17:08,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I just want to say first thank you so much.

810
01:17:10,413 --> 01:17:12,493
[SPEAKER_12]: for all that you supported us with this year.

811
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:20,595
[SPEAKER_12]: And on my first page, you can see that there's a drawing there, an illustration that a fourth grade student, Nancy Donlin in Ms.

812
01:17:20,635 --> 01:17:26,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Cogbill's class, she created that for me for teacher appreciation that we do a month at the Columbus.

813
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:28,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just was really, really impressed.

814
01:17:28,117 --> 01:17:31,478
[SPEAKER_12]: So I asked her if I could have her permission to put it on the front page of our website.

815
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:33,331
[SPEAKER_12]: highlights from this year.

816
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:44,456
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would be remiss if I didn't say an incredible thank you to my left hand, my right hand, my two feet, my brain when I need it, and that would be Mrs. Nancy Sherman Hudson.

817
01:17:44,516 --> 01:17:49,218
[SPEAKER_12]: She's just been a tremendous support to me and to everybody within the Columbus School community.

818
01:17:50,531 --> 01:18:07,984
[SPEAKER_12]: So at Columbus, everybody from the teachers to the nurses to the custodians and the kitchen staff, crossing guards, everybody who works at Columbus has really been committed to ensuring that our school year is safe both academically

819
01:18:08,865 --> 01:18:10,525
[SPEAKER_12]: and socially, emotionally for the students.

820
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:15,707
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that we do every year, but it just, it took on a bigger, deeper meaning this year.

821
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:23,188
[SPEAKER_12]: And we wanted to make sure that we were trying to do what we could for both of our in-person students and our remote academy learners.

822
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:25,829
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's something we were very dedicated to doing.

823
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:29,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Suzanne, if you can go back for just a second.

824
01:18:31,034 --> 01:18:41,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Our priority was to focus on the whole child, and so that meant, especially in the fall, really having a focus on the child's social emotional needs before we would dive into the academics.

825
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:46,948
[SPEAKER_12]: The academics were important, but if the students weren't ready to learn, it was going to be that much more difficult to do.

826
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:54,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Our teachers and all of our staff really, really stepped up to learn and become familiar with

827
01:18:55,616 --> 01:19:00,801
[SPEAKER_12]: those technological advances that the district provided for us.

828
01:19:01,302 --> 01:19:14,296
[SPEAKER_12]: And on many, many, many, many, many occasions, they reached out on their own and brought things in that they found through their own studies and their own research to bring and help make the social, emotional, and the academic progress of our students more meaningful.

829
01:19:15,058 --> 01:19:24,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'd like to just say thank you to the school committee, central administration, and for supporting us at the Columbus all year long, especially during this very challenging year.

830
01:19:24,732 --> 01:19:25,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

831
01:19:28,835 --> 01:19:33,938
[SPEAKER_12]: So at the Columbus, we decided we were going to put in safety protocols like we've done at every school, I'm sure.

832
01:19:34,338 --> 01:19:41,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can see in one of the pictures, there's some dots we had on the floor with a direction, and then the next stop would have been six feet apart.

833
01:19:41,822 --> 01:19:48,245
[SPEAKER_12]: So the arrow kind of helps now that we're able to have a little bit closer distance in the school, they can step on the arrow and the dots, and now they're three feet apart.

834
01:19:49,446 --> 01:19:51,790
[SPEAKER_12]: In the upper right hand corner, that's Mr. Seery and myself.

835
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:57,018
[SPEAKER_12]: We were geared up to go outside and do loop duty where we're distance six feet apart.

836
01:19:57,038 --> 01:19:57,980
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got our masks on.

837
01:19:58,413 --> 01:20:05,939
[SPEAKER_12]: and our bright little gear that we got from the Safe Schools Program to make sure that when we're outside doing loop duty, we're safe and protected.

838
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:10,683
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can tell you that parents paid much more attention to me this year with that vest on.

839
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:14,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Down below, you can see it's a picture of Mrs. Mastoni's first grade classroom.

840
01:20:15,007 --> 01:20:24,935
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't really see the shields, but because they kind of look like their cars, she decorated the front of their desks to look like a vehicle so that the protective shield was kind of like their windscreen.

841
01:20:26,536 --> 01:20:31,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Each day, the teachers met in a social emotional morning meeting.

842
01:20:31,862 --> 01:20:38,969
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we were doing the hybrid remote model, they would live stream that so that the class could come together as a cohesive unit.

843
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:46,317
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I mentioned before, they always started with some kind of social emotional activity to check in with the students and make sure that they were okay.

844
01:20:50,584 --> 01:20:59,472
[SPEAKER_12]: What you can see on some of the slides that I've provided are some links to certain things that we created at the Columbus, myself, Mrs. Sherman-Hudson, or the teachers.

845
01:20:59,852 --> 01:21:05,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm certainly not going to link on those now, but they're there for you if you have free moment.

846
01:21:06,518 --> 01:21:07,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Who has those these days?

847
01:21:07,919 --> 01:21:10,001
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you just wanted to take a gander, they're there for you.

848
01:21:10,101 --> 01:21:14,364
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we did at the beginning of the year was we, Nancy Sherman-Hudson was instrumental

849
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:25,150
[SPEAKER_12]: as well as Mr. Gliona helping us with some activities in providing structured play for the students that help maintain social distancing when they were outside.

850
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:33,895
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that first link there would be what the document looked like that we shared with the staff so everybody understood what the expectation was when the kids went out at recess.

851
01:21:34,766 --> 01:21:37,509
[SPEAKER_12]: We also provided some behavioral training.

852
01:21:37,569 --> 01:21:45,619
[SPEAKER_12]: So at the Columbus, we've done the positive behaviors interventions and support systems, which is a grassroots program that the teachers have helped create.

853
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:46,660
[SPEAKER_12]: We've done that for years.

854
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:51,707
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we did was we took the pandemic and we adjusted our training.

855
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:59,907
[SPEAKER_12]: So it included the things the kids needed to do in school to keep them safe, responsible, and respectful during this pandemic year.

856
01:22:00,327 --> 01:22:06,853
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we incorporated some of the students and some of the teachers in creating this video for us.

857
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:09,255
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be the second link if you wanted to take a look.

858
01:22:09,656 --> 01:22:16,062
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see what it looked like to be safe, responsible, and respectful in all the different areas of the Columbus Elementary School.

859
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:31,663
[SPEAKER_12]: What we also did on the next slide, we made sure that the teachers were continuing the use of the zones of regulation, the terminology in the language during their well-being, and their daily check-ins.

860
01:22:32,363 --> 01:22:40,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And what one of the teachers, Ashley Sullivan, had created and shared with a group of people was this tremendous online resource for

861
01:22:41,805 --> 01:22:48,729
[SPEAKER_12]: all kinds of social emotional links, books, games, movement breaks, breathing breaks.

862
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,951
[SPEAKER_12]: And so she shared it with her colleagues.

863
01:22:50,991 --> 01:22:56,414
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of the teachers were able to put little emojis that look like themselves in these schools.

864
01:22:56,454 --> 01:23:04,419
[SPEAKER_12]: And the kids could, you know, in this virtual school, and the child could link on a book, they could link on a video, they could listen to a story, they could read a story.

865
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,441
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that was something that was used very, very well for the kids.

866
01:23:08,702 --> 01:23:12,485
[SPEAKER_12]: When they had some downtime or even if the teacher needed them to have a little bit of a break.

867
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:20,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Both Nancy and myself we participated in some Department of Education trainings, one of which was called beyond zoom.

868
01:23:20,572 --> 01:23:21,533
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it taught us.

869
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:35,822
[SPEAKER_12]: activities on how to use Zoom more effective and in a more enjoyable way for the kids but still get some academics and some social emotional learning through this online virtual program.

870
01:23:36,282 --> 01:23:42,965
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the ones that we taught the teachers through this class and the teachers have responded to me that they really enjoyed it was

871
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,066
[SPEAKER_12]: The enter key is lava.

872
01:23:46,546 --> 01:23:48,907
[SPEAKER_12]: So many times the kids would be chatting back and forth.

873
01:23:49,627 --> 01:23:52,188
[SPEAKER_12]: You're trying to teach and you're looking at their chats.

874
01:23:52,228 --> 01:23:53,369
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very difficult to do.

875
01:23:53,489 --> 01:23:59,431
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a really quick way the teachers could say to the kids, all right, boys and girls, what's your favorite flavor ice cream?

876
01:23:59,912 --> 01:24:04,393
[SPEAKER_12]: But remember, if you touch the key before I say, it's lava and you're going to get burnt.

877
01:24:04,854 --> 01:24:08,775
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to wait until I count to three and say, the enter key is lava.

878
01:24:09,355 --> 01:24:10,556
[SPEAKER_12]: They would type in their answer.

879
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:13,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And when the teacher would say that, they would all hit the key at the same time.

880
01:24:13,557 --> 01:24:17,179
[SPEAKER_12]: and the answers would all come up simultaneously, and the teacher could look through those.

881
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:21,081
[SPEAKER_12]: So it kind of stopped some of the chatting back and forth that was sometimes distracting.

882
01:24:21,701 --> 01:24:24,542
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that the teacher said that the kids enjoyed that one.

883
01:24:25,243 --> 01:24:33,867
[SPEAKER_12]: We also talked about using music for breakout rooms and transition times, but asked the kids what their favorite music was, and then that could play in the background.

884
01:24:33,907 --> 01:24:36,068
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a lot of fun for the kids and the teachers.

885
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like Shannon had mentioned, we did hold monthly grade level Zoom meetings with the staff.

886
01:24:42,681 --> 01:24:46,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also had the remote team meet with us separately.

887
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:54,584
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the grade level teams meet as well, because the remote team felt that it was better that they talk with one another to find out what they could do for those remote needs.

888
01:24:55,064 --> 01:24:58,525
[SPEAKER_12]: So we shared anything that we had to share with the teachers.

889
01:24:58,865 --> 01:25:04,807
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also shared concerns, or perhaps maybe said, you know, taught Nancy and I things that we needed to do to work on.

890
01:25:05,187 --> 01:25:06,929
[SPEAKER_12]: to help make it more effective moving forward.

891
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,073
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, of course, we did twice a week COVID testing.

892
01:25:10,634 --> 01:25:14,939
[SPEAKER_12]: And this Zoom class we took, the educators were wonderful.

893
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I included that resource for you if we ever need more ideas on what to do moving forward.

894
01:25:20,606 --> 01:25:22,428
[SPEAKER_12]: They had some really good ideas in that link down below.

895
01:25:26,525 --> 01:25:31,507
[SPEAKER_12]: We continue doing our Conduct and Citizenship, which is monthly, and our WOW Awards, which is weekly.

896
01:25:31,987 --> 01:25:37,708
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for those children who are learning remotely, we either sent them via email or we mailed them to them.

897
01:25:38,089 --> 01:25:40,349
[SPEAKER_12]: So the kids were kind of excited to get this in the mail.

898
01:25:41,289 --> 01:25:48,372
[SPEAKER_12]: What I did at the beginning of the year is I realized that the remote kids, normally what we do is the fifth grade students do our morning announcements.

899
01:25:48,392 --> 01:25:52,513
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would include Pledge of Allegiance, the lunch menu, and a fun fact for the day.

900
01:25:53,313 --> 01:25:56,214
[SPEAKER_12]: And usually our fifth graders do that but they weren't in school.

901
01:25:56,795 --> 01:25:59,336
[SPEAKER_12]: So this year I decided I would create a YouTube account.

902
01:26:00,116 --> 01:26:10,161
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would do those morning messages and just like Mrs. demo said, I would tell the teachers who was absent, I would give them information that they might need that was specific or important to that particular day.

903
01:26:10,781 --> 01:26:13,763
[SPEAKER_12]: And then on Wednesdays I did where in the world is Miss Kay Wednesday.

904
01:26:14,363 --> 01:26:26,872
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to engage the kids in the building, because they weren't in the building, many of them, or at the beginning year, none of them, I showed them places like the cafeteria, the gymnasium, the front office, the library.

905
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,015
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I moved on to some of my travels because I did live overseas for four years.

906
01:26:31,696 --> 01:26:34,758
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I included pictures and clues.

907
01:26:34,878 --> 01:26:36,479
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I asked the students, where am I?

908
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:37,220
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you know,

909
01:26:37,919 --> 01:26:42,960
[SPEAKER_12]: please email me and then it kind of created a dialogue with some of those students in that way.

910
01:26:43,401 --> 01:26:52,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you can see that I combined one of my links, a regular morning with my where in the world is the first one if you wanted to take a look at that.

911
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:58,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it happened to be a pajama day and I put my sleeping eye mask on and pretended like I was just waking up.

912
01:26:58,865 --> 01:27:00,526
[SPEAKER_12]: So the kids enjoyed that I think.

913
01:27:02,066 --> 01:27:05,147
[SPEAKER_12]: I also, this year, I did a weekly communication for the parents.

914
01:27:05,247 --> 01:27:15,892
[SPEAKER_12]: I usually do a monthly newsletter, and I decided that in order to bring the remote academy together with those that are learning in school, it was important to send something on a weekly basis.

915
01:27:16,312 --> 01:27:19,953
[SPEAKER_12]: We also had so many things that were changing on a weekly basis, so to keep everybody updated.

916
01:27:20,414 --> 01:27:28,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what I did was I asked the teachers to share with me a remarkable, either remote or an in-person highlight, and I kept a

917
01:27:29,215 --> 01:27:30,316
[SPEAKER_12]: a Google page for that.

918
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:33,637
[SPEAKER_12]: And then each week I would share one or two with the families with photos.

919
01:27:33,877 --> 01:27:41,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, I had to have permission so that they can see all the wonderful things that the teachers were doing with the students in the classrooms.

920
01:27:42,121 --> 01:27:47,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you could see there's a link to one of my weekly letters and then my monthly letter, but it doesn't have the graphics.

921
01:27:47,103 --> 01:27:51,545
[SPEAKER_12]: It's usually more quite colorful when I send it out in its entirety.

922
01:27:54,266 --> 01:27:55,067
[SPEAKER_12]: We also had

923
01:27:56,684 --> 01:27:57,885
[SPEAKER_12]: The remote fifth graders.

924
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:02,909
[SPEAKER_12]: So now when the fifth grade came back to school, they now do the morning announcements for me in my office.

925
01:28:03,389 --> 01:28:07,392
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought, okay, how can we get the remote kids to feel like they're not missing out on this privilege?

926
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:09,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's always been the fifth grade privilege.

927
01:28:10,134 --> 01:28:19,141
[SPEAKER_12]: So I asked the fifth grade remote teacher, Mrs. Lattarella, if she would poll her students and see if they're interested in doing the morning announcements, video recorded.

928
01:28:19,441 --> 01:28:21,703
[SPEAKER_12]: And several of them, they said they were.

929
01:28:22,303 --> 01:28:28,726
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that little link there, if you were so inclined, you could see one of the fifth grade students doing what I was doing on a daily basis.

930
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:36,249
[SPEAKER_12]: We also engaged in Mindfulness Mondays, which was the brainchild of the nurses, Mrs. Roberto and Mrs. Borriello.

931
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:43,473
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do believe they had some of the Tufts University helping nurses help them with these.

932
01:28:43,873 --> 01:28:46,774
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they would teach a breathing technique and a mindfulness

933
01:28:48,435 --> 01:28:51,118
[SPEAKER_12]: message, Monday, sometimes they were Tuesdays.

934
01:28:51,759 --> 01:29:03,250
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what Mrs. Roberto did was she enlisted the support of some of our EL newcomer students, and then they would read what she would say in English, they would then read it in their native language, so the students would hear it that way as well.

935
01:29:04,932 --> 01:29:08,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Every year we do the conduct and citizenship, and one of the students said to me, well, Ms.

936
01:29:08,395 --> 01:29:10,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Kay, we really need something that's posted in the building.

937
01:29:11,077 --> 01:29:12,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I said, Hank, you're right, we do.

938
01:29:13,459 --> 01:29:24,348
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I did was I took the names that I post to the newspaper, that I post to the blog, that I put on the school website, and I posted them in the building so the kids can see who wins the conduct and citizenship award.

939
01:29:24,948 --> 01:29:31,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I enlisted the help of the afterschool program, and they made those beautiful letters you can see in that picture there where it says conduct and citizenship.

940
01:29:34,347 --> 01:29:35,688
[SPEAKER_12]: brought everyone together, they enjoyed it.

941
01:29:37,028 --> 01:29:45,452
[SPEAKER_12]: We also utilized the wonderful common district planning schedule that thank you, Mrs. Galussi helped us put together and the planning team over the summer.

942
01:29:46,312 --> 01:29:56,956
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really helped create some effective instruction because people, it wasn't guesswork as to who's getting EL and who's getting title one and to teach us who's getting special education.

943
01:29:56,976 --> 01:29:58,137
[SPEAKER_12]: The teachers were able to coordinate

944
01:29:58,917 --> 01:29:59,778
[SPEAKER_12]: much more efficiently.

945
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:02,639
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're going to continue doing that forward.

946
01:30:03,459 --> 01:30:11,723
[SPEAKER_12]: We had some collaborative planning time that the teachers were able to work with once a month with the CPT teams, but also grade level initiatives.

947
01:30:12,523 --> 01:30:17,385
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also use their planning time to effectively meet as needed with their grade levels.

948
01:30:17,425 --> 01:30:20,467
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm proud to say that one grade level, third grade,

949
01:30:20,907 --> 01:30:28,534
[SPEAKER_12]: even mentioned to me that they were meeting on Saturdays to plan collaboratively for their students, both the remote teacher and the in-person teacher.

950
01:30:28,554 --> 01:30:30,055
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's dedication for sure.

951
01:30:31,397 --> 01:30:32,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And all the teachers were dedicated.

952
01:30:33,949 --> 01:30:46,277
[SPEAKER_12]: The staff meetings, we came together once a month virtually, and I have to say that I think a lot of the teachers really liked doing it virtually, because I know several of them have asked me, can we possibly continue doing that once in a while into the future?

953
01:30:46,917 --> 01:30:57,264
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we came together, we shared, we questioned, we spoke about concerns, anything that was specific to education, social emotional needs, or just how the teachers were feeling in general.

954
01:31:00,433 --> 01:31:10,702
[SPEAKER_12]: We also had many of the things that Shannon had already mentioned, training for the teachers, responsive classroom, ECRI, which was both in the spring and the fall, core five and literacy.

955
01:31:11,142 --> 01:31:14,805
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a lot of work on cultural responsiveness and implicit bias at the Columbus.

956
01:31:15,646 --> 01:31:18,128
[SPEAKER_12]: They learned all the technology things that I won't mention.

957
01:31:18,949 --> 01:31:19,429
[SPEAKER_12]: They're there.

958
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:24,054
[SPEAKER_12]: And also we prepared the students for the upcoming Columbus name change.

959
01:31:24,515 --> 01:31:28,880
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had some resources that teachers could use to generate dialogues and conversations with that.

960
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:33,004
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, the ever fun and popular preparing for the remote MCAS.

961
01:31:36,788 --> 01:31:41,231
[SPEAKER_12]: At the Columbus, we did hold our virtual conduct and citizenship award.

962
01:31:41,672 --> 01:31:48,637
[SPEAKER_12]: And so normally we get we take pictures, they eat on the stage with me, they get a ribbon but a lot of that we couldn't do because the pandemic.

963
01:31:49,117 --> 01:31:52,539
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I did was I would have like a virtual email with the students who won.

964
01:31:53,520 --> 01:32:03,403
[SPEAKER_12]: they would then tell me their ideas for what they wanted the spirit day to be and then I would create this colorful little form and the students got to vote on what the spirit day would be in that month.

965
01:32:03,743 --> 01:32:12,266
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can see a picture of one of the little boys who's in pajama day with Abby Harris who's one of our third grade teachers with one of her students dressed up in their pajamas.

966
01:32:13,547 --> 01:32:17,088
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I thought was helpful for the teachers was to create a document where they could

967
01:32:17,668 --> 01:32:21,931
[SPEAKER_12]: generate a worry or a wonder, something they're wondering about or something they're worried about.

968
01:32:22,551 --> 01:32:28,955
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I would answer it in colors so that they could see whosever question was there and what the answer was.

969
01:32:29,035 --> 01:32:31,096
[SPEAKER_12]: And it might be a question someone else hadn't asked.

970
01:32:31,556 --> 01:32:34,478
[SPEAKER_12]: But when the answer is there, they're like, oh, that's really helpful to have.

971
01:32:34,518 --> 01:32:35,519
[SPEAKER_12]: I was wondering that as well.

972
01:32:36,019 --> 01:32:37,840
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that was just ongoing all year long.

973
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:40,922
[SPEAKER_12]: We did hold a virtual literacy night.

974
01:32:41,683 --> 01:32:44,404
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, I missed that other slide.

975
01:32:44,424 --> 01:32:45,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Susan, could you go back for one second?

976
01:32:45,425 --> 01:32:45,725
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

977
01:32:48,185 --> 01:32:49,147
[SPEAKER_12]: virtual literacy night.

978
01:32:49,187 --> 01:32:50,488
[SPEAKER_12]: We did have some presentations.

979
01:32:51,169 --> 01:32:52,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Terry Carter came.

980
01:32:52,551 --> 01:32:56,377
[SPEAKER_12]: We had Len Cabral, which the PTO got for us, who is a Black storyteller.

981
01:32:57,078 --> 01:33:01,203
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'll mention more of the things that they brought to us on another slide.

982
01:33:01,464 --> 01:33:01,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

983
01:33:01,784 --> 01:33:02,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Suzanne.

984
01:33:04,325 --> 01:33:07,047
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we had many pickup days, just like Shannon had mentioned.

985
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:19,937
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, one of the very special things was we did have an anonymous donation and, uh, we had the parents come and pick up for all of the students, every single student at the Columbus got a whiteboard and some markers with erasers.

986
01:33:20,477 --> 01:33:28,443
[SPEAKER_12]: And teachers have said that it really, really helped, um, advance and support the learning they were doing when the, when the students were learning at home.

987
01:33:28,913 --> 01:33:32,818
[SPEAKER_12]: We also had two photograph days at the Columbus, which Mrs. Sherman Hudson organized.

988
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:38,165
[SPEAKER_12]: We had one in the fall where the remote families were invited, but we did one again last week, which was outside.

989
01:33:38,185 --> 01:33:41,870
[SPEAKER_12]: And Shannon already told you how wonderful it was with O'Connor Studios.

990
01:33:42,191 --> 01:33:46,036
[SPEAKER_12]: They set up a really nice tent and the kids were able to have their pictures taken out in front of the school.

991
01:33:49,338 --> 01:34:01,023
[SPEAKER_12]: So at the Columbus, the PTO, which is ever generous and supportive and constantly helping us, really continued to step up from their homes, not being able to come into the buildings.

992
01:34:01,743 --> 01:34:14,728
[SPEAKER_12]: And they provided extra learning supplies for the students with needs, art pads and watercolors for the remote kids so that they could do more exciting art lessons at home and have some materials to do that.

993
01:34:16,225 --> 01:34:19,028
[SPEAKER_12]: They also created stars, which must have taken them forever.

994
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:22,032
[SPEAKER_12]: They cut them out and they were color coded.

995
01:34:22,072 --> 01:34:24,194
[SPEAKER_12]: They put the students name and their grade level.

996
01:34:24,615 --> 01:34:27,458
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they came to the school and decorated our first floor windows.

997
01:34:27,939 --> 01:34:32,124
[SPEAKER_12]: So people who would come by the school could see the names of the students who belonged at the Columbus.

998
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:34,776
[SPEAKER_12]: We had two virtual book fairs.

999
01:34:34,896 --> 01:34:37,456
[SPEAKER_12]: One was with Scholastic and the other one was with Porter Square.

1000
01:34:38,397 --> 01:34:46,620
[SPEAKER_12]: In those book fairs, the PTO was able to fund 220 books for both the teachers and the school library.

1001
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,041
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's an amazing accomplishment and we thank them for that.

1002
01:34:49,941 --> 01:34:53,302
[SPEAKER_12]: We also participated in the Who's Reading Readathon, which the kids enjoy.

1003
01:34:53,322 --> 01:34:56,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year it was virtual as it is every year.

1004
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:58,484
[SPEAKER_12]: So the kids knew how to do it because they've had lots of practice.

1005
01:34:59,535 --> 01:35:01,316
[SPEAKER_12]: We enjoyed some virtual presentations.

1006
01:35:01,877 --> 01:35:04,318
[SPEAKER_12]: We had the Museum of Science came for all grades.

1007
01:35:04,839 --> 01:35:09,062
[SPEAKER_12]: They did Habitat Explorers, Build for Survival, Changing Sky.

1008
01:35:09,922 --> 01:35:11,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Curious Creatures came for kindergarten.

1009
01:35:11,704 --> 01:35:14,485
[SPEAKER_12]: That was an animal exhibition virtually.

1010
01:35:15,426 --> 01:35:18,628
[SPEAKER_12]: The Tufts Traveling Treasure Trunk did an improv for kindergarten.

1011
01:35:19,109 --> 01:35:24,132
[SPEAKER_12]: TheaterWorks did Jacqueline and the Beanstalk and the Jungle Book for grades one and two.

1012
01:35:24,532 --> 01:35:26,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And in third grade, they had Colonial Trades come.

1013
01:35:27,907 --> 01:35:31,688
[SPEAKER_12]: The PTO also offered clubhouse.

1014
01:35:31,728 --> 01:35:34,950
[SPEAKER_12]: We usually do an in-person clubhouse, but because we couldn't, they offered kits.

1015
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:43,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they sent home and oftentimes delivering to their homes, which again, the teachers at the Columbus often delivered supplies to families' homes as well.

1016
01:35:44,653 --> 01:35:51,675
[SPEAKER_12]: But the PTO delivered 80 kits to families in the fall, 90 in the winter, and 60 in the spring.

1017
01:35:52,396 --> 01:35:55,757
[SPEAKER_12]: And what those kits included were things like pearler beads,

1018
01:35:56,697 --> 01:36:06,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Play-Doh, friendship bracelets, decoupage, a window garden, just things that they could do with their hands to really keep them engaged when the day was over.

1019
01:36:07,065 --> 01:36:09,326
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you can see, it was quite successful.

1020
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:11,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Many families were interested.

1021
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:16,091
[SPEAKER_12]: They are providing a magician for us that's going to happen at our mini fun day.

1022
01:36:16,491 --> 01:36:19,674
[SPEAKER_12]: And his name is Robert Clark.

1023
01:36:21,781 --> 01:36:25,123
[SPEAKER_12]: And we had a newspaper, which I wasn't able to get the link.

1024
01:36:26,384 --> 01:36:29,225
[SPEAKER_12]: You see where it says newspaper link there, and I couldn't get it to work.

1025
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:33,268
[SPEAKER_12]: But if anybody on the school committee wants to have a copy of that, I'm more than happy to share it with you.

1026
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:34,708
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really phenomenal.

1027
01:36:34,748 --> 01:36:35,769
[SPEAKER_12]: The kids did a great job.

1028
01:36:36,309 --> 01:36:37,750
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also had a dog tag.

1029
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:39,811
[SPEAKER_12]: The PTO purchased the dog tags.

1030
01:36:39,831 --> 01:36:41,132
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a little computer on the front.

1031
01:36:41,632 --> 01:36:43,753
[SPEAKER_12]: The kids drew a picture and their name on it on the back.

1032
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:46,795
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they came outside and hung them on the Columbus garden fence.

1033
01:36:47,235 --> 01:36:48,136
[SPEAKER_12]: And they had a lot of fun doing it.

1034
01:36:48,216 --> 01:36:49,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Windy, but they had a lot of fun.

1035
01:36:51,406 --> 01:36:59,752
[SPEAKER_12]: closing out the school year for 2021 we're also going to have a kindergarten event where the families are invited Wednesday the 26th with a rain date of June 9.

1036
01:37:00,913 --> 01:37:07,419
[SPEAKER_12]: So our kindergarten teachers will welcome our new our newest incoming students our kindergarten present kindergarten.

1037
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:13,940
[SPEAKER_12]: They will be doing a virtual kindergarten celebration for the end of the year, which they usually do every year.

1038
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:23,408
[SPEAKER_12]: We are going to have a homeroom specific fifth grade move up ceremony, and it will be virtual for those students who are involved in the remote academy.

1039
01:37:24,068 --> 01:37:29,793
[SPEAKER_12]: If in fact 100% of the remote families feel that they're not comfortable having their children come to school.

1040
01:37:30,493 --> 01:37:38,796
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what will happen is we will have a fifth grade celebratory pizza luncheon on their move-up day, which is June 11th, tentatively.

1041
01:37:40,097 --> 01:37:44,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I have an end-of-year slideshow that has photographs of the students from kindergarten forward.

1042
01:37:44,638 --> 01:37:49,680
[SPEAKER_12]: So they'll get to watch that in the cafeteria, six feet apart, while they eat their pizza.

1043
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:58,490
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have a mini fun day planned for June 17th and there is no rain date because there's no more time after that.

1044
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:01,812
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where the kids will go outside for a 45 minute block.

1045
01:38:02,113 --> 01:38:05,295
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll run around with games that Mr. Glyoner is going to prepare for us.

1046
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Two grade levels at a time, very spread out on the field.

1047
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:14,723
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're hoping that some of our remote families will feel comfortable to join us on that day.

1048
01:38:14,803 --> 01:38:16,625
[SPEAKER_12]: But if not, there are remote activities.

1049
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:21,969
[SPEAKER_12]: So the students can engage asynchronously if that's more comfortable for the families.

1050
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:28,094
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when they come back into the building, there will be a virtual magician presentation that the PTO has funded.

1051
01:38:28,795 --> 01:38:32,297
[SPEAKER_12]: As Shannon said, we're also going to have the Camp Mustang and Reader's Camp.

1052
01:38:32,898 --> 01:38:35,480
[SPEAKER_12]: And summer fun is also going to be at the Columbus this year.

1053
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:43,423
[SPEAKER_12]: We are going to plan kindergarten play dates and the PTO at the Columbus usually does play dates for separate grade levels as well.

1054
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:46,764
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of the summer will be planning for 2021.

1055
01:38:50,905 --> 01:38:56,347
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just like to show you a picture of many of the staff members at the Columbus in unmasked times.

1056
01:38:56,908 --> 01:38:57,608
[SPEAKER_12]: We got together to

1057
01:38:59,939 --> 01:39:02,601
[SPEAKER_12]: honor, I would say, Noel Lattarello's little boy, Owen.

1058
01:39:02,901 --> 01:39:07,265
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's just a really nice poster that the PTO had created for the Columbus School.

1059
01:39:07,745 --> 01:39:18,113
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to say thank you to my staff, all the teachers, everybody who works at the Columbus, to Dr. Edouard-Vincent and her wonderful team, and to the school committee as well.

1060
01:39:18,153 --> 01:39:19,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for your help this year.

1061
01:39:28,681 --> 01:39:29,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Great presentation.

1062
01:39:30,446 --> 01:39:30,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor?

1063
01:39:31,706 --> 01:39:32,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Vendaclu?

1064
01:39:32,686 --> 01:39:37,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'd just like to thank both of our principals as well as those who presented last week.

1065
01:39:37,887 --> 01:39:40,168
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so great to see some of the creativity.

1066
01:39:40,948 --> 01:39:48,670
[SPEAKER_09]: The desks that look like cars with the shields just absolutely just got it for me.

1067
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:50,470
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you so much.

1068
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:54,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there were so many different ideas and creative thinking in those.

1069
01:39:55,751 --> 01:40:03,514
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when we're talking sometimes about the issues, it's hard to, you know, understand exactly what's happening in the classroom.

1070
01:40:03,534 --> 01:40:05,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you see that and it's just knocks your socks off.

1071
01:40:05,855 --> 01:40:12,557
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you so much to both of you and to all of our principals who've worked so hard this year and to our entire staff.

1072
01:40:14,218 --> 01:40:14,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1073
01:40:14,638 --> 01:40:14,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Kay?

1074
01:40:15,619 --> 01:40:22,902
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may, I just want to say one more thing, and I'm sure I speak for Shannon and my other elementary principals as well when I say this, that what we presented is just tip of the iceberg.

1075
01:40:23,422 --> 01:40:25,263
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, those are the things that kind of came to the fore.

1076
01:40:25,303 --> 01:40:39,750
[SPEAKER_12]: There was so much that went on all year long that if I missed out on something or missed out on people in my school who did wonderful things, and I'm sure Shannon feels the same way, I truly apologize because everyone really stepped above and beyond tremendously this year.

1077
01:40:41,211 --> 01:40:41,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

1078
01:40:45,314 --> 01:40:45,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1079
01:40:46,815 --> 01:40:51,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we have Mr. David Murphy, David Murphy, update on fiscal year 22 budget.

1080
01:40:51,799 --> 01:40:52,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Murphy.

1081
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:53,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor.

1082
01:40:53,860 --> 01:41:04,988
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough to follow up Principal Deimos and Dr. K with, as Mayor Vandekluz said, some of the real concrete examples of the good work that's taking place.

1083
01:41:05,168 --> 01:41:13,254
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will very briefly return us to the world of the abstract and numbers to go over

1084
01:41:13,839 --> 01:41:15,860
[SPEAKER_00]: and update for the FY 22 budget.

1085
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:28,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the committee knows, we have recently completed five separate committee of the whole meetings of the school committee discussing the development of the FY 22 budget.

1086
01:41:29,123 --> 01:41:36,645
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes on the heels of several budget updates that you've received since February and talking about all the various funding streams.

1087
01:41:37,465 --> 01:41:42,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the budget presentations, the first several slides are ones that you've seen before many, many times.

1088
01:41:42,587 --> 01:41:43,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go

1089
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:49,845
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly through them to get to the summary portion coming out of the committee of the whole meetings.

1090
01:41:50,626 --> 01:41:51,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll take your questions.

1091
01:41:51,767 --> 01:41:58,652
[SPEAKER_00]: But this budget update is really just a precursor to the school committee's statutorily required budget hearing.

1092
01:41:58,692 --> 01:42:05,718
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen with the slide that we used to represent the sequence of the budget process.

1093
01:42:06,199 --> 01:42:07,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is where we are right now.

1094
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:12,104
[SPEAKER_00]: But after next week, the request will be made to the municipal government.

1095
01:42:13,078 --> 01:42:30,826
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've said on several occasions during the Committee of the Whole meetings, while the administration was tasked with developing a list of budgetary priorities encompassing the entire district, we are also planning for all necessary contingencies with regard to operating the district.

1096
01:42:30,866 --> 01:42:42,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes when we talk in terms of listing our priorities and saying that this is what we need, I think the priorities that you were presented with throughout those meetings the last several weeks

1097
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:43,850
[SPEAKER_00]: are very authentic.

1098
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:52,753
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming based on a consensus with department heads and principals, and they truly do represent the work that we're trying to do and the associated costs.

1099
01:42:53,173 --> 01:43:06,357
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we understand that we are not the only constituent component of the city of Medford, and we understand that whatever the appropriation is made, we have a responsibility to operate the district and do so effectively.

1100
01:43:06,737 --> 01:43:09,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, as you've heard me say several times, we will be prepared to do that.

1101
01:43:11,075 --> 01:43:19,579
[SPEAKER_00]: As a school committee, your responsibility is to advocate on behalf of the district, and so we see it as our responsibility and the administration to provide you with the information necessary to do that.

1102
01:43:20,119 --> 01:43:39,607
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you've heard me say before, the various funding streams include money coming in based on our Chapter 70 allocation, the local contribution locally coming from the municipal level, and then the sort of variable that distinguishes the fiscal years amidst the COVID chapter are the external funds coming in from the federal government

1103
01:43:40,427 --> 01:43:45,630
[SPEAKER_00]: And those have a lot of questions associated with them, but they're also some significant dollars.

1104
01:43:46,090 --> 01:44:04,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while we know they are one-time dollars and we have to associate budgetary priorities with them in accordance with that, as we've said, we also want to make sure that we're understanding the urgency of some of the needs that our students are facing coming out of this multi-year instructional disruption.

1105
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:09,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the numbers that you've seen before, and you see I've crossed out

1106
01:44:10,023 --> 01:44:19,286
[SPEAKER_00]: our initial projections, they are generally in line with what we anticipated when we first got into some of the specificity of our projections on April 26th.

1107
01:44:20,386 --> 01:44:27,388
[SPEAKER_00]: The one exception is our fixed costs have come in at million dollars higher than we were anticipating.

1108
01:44:27,429 --> 01:44:33,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention this in one of the Committee of the Whole meetings last week, I believe, maybe the week before.

1109
01:44:34,131 --> 01:44:38,612
[SPEAKER_00]: That million dollar variation is primarily attributable to fixed costs

1110
01:44:39,042 --> 01:44:40,643
[SPEAKER_00]: in the area of special education.

1111
01:44:41,303 --> 01:45:00,311
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'll remember from the presentations that we heard on May 6th, the special education budgeting process, we've compared it to a roller coaster in that we see the numbers, they look big, they look scary, but we know that there's a significant amount of external funding that will come in over the coming months that will offset that.

1112
01:45:00,732 --> 01:45:07,955
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we can, at least for the time being, have a certain level of peace of mind looking back historically

1113
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:13,173
[SPEAKER_00]: IDEA funds and the access to Circuit Breaker that have helped offset those costs.

1114
01:45:13,593 --> 01:45:27,563
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we always need to have some insulation built in because the variability in special education budgeting is such that the numbers can go back to sort of the scary side of the budgetary continuum somewhat quickly.

1115
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:34,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, we're generally in line and it should be the 3.1 to 5.8 number a little bit lower than

1116
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:42,222
[SPEAKER_00]: than what the actual numbers will come in at the end of the week.

1117
01:45:42,262 --> 01:45:46,824
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, the priorities that the committee has discussed are in line with that.

1118
01:45:47,364 --> 01:45:50,125
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the number at the bottom there, the $1.4 million.

1119
01:45:50,825 --> 01:46:00,510
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the number if we collect all of the priorities listed in what was the bottom row of the budget narratives that were presented to you over those five meetings.

1120
01:46:01,290 --> 01:46:03,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I anticipate over the course of the next several days,

1121
01:46:04,512 --> 01:46:09,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just received ESSER III guidance from the state at the very end of last week.

1122
01:46:09,095 --> 01:46:27,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So using that guidance, I think we will have some options with regard to moving some of the budgetary priorities that are currently in the operating end of the budget into the ESSER funds, wanting to, again, be mindful of the one-time nature of those funds and not wanting to create unnecessary structural deficits.

1123
01:46:29,207 --> 01:46:34,209
[SPEAKER_00]: And also understanding that that funding has to extend over the course of the next several fiscal years.

1124
01:46:34,309 --> 01:46:47,575
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do not expect that our recommended ESSER budgeting will approach the $7.6 million that we're anticipating over the next several budget cycles, but I think it will probably grow from the 1.4 million.

1125
01:46:48,476 --> 01:46:55,699
[SPEAKER_00]: And that coupled with the external funds that will come in to help offset those fixed costs will get us back within the range of,

1126
01:46:57,853 --> 01:47:00,574
[SPEAKER_00]: the vicinity of $5.8 million, a little bit lower, I think.

1127
01:47:01,414 --> 01:47:04,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we'll plan for any and all contingencies.

1128
01:47:04,275 --> 01:47:18,798
[SPEAKER_00]: So if and when the appropriation is lower than the number that the school committee requests, and that's certainly an important dialogue that every community has to have, but I just wanna be clear, the school district will be prepared to operate and to do so effectively when that number is ultimately appropriated.

1129
01:47:19,678 --> 01:47:24,880
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of what you will be holding a hearing on, on Tuesday, June 1st,

1130
01:47:26,385 --> 01:47:35,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the direction that we've received from the committee, the proposed budget that you will receive will reflect the all of the committee of the whole recommendation.

1131
01:47:35,792 --> 01:47:39,055
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the number on the far right, the $69.9 million.

1132
01:47:40,055 --> 01:47:43,198
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a significant increase over the FY.

1133
01:47:44,325 --> 01:47:45,226
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 operating budget.

1134
01:47:45,606 --> 01:47:49,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it does not include some of the funds that will flow in from an external, the external funds.

1135
01:47:49,788 --> 01:47:51,569
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will offset that to some degree.

1136
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:56,432
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to limit, and this is certainly, this is the prerogative of the school committee.

1137
01:47:56,892 --> 01:48:03,176
[SPEAKER_00]: If the requests were to be limited to the critical committee of the whole recommendations, it would be about $67.7 million.

1138
01:48:03,396 --> 01:48:07,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see all that in specificity when the budget books are issued to you before the end of this week.

1139
01:48:08,138 --> 01:48:11,440
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

1140
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:13,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize, as I said, this is a high level,

1141
01:48:13,712 --> 01:48:14,112
[SPEAKER_00]: update.

1142
01:48:14,452 --> 01:48:18,654
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be more specificity, certainly in documents that you received prior to the budget hearing on June 1st.

1143
01:48:19,414 --> 01:48:28,718
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of this, I hope and believe is fully consistent with the information that you've been presented with over the course of the past five public meetings.

1144
01:48:29,379 --> 01:48:29,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1145
01:48:39,363 --> 01:48:40,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1146
01:48:41,004 --> 01:48:41,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we have

1147
01:48:42,735 --> 01:48:44,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have any old business.

1148
01:48:44,136 --> 01:48:50,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any communications?

1149
01:48:50,161 --> 01:48:57,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 11, new business request for possible extension from the advisory committee to rename the Columbus Elementary School.

1150
01:48:57,047 --> 01:49:04,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was offered by myself as I've been trying to watch parts of the meetings when available.

1151
01:49:05,173 --> 01:49:06,595
[SPEAKER_04]: They do need an extension.

1152
01:49:07,395 --> 01:49:09,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to us based on the policy to extend

1153
01:49:12,681 --> 01:49:14,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, are we ready to conclude?

1154
01:49:15,452 --> 01:49:23,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did get a letter regarding the whole Columbus issue.

1155
01:49:23,555 --> 01:49:27,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't read it at the front.

1156
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:30,257
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from Mr. Giglio.

1157
01:49:30,357 --> 01:49:32,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he was on earlier.

1158
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:33,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, he's still on.

1159
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:43,142
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a kind of funny thing about the letters, which now we have this way that people can submit letters, but they're also on.

1160
01:49:45,503 --> 01:49:51,008
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, I think I need to read it because it was submitted through the proper channels, okay?

1161
01:49:52,169 --> 01:50:08,625
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, dear school committee, with the recent removal of one of the Columbus School renaming committee members due to his social media comments, many Medford residents strongly feel that the process is tainted and flawed due to not only his anti-bias views, but other committee members and their similar social media comments.

1162
01:50:09,475 --> 01:50:21,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Although this former member no longer sits on the committee, his suggestion that there was widespread cheating as well as his comments made about a particular race and nationality of people who took the time to fill out the response form is absolutely absurd.

1163
01:50:21,818 --> 01:50:29,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also like to bring up the disturbing fact that the beginning of the last renaming meeting, a letter was read on behalf of the NAACP.

1164
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:36,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe, and I could be wrong, that the public was told that there would be no public participation of any kind during these renaming committee meetings.

1165
01:50:36,683 --> 01:50:45,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only was the NAACP, who does not sit on the renaming committee letter, but it also mentioned other issues and ideas that were suggested to be

1166
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:49,502
[SPEAKER_09]: next on the agenda to be pushed through in the future.

1167
01:50:49,802 --> 01:51:01,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I've obtained and read the letter that the NAACP wrote that was addressed to the mayor of Medford and dated March 12th, 2021, which was before the renaming committee was chosen.

1168
01:51:02,248 --> 01:51:08,911
[SPEAKER_09]: This leads many people to believe that someone within the school committee or school system had this push through to be read during the meeting on May 12th.

1169
01:51:10,032 --> 01:51:15,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam mayor and school committee chair, with so many issues that have arisen during this process, which included certain timeline dates,

1170
01:51:16,455 --> 01:51:37,766
[SPEAKER_09]: made but not kept by the school committee and with the removal of the renaming committee member along with the NAACP letter that suggests changing other rules and policies the Medford community kindly asks that the Columbus school renaming process please cease and be re-evaluated request this Columbus school renaming process be added to the ballot for the November 2021 election

1171
01:51:39,728 --> 01:51:43,452
[SPEAKER_09]: to afford a fair process for all residents to have a say in the process.

1172
01:51:44,273 --> 01:51:48,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Please consider this request respectfully, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street, Medford.

1173
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:51,461
[SPEAKER_09]: 18 year resident.

1174
01:51:52,963 --> 01:51:54,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Van der Kloot.

1175
01:51:55,225 --> 01:52:00,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mayor, I have, no, if I may continue.

1176
01:52:00,776 --> 01:52:01,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1177
01:52:01,537 --> 01:52:07,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would support if the advisory committee needs more time.

1178
01:52:07,681 --> 01:52:11,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly would think that we can accommodate that.

1179
01:52:12,285 --> 01:52:15,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I will tell you that I did eavesdrop on the last meeting.

1180
01:52:16,488 --> 01:52:21,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw the committee slugging through the weeds of process.

1181
01:52:22,492 --> 01:52:34,335
[SPEAKER_09]: then I was very appreciative to all of them because that's the kind of hard work, the difficult conversations, the trying to figure out what's right.

1182
01:52:35,236 --> 01:52:44,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And I certainly saw, while I wouldn't necessarily have agreed with every comment that was made, I certainly saw people working with good faith.

1183
01:52:45,438 --> 01:52:48,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was very appreciative to the advisory committee.

1184
01:52:48,899 --> 01:53:00,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So my personal belief is that if the committee has asked us for more time, then absolutely in the interest of them going forward, we should accommodate their schedule.

1185
01:53:01,827 --> 01:53:02,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member van de Kloot.

1186
01:53:03,608 --> 01:53:09,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we have our two meetings, regular meetings in June on the 7th and the 14th.

1187
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:11,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you proposing that we have

1188
01:53:13,193 --> 01:53:18,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a date you're proposing, or I'll actually let you think about it and call on member Kreatz.

1189
01:53:19,777 --> 01:53:21,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should hear from other members.

1190
01:53:22,438 --> 01:53:23,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz and then member Rousseau.

1191
01:53:26,548 --> 01:53:29,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I support the extension also.

1192
01:53:30,071 --> 01:53:34,974
[SPEAKER_16]: I did get to watch the part of the meeting last week.

1193
01:53:35,014 --> 01:53:36,875
[SPEAKER_16]: I was in another meeting, but I got to watch some of it.

1194
01:53:37,515 --> 01:53:39,717
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're working very hard.

1195
01:53:40,037 --> 01:53:48,863
[SPEAKER_16]: And it seems like there might have been some technical difficulties with some of the information and some of the information wasn't available.

1196
01:53:49,003 --> 01:53:55,087
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I do think that they, you know, could use the extension and I approve and I support the extension.

1197
01:53:58,108 --> 01:53:58,708
[SPEAKER_03]: member Ruseau.

1198
01:54:00,509 --> 01:54:01,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

1199
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:03,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a motion to provide an extension to June 7th.

1200
01:54:03,931 --> 01:54:06,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1201
01:54:11,614 --> 01:54:12,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call, please.

1202
01:54:12,675 --> 01:54:13,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, Mayor.

1203
01:54:14,275 --> 01:54:14,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van der Kloot.

1204
01:54:15,236 --> 01:54:18,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Is June 7th really giving them the time they need?

1205
01:54:19,638 --> 01:54:26,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will just be back June 7th asking for another extension, but it's at least giving them more time past

1206
01:54:26,974 --> 01:54:28,930
[SPEAKER_04]: when it was due in a couple days.

1207
01:54:29,397 --> 01:54:43,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the other thing I would just wanted to mention before we do the roll call is we also received a letter from the Columbus Elementary staff, which I know is going to be shared with the committee, the advisory committee at their next meeting.

1208
01:54:44,901 --> 01:54:50,682
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a letter really suggesting some other alternatives that perhaps weren't as loaded.

1209
01:54:52,022 --> 01:54:58,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I heard Mr. Lister mentioned in a letter back to

1210
01:55:00,264 --> 01:55:08,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Vicki Mello, who sent it on behalf of Columbus teachers, that he was going to read it at their next meeting.

1211
01:55:08,247 --> 01:55:14,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would be very interested in also hearing their opinion on the letter.

1212
01:55:16,811 --> 01:55:18,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you, Member Van der Kloot.

1213
01:55:18,131 --> 01:55:19,632
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Member Graham, then Member Ruseau.

1214
01:55:21,329 --> 01:55:21,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1215
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:38,729
[SPEAKER_02]: The resolution that the advisory committee passed to bring to us lays out the work that they've done to date and the work that they feel like they need, and they have indicated in their letter that they will be ready at any date of our choosing any time after June 4th.

1216
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:47,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I believe them and take them at their word when they tell us that they know what work it is that they have ahead of them.

1217
01:55:47,972 --> 01:55:54,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like June 7th is a really reasonable date given what they have outlined for us.

1218
01:55:54,434 --> 01:55:59,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1219
01:55:59,596 --> 01:56:00,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau.

1220
01:56:01,516 --> 01:56:01,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all set.

1221
01:56:01,996 --> 01:56:02,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1222
01:56:03,837 --> 01:56:04,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Melanie.

1223
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:08,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you, Mayor.

1224
01:56:08,381 --> 01:56:10,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to thank the committee for all their hard work.

1225
01:56:11,624 --> 01:56:15,847
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not an easy task, and we appreciate what they're doing.

1226
01:56:16,287 --> 01:56:22,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also think June 7th is a fine date for continuation.

1227
01:56:22,893 --> 01:56:23,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1228
01:56:26,355 --> 01:56:27,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, motion on the floor.

1229
01:56:27,616 --> 01:56:30,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1230
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:32,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

1231
01:56:32,821 --> 01:56:33,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1232
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:34,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

1233
01:56:35,591 --> 01:56:35,831
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1234
01:56:36,732 --> 01:56:37,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

1235
01:56:37,372 --> 01:56:37,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1236
01:56:37,612 --> 01:56:38,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone?

1237
01:56:49,681 --> 01:56:50,521
[SPEAKER_07]: She put her finger up.

1238
01:56:50,762 --> 01:56:52,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, I can unmute now.

1239
01:56:52,703 --> 01:56:53,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

1240
01:56:53,964 --> 01:56:54,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

1241
01:56:55,825 --> 01:56:56,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1242
01:56:56,986 --> 01:56:57,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot?

1243
01:56:58,187 --> 01:56:58,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1244
01:56:59,047 --> 01:56:59,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1245
01:57:01,433 --> 01:57:04,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1246
01:57:05,394 --> 01:57:07,755
[SPEAKER_04]: The extension is approved till June 7th.

1247
01:57:08,395 --> 01:57:08,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1248
01:57:10,756 --> 01:57:22,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, beginning in the fall of 2021, an extract of the email addresses on file and school brains or whatever system is used for tracking parent caregiver emails will be created twice each school year.

1249
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:31,203
[SPEAKER_04]: This extract will be used to create a white list within our email provider to allow emails in and out of

1250
01:57:32,083 --> 01:57:35,625
[SPEAKER_04]: for any email on that white list for grades K through eight.

1251
01:57:36,006 --> 01:57:42,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Presently K through eight emails are blocked from any incoming or outgoing email now within the Medford public schools.

1252
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:45,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And this creates a problem for parents, caregivers, and students.

1253
01:57:46,012 --> 01:57:49,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Work arounds are challenging, expensive, and disruptive.

1254
01:57:49,775 --> 01:57:58,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And students and families should not have to purposefully circumvent our systems to perform perfectly valid activities such as communication with our students.

1255
01:57:59,661 --> 01:58:00,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by member Rousseau.

1256
01:58:04,882 --> 01:58:05,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

1257
01:58:06,083 --> 01:58:13,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, unless there's any questions about what this is, I don't have anything to say on the matter.

1258
01:58:14,246 --> 01:58:17,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we vote on it, if you could just explain it.

1259
01:58:19,028 --> 01:58:22,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so a whitelist is, it's a technical term.

1260
01:58:22,370 --> 01:58:26,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an exception list.

1261
01:58:28,633 --> 01:58:31,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So our email system does not allow parents

1262
01:58:32,394 --> 01:58:38,719
[SPEAKER_01]: to email their own children or their children to email their parents in the K-8 grades.

1263
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:42,782
[SPEAKER_01]: All in and out of communications for K-8 students is completely blocked.

1264
01:58:43,602 --> 01:58:50,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And many parents have complained to me about this in the last three and a half years.

1265
01:58:51,228 --> 01:58:58,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And the workarounds are rather, are simple, but they're not exactly equitable.

1266
01:58:58,533 --> 01:59:00,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents give their kids iPhones, they give them

1267
01:59:01,839 --> 01:59:08,363
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their kids logging in and other devices with other email accounts so that the kids can accomplish that.

1268
01:59:08,443 --> 01:59:15,087
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, not all kids have those things and it's expensive, frankly.

1269
01:59:15,427 --> 01:59:26,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't exactly, I can't actually remember what communications I was having with a parent about this recently about that made me write the resolution.

1270
01:59:26,353 --> 01:59:30,155
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to look at my notes, but we can simply have a whitelist created

1271
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:42,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Any email distribution system, and certainly Google, will have the capability of having a whitelist added to allow emails in and out to those email addresses.

1272
01:59:42,489 --> 01:59:46,132
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1273
01:59:46,893 --> 01:59:48,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent, then member Kreatz.

1274
01:59:50,676 --> 01:59:57,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to say that I spoke with Molly Layden and with the team.

1275
01:59:59,816 --> 02:00:12,240
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really going to present a hardship in terms of being able to manage the outside emails on our district network.

1276
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:16,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It exposes us to additional vulnerabilities.

1277
02:00:16,921 --> 02:00:28,905
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other districts that do not open the network at all, their K through 12 network, because of what can potentially end up happening.

1278
02:00:29,422 --> 02:00:37,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And so once it is opened, the entire email system is essentially exposed.

1279
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:54,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was the reason why it's open for our students at the high school, grades nine through 12, is so that they can receive additional support from their guidance Councilors when they're applying for college applications.

1280
02:00:54,724 --> 02:01:02,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really a specific use that the email system is being opened.

1281
02:01:02,786 --> 02:01:04,746
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the K through eight,

1282
02:01:07,434 --> 02:01:19,246
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of additional support to be opening up the district email system, we really would be opening ourselves up to vulnerabilities.

1283
02:01:20,026 --> 02:01:22,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is why, you know,

1284
02:01:25,786 --> 02:01:32,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I had said, you know, we knew that this was going to be posted, but I did the research to kind of look into it.

1285
02:01:33,455 --> 02:01:43,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really am not in support of us opening it up K through eight, knowing that we could end up

1286
02:01:44,596 --> 02:01:57,122
[SPEAKER_06]: giving ourselves additional technological issues where the emails are concerned, because we're not going to be able to monitor it the way we would want to monitor it right now.

1287
02:01:57,482 --> 02:02:08,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So by having it closed at least K through eight, it allows us to ensure that the emails are being used for school-related purposes.

1288
02:02:12,593 --> 02:02:12,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1289
02:02:13,033 --> 02:02:14,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz, then Member Ruseau.

1290
02:02:15,956 --> 02:02:16,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1291
02:02:17,718 --> 02:02:34,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I reached out to Dr. Cushing and Molly Leighton, and everything that Dr. Edward Benson mentioned, that is the information that I received, that there's a restriction for safety and security for the students who are of age

1292
02:02:36,074 --> 02:03:02,969
[SPEAKER_16]: up through 13 and and under should not have access to email that's not monitored consistently um you know so and what molly had had mentioned in the email is that the k-8 issued email accounts are closed and that they should only be used to communicate within the medford um k12.ma.us domain the high school

1293
02:03:04,050 --> 02:03:17,374
[SPEAKER_16]: emails are open and can receive and send emails outside of the Medford Public Schools domain so that students are able to use their school email for related communications such as job applications, colleges, etc.

1294
02:03:17,914 --> 02:03:28,357
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I agree with the superintendent's recommendation that we shouldn't open up the email for the K through 8.

1295
02:03:29,677 --> 02:03:32,941
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it should be kept closed down for security reasons.

1296
02:03:33,722 --> 02:03:45,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Similarly, at my work, you know, for some reason, you know, there was some, you know, technical problems going on, and we switched from one email mechanism to another.

1297
02:03:47,259 --> 02:03:51,962
[SPEAKER_16]: It was some people's emails were, so to speak, blacklisted.

1298
02:03:52,682 --> 02:03:57,025
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was quite extensive in getting that information repaired.

1299
02:03:57,785 --> 02:04:08,952
[SPEAKER_16]: And there was also, we could have been in potential danger from getting unnecessary emails that we shouldn't be getting.

1300
02:04:09,372 --> 02:04:12,234
[SPEAKER_16]: So we were taking precautions at that time.

1301
02:04:12,334 --> 02:04:14,075
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to mention that.

1302
02:04:16,762 --> 02:04:17,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Kreatz.

1303
02:04:18,143 --> 02:04:21,844
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Member Ruseau and then also Dr. Cushing.

1304
02:04:23,185 --> 02:04:23,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

1305
02:04:24,866 --> 02:04:35,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's clear from the conversation at this moment that nobody on this who's spoken so far knows what whitelisting or blacklisting means or knows anything about email administration.

1306
02:04:36,131 --> 02:04:41,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just point out that any notion that are opening up our email system for nine through 12,

1307
02:04:44,959 --> 02:04:46,739
[SPEAKER_01]: The reasons we open it up, I support.

1308
02:04:47,539 --> 02:04:57,061
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was to show you what the inbox of a ninth grader looked like and the amount of porn that a ninth grader gets in our school system, you would be shocked.

1309
02:04:58,041 --> 02:04:58,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1310
02:04:58,521 --> 02:05:03,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, and I'm talking from experience as a parent of a ninth grader.

1311
02:05:04,162 --> 02:05:04,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1312
02:05:04,983 --> 02:05:13,104
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we don't have anybody on the call, who knows what white listing is or email management system management is,

1313
02:05:13,746 --> 02:05:15,086
[SPEAKER_01]: then this isn't gonna go anywhere.

1314
02:05:15,106 --> 02:05:38,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just really a little concerned that even the point of this motion is completely missed because every kid who has a parent that's just gonna hand them an iPhone to communicate with can look up all of the porn and all of the stuff we don't want them to look at without any control that we have.

1315
02:05:39,527 --> 02:05:41,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember elementary school.

1316
02:05:42,108 --> 02:05:43,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. K is right there.

1317
02:05:43,408 --> 02:05:47,729
[SPEAKER_01]: How many elementary school kids in kindergarten show up with iPhones?

1318
02:05:48,769 --> 02:05:56,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we have any restrictions, control, porn, spam, any control over any of that?

1319
02:05:57,971 --> 02:06:02,452
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, then we're just pretending that there's something that's going on that's not real.

1320
02:06:03,113 --> 02:06:05,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure.

1321
02:06:05,427 --> 02:06:08,028
[SPEAKER_01]: A whitelist does not allow anybody in.

1322
02:06:08,408 --> 02:06:10,849
[SPEAKER_01]: It also does not open our network in any way, shape or form.

1323
02:06:10,869 --> 02:06:12,990
[SPEAKER_01]: A whitelist has nothing to do with our network.

1324
02:06:13,610 --> 02:06:18,612
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows an email address, a specific email address to get through the filter.

1325
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:26,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when you go to send an email from within the school system, if that email address is on the whitelist, it goes out.

1326
02:06:28,836 --> 02:06:35,178
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a security risk any more than the vast security risks that we already have in our school system.

1327
02:06:37,190 --> 02:06:37,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing?

1328
02:06:42,515 --> 02:06:45,577
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much for the opportunity to speak.

1329
02:06:46,058 --> 02:06:50,461
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate and understand Mr. Rousseau's motion.

1330
02:06:51,342 --> 02:06:54,925
[SPEAKER_15]: I also do understand whitelist and blacklist.

1331
02:06:55,886 --> 02:06:56,866
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a couple of issues.

1332
02:06:58,593 --> 02:07:04,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Our data for a whitelist is only as good as the data that is provided to us by families.

1333
02:07:05,116 --> 02:07:16,220
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have a difficult time maintaining good, clean data when a person changes their email address, changes their phone number, whatever it may be.

1334
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:27,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So we would have a difficult time maintaining that level of data cleanliness to maintain an up-to-date whitelist.

1335
02:07:28,321 --> 02:07:46,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, I will say this, that when I first came to Medford and found out that high school students were allowed to email outside of the domain, as Mr. Russo just mentioned, because of the issues of what can come into a student's inbox,

1336
02:07:47,547 --> 02:07:58,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I was surprised in no other district that I've worked in where students are allowed to have email addresses, have they been allowed to email outside of the domain and have that level of contact.

1337
02:07:58,458 --> 02:08:09,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything outside of that was, you know, for the realm of a personal email address, Google, I believe their policy while not having it right in front of me right now is

1338
02:08:10,369 --> 02:08:14,790
[SPEAKER_15]: for no one under the age of 13 to have a Google account.

1339
02:08:14,870 --> 02:08:18,831
[SPEAKER_15]: If they find out that you are under the age of 13, they will suspend it.

1340
02:08:18,971 --> 02:08:26,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that may be different because ours is, for all intents and purposes, a closed system that we purchased from them.

1341
02:08:28,113 --> 02:08:36,135
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing is, finally, I would be remiss to say that I would be concerned that on a district

1342
02:08:37,135 --> 02:08:52,002
[SPEAKER_15]: system that we could have something negative happen where we now, as a result of the COVID pandemic, have opened up our students to having Gmail accounts in K-1-2.

1343
02:08:52,202 --> 02:08:52,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1344
02:08:52,382 --> 02:08:57,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Galussi can probably chime in, but I don't believe that we offered that previously.

1345
02:08:57,264 --> 02:09:03,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Most districts prior to the pandemic only offered students accounts in grades three through eight.

1346
02:09:03,767 --> 02:09:06,088
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I understand and fully respect

1347
02:09:06,890 --> 02:09:23,858
[SPEAKER_15]: the need for parents to be in touch with their students and their students' teachers and the positive benefits that could come from this, even if we have a wait list, I worry that we would not be able to maintain that wait list and the cleanliness of that data.

1348
02:09:23,938 --> 02:09:36,024
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if we just were to say, open it up, which I know is not what is being asked for, but I would have serious reservations and concerns about the malicious

1349
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:41,813
[SPEAKER_15]: interests that can lurk on the web of reaching in.

1350
02:09:44,434 --> 02:09:45,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1351
02:09:48,256 --> 02:09:49,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1352
02:09:49,257 --> 02:09:53,539
[SPEAKER_04]: We have member Ms.

1353
02:09:53,559 --> 02:09:57,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Stone, then member Rousseau again, and we also have a resident, Ms.

1354
02:09:57,401 --> 02:09:58,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Kugno, so member Ms.

1355
02:09:59,002 --> 02:09:59,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Stone.

1356
02:10:00,894 --> 02:10:01,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you, Mayor.

1357
02:10:02,837 --> 02:10:05,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate Member Ruseau bringing this up.

1358
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:12,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think it brings us to another point, which the parents on the line can probably relate, is that we still

1359
02:10:12,805 --> 02:10:15,767
[SPEAKER_07]: fill out a paper copy of all of our information.

1360
02:10:16,287 --> 02:10:25,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can remember a year that there was six forms for my medical, six forms for the emergency contact, six forms of my family biography.

1361
02:10:25,912 --> 02:10:39,820
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that ties in because if we did all of that information online, we could just export the parent one, parent two, guardian one, guardian two, to be able to have it on a white list.

1362
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:48,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's doable because I know if I email teachers from my Yahoo email, all the teachers can get it and Tegan, my sophomore, can get it.

1363
02:10:49,166 --> 02:10:51,227
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is something that we can handle.

1364
02:10:51,667 --> 02:11:07,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think, like Member Ruseau said, we did have a number of parents who said they're not at the point where they want to give their fourth grader a phone, but they do want to touch base during the day or put on a thread with the teacher about concerns of their child.

1365
02:11:08,058 --> 02:11:15,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess mine is probably the a two-part to could we talk about getting all of our information online?

1366
02:11:16,643 --> 02:11:36,194
[SPEAKER_07]: You know there's family ID and Ravenna and all these school information sites that I think is an important step for us to move forward and I don't know if that should be an own motion or if we can tie it in but I definitely think we need to step up with our

1367
02:11:37,428 --> 02:11:39,910
[SPEAKER_07]: technology and family information.

1368
02:11:40,110 --> 02:11:40,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1369
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:42,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Mustone.

1370
02:11:43,372 --> 02:11:44,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

1371
02:11:46,353 --> 02:11:46,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1372
02:11:47,454 --> 02:11:51,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly want to acknowledge the data cleanliness problem.

1373
02:11:52,477 --> 02:11:54,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a staffing problem.

1374
02:11:54,878 --> 02:11:55,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a systems problem.

1375
02:11:56,319 --> 02:11:58,400
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this data cleanliness is not free.

1376
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:05,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just a matter of whether or not parents have written a legible email address on paper or versus typed it into school brains.

1377
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:08,297
[SPEAKER_01]: It's far more complicated than that.

1378
02:12:08,817 --> 02:12:17,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little surprised that that's an issue after a whole year of what I think of is unprecedented need to communicate with families.

1379
02:12:18,766 --> 02:12:23,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we saying we have lots of families where we have no valid way to communicate with them today?

1380
02:12:23,790 --> 02:12:28,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if that's the case, that seems kind of crazy in the middle of a pandemic.

1381
02:12:28,435 --> 02:12:30,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Murphy wants to answer that question before I keep going, I think.

1382
02:12:32,458 --> 02:12:33,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

1383
02:12:35,733 --> 02:12:36,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to comment, Mr. Murphy?

1384
02:12:37,334 --> 02:12:37,894
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind.

1385
02:12:39,155 --> 02:12:48,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's no question to Mr. Rousseau's point that we are in a better place today than we were at the beginning of the school year for several reasons.

1386
02:12:49,901 --> 02:13:02,469
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which is there's been a significant amount of data cleanup that has been part of our COVID testing program in which a very significant portion of our student population have been participating at all grade levels.

1387
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:04,050
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said,

1388
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:06,061
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an ongoing challenge.

1389
02:13:06,762 --> 02:13:17,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it's the case that we have huge swaths of data that we're missing, but it is the case that it's a challenge that's very much continuous.

1390
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:31,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes families who are already facing some of the most significant challenges

1391
02:13:32,146 --> 02:13:36,491
[SPEAKER_00]: who frankly updating their data with us is not their biggest concern.

1392
02:13:36,591 --> 02:13:43,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do have concerns with regard to the equity of the application of this policy.

1393
02:13:43,098 --> 02:13:49,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what it really comes down to is it's something that should be simple and it's something that we should be able to do efficiently.

1394
02:13:49,702 --> 02:13:56,563
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think from the administration's perspective, we're not confident that we're there yet, either with respect to personnel or to systems.

1395
02:13:57,083 --> 02:14:02,484
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have to build out those systems before we would be able to do this in a way that we'd feel confident.

1396
02:14:02,544 --> 02:14:11,806
[SPEAKER_00]: We will, as always, we will do, we will follow the policy of the committee and we'll report back if its application or its implementation just proves impossible.

1397
02:14:12,446 --> 02:14:18,507
[SPEAKER_00]: But the committee should know that we have, as a team, we have significant reservations

1398
02:14:19,257 --> 02:14:19,657
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.

1399
02:14:20,918 --> 02:14:21,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1400
02:14:21,898 --> 02:14:27,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, the equity point of that though, I think, I appreciate that you're pointing that out.

1401
02:14:28,721 --> 02:14:45,589
[SPEAKER_01]: The other side of it as I see it is, if you must communicate with your child K to eight, pardon me, then your option is to buy them an iPhone or Android or whatever.

1402
02:14:46,189 --> 02:14:48,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I ask, when I think about who can afford that,

1403
02:14:50,169 --> 02:14:51,930
[SPEAKER_01]: equity has to be part of that conversation.

1404
02:14:51,950 --> 02:15:06,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's always, of course, parents who are like, I'm not giving my phone and, you know, the wait till eight system, which I was a supporter of, and I waited till they were in eighth grade, but I didn't need to communicate with my kids because there was somebody home all the time.

1405
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:14,603
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there were going to be transportation or childcare issues, or you don't go home to mom, you got to go home to dad's house today because

1406
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:16,660
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, parents aren't living together.

1407
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:20,601
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand reasons for which a parent must communicate during the day.

1408
02:15:22,281 --> 02:15:24,522
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just say no.

1409
02:15:25,182 --> 02:15:25,842
[SPEAKER_01]: We just say no.

1410
02:15:26,022 --> 02:15:27,423
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't, though, Mr. President.

1411
02:15:27,523 --> 02:15:28,103
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't.

1412
02:15:28,343 --> 02:15:29,283
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just say no.

1413
02:15:29,403 --> 02:15:35,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we may say that mail system is not the platform for that communication to happen on a daily basis.

1414
02:15:36,144 --> 02:15:44,326
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are families with extenuating circumstances, we will work with those families either through often the health services office or the principal's office or

1415
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:54,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes directly with the teacher, but and I think our experiences of those are generally exceptions to the rule, rather than the norm.

1416
02:15:54,518 --> 02:15:59,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably that's part of why the systems haven't been built out, frankly, the way that they need to.

1417
02:16:00,423 --> 02:16:03,445
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I absolutely think this is something we can work toward.

1418
02:16:03,465 --> 02:16:04,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that there's

1419
02:16:05,181 --> 02:16:08,942
[SPEAKER_00]: divergence with regard to what we would all like to see happen and like to see possible.

1420
02:16:09,242 --> 02:16:20,406
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to be able to provide a very convenient means of communication between families and students so that, you know, we're improving that dynamic and hopefully also communicating more frequently with the parents and family caregivers.

1421
02:16:21,046 --> 02:16:33,751
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the goal is generally share, but I think there's concern about our ability to update data, number one, and with regard to some of the safety and security concerns that have already been raised.

1422
02:16:34,291 --> 02:16:34,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't

1423
02:16:35,387 --> 02:16:38,409
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that we feel right now that we would have the capacity to do that.

1424
02:16:38,529 --> 02:16:43,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely think it's something we can work toward and come back and report on.

1425
02:16:45,535 --> 02:16:47,096
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't, I don't, I want to be very clear.

1426
02:16:47,136 --> 02:16:48,737
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just say too bad.

1427
02:16:49,097 --> 02:16:57,263
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not, and if anyone is having that experience, they should raise it with the central administration, but I don't believe that to be the case.

1428
02:16:58,824 --> 02:16:59,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1429
02:17:00,246 --> 02:17:04,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham, then member Van der Kloot, then we have a couple of residents that would like to comment.

1430
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:06,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1431
02:17:07,731 --> 02:17:19,741
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think one of the possible opportunities with this resolution is that we refer to the engagement communications and strategic planning subcommittee.

1432
02:17:20,522 --> 02:17:32,351
[SPEAKER_02]: We just heard about the new Harvard superintendent in residence who has apparently like very deep expertise in family engagement.

1433
02:17:32,431 --> 02:17:32,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me,

1434
02:17:33,879 --> 02:17:36,380
[SPEAKER_02]: this resolution is all about family engagement.

1435
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:41,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about keeping parents and students on the same page.

1436
02:17:42,462 --> 02:17:50,785
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other purposes, but I think, you know, I can't communicate simultaneously with my child's teacher and them.

1437
02:17:51,346 --> 02:17:59,909
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like not as big of a deal in elementary school, but it's a really big deal in middle school when communication to parents drops off completely, it's like a cliff.

1438
02:18:00,669 --> 02:18:26,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to see this committee endorse the fact that this is a priority in terms of family engagement and acknowledge that it's not without challenges and send it to the subcommittee on family engagement to work through this in a meaningful way, probably at the start of the next school year, given the rest of our calendar.

1439
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:32,719
[SPEAKER_04]: make a motion to refer.

1440
02:18:32,739 --> 02:18:39,024
[SPEAKER_05]: To say I make a motion to refer to the, um, communication subcommittee family and community community engagement Communications subcommittee.

1441
02:18:41,105 --> 02:18:44,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Came motion by member McLaughlin before them.

1442
02:18:44,347 --> 02:18:45,768
[SPEAKER_04]: That motion is called member Van der Kloot.

1443
02:18:46,528 --> 02:18:53,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd actually like to defer to the to miss Cugno and Adam, who so if I could have

1444
02:19:01,721 --> 02:19:05,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna, you should see the button to unmute.

1445
02:19:05,745 --> 02:19:07,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yep, I'm all set, thank you.

1446
02:19:09,808 --> 02:19:15,893
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have a couple of questions here, and that is, there's been discussion on two things.

1447
02:19:16,034 --> 02:19:22,079
[SPEAKER_11]: One is family engagement, and that is how to get your address for the record.

1448
02:19:22,497 --> 02:19:26,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm so sorry, Emery Cugno 871 Felsway Medford mess.

1449
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:26,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1450
02:19:26,981 --> 02:19:28,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you're welcome and I should have known better.

1451
02:19:29,023 --> 02:19:29,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1452
02:19:30,444 --> 02:19:39,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there were two things that people are talking about and that is one is family engagement and the other one is child engagement, family engagement is something that

1453
02:19:39,992 --> 02:19:45,354
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying one is more important than the other, but I totally understand the engagement that a person has.

1454
02:19:45,414 --> 02:19:50,696
[SPEAKER_11]: You're only dealing with one teacher most of the time when you're K through five.

1455
02:19:50,876 --> 02:19:54,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Once they go to middle school, then there's teams of teachers and high school is the same thing.

1456
02:19:55,397 --> 02:20:00,379
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very important issue that I know that there was communication.

1457
02:20:00,419 --> 02:20:05,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we had certain apps that we were working with, software programs that we were working with in the past.

1458
02:20:05,861 --> 02:20:08,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if they're still up and going, but

1459
02:20:10,404 --> 02:20:19,292
[SPEAKER_11]: There's, as a person listening to this meeting, as a parent, I would get, it seems a little bit nerve wracking.

1460
02:20:19,732 --> 02:20:25,217
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I do know that if anyone has ever, I mean, I was on the school committee for many years.

1461
02:20:25,237 --> 02:20:36,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember anybody telling me they couldn't get in touch with their child for an emergency or because their buses had to get switched that day or because someone else was picking them up.

1462
02:20:36,206 --> 02:20:37,287
[SPEAKER_11]: They always called

1463
02:20:37,947 --> 02:20:46,292
[SPEAKER_11]: the school and the school, whether it be the principal, headmaster, assistant principals, the information always got to the child.

1464
02:20:48,074 --> 02:21:01,702
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't want parents out there thinking that if they don't have iPhones, if they don't have certain, you know, things to connect directly with the child, that they're never going to be able to get a message to their child.

1465
02:21:03,023 --> 02:21:06,906
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing is, is that before we open up any more,

1466
02:21:08,746 --> 02:21:10,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo said something about pornography.

1467
02:21:12,227 --> 02:21:25,629
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a school committee member, I think that would be a huge issue that should be discussed and taken care of before emails and more emails are put on our sites.

1468
02:21:26,110 --> 02:21:39,332
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, if people are saying that their children are seeing pornography that's coming to us, or, I mean, please specify and clarify what's going on, because I think it's important that before anybody else adds more onto our service,

1469
02:21:40,498 --> 02:21:43,379
[SPEAKER_11]: um, that that really needs to be addressed.

1470
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:48,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Miss Kugno.

1471
02:21:49,481 --> 02:21:49,981
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1472
02:21:50,501 --> 02:21:50,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1473
02:21:51,641 --> 02:21:52,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1474
02:21:55,642 --> 02:22:01,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that can also be addressed in the in the subcommittee meeting and figure out ways to explore how to resolve that.

1475
02:22:02,144 --> 02:22:02,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Member van de Kloot?

1476
02:22:05,395 --> 02:22:06,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

1477
02:22:06,816 --> 02:22:09,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I would support sending this to the subcommittee.

1478
02:22:09,158 --> 02:22:19,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's lots of issues involved, including whether we have the personnel, whether we have the systems in place, perhaps we're identifying an issue.

1479
02:22:19,187 --> 02:22:31,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I may be sounding kind of old school, but, you know, I have some concerns about parents talking to their kids all throughout the school day because, and I always saw that, I mean,

1480
02:22:34,316 --> 02:22:44,798
[SPEAKER_09]: that certainly if there's a concern around transportation or who's going where, whatever, those are communications that do need to happen.

1481
02:22:45,919 --> 02:22:52,200
[SPEAKER_09]: But also, I think there's a lot of questions here.

1482
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:54,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So I support it going to the subcommittee.

1483
02:22:56,581 --> 02:22:59,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Van der Kloot.

1484
02:23:01,722 --> 02:23:02,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Mustone?

1485
02:23:03,398 --> 02:23:11,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Could a school information system possible quote be moved in as well with that motion?

1486
02:23:11,902 --> 02:23:30,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think the papers, I just, in this day and age, the papers for the bus pass, the emergency contact, the, I don't know if it's called family biography or what the top of the one is, that it's teeny tiny lines and teeny tiny space.

1487
02:23:31,272 --> 02:23:40,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I think if we go to a school information system that the parents is more user friendly, so I'm not sure if that could be included to just quote some.

1488
02:23:40,341 --> 02:23:46,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I know three offhand because I know other schools who use them, but I would appreciate if that could be included.

1489
02:23:46,547 --> 02:23:47,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1490
02:23:47,888 --> 02:23:53,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so motion for approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Van der Kloot as amended by member Stone.

1491
02:23:55,295 --> 02:23:55,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call, please.

1492

02:24:20,084 --> 02:24:20,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1506
02:24:20,945 --> 02:24:22,307
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1507
02:24:22,647 --> 02:24:25,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion is approved.

1508
02:24:27,190 --> 02:24:34,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we have be it resolved that the Medford School Committee return to having our regularly scheduled meetings at Medford City Hall along with Zoom capability.

1509
02:24:35,152 --> 02:24:41,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Further, that the committee discuss a protocol for determining in the future what meetings are held fully on Zoom and which will be held in person.

1510
02:24:42,235 --> 02:24:45,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Submitted by member Kathy Kreatz and member Paulette van de Kloot.

1511
02:24:46,076 --> 02:24:49,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna turn the floor over to the two of you.

1512
02:24:49,137 --> 02:24:54,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanna let you know that the governor did allow Zoom meetings by special order, so he will be coming.

1513
02:24:55,059 --> 02:24:55,259
[SPEAKER_04]: That's...

1514
02:24:57,007 --> 02:24:59,428
[SPEAKER_04]: will not be in effect as of June 15th.

1515
02:24:59,468 --> 02:25:03,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So he should be coming up with new guidelines that will help guide us.

1516
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:05,031
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's a great idea.

1517
02:25:05,051 --> 02:25:07,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in favor of going back for the regular meetings.

1518
02:25:08,012 --> 02:25:10,834
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one in June 7th and one on June 14th.

1519
02:25:11,194 --> 02:25:12,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm in support of this.

1520
02:25:12,775 --> 02:25:14,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kretser, Member Vindiclude, if you want to take the floor.

1521
02:25:18,675 --> 02:25:19,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Kathy, go ahead.

1522
02:25:19,976 --> 02:25:20,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Ms.

1523
02:25:20,236 --> 02:25:21,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Van's good.

1524
02:25:21,397 --> 02:25:41,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you know, just following the guidance from the governor and, you know, seeing that the city council is back in chambers and, you know, we do have the capability to have, you know, a hybrid model where we could have the Zoom on at the same time and have members in chambers.

1525
02:25:42,409 --> 02:25:46,672
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, if members can't come to chambers, they could still join the

1526
02:25:47,149 --> 02:26:11,599
[SPEAKER_16]: meeting via zoom and that's what the city council was doing and um it worked you know very well i watched a couple of meetings and you know um you know the the screen was there you could hear the members who were calling from home and they were visible they were clear and um the audience could still be on zoom and participate um i think it's a good idea now that

1527
02:26:12,359 --> 02:26:24,709
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, with the reopening and with a lot of the restrictions being lifted, you know, we've been hearing from a lot of community members that they would like to see the school committee back in chambers.

1528
02:26:27,191 --> 02:26:27,892
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll turn it over to Ms.

1529
02:26:27,912 --> 02:26:28,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Van de Koop.

1530
02:26:28,812 --> 02:26:32,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so Mayor, I do think it's time.

1531
02:26:32,675 --> 02:26:40,682
[SPEAKER_09]: My only concern is that we've just sent the advisory committee to make their presentations on the 7th

1532
02:26:41,551 --> 02:26:50,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know whether it's more complicated or less complicated for them if all of a sudden we say, oh, well, yeah, we're going to be in the chambers.

1533
02:26:50,217 --> 02:26:54,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's something I'm a little uncertain about.

1534
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:57,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're fine.

1535
02:26:57,883 --> 02:26:58,503
[SPEAKER_09]: You think you're fine?

1536
02:26:58,943 --> 02:26:59,284
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1537
02:26:59,984 --> 02:27:00,725
[SPEAKER_09]: So then fine.

1538
02:27:01,405 --> 02:27:05,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I would say that we should return and it should be, you know, it's time.

1539
02:27:06,389 --> 02:27:07,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Luckily, it's time.

1540
02:27:07,490 --> 02:27:08,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank God it's time.

1541
02:27:09,491 --> 02:27:10,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1542
02:27:10,272 --> 02:27:10,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

1543
02:27:13,017 --> 02:27:13,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, mayor.

1544
02:27:13,617 --> 02:27:15,819
[SPEAKER_01]: I too am very excited to return to the chambers actually.

1545
02:27:18,521 --> 02:27:21,583
[SPEAKER_01]: My concern is around subcommittees and committees as a whole.

1546
02:27:22,704 --> 02:27:34,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, I'll just say, I think it would be wildly irresponsible to pack the superintendent's conference room to the gills with people.

1547
02:27:34,372 --> 02:27:36,093
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no technology in that room.

1548
02:27:36,253 --> 02:27:38,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who would be interested in a meeting there

1549
02:27:39,605 --> 02:27:40,926
[SPEAKER_01]: will have to come to that room.

1550
02:27:41,706 --> 02:27:42,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm quite curious.

1551
02:27:42,706 --> 02:27:49,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, could you, it seems like somebody is unmuted.

1552
02:27:50,289 --> 02:28:05,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So without having, without any technology capabilities in that superintendent's conference room, I'm also very curious what the HVAC situation is and how many people are allowed in that particular space.

1553
02:28:12,965 --> 02:28:16,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Edward-Vinson?

1554
02:28:16,686 --> 02:28:24,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to just notify the school committee that the superintendent's conference room is now outfitted as a Zoom room.

1555
02:28:25,108 --> 02:28:30,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has the full capability to broadcast through Zoom.

1556
02:28:31,089 --> 02:28:34,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It has the large screen TV there.

1557
02:28:36,557 --> 02:28:43,883
[SPEAKER_06]: we could hold meetings there and at the same time communicate with the community at large that's still logging on by Zoom.

1558
02:28:44,183 --> 02:28:50,848
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was one of the perks during the closure that we did make that space outfitted as a Zoom room.

1559
02:28:51,268 --> 02:28:51,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1560
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:55,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And Director Cushing, if you want to have anything to add.

1561
02:28:55,752 --> 02:28:56,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1562
02:28:56,753 --> 02:29:03,498
[SPEAKER_15]: While I don't have the specific air exchange information in front of me, I will say that in that conference room, you'll have to speak up.

1563
02:29:04,662 --> 02:29:12,426
[SPEAKER_15]: because the airflow coming through there is actually loud now because it is moving so well.

1564
02:29:13,006 --> 02:29:23,852
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd also like to note that we do have a Zoom room capacity at the McGlynn in one of the conference rooms at the McGlynn Middle School Elementary School for future reference as well.

1565
02:29:26,873 --> 02:29:27,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1566
02:29:27,914 --> 02:29:30,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have member Kreatz, Van der Kloot and Rousseau.

1567
02:29:31,685 --> 02:29:36,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I could just point out again, the governor will be revising his orders.

1568
02:29:37,129 --> 02:29:45,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So at some point before June 15th, he may order that we have to go back to in-person meetings or that we need a quorum.

1569
02:29:46,176 --> 02:29:53,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully he will keep the Zoom capabilities, which you're assuming he will, but just need to figure out the next couple of weeks, that's all.

1570
02:29:53,802 --> 02:29:54,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz.

1571
02:29:55,867 --> 02:29:59,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, so I wanted to know because I wasn't sure how it would be handled.

1572
02:30:00,149 --> 02:30:04,011
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, you know, this was before the code.

1573
02:30:04,572 --> 02:30:08,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, we had Mr. McLaughlin was was doing our meetings.

1574
02:30:09,254 --> 02:30:16,178
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I think that, you know, we'll have to work out the technical piece of who is going to cover our meetings.

1575
02:30:16,778 --> 02:30:23,860
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, when we do go back to chambers and who's going to be covering the meeting and the Zoom.

1576
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:26,761
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Mr. Dr. Cushing has been doing the Zoom.

1577
02:30:27,241 --> 02:30:32,622
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I don't know the mechanics and working those details out.

1578
02:30:32,662 --> 02:30:36,223
[SPEAKER_16]: That was something that, you know, I wanted to bring up.

1579
02:30:36,704 --> 02:30:41,125
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what details, you know, are going to be covered by whom or whoever.

1580
02:30:42,345 --> 02:31:09,123
[SPEAKER_16]: and then also at the same time if any of the committee members have any like medical reasons why they wouldn't need to wear a mask or they wouldn't be able to wear a mask um would the medical like would that committee member be able to you know remove the mask in the chambers um in between the barricade because i know that they have the glass petitions and um

1581
02:31:09,603 --> 02:31:28,435
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, to keep the distance and the glass petitions so that if the committee member is like vaccinated and has difficulty breathing and has a medical note, can that person remove their mask with that or would that person have to go on the remote call?

1582
02:31:30,016 --> 02:31:35,720
[SPEAKER_04]: As of June 1st, if you are vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.

1583
02:31:37,890 --> 02:31:47,474
[SPEAKER_16]: And would that be the same for being in the committee of the whole, so the subcommittee, if they were in those separate rooms?

1584
02:31:47,834 --> 02:32:00,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I know that the governor did say that all of the restrictions would be over once June 15th, like the number of people attending meetings.

1585
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:01,580
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, okay.

1586
02:32:02,381 --> 02:32:03,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1587
02:32:03,501 --> 02:32:07,483
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know the answer to that question, but everything is kind of going back to normal

1588
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:09,141
[SPEAKER_04]: June 1st.

1589
02:32:09,641 --> 02:32:11,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1590
02:32:13,064 --> 02:32:15,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, and the guidance from a while back, I don't know if Ms.

1591
02:32:16,046 --> 02:32:24,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray is on the call, it's been a while that if you're in a meeting indoors and all parties are vaccinated, you do not have to wear a mask.

1592
02:32:25,813 --> 02:32:35,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, Mayor, I just want to clarify, in all school district facilities, these restrictions are still in place per the director of the superintendent.

1593
02:32:36,719 --> 02:32:46,285
[SPEAKER_00]: While the public health guidance is in place, as we communicated related to the recess masks, as Director Ray spoke to earlier in the evening, we've made those modifications.

1594
02:32:46,365 --> 02:32:59,533
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Medford Public School facilities, and this would frankly go for any meetings, any visitors, any community members using it, or certainly students or staff, the mask requirement is in place for the remainder of the school year.

1595
02:32:59,654 --> 02:33:04,397
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want that to be clear for community members who might be watching.

1596
02:33:08,619 --> 02:33:12,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz, if you're finished, I'll go to Member Van der Kloot, then Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

1597
02:33:12,687 --> 02:33:14,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I didn't take my hand down, sorry.

1598
02:33:15,152 --> 02:33:16,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

1599
02:33:16,294 --> 02:33:16,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Van der Kloot?

1600
02:33:18,158 --> 02:33:47,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I just wanted to mention that I do think in the future, and I don't know exactly what the governor's advisory is going to be, but there also is, there is a plus side to sometimes having Zoom meetings, either weather related or whether you members are, you know, so I'm hoping that as we go forward into this next phase, and as we figure out meetings, that we're both returning to chambers, which will be

1601
02:33:48,278 --> 02:34:01,051
[SPEAKER_09]: a delight for many of us, but also that since we've now have this capability of doing meetings by Zoom, that sometimes we might opt to do a subcommittee meeting or something by Zoom.

1602
02:34:01,932 --> 02:34:03,634
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll be interesting as we go forward.

1603
02:34:05,837 --> 02:34:06,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1604
02:34:06,477 --> 02:34:07,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

1605
02:34:07,779 --> 02:34:09,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

1606
02:34:10,809 --> 02:34:19,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So having watched the city council meeting recently where the rule was that people had to wear a mask and the public just essentially gave the middle finger to the city councilors.

1607
02:34:22,272 --> 02:34:32,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I'm wondering, since you are the presiding officer, and all of us are presiding officers in subcommittee meetings, if we are in the superintendent's conference room,

1608
02:34:33,230 --> 02:34:39,094
[SPEAKER_01]: and somebody from the public refuses to wear a mask, and the superintendent still has the authority to say a mask is required.

1609
02:34:39,975 --> 02:34:46,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to know what the next steps are when that does happen, because I would like to be clear, it will happen.

1610
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:53,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to the open meeting law, the proper course is for us to call the police.

1611
02:34:53,624 --> 02:35:00,989
[SPEAKER_01]: That just seems really a lot of a very heavy lift, but I'm not interested in being like the city council where

1612
02:35:01,922 --> 02:35:07,486
[SPEAKER_01]: They are ordered to wear a mask and the public just says, okay, and then puts it under their chin.

1613
02:35:07,926 --> 02:35:10,948
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we going to do as a school committee when that happens?

1614
02:35:10,968 --> 02:35:11,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to happen.

1615
02:35:12,389 --> 02:35:17,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, wearing a mask when you're vaccinated doesn't make any sense anymore.

1616
02:35:18,654 --> 02:35:24,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, by the way, wearing a, you know, it's fine to not wear a mask if you don't have COVID.

1617
02:35:25,250 --> 02:35:26,010
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.

1618
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:27,211
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know who's vaccinated.

1619
02:35:27,231 --> 02:35:30,372
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not gonna be checking vaccination cards when people come into these meetings.

1620
02:35:31,012 --> 02:35:38,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as we're in the school system in that building, anybody not wearing a mask should be removed.

1621
02:35:39,494 --> 02:35:40,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we do that?

1622
02:35:42,335 --> 02:35:48,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when they didn't wear them at city council meetings, although I remember whoever was presiding as president asked them to wear them.

1623
02:35:50,658 --> 02:35:52,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That was over the last several weeks.

1624
02:35:52,879 --> 02:35:55,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was before June 1st when now they're not required.

1625
02:35:55,800 --> 02:36:04,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're in a meeting in the conference room and it's all adults and we're vaccinated, we would be able to take off our masks.

1626
02:36:05,823 --> 02:36:06,483
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we would not.

1627
02:36:07,303 --> 02:36:08,424
[SPEAKER_04]: June 1st on.

1628
02:36:10,584 --> 02:36:13,245
[SPEAKER_01]: The superintendent has that authority, not us or the board of health.

1629
02:36:18,116 --> 02:36:31,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure if Madam Superintendent has even decided whether or not we're gonna have mass at meetings, but we also have to make sure that the conference rooms are televised, have capability to be televised before we move to a small conference room.

1630
02:36:35,327 --> 02:36:45,694
[SPEAKER_06]: The conference room across the way does, I know it has the Zoom capacity, so if it's a Zoom room, we would just be required to give the link,

1631
02:36:46,385 --> 02:36:55,530
[SPEAKER_06]: to the TV station, and they should be able to broadcast it or simulcast it for us.

1632
02:36:57,170 --> 02:37:11,517
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of mask usage and wearage, when people come on campus and they are processed through the front desk, if they don't have a mask, we do have disposable masks that are available.

1633
02:37:13,552 --> 02:37:25,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, if in the case someone were to have a medical condition and they were to, you know, let that be made known, then we would, you know, work with them in a capacity that we could, but the conference room across the hall.

1634
02:37:27,317 --> 02:37:46,749
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it is a smaller space, but as Dr. Cushing mentioned earlier, there is definitely increased airflow, and we do have access to additional HEPA filters if we were to need to place an additional HEPA filter within that conference room space.

1635
02:37:49,211 --> 02:37:49,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1636
02:37:49,912 --> 02:37:53,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham, then Member McLaughlin, then we have a resident that would like to say.

1637
02:37:56,035 --> 02:37:56,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1638
02:37:57,216 --> 02:38:23,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to suggest that we also ask the rules policy and equity subcommittee to follow the proceedings over the course of the next several weeks and months really to present the school committee of policy on remote participation that's compliant with the law that preserves, I think the increased participation we have seen because of Zoom

1639
02:38:24,268 --> 02:38:33,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which I think we all agree is a plus and, um, also sort of navigates, you know, lots of rules yet to be made.

1640
02:38:33,175 --> 02:38:35,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to see us, um, ask.

1641
02:38:36,537 --> 02:38:41,441
[SPEAKER_02]: The rules, policy and equity subcommittee to take this on and present something back to us.

1642
02:38:41,481 --> 02:38:44,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may even take until, you know, September of next year.

1643
02:38:45,004 --> 02:38:51,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, as member Van der Kloot said, there are, there are times and reasons why having remote meetings.

1644
02:38:52,458 --> 02:38:55,900
[SPEAKER_02]: would continue to make sense if it's allowed by law for members.

1645
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:16,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly I don't wanna lose the participation that we've experienced and the options that affords working parents to be able to join us for these meetings and go back to what we used to see in city hall chambers, which was an audience of two or three at most.

1646
02:39:18,091 --> 02:39:21,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like the rules, policy and equity subcommittee to take that on.

1647
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:23,320
[SPEAKER_02]: as it unfolds.

1648
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:34,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think the other thing that I will say is being a regular watcher of the city council meetings, I don't find them to be easy to watch in the current format.

1649
02:39:34,622 --> 02:39:47,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would also be interested in what changes are coming to chambers because I don't find those meetings very easy to watch right now with the way the camera angles are set.

1650
02:39:47,365 --> 02:39:48,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's,

1651
02:39:49,802 --> 02:40:03,868
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a real, and maybe it's just a very stark contrast with the luxuries that you get when you're looking at a Zoom screen and you can see the people speaking quite clearly, and the closed captioning that Zoom affords.

1652
02:40:03,888 --> 02:40:10,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna make sure we're not losing some of those capabilities as we make this transition, because I think the public has appreciated them.

1653
02:40:11,752 --> 02:40:12,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Graham.

1654
02:40:13,793 --> 02:40:14,793
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Nadine.

1655
02:40:17,815 --> 02:40:18,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

1656
02:40:19,097 --> 02:40:19,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, geez, I'm sorry.

1657
02:40:20,819 --> 02:40:22,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I was called by the hands on the right.

1658
02:40:22,921 --> 02:40:24,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin then named Dean.

1659
02:40:24,842 --> 02:40:25,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1660
02:40:26,103 --> 02:40:33,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to also echo the sentiment that, you know, any accessibility issues are considered for, you know, going back into chambers.

1661
02:40:33,730 --> 02:40:38,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So the closed captioning that we've had, those kinds of things, you know, are important that we maintain.

1662
02:40:39,756 --> 02:40:43,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also somebody had asked or mentioned the concern over

1663
02:40:45,183 --> 02:40:47,004
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of the microphone cleanliness, right?

1664
02:40:47,084 --> 02:40:51,187
[SPEAKER_05]: So if everybody's going up to the mic as well, like what the protocol is gonna be for that.

1665
02:40:51,627 --> 02:40:54,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's so interesting, it's things that we haven't thought about pre-pandemic.

1666
02:40:55,049 --> 02:41:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody sort of just did that and now they're a whole different, I know I'll never look at a door handle the same way again, but I think we need to, I think we need to think about those things too.

1667
02:41:06,276 --> 02:41:12,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would second the idea that we should be creating some policy around what this is gonna look like.

1668
02:41:13,043 --> 02:41:18,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, it's almost like when you watch TV and you see people touching and you're like, why are you touching?

1669
02:41:19,367 --> 02:41:21,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, okay, Nadine and then Ms.

1670
02:41:21,229 --> 02:41:21,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Kugno.

1671
02:41:24,111 --> 02:41:24,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mayor.

1672
02:41:25,071 --> 02:41:38,120
[SPEAKER_19]: I was at the city council meeting last week and I think, I mean, everybody had their masks on, but to speak, I found it that you really couldn't understand or hear somebody really clearly.

1673
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:40,942
[SPEAKER_19]: So to pull the mask down, I think it just made it

1674
02:41:41,312 --> 02:41:46,993
[SPEAKER_19]: easier for even the people on Zoom to hear what the people were saying, because the mask, you know, sometimes you can't hear.

1675
02:41:47,393 --> 02:42:00,035
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't think it was anything purposeful that they weren't, you know, listening to the city council members request, because after a while, everybody that went up to speak did pull their mask down under their chin, spoke and then put it back on.

1676
02:42:01,155 --> 02:42:02,436
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, I think it's just difficult.

1677
02:42:02,476 --> 02:42:06,236
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think they wanted just to hear, be able to have everybody hear what we were saying.

1678
02:42:06,316 --> 02:42:10,357
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't think it was anything deliberate, at least for me.

1679
02:42:10,885 --> 02:42:13,207
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I took it down, and if they said put it back up, I would.

1680
02:42:13,287 --> 02:42:16,950
[SPEAKER_19]: But for them to understand what I was saying, it was easier to pull the mask down.

1681
02:42:17,490 --> 02:42:18,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but that's it.

1682
02:42:18,751 --> 02:42:19,472
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I wanted to say.

1683
02:42:19,752 --> 02:42:20,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1684
02:42:28,419 --> 02:42:28,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1685
02:42:35,525 --> 02:42:35,805
[SPEAKER_11]: How did I?

1686
02:42:47,928 --> 02:42:49,088
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a motion on the floor.

1687
02:42:50,169 --> 02:42:53,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham, did you want that as a motion?

1688
02:42:56,114 --> 02:42:56,374
Okay.

1689
02:42:56,394 --> 02:42:57,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that sounds good.

1690
02:42:57,976 --> 02:43:00,017
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can just amend this one, that's fine.

1691
02:43:01,198 --> 02:43:03,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so motion as amended by Member Graham.

1692
02:43:03,900 --> 02:43:04,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1693
02:43:04,101 --> 02:43:05,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Kugno, did you want to speak?

1694
02:43:07,223 --> 02:43:07,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

1695
02:43:09,965 --> 02:43:10,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1696
02:43:10,265 --> 02:43:10,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.

1697
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:16,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have to re-say my name and address again, for the record?

1698
02:43:16,464 --> 02:43:17,465
[SPEAKER_11]: 871-FELSA, Ms.

1699
02:43:17,545 --> 02:43:17,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Guzman.

1700
02:43:18,806 --> 02:43:19,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1701
02:43:19,787 --> 02:43:26,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just ask that there are protocols and there's policies, but there's also common sense.

1702
02:43:28,214 --> 02:43:32,478
[SPEAKER_11]: You're offering to do a meeting both in person and on Zoom.

1703
02:43:32,858 --> 02:43:38,403
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not like you're taking away the possibility of people still watching on Zoom, but

1704
02:43:39,437 --> 02:43:47,105
[SPEAKER_11]: The people in the city, they've been asking and they're all, we all want an in-person meeting.

1705
02:43:47,505 --> 02:43:50,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not only speaking for myself, I'm speaking for a lot of people.

1706
02:43:52,530 --> 02:43:56,654
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to have that opportunity to come in person.

1707
02:43:57,214 --> 02:44:00,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people feel comfortable on Zoom, some people feel comfortable in person.

1708
02:44:02,379 --> 02:44:02,920
[SPEAKER_11]: It's time.

1709
02:44:03,417 --> 02:44:05,898
[SPEAKER_11]: it's time for people to see you.

1710
02:44:06,838 --> 02:44:18,801
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know there's a motion on there saying that maybe you'll wait for your policies and protocols to be looked at and reviewed, but that might even take until September.

1711
02:44:19,421 --> 02:44:21,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Ms.

1712
02:44:21,201 --> 02:44:27,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Gray mentioned something about September, so I just wanna make sure that we clarify that you guys aren't waiting until September.

1713
02:44:27,543 --> 02:44:31,444
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we'll be back in the chambers for our regular meeting on June 7th.

1714
02:44:32,084 --> 02:44:32,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

1715
02:44:33,003 --> 02:44:33,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1716
02:44:33,963 --> 02:44:34,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1717
02:44:34,143 --> 02:44:37,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And our two meetings that month are June 7th, June 14th, we'll be in chambers.

1718
02:44:38,525 --> 02:44:38,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1719
02:44:39,765 --> 02:44:40,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

1720
02:44:44,467 --> 02:44:46,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have my hand up, Mayor, but Member Ruseau does.

1721
02:44:47,308 --> 02:44:47,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

1722
02:44:49,469 --> 02:44:49,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

1723
02:44:50,929 --> 02:44:52,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very excited for June 7th.

1724
02:44:52,790 --> 02:44:56,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just ask that, unlike the city council, we don't have Larry.

1725
02:44:57,572 --> 02:45:00,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know Larry's title or his last name,

1726
02:45:01,193 --> 02:45:12,898
[SPEAKER_01]: but he does the check-in of everybody, they have to sign in, so the contact tracing can take place, unless we're expecting by June 7th that there'll be no more contact tracing.

1727
02:45:14,039 --> 02:45:19,482
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but if there is still contact tracing requirements, sorry, go ahead, Mayor.

1728
02:45:20,222 --> 02:45:28,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, you won't have to, but we can always put a book out, and there's always several admin at our meetings, so I'm sure we can check people in if we so choose.

1729
02:45:32,147 --> 02:45:35,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think we should decide whether we're going to do that now since the next meeting is that meeting.

1730
02:45:41,711 --> 02:45:49,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just feel like the people that think that the pandemic was a hoax aren't signing in.

1731
02:45:51,214 --> 02:45:52,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also not getting vaccinated.

1732
02:45:54,635 --> 02:45:58,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to sign in, I'm vaccinated, I have no fear of the pandemic getting me.

1733
02:45:59,917 --> 02:46:10,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get what's the point of contact tracing and even doing that effort if people will actively not sign in.

1734
02:46:12,083 --> 02:46:16,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm fine just saying we're not gonna put a pen up and we're not gonna have any kind of, it's theater is my point.

1735
02:46:17,825 --> 02:46:24,148
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody who disagrees that there's been plenty of theater, safety theater going on in some situations.

1736
02:46:24,889 --> 02:46:28,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it has not been theater, but I am not a fan of theater.

1737
02:46:29,092 --> 02:46:31,513
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs money, people's time and effort.

1738
02:46:32,034 --> 02:46:42,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be fine with no sign in and no contact tracing if we're not going to have somebody there to every person walking through the door, what's your name and address?

1739
02:46:43,461 --> 02:46:48,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they put down, you know, Pete Rose, no, what's your name?

1740
02:46:49,365 --> 02:46:51,026
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's your real name?

1741
02:46:51,907 --> 02:46:52,787
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do that.

1742
02:46:52,867 --> 02:46:54,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would be fine with no

1743
02:46:54,695 --> 02:46:55,155
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that.

1744
02:46:59,359 --> 02:46:59,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1745
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:03,141
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion on the floor is amended by member Graham.

1746
02:47:03,201 --> 02:47:04,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second?

1747
02:47:05,063 --> 02:47:05,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1748
02:47:06,204 --> 02:47:07,965

[SPEAKER_04]: We will see everybody in chambers on the 7th of June.

1763

[SPEAKER_04]: Last up, we have one condolence.

1764
02:47:37,569 --> 02:47:47,136
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford School Committee extends its condolences to the family of Kathleen Ellen Mortel, mother-in-law of Joanne Mortel of the Medford Public Schools Business Office.

1765
02:47:47,977 --> 02:47:49,498
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take a moment of silence.

1766
02:47:59,995 --> 02:48:00,355
