00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:55,486
[SPEAKER_16]: You can hear me?

5
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:57,027
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little funky, but yeah.

6
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:58,288
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really funky.

7
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,989
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't hear anything, I don't think.

8
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:01,010

00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:22,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hear you, Marta.

10
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hear you perfectly.

11
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:25,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me?

12
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,602
[SPEAKER_16]: We hear your sound, but it sounds like a garbled robot.

13
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:53,009
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

14
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:22,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me.

15
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,272

[SPEAKER_10]: I think you sound better now.

17
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:43,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I heard something that was intelligible.

18
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Libby, can you hear us now?

19
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:50,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's great.

20
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,350

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,170

00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:56,331

24
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:56,471

51
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:06,070
[SPEAKER_08]: There are two corrections that need to be made to member Morell's name.

52
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole Bramley was transposed for Nicole Morell, so we'll make those updates.

53
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:24,054
[SPEAKER_08]: is there, before we take a motion to approve, just a reminder, the finance subcommittee in particular, if you were not present at the meeting, join us.

00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:48,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

55
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

56
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:51,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

57
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:57,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

58
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,937
[SPEAKER_09]: We hear just like gobbledygook, but not words.

59
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,918
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can hear the mic is on.

60
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,959
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not intelligible.

61
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Middle, so it's a little closer.

62
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:38,027
[SPEAKER_15]: It's talking to.

63
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:40,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear us now?

64
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:42,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's better.

65
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:42,409
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

66
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Still better?

67
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Marta, Marissa, how is it for you guys?

68
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:47,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds the same.

69
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,840
[SPEAKER_10]: It could wear a bad way.

70
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,220
[SPEAKER_10]: In a bad way.

71
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:10,405
[SPEAKER_16]: We're lighting up, so just trying to figure it out.

72
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:21,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Libby, can you hear us now?

73
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:23,232
[SPEAKER_09]: That's better.

74
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:24,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I can at least understand you.

75
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:28,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, just take it.

76
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:28,865
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll take it.

77
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:29,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

78
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,637
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that?

79
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,038
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

80
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:58,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

81
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:00,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

82
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:04,019
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

83
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:04,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Perfect.

84
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:23,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so as I was saying, I don't know what you all were able to hear, so I'm just going to repeat what I said.

85
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:31,806
[SPEAKER_08]: The finance subcommittee was streamed to YouTube, so if you weren't at the meeting, I would encourage you to watch.

86
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:38,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Alicia Hunt from our planning office joined us, and we had a good conversation about

87
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:47,667
[SPEAKER_08]: potential sites for the high school should this site not be the one that is desirable from a planner's perspective.

88
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:51,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So it just was like a really sort of interesting conversation.

89
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Particularly, we talked a lot.

90
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:54,793
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked a little bit about transportation.

91
00:11:54,813 --> 00:12:07,023
[SPEAKER_08]: And her planner's hat says that transportation should not be the reason we do or don't do something with the building, because transportation

92
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:14,318
[SPEAKER_08]: can be moved to align with where the building ultimately resides.

93
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:24,206
[SPEAKER_08]: So just like good information, more sort of like fact finding and starting to engage the right people that I would recommend everybody listen to if they have a minute.

94
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:34,475
[SPEAKER_08]: There are two amendments that do need to be made to correctly list Nicole Morell in both the minutes and in the motion.

95
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And then other than that, I will look for a motion to approve the consent agenda.

96
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:45,666
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no other objections.

97
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:51,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion approved by Mayor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Dr. Edward Vinson.

98
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, roll call.

99
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:57,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny Graham, yes.

100
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:58,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn, yes.

101
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:00,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edward Vinson, yes.

102
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:01,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Suzanne Galluzzi, yes.

103
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:04,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Cushion?

104
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:05,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

105
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:06,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Marta Cabral?

106
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

107
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Libby Brown?

108
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:09,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

109
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:11,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Marissa Desmond?

110
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:12,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

111
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:14,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Maria Dorsey?

112
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:14,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

113
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:15,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Brian Hilliard?

114
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:15,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

115
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:17,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Tracy Keene?

116
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:17,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

117
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily Lazzaro?

118
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:19,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

119
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole Morell?

120
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

121
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Erin Orapade?

122
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:22,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

123
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:25,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke Prisner?

124
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,555
[SPEAKER_08]: 14 in the affirmative, one absent.

125
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:30,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion, the minutes are approved.

126
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:40,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the next thing on our list is actually, um, to take what I'm going to call a brief introductory tour of the building.

127
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:45,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's at least some number of people who have never done that before here.

128
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:52,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, or maybe you've seen bits and parts of the building, but I thought it would be a good time to sort of give everyone

129
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:58,827
[SPEAKER_08]: some sort of helpful framework that says like, what even all are we talking about that goes on in this building today?

130
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:12,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we wanted to spend a little bit of time and we're gonna try to be back here by seven to take you all on a little walking tour of the facility.

131
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:19,483
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those of you that are on the phone and have joined us remotely, we're gonna,

132
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:26,057
[SPEAKER_08]: not take you with us so that you don't feel like you're in the Blair Witch Project as we move around the building.

133
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:37,144
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will put up a note on the Zoom just so people know that we're on a walking tour of the building and we expect to be back about seven.

134
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:43,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those of you who have joined us remotely, we'll see you back here at seven.

135
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm really starting to be sick and miss this.

136
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:50,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there an opportunity in the future for like Marissa and I to take a look around?

137
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:52,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, absolutely.

138
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,339
[SPEAKER_09]: For another meeting or something?

139
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think we'll do this more than one time because right now, again, we're like in the middle of the paperwork phase.

140
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:04,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it might be helpful at a high level, but when we start talking about

141
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:11,312
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, when we start getting into the place where we're talking about design and feasibility, there will be plenty of opportunities for us to do that again.

142
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:16,276
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be lots of opportunities even for the community to come in and do that as part of the communication plan.

143
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,617
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, absolutely.

144
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:29,206
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, and certainly if you want to come in before then just let me know and I'll have I'll arrange it with somebody to give you a personal tour.

145
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:30,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

146
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:30,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

147
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:31,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

148
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:39,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we're gonna go on a little walking tour here.

149
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.

150
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:44,720
[SPEAKER_16]: It's getting worse.

151
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:49,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting worse.

152
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:50,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all gas.

153
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:04,706
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw that when I came down.

154
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Libby, Marta.

155
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:07,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here.

156
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,241
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

157
01:02:08,281 --> 01:02:08,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, everyone.

158
01:02:08,761 --> 01:02:09,621
[SPEAKER_16]: It should focus.

159
01:02:09,721 --> 01:02:10,101
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

160
01:02:34,553 --> 01:02:40,176
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just got back from a brief walking tour of the building.

161
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:46,539
[SPEAKER_08]: We saw just like a little bit of everything, just to give people some perspective on what all this building is about.

162
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:52,322
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, it's pluses and minuses, I guess I'll say, and we'll leave it at that.

163
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:59,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, we have lots of marble at our disposal, minus, you know, many minuses.

164
01:02:59,345 --> 01:03:02,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So having...

165
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:19,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the next item on our agenda is to take a look at our chapter 74 viability form, which we looked at last time.

166
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's in your packet.

167
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:21,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent it, we sent it out yesterday.

168
01:03:25,214 --> 01:03:39,861
[SPEAKER_08]: We at our 520 school committee meeting, Chad and Dr. Cushing presented to the school committee about some things that they would like to see us study from an expansion perspective.

169
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:46,164
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are four programs, auto, electrical,

170
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:53,443
[SPEAKER_08]: cosmetology and health assisting that are current programs here that are space constrained.

171
01:03:53,463 --> 01:04:03,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are, we, the school committee unanimously approved that we study an expansion of those programs from a space perspective when we get to the feasibility study.

172
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:25,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And in addition, the school committee approved that we study dental assisting, veterinary science, criminal justice and protective services, plumbing and HVAC, and information systems, networking, cybersecurity, all as separate vocations.

173
01:04:25,298 --> 01:04:32,301
[SPEAKER_08]: So five new vocational programs under study from a space perspective for the vocational school as well.

174
01:04:32,361 --> 01:04:33,402
[SPEAKER_08]: So the school,

175
01:04:34,907 --> 01:04:42,050
[SPEAKER_08]: MSBA requires that we follow all the rules and regs that DESE has around Chapter 74 programming.

176
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: So they all require licensure.

177
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:47,153
[SPEAKER_08]: They all require like all the things that would normally have to happen.

178
01:04:48,293 --> 01:04:52,215
[SPEAKER_08]: They also will ask DESE to weigh in on us studying these programs.

179
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:57,878
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a variety of criteria, including that there's demand in the area for those programs.

180
01:04:59,237 --> 01:05:03,181
[SPEAKER_08]: and that the school committee is in support of studying those programs.

181
01:05:03,201 --> 01:05:12,549
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've checked all of those boxes, that presentation and the vote and the minutes will be sent to MSBA with this form.

182
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:18,214
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to bring this form back to you all.

183
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I did talk to our contact at MSBA this morning,

184
01:05:23,911 --> 01:05:34,055
[SPEAKER_08]: We are not required to take votes on these eligibility program documents as the school building committee, but I think it's important that this group provide their input and weigh in and take a vote.

185
01:05:34,455 --> 01:05:36,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to see us do that.

186
01:05:37,257 --> 01:05:48,381
[SPEAKER_08]: My hope is that if you all have any comments tonight, having reviewed this, we can take a vote to approve this document as amended, and then we will submit this document.

187
01:05:48,441 --> 01:05:52,083
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to open the floor in case anybody had questions.

188
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:59,186
[SPEAKER_08]: comments, thoughts about what is here, before we move any sort of approval.

189
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:00,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke?

190
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:03,789
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to check specialized spaces.

191
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:08,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to clarify, open night is not an auditorium.

192
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:11,914
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a learning space to gather students together in the community.

193
01:06:11,954 --> 01:06:15,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we plan out the gym, which is around the gym.

194
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:16,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's.

195
01:06:19,986 --> 01:06:22,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Other forms, other forms.

196
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:25,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, auditorium, auditorium is ringing a bell.

197
01:06:25,613 --> 01:06:28,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, sorry, this is the chapter 74 one.

198
01:06:28,758 --> 01:06:30,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we reviewed it last week.

199
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:36,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And since then, or not last week, but at our last meeting,

200
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Since then, all the information has been filled out.

201
01:06:42,113 --> 01:06:46,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Our proposed capacity information has been fleshed out.

202
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:54,622
[SPEAKER_08]: We've noted the school committee's support for the new programs and finished filling out the rest of this form.

203
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:58,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to make sure there weren't any other questions about this document.

204
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:15,449
Chad.

205
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:17,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is a waitlist and

206
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:12,224
[SPEAKER_15]: We did, up until last year it dwindled because our enrollment was rising, so at the same time we took less students from outside the communities.

207
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:15,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now we can't take any because we're small.

208
01:08:15,748 --> 01:08:21,254
I don't know, I mean if you ask me, my philosophy is if there's kids in

209
01:08:32,452 --> 01:08:33,432
[SPEAKER_15]: can't take it.

210
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:41,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the only other issue is we don't get to decide.

211
01:08:43,157 --> 01:08:46,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we don't function like a standalone vocational school.

212
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:47,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

213
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:47,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

214
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So he could bring in

215
01:09:03,627 --> 01:09:12,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say though, a few years ago, I was bringing in folks to $200,000 a year, which is what's kept us afloat in tough times.

216
01:09:28,548 --> 01:09:29,809
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.

217
01:09:29,849 --> 01:09:49,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I think the other sort of thing because we had this actually this conversation like very early like back in February, the first time we met, where I was like, Hey guys I need you to like really think about all these things and fill out these forms and like, we need to do a lickety split, so they haven't like kicked me out of their office just yet which is nice.

218
01:09:50,123 --> 01:10:13,670
[SPEAKER_08]: but we had this conversation and I think there's like the other variables are you know yes MSBA is going to pay for a portion of the building but we also as a community are going to pay for a portion of the building and it's a much more complicated story to tell to say we're going to make it bigger than our students need and we're going to pay for that at a hundred percent because our enrollment certification won't support

219
01:10:16,452 --> 01:10:18,914
[SPEAKER_08]: to be enrollment from other districts, right?

220
01:10:18,974 --> 01:10:21,777
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's sort of the balance.

221
01:10:21,797 --> 01:10:30,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we actually sort of stayed towards like the current model of if there's capacity, we would continue to take students like Chad does.

222
01:10:31,525 --> 01:10:40,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And with the expansion, like the expansion that we're talking about and the new programming, I think we could see again that there's capacity across the programming, but

223
01:10:41,014 --> 01:10:56,839
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit hard to say I think but that was sort of the calculus as we were thinking about how like the point of view to take to put this stuff together which was like we felt like it would be too hard of a sell to the community to say let's pay 100% for the extra space

224
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:07,444
[SPEAKER_08]: for programming to tuition in which may or may not ultimately sort of get us where we need to go.

225
01:11:07,565 --> 01:11:10,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the conversation that we had certainly.

226
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:18,030
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just like one point of view, but that was sort of where we landed as we put this together.

227
01:11:23,203 --> 01:11:25,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Other questions, comments, concerns?

228
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:26,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria?

229
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:30,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how accurate this is supposed to be, where the library is concerned.

230
01:11:31,107 --> 01:11:36,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It does just say that it's a library with... Oh, hold your thoughts just one second.

231
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,951
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Chapter 74 form?

232
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:41,692
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, you're fine.

233
01:11:41,732 --> 01:11:43,833
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to you in just one second.

234
01:11:46,054 --> 01:11:49,475
[SPEAKER_08]: So are there any other Chapter 74 questions?

235
01:11:55,632 --> 01:11:58,333
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw the last name and I remember the connection.

236
01:11:58,373 --> 01:11:59,113
Miles was on the way.

237
01:11:59,213 --> 01:12:05,636
[SPEAKER_15]: It was for a short period of time.

238
01:12:05,856 --> 01:12:10,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so there's a motion on the floor to approve this document by Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

239
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

240
01:12:11,658 --> 01:12:13,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Second by Member Olapade.

241
01:12:13,919 --> 01:12:14,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hold on.

242
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:21,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you just remember everybody's name?

243
01:12:21,225 --> 01:12:27,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I could almost do it, but I wrote in my brand new notebook in the front, so I remember you all.

244
01:12:28,027 --> 01:12:29,307
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, Jenny Graham, yes.

245
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:30,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary Lungo-Koehn, yes.

246
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:33,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edward Vincent, yes.

247
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:34,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Galussi, absent.

248
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:35,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Right behind you.

249
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:36,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Galussi.

250
01:12:36,169 --> 01:12:36,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say yes.

251
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:37,889

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

257
01:12:44,951 --> 01:12:45,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Marta Cabral.

258
01:12:46,332 --> 01:12:46,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:12:47,935 --> 01:12:48,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Libby Brown.

260
01:12:49,216 --> 01:12:49,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

261
01:12:51,098 --> 01:12:51,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Maria Dorsey.

262
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:52,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

263
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Brian Hilliard.

264
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:53,400

[SPEAKER_08]: Tracy Keene.

266
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:55,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

267
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:56,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily Lazzaro.

268
01:12:56,642 --> 01:12:56,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

269
01:12:57,043 --> 01:12:57,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole Morell.

270
01:12:58,043 --> 01:12:58,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

271
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Erina Lapate.

272
01:12:59,505 --> 01:12:59,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

273
01:12:59,765 --> 01:13:00,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke Kreisner.

274
01:13:01,827 --> 01:13:02,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

275
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,649
[SPEAKER_08]: 15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

276
01:13:04,769 --> 01:13:06,090
[SPEAKER_08]: The form is approved.

277
01:13:09,673 --> 01:13:10,754
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, Karen.

278
01:13:13,149 --> 01:13:23,336
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will submit that, that will be the third of five deliverables that we are on the hook for to be on our way out of this eligibility phase.

279
01:13:23,436 --> 01:13:26,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So excellent work, thank you everyone.

280
01:13:27,178 --> 01:13:36,344
[SPEAKER_08]: The other document that you have in front of you is item number five on the agenda, which is the educational profile.

281
01:13:37,524 --> 01:13:40,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm going to take a few minutes and just walk through this.

282
01:13:40,467 --> 01:13:44,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think there's probably a lot of questions and this is still very much a work in progress.

283
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:50,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we are aiming to get this, um, updated and completed as quickly as possible.

284
01:13:51,678 --> 01:13:56,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I'm hoping by next week we'll have something that's pretty darn close for you all to approve.

285
01:13:57,223 --> 01:14:01,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but let me walk you through what's here and maybe we can take questions like section by section.

286
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:07,993
[SPEAKER_08]: So section one talks about district-wide facilities as they exist right now.

287
01:14:08,213 --> 01:14:11,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is to say, this is what is in the building right now.

288
01:14:12,857 --> 01:14:18,301
[SPEAKER_08]: The chart that you see was widely pre-populated by MSBA.

289
01:14:18,381 --> 01:14:24,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're trying to get a view of the whole entire district and the square footage space.

290
01:14:24,145 --> 01:14:29,950
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to make some updates and some adjustments, particularly to the square footage that they had on file.

291
01:14:31,169 --> 01:14:32,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So those have been updated.

292
01:14:34,591 --> 01:14:38,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Item B is a description of how students progress.

293
01:14:38,713 --> 01:14:39,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

294
01:14:39,254 --> 01:14:40,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there questions about?

295
01:14:40,194 --> 01:14:40,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

296
01:14:40,294 --> 01:14:42,616
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the science lab count?

297
01:14:42,656 --> 01:14:47,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it an addition, reno, or is that column last passed?

298
01:14:56,881 --> 01:14:59,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we should actually, that's a good call.

299
01:14:59,342 --> 01:15:04,483
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll put the science labs in that field.

300
01:15:04,563 --> 01:15:05,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I can add that.

301
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:07,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Next one down.

302
01:15:08,224 --> 01:15:08,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

303
01:15:09,345 --> 01:15:10,605
[SPEAKER_15]: What is B and A, HS?

304
01:15:11,865 --> 01:15:13,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it their form that they pre-populated?

305
01:15:13,626 --> 01:15:14,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

306
01:15:14,046 --> 01:15:14,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

307
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:16,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it's vocational or academic.

308
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:19,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm guessing it's, yeah, the vocational piece.

309
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:20,288
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that?

310
01:15:25,618 --> 01:15:27,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it an agricultural school at any time?

311
01:15:27,499 --> 01:15:27,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

312
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,681
[SPEAKER_08]: We would love that.

313
01:15:30,602 --> 01:15:33,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I can ask and we can clear that up.

314
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:34,585
[SPEAKER_04]: One more item.

315
01:15:34,605 --> 01:15:34,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

316
01:15:34,745 --> 01:15:35,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the 330 plus the 845

317
01:15:55,646 --> 01:15:57,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

318
01:15:58,928 --> 01:16:03,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so everyone's aware, these were pre-populated by them.

319
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:14,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I did update, after reaching out to the architects of the five newer schools, those numbers to be in line with what those architects said.

320
01:16:14,715 --> 01:16:19,897
[SPEAKER_00]: There were minor discrepancies up to about 10,000 square feet.

321
01:16:21,078 --> 01:16:25,120
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so we can double check the square footage of Medford High and the vocational school.

322
01:16:30,112 --> 01:16:34,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Question B really talks about how students move through the district.

323
01:16:34,796 --> 01:16:40,701
[SPEAKER_08]: So this talks about, you know, they're wanting to know things like, is it a lottery?

324
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:42,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a neighborhood school?

325
01:16:42,242 --> 01:16:44,024
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you move from fifth to sixth?

326
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:56,735
[SPEAKER_08]: So this narrative talks about our four elementary schools, you know, how many schools we have, and it talks about the transitions from five to six being a lottery for the two middle schools.

327
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:14,419
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody comes to Medford High and then it does talk a little bit about the freshman exploratory program as well as like how students pick into a CTE program if they're desired and then it sort of references the wait list and references our chapter 74 form.

328
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:21,741
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just really to give the folks that are trying to get a feel for our district like how do students move about the district all the time.

329
01:17:23,141 --> 01:17:25,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Is therapeutic high school a telemark

330
01:17:26,694 --> 01:17:28,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions about this section B?

331
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:53,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

332
01:17:53,345 --> 01:17:58,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Section two, this is where you'll see sort of the, again, current state.

333
01:17:59,533 --> 01:18:03,559
[SPEAKER_08]: How many classrooms are considered each of these things?

334
01:18:04,495 --> 01:18:18,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so thank you to Marta and her team, among others who went through and counted all the spaces in the building to say, like, here are all the things that are happening in this building.

335
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:27,215
[SPEAKER_08]: We will do another review of this, but this is just to sort of tally up all of the spaces that exist in this building.

336
01:18:29,257 --> 01:18:30,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and then

337
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:37,812
[SPEAKER_08]: In a related question, item B talks about like, how are these spaces currently used?

338
01:18:38,973 --> 01:18:54,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is a narrative around, as the form requests, course spaces, specialized spaces, non-traditional spaces, and class policy, class five policy, all of which are requested in the question in the form.

339
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah, we can add that.

340
01:19:35,059 --> 01:19:35,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Maria?

341
01:19:35,419 --> 01:19:37,260
[SPEAKER_08]: The medium of the library?

342
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:37,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

343
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:44,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is only with the library and the CCSR, but there are multiple spaces in the library.

344
01:19:44,223 --> 01:19:44,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

345
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:47,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Classrooms, labs, maybe space.

346
01:19:47,525 --> 01:19:49,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that need to be called medium?

347
01:19:49,805 --> 01:19:50,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

348
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:51,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it does.

349
01:19:52,327 --> 01:19:57,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So can I send this to you and have you make some edits to it and send it back to us?

350
01:19:57,789 --> 01:19:58,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

351
01:19:59,310 --> 01:19:59,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Maria.

352
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:10,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions about the information in item B?

353
01:20:14,637 --> 01:20:18,280
[SPEAKER_08]: We also talk a little bit on the top of page seven about

354
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:26,552
[SPEAKER_08]: the some of the rentals that happen with our community partners, as well as the central office being housed here.

355
01:20:27,873 --> 01:20:39,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of the all of the administrative offices, the administrative offices, I believe, are another thing where they're not considered part of the school from a reimbursement perspective, but

356
01:20:39,797 --> 01:20:46,201
[SPEAKER_08]: There obviously has to be an administrative space available to operate the school.

357
01:20:46,301 --> 01:20:55,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, there's any number of questions about how that could happen in our like new reconfigured space, whether they stay where they are or they.

358
01:20:56,868 --> 01:21:03,171
[SPEAKER_08]: perhaps move to the Curtis-Tufts because we want to co-locate the Curtis-Tufts program on this campus.

359
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's any number of things that the feasibility study will look at.

360
01:21:06,832 --> 01:21:11,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the important thing for us is just to say, yes, the administrative offices are housed in this building.

361
01:21:11,994 --> 01:21:14,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end of all of this, they need a home.

362
01:21:14,755 --> 01:21:18,677
[SPEAKER_08]: So any questions about B?

363
01:21:23,303 --> 01:21:27,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Um item c again current state what is our current

364
01:21:28,883 --> 01:21:33,025
[SPEAKER_08]: teaching methodology, class size policies, et cetera.

365
01:21:33,725 --> 01:21:57,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a description, thank you to the administrative team who has taken a lot of time to try to be complete and comprehensive about both like the teaching methodology and some of the specialized programming we have within the building, including the TLP program, the transitions program, our English learners,

366
01:21:59,190 --> 01:21:59,750
[SPEAKER_08]: et cetera.

367
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:11,418
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have some conversation about technology in this section, and then some of the things that are quite limiting around reliable connectivity access to the internet, et cetera, at the bottom.

368
01:22:11,438 --> 01:22:15,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions about this so far?

369
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:27,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, section three,

370
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,934
[SPEAKER_08]: is about what are we proposing?

371
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:34,396
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it that we want to see in this building?

372
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:38,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have a conversation with our MSBA contact today and

373
01:22:41,045 --> 01:23:04,403
[SPEAKER_08]: we did I did ask some questions about what sort of the finality of what is in this document and she assured me that this is like a jumping off point so that MSBA can get a feel for the kind of building we're envisioning and that whoever we ultimately bring on as an owner's project manager or to do a feasibility study can start to learn about us through these documents that we've had to create.

374
01:23:05,623 --> 01:23:12,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason I was asking is because I did have a chance to go to Arlington and perhaps sometime this summer we'll try to schedule another tour with them.

375
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:30,413
[SPEAKER_08]: There were spaces in the high school that like if you asked us to fill out a document today to say what should be in this high school, like we couldn't envision that space because it's just not something any of us have ever like seen or considered as an option because it doesn't exist here.

376
01:23:30,533 --> 01:23:32,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to make sure that

377
01:23:34,662 --> 01:23:39,804
[SPEAKER_08]: what we put here doesn't limit the thinking of the people who are coming in who build school buildings for a living.

378
01:23:40,044 --> 01:23:43,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And they assured me that, no, this is a jumping off point.

379
01:23:44,565 --> 01:23:56,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Very much, they want to know sort of where our head is at and what they're thinking about and what we're thinking about, but also that all of that visioning will happen led by the folks doing the feasibility study.

380
01:23:56,950 --> 01:24:00,111
[SPEAKER_08]: So those designers will really sort of lead that charge.

381
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:23,564
[SPEAKER_08]: The other conversation that I had today was with one of our Medford High School nurses and our district physician, and they reached out knowing that we were sort of in this pipeline and process to ask about whether we should be trying to provide space for an in-school health clinic.

382
01:24:24,504 --> 01:24:42,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And they talked about, Dr. Sabia talked about some of the programs that he is part of in Malden, in Everett, and in Revere, where they partner with Cambridge Health Alliance and they provide health services here that are over and above what happens in a nurse's office.

383
01:24:43,571 --> 01:24:51,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they had some particular information and insights about the kind of space that they would need to be able to hold such a facility.

384
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:57,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Most often those programs start out as grant funded by the Department of Public Health, which sounds amazing.

385
01:24:59,185 --> 01:25:00,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they just wanted to say like,

386
01:25:01,227 --> 01:25:18,310
[SPEAKER_08]: hey like we just want to make sure you know that we're here and we're thinking about these things um so that's something that I told her like we needed to like connect back with the district administration and talk about that and figure out like if and how it should go on this form but you could you should maybe expect to see some change there on the form in the next

387
01:25:18,931 --> 01:25:19,191
[SPEAKER_08]: week.

388
01:25:19,231 --> 01:25:23,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had like a 30 minute conversation with them and my wheels were turning.

389
01:25:23,314 --> 01:25:27,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, this, this is the time to say we're envisioning something like that as a possibility.

390
01:25:28,136 --> 01:25:32,159
[SPEAKER_08]: We certainly want to study how to have and provide that kind of space.

391
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:36,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Questions about that, Luke?

392
01:25:36,702 --> 01:25:37,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

393
01:25:37,322 --> 01:25:44,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions about AJ last sentence?

394
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,102
[SPEAKER_13]: due to the structure and the age of the building limits.

395
01:25:53,883 --> 01:25:54,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

396
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:55,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

397
01:25:58,907 --> 01:25:59,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

398
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:03,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Luke, did you have a question?

399
01:26:03,971 --> 01:26:14,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so maybe just sort of wanted to speak, if it's possible, about the key aspect of the scope of this.

400
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:19,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It is focused almost entirely on security spaces, and it does not seem

401
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,000
[SPEAKER_02]: so scanning quickly.

402
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:27,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Any consideration of the environment, the natural environment that surrounds the school, right?

403
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:32,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you drop a school in the middle of the city, your surrounding environment looks a certain way.

404
01:26:32,643 --> 01:26:36,023
[SPEAKER_02]: If you drop it on the edge of the fells, it looks different.

405
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:42,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly there's athletic fields that have some aspect, some portion of the property.

406
01:26:43,345 --> 01:26:46,006
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be a desire to have outdoor eating spaces.

407
01:26:46,646 --> 01:26:50,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't seem like any of that was written about,

408
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:55,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And perhaps this is a document for that.

409
01:26:55,557 --> 01:26:56,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is actually.

410
01:26:56,598 --> 01:26:58,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I think that's a great suggestion.

411
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,322
[SPEAKER_08]: We can add all of that in.

412
01:27:02,002 --> 01:27:02,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And then

413
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:10,605
[SPEAKER_08]: If any of you, the McGlynn Playground project is under construction right now.

414
01:27:11,646 --> 01:27:17,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And it actually is an amazing use of outdoor space, and particularly for outdoor classrooms, et cetera.

415
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:19,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So keep your eyes on that project.

416
01:27:19,292 --> 01:27:22,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be done sometime this summer, hopefully before school starts.

417
01:27:23,935 --> 01:27:25,857
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is really stunning.

418
01:27:26,057 --> 01:27:29,019
[SPEAKER_08]: And the outside space is very, very amazing.

419
01:27:32,967 --> 01:27:34,189
[SPEAKER_08]: be thinking about that, too.

420
01:27:34,369 --> 01:27:40,738
[SPEAKER_08]: And at one point, if I remember, we went after a big grant.

421
01:27:41,519 --> 01:27:45,124
[SPEAKER_08]: This was years ago, because it was before Chad's time.

422
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:58,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Suzanne was at the Brooks, Joan you were here, and it was the entire grant was written to become a like very Fells-centric educational program.

423
01:27:58,928 --> 01:28:01,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that ring a bell to you all?

424
01:28:02,549 --> 01:28:03,989
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a high school grant.

425
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:15,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it was through Bloomberg Foundations or it was some big, big, big grant where like it would have re-envisioned this building and it was architected by Heidi Riccio and

426
01:28:18,529 --> 01:28:21,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget, Edward, no.

427
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:24,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Perella, thank you, Mr. Perella.

428
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:36,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And they submitted this very significant grant that had a lot to do with sort of being anchored to the fells as like a central like teaching point.

429
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:39,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that ring any bells to anybody who's been around for a long time?

430
01:28:40,122 --> 01:28:46,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to the structure, but I know that there was work done to create like

431
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:53,157
[SPEAKER_01]: trails within the fells and to create some outdoor space within the fells, but I don't know.

432
01:28:53,297 --> 01:28:56,079
[SPEAKER_08]: This was just a grant application, like we didn't get it.

433
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:05,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a grant application and we didn't get the grants, but there was something submitted.

434
01:29:05,023 --> 01:29:13,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just I wonder if there is something in there if we can locate it that would be worth

435
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:32,246
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking about in terms of inclusion from an outdoor space perspective, because if I remember correctly, the whole entire like genesis of the program they were proposing had to do with like being very anchored to the fact that the fell sat right here.

436
01:29:33,726 --> 01:29:34,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole?

437
01:29:34,807 --> 01:29:35,167
Yes.

438
01:29:35,507 --> 01:29:36,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

439
01:29:36,568 --> 01:29:37,188
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go first.

440
01:29:37,808 --> 01:29:39,609
You changed that thread.

441
01:29:39,789 --> 01:29:43,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'm a little, the building itself, I guess, for the design, it's gonna be

442
01:29:44,349 --> 01:29:46,070
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable, resilient, blah, blah, blah.

443
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:56,133
[SPEAKER_04]: How much of the outdoor space do we have to come up with and ask for, as far as like resiliency and mitigation, or is that being tangible?

444
01:29:57,074 --> 01:30:01,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it can't hurt for us to describe our intentions, right?

445
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:07,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that we, you know, that we do have climate concerns on this,

446
01:30:08,781 --> 01:30:10,404
[SPEAKER_08]: on this physical site, right?

447
01:30:10,424 --> 01:30:15,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we have had issues because we sit right by the belt and every now and again the water pours in.

448
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:24,503
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think to your point and to Luke's point, like we certainly need to make some space in this document to talk about the fields that are up high.

449
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:27,425
[SPEAKER_08]: They are at their end of life.

450
01:30:27,525 --> 01:30:31,388
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like more rubber than grass at this point.

451
01:30:32,049 --> 01:30:34,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So those fields need to be taken care of.

452
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:38,774
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a football practice field that's very much in disrepair.

453
01:30:39,234 --> 01:30:45,699
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another practice field up there that I'm sure somebody will tell me has a name and I don't know what it is.

454
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:51,303
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are all these other like little things all over the campus.

455
01:30:51,543 --> 01:30:54,926
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if like we were like dreaming really big,

456
01:30:55,822 --> 01:30:59,943
[SPEAKER_08]: you wouldn't have to go across town to get to the football stadium.

457
01:30:59,983 --> 01:31:06,465
[SPEAKER_08]: You wouldn't have to go somewhere else to get to a softball field or a baseball field or a track, right?

458
01:31:06,565 --> 01:31:21,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe some sort of, maybe we can add something that talks about a more cohesive vision for our athletics properties as part of this project that service the students here.

459
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:22,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul?

460
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:24,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, I feel like

461
01:31:25,629 --> 01:31:51,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember if it was the Oklahoma school that we saw the video for, some of us saw, but we did go to, I've been to Arlington, I drive by the Watertown High School being built right now, and I drove by Winchester's when they were being built, and all of these schools seem to have something in common, that school is the walls,

462
01:31:54,599 --> 01:31:56,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's no integration in nature at all.

463
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:03,364
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, I mean, we have probably more than most of those places because we have those corridors.

464
01:32:04,065 --> 01:32:24,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just feel like, while intentional spaces for the classroom do seem important, I just feel like students should walk through the doors of a school building and then get completely encapsulated and start to walk out the doors, like nature grants

465
01:32:24,924 --> 01:32:29,087
[SPEAKER_03]: climate is getting hotter, but there's no integration with nature at all.

466
01:32:29,167 --> 01:32:37,652
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no intention that the students are in and out of the building in any way in any of those schools that I described.

467
01:32:38,313 --> 01:32:42,276
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very much in the clinical field.

468
01:32:42,976 --> 01:32:44,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if we have any good examples

469
01:32:51,938 --> 01:32:53,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that works.

470
01:32:54,139 --> 01:32:56,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we were going to have an orchard.

471
01:32:56,999 --> 01:32:58,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Shooters behind the trees.

472
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:03,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But are we going to build a facility in prison?

473
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:20,159
[SPEAKER_03]: share if I can say, are we going to build a place?

474
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:21,199
[SPEAKER_07]: We already have that.

475
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:22,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Luke?

476
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:25,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of discussion.

477
01:33:25,201 --> 01:33:25,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

478
01:33:25,741 --> 01:33:33,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this could be an opportunity to perhaps establish a defining, at least exterior, character for the school.

479
01:33:33,244 --> 01:33:33,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.

480
01:33:33,464 --> 01:33:34,604
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the above the fouls.

481
01:33:35,124 --> 01:33:35,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

482
01:33:35,585 --> 01:33:36,965
[SPEAKER_02]: We're surrounded by natural beauty.

483
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:43,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a rare sort of promontory where you can see downtown from bedroom.

484
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:43,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

485
01:33:44,008 --> 01:33:44,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of special.

486
01:33:44,848 --> 01:33:45,228
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare.

487
01:33:48,945 --> 01:33:59,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Somerville's Healy Middle School has it, and granted, they're not throughout by nature, but they really did a wonderful job in making that front and center when you go to school.

488
01:34:00,212 --> 01:34:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do something like that too.

489
01:34:01,653 --> 01:34:08,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Our surroundings could be a sort of defining aspect of at least the exterior of the school's character.

490
01:34:09,558 --> 01:34:09,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

491
01:34:10,658 --> 01:34:10,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily?

492
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:14,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a comment sort of similar to

493
01:34:15,174 --> 01:34:22,681
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about the possibility of greater openness and leaning into the assets of the school.

494
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:34,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Something I'd like to mention that we could maybe integrate into section four if we're, I don't know if we're here yet, but community engagement that

495
01:34:35,418 --> 01:34:36,299
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not quite there.

496
01:34:36,519 --> 01:34:39,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want me to wait?

497
01:34:39,764 --> 01:34:40,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

498
01:34:40,485 --> 01:34:51,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Greenfield Community College has a unique outdoor leadership program where students can earn an associate's degree in orienteering, canoeing, hiking.

499
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:55,522
[SPEAKER_00]: and being leaders of those types of things.

500
01:34:56,043 --> 01:35:03,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Those programs really dovetail well with environmental science classes and your imagination can run wild.

501
01:35:03,868 --> 01:35:08,831
[SPEAKER_00]: It's learning ropes, all these types of things that I think would dovetail nicely.

502
01:35:10,157 --> 01:35:29,903
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be an opportunity for us to talk with Bunker Hill Community College as we look at our pathways for dual enrollment and other things along those lines to see if that would be a partnership that they would be interested in forging over the next couple of years, because it is only in Greenfield.

503
01:35:31,203 --> 01:35:37,325
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that type of a program here would offer a tremendous draw

504
01:35:38,602 --> 01:35:44,245
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would be a great opportunity for our students here and as well as that connection with Bunker Hill.

505
01:35:46,346 --> 01:36:03,696
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I've heard like a million good ideas so far and I'm wondering if there are any volunteers who might take a shot at like a paragraph or some sort of narrative about any of the topics that we've talked about so far to sort of help

506
01:36:04,821 --> 01:36:31,666
[SPEAKER_08]: make light work of what is like otherwise a really heavy lift for the administration at this time of year when graduation is tomorrow and all the other things are happening before between now and the end of the year so is there I will see if I can't talk to some folks who might know where that grant application is and and you guys can go um in the can hop in Howard's Wayback Machine and um

507
01:36:33,021 --> 01:36:36,523
[SPEAKER_08]: get in the time machine and see what you can come up with from that perspective.

508
01:36:36,543 --> 01:36:40,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know that at the time, I was like, wow, this is so amazing.

509
01:36:40,766 --> 01:36:42,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just really well done.

510
01:36:42,927 --> 01:36:48,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So there just might be something there that helps draw that anchoring to the outside space.

511
01:36:49,412 --> 01:36:53,214
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll take a look for that to see if there isn't something that we can pull in and integrate.

512
01:36:53,354 --> 01:36:53,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Tracy?

513
01:36:53,834 --> 01:36:58,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Jenny, you said that the finance committee talked about other locations.

514
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:02,040
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see, based on what Lupe's talking about,

515
01:37:02,677 --> 01:37:14,947
[SPEAKER_11]: this space, but when we talk about these other spaces there, are we envisioning that in those spaces?

516
01:37:15,027 --> 01:37:30,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Can this, what Luke is referencing, the green and the courtyards, are those also ideal in that situation where we get so fixated on this space and then find out this is not a feasible space because of

517
01:37:30,956 --> 01:37:34,439
[SPEAKER_11]: and even to urban spaces.

518
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:38,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Your concept changes and goes back to what Paul was saying.

519
01:37:38,343 --> 01:37:46,291
[SPEAKER_11]: These other schools are almost feeling downtown that we are limited to our broader thinking.

520
01:37:46,872 --> 01:37:51,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess my thought is there's a way for us in this document to say like,

521
01:37:52,355 --> 01:37:54,457
[SPEAKER_08]: We are not tied to this location.

522
01:37:54,477 --> 01:38:00,322
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have identified others that potentially are worthy of discussion.

523
01:38:00,462 --> 01:38:08,209
[SPEAKER_08]: But as it relates to this location, here are some things that we would think are important if we are planning to stay here.

524
01:38:09,129 --> 01:38:12,491
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's perfectly rational and reasonable.

525
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:31,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there is somebody who would like to take a crack at like the athletic spaces or the outdoor classroom spaces or the sort of anchoring to the fells, like if anyone wants to just take a shot at writing a paragraph or something and sending it to me, like I'm happy to do the integration if there are any volunteers.

526
01:38:33,461 --> 01:38:34,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to write something.

527
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:50,507
[SPEAKER_09]: if you want more than one, we can always see what we... Do you have a particular topic, Libby, that you are... I think that that's a good point, that whether we're on this site or any other site, that the integration of nature or access to, you know, views and connection to the exterior is important.

528
01:38:50,527 --> 01:38:54,050
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there'll be a civil engineer and a landscape architect on the design team.

529
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:57,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's good to acknowledge the work that they would be doing.

530
01:38:57,632 --> 01:38:58,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd be happy to write.

531
01:38:59,013 --> 01:39:03,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the athletic fields, I don't know as much about specifically, but I could mention that.

532
01:39:04,497 --> 01:39:07,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Prioritizing them being close by and refurbished is important.

533
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:08,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

534
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Luke?

535
01:39:11,641 --> 01:39:19,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Integrated design concept that amplifies surrounding environment.

536
01:39:19,966 --> 01:39:20,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.

537
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:25,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

538
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:27,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that.

539
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:28,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Cultural stuff.

540
01:39:35,769 --> 01:39:41,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what your conversation is.

541
01:39:42,013 --> 01:39:43,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Peter, we're going to get cows here, you guys.

542
01:39:45,215 --> 01:39:54,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, in all reality, I mean, a horticulture program using shipping container growing is being done at other schools.

543
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:59,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so we didn't present horticulture at the school committee, however, I mean.

544
01:39:59,784 --> 01:40:03,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a piece of that at the end of the science, too, that I'm excited to explore.

545
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:06,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

546
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:06,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

547
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

548
01:40:10,503 --> 01:40:32,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Tracy, the other thing that I'm thinking about is like the very active conversation about the arts that we are having in the community at this very moment and wondering if there isn't something that we should be adding about sort of like how we're envisioning like the artistic spaces and if you might think about writing something about that.

549
01:40:37,096 --> 01:40:37,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else?

550
01:40:38,137 --> 01:40:38,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria?

551
01:40:38,597 --> 01:40:42,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to circle back to when you were talking about health care.

552
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:47,703
[SPEAKER_05]: You brought up paper child alliance as possibly being a partner and needing space.

553
01:40:48,184 --> 01:40:54,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that we are also contracting with Elliot Services for mental health and counseling.

554
01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:55,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Would they also?

555
01:40:55,929 --> 01:40:58,671
[SPEAKER_08]: That came up as well as having space for that as well.

556
01:41:00,905 --> 01:41:04,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was like a really exciting conversation.

557
01:41:04,349 --> 01:41:06,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what about all the other schools?

558
01:41:06,491 --> 01:41:09,114
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're like, slow down.

559
01:41:11,016 --> 01:41:12,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

560
01:41:12,557 --> 01:41:20,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So Maria, I think the other space that like could require or like, do with a little bit of love would be the library space.

561
01:41:20,986 --> 01:41:22,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you take a crack at that?

562
01:41:23,209 --> 01:41:23,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

563
01:41:24,561 --> 01:41:44,956
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing too is a few years ago during COVID, an organization out of Boston Architectural College called the TIDAVAL, Trauma Informed Design Evaluation, they developed a tool to really evaluate schools, and this group is doing a lot of work with the Uvalde School District.

564
01:41:45,552 --> 01:41:55,474
[SPEAKER_00]: to really work on that school district and to really understand space and how a space may impact students' trauma.

565
01:41:56,414 --> 01:42:00,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I think throughout this process, it's a Boston-based group.

566
01:42:00,675 --> 01:42:03,775
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be wise for us to at least reach out and see.

567
01:42:03,835 --> 01:42:10,617
[SPEAKER_00]: They did an analysis of the Andrews School as part of their developing the tool itself.

568
01:42:14,368 --> 01:42:22,154
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing, Lori, that's gonna need to be sort of flushed in here is some conversation about the co-location of Curtis Tufts.

569
01:42:22,194 --> 01:42:28,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So we might do with a paragraph from you about that vision, if you could work on that, Joan.

570
01:42:29,019 --> 01:42:29,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, great.

571
01:42:29,779 --> 01:42:32,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying in terms of space or velocity?

572
01:42:32,301 --> 01:42:33,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Both, both.

573
01:42:33,462 --> 01:42:33,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

574
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:46,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions about this section so far?

575
01:42:46,882 --> 01:42:48,163
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got 10 minutes to go.

576
01:42:49,504 --> 01:42:51,625
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

577
01:42:51,785 --> 01:42:52,726
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great question.

578
01:42:52,766 --> 01:42:57,949
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're scheduled to meet next Wednesday, June 12.

579
01:42:58,489 --> 01:42:59,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Tuesday?

580
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:00,030
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Wednesday.

581
01:43:00,451 --> 01:43:01,251
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Wednesday.

582
01:43:01,331 --> 01:43:01,611
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

583
01:43:02,492 --> 01:43:09,637
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you all could, by any means, get it to me by Friday, I can then do some integrating.

584
01:43:10,717 --> 01:43:12,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you can't, it's OK.

585
01:43:13,826 --> 01:43:14,647
[SPEAKER_08]: give it to me when you can.

586
01:43:16,549 --> 01:43:18,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.

587
01:43:19,633 --> 01:43:20,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Midnight Friday.

588
01:43:22,016 --> 01:43:23,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna I'll work on it over the weekend.

589
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:23,638
[SPEAKER_08]: So

590
01:43:27,503 --> 01:43:29,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, item C is, um.

591
01:43:30,507 --> 01:43:31,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Still a work in progress.

592
01:43:31,949 --> 01:43:36,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the administrative team has some work to do to be able to describe that piece of it.

593
01:43:37,076 --> 01:43:39,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so that there's nothing for you all to review there.

594
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:43,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and then section four is about community engagement.

595
01:43:44,505 --> 01:43:52,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and it talks about, um, some of the community engagement we have already done about Curtis Tufts and whether to co-locate that.

596
01:43:53,227 --> 01:44:02,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It also talks about, um, some of the communications and community engagement subcommittee work, um, in terms of how we plan to engage the community in this project.

597
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:08,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And it closes, um, by saying that certainly we will need a debt exclusion to fully fund this project.

598
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:11,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I think Maria had some questions about this, right?

599
01:44:12,071 --> 01:44:14,072
[SPEAKER_08]: this section for community engagement?

600
01:44:16,272 --> 01:44:17,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Emily, sorry.

601
01:44:17,533 --> 01:44:18,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

602
01:44:19,293 --> 01:44:22,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily, sorry.

603
01:44:23,255 --> 01:44:36,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I, I sort of what triggered my thoughts on this was what somebody said about what John was saying about the idea of the school being kind of an open campus.

604
01:44:36,879 --> 01:44:38,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that

605
01:44:39,415 --> 01:44:49,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see something in this section that's a little bit about the idea of the space being also kind of a community hub outside of just the high schoolers.

606
01:44:50,303 --> 01:45:03,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are a lot of community things that happen here, the community schools, the pool, the network, family network, a lot of things happen here.

607
01:45:03,753 --> 01:45:05,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, and I thought about that.

608
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:09,823
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously, and unfortunately for myself volunteering too, right?

609
01:45:10,183 --> 01:45:13,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you are.

610
01:45:13,885 --> 01:45:16,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd be happy to put that in and integrate it.

611
01:45:16,826 --> 01:45:17,447
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great.

612
01:45:17,587 --> 01:45:18,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

613
01:45:18,907 --> 01:45:21,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think that we have so much space here.

614
01:45:22,469 --> 01:45:35,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that in the early days of this building, there were more students and now there are fewer, but that if we do end up changing locations and having a smaller building,

615
01:45:36,155 --> 01:45:49,726
[SPEAKER_06]: that we sacrifice one of the perks of this large space, which is that there are a lot of opportunities to use it for a lot of different community, a lot of attention for community good.

616
01:45:50,206 --> 01:45:52,788
So that's something I'd like to highlight.

617
01:45:52,888 --> 01:45:57,032
[SPEAKER_07]: It is doing that now, and it can continue to do it, and it can do even more.

618
01:45:57,052 --> 01:45:57,272
Great.

619
01:45:57,632 --> 01:45:57,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul?

620
01:45:57,872 --> 01:46:00,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for bringing that up.

621
01:46:00,715 --> 01:46:03,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure where it's at.

622
01:46:09,189 --> 01:46:15,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Medford does lack a lot of community spaces, and we're not going to be able to supply enough for everyone.

623
01:46:16,151 --> 01:46:24,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's about, like, how we segregate portions of this building, many different segments of it, even at a time.

624
01:46:26,414 --> 01:46:32,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like, those girls down here, if we find a place to put our troops, we can't do it at home.

625
01:46:44,500 --> 01:47:04,783
[SPEAKER_03]: turn this into, you know, that open campus idea, I don't really know much about it because it's a lot, but the idea of the school community sector or education, community education, for all of these, there's so many more things.

626
01:47:23,607 --> 01:47:27,048
No, it was in a middle school, but it's, but that's how they use their spaces.

627
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:32,409
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in like a, it was in a science club, but it was, that's, that's one of the things they do there.

628
01:47:32,449 --> 01:47:44,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, there is a lot of potential and really just in like a city council, like it's a revenue generator to have more of these programs to bring in funds to the city.

629
01:47:44,911 --> 01:47:48,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, these are all, these are all good things for us.

630
01:47:49,272 --> 01:47:49,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

631
01:47:49,992 --> 01:47:51,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor, did you have your name in the air?

632
01:47:52,033 --> 01:48:06,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Just quickly, if you thought maybe to add after-school programming needs of the community, it doesn't have to be a full paragraph, but somewhere, state, Alina, how desperately we are in need of space.

633
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:07,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

634
01:48:08,372 --> 01:48:12,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Devils in space and things like that.

635
01:48:26,628 --> 01:48:27,989
[SPEAKER_02]: that the answer's given.

636
01:48:28,489 --> 01:48:29,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little confusing.

637
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:33,973
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, it seems like you're answering the question.

638
01:48:34,834 --> 01:48:39,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not until you get to the third paragraph that you answer it.

639
01:48:40,017 --> 01:48:52,525
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's a place for the Curtis-Thompson Peaceful, but I think it follows the more direct, the establishment of the communication.

640
01:48:56,596 --> 01:49:01,398
[SPEAKER_02]: grammar there, but for indication for a project.

641
01:49:01,438 --> 01:49:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So first point of feedback is the sequence of information is not a sequence.

642
01:49:09,801 --> 01:49:13,122
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can be re-sequenced to make sense.

643
01:49:13,823 --> 01:49:19,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second part is the stakeholders aren't really identified, but Emily sort of touches on it.

644
01:49:19,865 --> 01:49:24,787
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of external organizations that utilize the space, right?

645
01:49:25,964 --> 01:49:32,728
[SPEAKER_02]: The residents are one stakeholder group, but a Japanese school that comes on Saturdays is another large stakeholder group.

646
01:49:33,029 --> 01:49:38,752
[SPEAKER_02]: The lacrosse league that runs the field during the spring and fall, that's another stakeholder group.

647
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:40,373
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of these stakeholder groups.

648
01:49:41,194 --> 01:49:52,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you necessarily have to list them all out, but you should identify that there are non-resident strong stakeholders that we would have to communicate with and engage with.

649
01:49:52,621 --> 01:49:54,943
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, for any other reasons than just

650
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two items.

651
01:50:01,721 --> 01:50:01,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

652
01:50:03,483 --> 01:50:05,605
[SPEAKER_13]: What else?

653
01:50:08,348 --> 01:50:11,592
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a motion to lay this on the table.

654
01:50:11,792 --> 01:50:13,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is just a draft review.

655
01:50:13,674 --> 01:50:16,777
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we're on it until Wednesday.

656
01:50:17,079 --> 01:50:32,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so everybody who has been found told to write something please go ahead and send that to me, I will do the integration of that information and then we will take another look at it next Wednesday and we'll decide are we like.

657
01:50:33,368 --> 01:50:34,189
[SPEAKER_08]: feeling good about it?

658
01:50:34,249 --> 01:50:35,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need more time?

659
01:50:35,211 --> 01:50:41,098
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, how do we, you know, how do we sort of balance, you know, speed and completeness?

660
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:47,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, that's always sort of the challenge, but we're on a good track and

661
01:50:49,375 --> 01:50:51,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all the feedback today was really great.

662
01:50:51,657 --> 01:50:56,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you all for, thank you for your feedback and your input.

663
01:50:57,322 --> 01:51:05,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Next time we'll review this document and hopefully we'll take a first, maybe last look at the maintenance submission that has to go in.

664
01:51:05,649 --> 01:51:12,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, doesn't require this committee's review, but I think it's important that you all know what those questions and answers are.

665
01:51:13,535 --> 01:51:19,678
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see how far we can get in the drafting of those answers and then look at that as well.

666
01:51:20,038 --> 01:51:22,079
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I wanted to do before everyone leaves.

667
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, where's my schedule?

668
01:51:25,501 --> 01:51:26,341
[SPEAKER_08]: We have scheduled

669
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:38,972
[SPEAKER_08]: still, we have a meeting on the 12th.

670
01:51:39,873 --> 01:51:46,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had a subcommittee meeting that was a TBD on the 20th.

671
01:51:46,498 --> 01:51:50,982
[SPEAKER_08]: We then decided we would use that for the communications and community engagement subcommittee.

672
01:51:51,082 --> 01:51:58,449
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I have a date with my 11-year-old nephews to take them to see the Michael Jackson musical that evening, so I cannot attend.

673
01:52:02,672 --> 01:52:07,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently all fifth grade boys go through that phase and we are there.

674
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:10,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So I need to move that meeting time.

675
01:52:10,903 --> 01:52:15,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will reach out to the communications subcommittee and we'll find another time where we can have another meeting.

676
01:52:17,272 --> 01:52:19,435
[SPEAKER_08]: There are two meetings on the books.

677
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:24,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It won in July, won in August.

678
01:52:24,862 --> 01:52:26,763
[SPEAKER_08]: We may or may not need those.

679
01:52:26,904 --> 01:52:31,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can use those as like a tour date to go see Arlington or something like that.

680
01:52:33,928 --> 01:52:44,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we, depending on how far we are able to get through the other documents, like we may do a Zoom only meeting at some point before the end of June to finish our deliverables.

681
01:52:45,095 --> 01:52:54,605
[SPEAKER_08]: The last deliverable is actually not an action for this group to take, but it's a vote for the city council to take to authorize the funding for the feasibility study.

682
01:52:54,645 --> 01:52:56,046
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor and I are working on that.

683
01:52:56,627 --> 01:53:03,034
[SPEAKER_08]: MSBA is reviewing the proposed language that will go up on the council agenda probably the week of the 25th.

684
01:53:06,537 --> 01:53:08,478
[SPEAKER_08]: but we'll keep you all posted on when that is.

685
01:53:08,538 --> 01:53:16,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a really, the MSBA has to approve the language, the council has to vote it very specifically, but we're all on track for that.

686
01:53:16,161 --> 01:53:27,926
[SPEAKER_08]: So the last piece of what we have to do in eligibility is information that we'll work with Director Hunt's office around community growth projections.

687
01:53:28,346 --> 01:53:29,647
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are working on that.

688
01:53:29,887 --> 01:53:32,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's an enrollment piece on the school side and then there's a city piece

689
01:53:33,789 --> 01:53:34,850
[SPEAKER_08]: that has to get submitted.

690
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:45,084
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am actively working with Director Hunt on that and hopefully we'll be able to get all that stuff like organized and put into the system in short order.

691
01:53:45,124 --> 01:53:46,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're on track.

692
01:53:47,367 --> 01:53:48,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

693
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:49,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

694
01:53:51,185 --> 01:53:53,006
[SPEAKER_08]: That is everything that I have for all of you.

695
01:53:53,026 --> 01:53:57,027
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a note to say like, bear with us as we get through the rest of the scheduling of all of this.

696
01:53:57,868 --> 01:54:02,029
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, I think we're at the end of our agenda.

697
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:05,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Our next meeting is on June 12.

698
01:54:06,851 --> 01:54:17,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my goal is to set the rest of the, my goal is to set our calendar for the fall once the school committee calendar is set, so we'll do that and then we'll set this calendar so you all can put it in your calendars.

699
01:54:18,544 --> 01:54:19,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

700
01:54:20,086 --> 01:54:20,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.

701
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:24,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn by Luke, seconded by Tracy.

702
01:54:25,832 --> 01:54:26,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, okay.

703
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:27,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll calls.

704
01:54:27,973 --> 01:54:28,533
