1
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:34,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford City Council Committee, the whole March 4th, 2025.

2
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:35,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:18:36,454 --> 00:18:45,526
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

4
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:45,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Present.

5
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:47,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven present, none absent.

6
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:48,170
[SPEAKER_17]: This meeting is called to order.

7
00:18:48,853 --> 00:19:02,137
[SPEAKER_17]: The action discussion item for tonight's meeting is 24-468 offered by Councilor Tseng, which is a resolution to discuss the draft city charter as amended by the governance committee, and I will go to Councilor Tseng to discuss the paper.

8
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:03,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

9
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:15,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the last two months, the governance committee has been reviewing a draft charter developed by the charter study committee and sent to us from the mayor's office.

10
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,077
[SPEAKER_13]: This has been a really exciting process.

11
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:23,179
[SPEAKER_13]: I know a lot of residents have been engaged in this process over a long time and especially in the last few weeks.

12
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,962
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, this process really will change what

13
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:38,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Rules underlie our governance, and as I've heard it being put multiple times before, the Charter is a reflection of who we are as a city.

14
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:47,400
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's really important to thank the members of the Charter Study Committee for their work over the last few years.

15
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:57,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Where the city council comes in is where the state law begins, which, you know, using the method that the mayor chose to do charter review.

16
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:06,462
[SPEAKER_13]: The city council is the body that has to approve any proposal that we sent the state legislature on the text.

17
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:18,603
[SPEAKER_13]: The legally binding text that the text that will send to the voters starts here and that's the work that we've been doing with our due diligence over the last few months.

18
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:37,597
[SPEAKER_13]: During those meetings, I made sure to invite members of the Charter Study Committee, members of different bodies that would be affected, such as the School Committee and multiple member bodies to the meetings and to provide feedback, many of whom did provide feedback to us.

19
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:42,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm proud to say that I think the Governance Committee really did consider

20
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,224
[SPEAKER_13]: feedback from all different angles, from different perspectives.

21
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:51,846
[SPEAKER_13]: We had some real debates in committee about what we bring to this committee, the whole meeting.

22
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:58,608
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that the conversation, the discourse that we had was very thoughtful.

23
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:06,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, just to summarize, there are three main buckets of edits that the governance committee made.

24
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,955
[SPEAKER_13]: There are two bigger substantive changes.

25
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:21,720
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the last bucket are just technical edits to clarify language and to make sure that the language that we had in the draft city charter was legally airtight and wouldn't lead to any loopholes.

26
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:43,465
[SPEAKER_13]: The two big substantive edits that we made was to adopt a district-based composition for city council to align it with the school committee model that was proposed, and to remove the mayor as the chair of the school committee, keeping the mayor on the school committee as a normal member.

27
00:21:45,843 --> 00:22:12,245
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have some more technical edits going through the city charter in communications with the Collins Center and also in working with folks at Harvard Law, just some technical edits to make sure that we don't slip into any situations where there might be litigation and to make sure that we're fully aligned with state law and that each part of the city charter aligns with each other as well.

28
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:16,287
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a list of technical edits too.

29
00:22:18,027 --> 00:22:31,053
[SPEAKER_13]: So to start in section 1-3, I would suggest removing the words, not including the Medford public schools, specifically from the definitions of city agency and city office or department head.

30
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:37,116
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a change that we made at the last meeting on the school committee.

31
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:41,958
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a change that was recommended to align us with CELAW.

32
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also suggest in section 1-7, the definition section, two edits.

33
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:56,993
[SPEAKER_13]: One, to add the word new before initiative measure, and to add the words excluding repeal referendum measures at the end of the definition.

34
00:22:57,514 --> 00:23:02,755
[SPEAKER_13]: This brings us in alignment with the rest of the document which we edited.

35
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:05,517
[SPEAKER_13]: at that last governance committee meeting.

36
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:14,164
[SPEAKER_13]: It also just clarifies that we do have a new initiative measure process and a repeal referendum process, and those don't overlap.

37
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:15,325
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's no loophole there.

38
00:23:16,766 --> 00:23:24,672
[SPEAKER_13]: The second edit that I would suggest making to section 1-7 would be to add the word repeal before referendum measure.

39
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:27,815
[SPEAKER_13]: That's again, just to align what we have there.

40
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:41,067
[SPEAKER_13]: A technical edit suggestion that I have for section article 3-8 would be to add the word temporarily before the word unable.

41
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:49,570
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the section of the city charter about what happens with a temporary absence of the mayor in talking to lawyers.

42
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,851
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty, there was a pretty

43
00:23:53,794 --> 00:24:08,678
[SPEAKER_13]: big red flag in this section about this potentially giving the city council the power to coup the mayor with a bunch of different legal rules, doctrines for why the section as is would do that.

44
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:12,619
[SPEAKER_13]: This doesn't reflect the intent of the Charter Study Committee.

45
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:20,162
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't, in our conversation at the Governance Committee, didn't reflect the intent of anyone at that meeting as well.

46
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:27,198
[SPEAKER_13]: In section 3-10, I have two proposed edits.

47
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:40,474
[SPEAKER_13]: The first one would be to add the words in bullet point A, so subsection A, add the words, and shall receive compensation as established by ordinance for the office of mayor.

48
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:55,482
[SPEAKER_13]: That is to clarify something that we had discussed in the governance committee about making sure that someone doing the job of acting mayor for months on end would be paid for that.

49
00:24:55,502 --> 00:25:06,487
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a very similar edit I'd like to make in, I suggest that the committee of the whole make in part B to amend the final clause to end after the sentence

50
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:13,855
[SPEAKER_13]: to end the sentence after the words section 3-1A and to insert the following.

51
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:29,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Quote, such person shall not be entitled to have the words candidate for reelection printed against their name on the election ballot for the office of the mayor, but may have these words printed against their name on the election ballot for their original city council position.

52
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:35,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Such person shall receive such compensation as established by ordinance for the office of mayor.

53
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:49,493
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just to clarify a potential ambiguity that was raised to me just to make sure that we are keeping with the intentions that we had.

54
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:51,895
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is just really clearing up a loophole.

55
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:54,517
[SPEAKER_13]: In section 4-8B,

56
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:04,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I would suggest replacing the words highest vote getter with candidate receiving the highest number of votes.

57
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:07,142
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just to align us with legal language.

58
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:18,806
[SPEAKER_13]: In section 6-4, I would suggest adding that the budget should be required to be posted on the city website.

59
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:22,948
[SPEAKER_13]: In section 8-4, subsection 3, I would amend the language to read

60
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:33,138
[SPEAKER_13]: the city budget or school committee budget as a whole or any portion thereof.

61
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:45,593
[SPEAKER_13]: That also reflects some, the conversation that we had at our last governance committee meeting, just to make sure that the language there is airtight as well, because the language before read the other way.

62
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:56,237
[SPEAKER_13]: And in Section 9-11, this is the final edit in Section 9-11, I would suggest replacing the words Board of Election Commissioners with City Clerk.

63
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:59,480
[SPEAKER_13]: That's another, just a technical edit.

64
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:12,068
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that all being said, and I can email this list around to the City Clerk and to Councilors if need be, I would motion to accept the recommendations of the Governance Committee with these technical edits.

65
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:18,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

66
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,069
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard a motion to accept the recommendations of the study committee with the technical amendments and refer to regular meeting.

67
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

68
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:36,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Before we go there, I just wanted to, I have one question or two questions, one from the clerk regarding that

69
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:39,218
[SPEAKER_17]: 9-11 change.

70
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:46,305
[SPEAKER_17]: The clerk has said that the certificates of election or appointment do now come from the board of elections commissioners.

71
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:49,647
[SPEAKER_17]: So is that correct?

72
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:50,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

73
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:59,876
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would recommend leaving that as is because the certificates of election, when someone is appointed to the city,

74
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:04,116
[SPEAKER_19]: have to administer the oath of office and when someone is elected, I have to administer the oath of office.

75
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:10,577
[SPEAKER_19]: But the certificates of election have been coming from the from the Elections Commission since the changeover in 2022.

76
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:10,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

77
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:10,797
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

78
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:10,997
[SPEAKER_19]: And then

79
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:37,352
[SPEAKER_17]: There was one other item where we were, or two other items, sorry, where one, we were supposed to get some recommended language back from the Collins Center.

80
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:50,440
[SPEAKER_17]: One was for the school committee regarding the section 4-5, subsection B, subsection 1, the language upon the recommendation of the superintendent.

81
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,701
[SPEAKER_17]: We were supposed to get language from school committee council.

82
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:53,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Did we get that?

83
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:04,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

84
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:07,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the last one was section 8-1.

85
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:18,575
[SPEAKER_17]: We requested language from the Collins Center regarding the procedure for legal review of group petitions.

86
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:21,275
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we received any language on that.

87
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:24,016
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

88
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:26,625
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can follow up.

89
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:46,393
[SPEAKER_17]: The residency requirement for the boards and commissions.

90
00:29:49,837 --> 00:30:00,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so if you could add those three items and make sure we get that language back from Count Collins Center, since they didn't get it to us yet, that would be great.

91
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,540
[SPEAKER_17]: And you'll send a list of all of these to the clerk?

92
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:03,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

93
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,261
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I will go to, who do I have here?

94
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:15,082
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, and then we'll go from there, Councilor Collins.

95
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:20,356
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, President Paris.

96
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:23,258
[SPEAKER_28]: It's exciting to get to this phase in the process.

97
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,743
[SPEAKER_28]: Just want to begin by thanking the community for advocating for a new charter.

98
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:30,105
[SPEAKER_28]: This advocacy has been going on for a long time.

99
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:33,749
[SPEAKER_28]: It predates the specific chapter in the charter review process.

100
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,394
[SPEAKER_28]: Community members, many of whom are in the room tonight, and I'm sure watching on Zoom,

101
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:39,154
[SPEAKER_28]: Council.

102
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:40,635
[SPEAKER_28]: Um have been advocating for this before.

103
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:43,497
[SPEAKER_28]: There was a charter study committee assembled by the mayor.

104
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:45,638
[SPEAKER_28]: Um I'm excited that I get to vote.

105
00:30:46,198 --> 00:30:53,982
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes on a new charter twice in my time as a city Councilor first a couple years ago, and hopefully again in a couple weeks.

106
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:59,125
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to thank the Charter Study Committee, especially Chairman Donald for all of your hard work.

107
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:02,627
[SPEAKER_28]: The count the Collins Center for consulting with the Charter

108
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:23,780
[SPEAKER_28]: Everybody tuning into this process knows this already, but I think it bears repeating the council's role in this process is not to draft or craft the draft charter, but to review it and to make targeted improvements and adjustments the Charter Study Committee

109
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:32,963
[SPEAKER_28]: We know they worked really hard, diligently gathering community input, interpreting that as best as they could, creating this long and technical draft.

110
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:34,864
[SPEAKER_28]: That's no mean feat.

111
00:31:36,264 --> 00:31:43,186
[SPEAKER_28]: And now it is our responsibility, it being passed off to us at this part of the process, to have given it a thorough and earnest review.

112
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:44,967
[SPEAKER_28]: Our review is not a rubber stamp.

113
00:31:45,727 --> 00:32:05,995
[SPEAKER_28]: but a responsibility that we know we all, none of us take lightly to make adjustments that in our perspective, given our access, given our information, given our perspective as Councilors, to make this draft as strong as it can possibly be for the long-term good of the people that our body governs, for the good of the community.

114
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:08,156
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe that this draft

115
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:09,656
[SPEAKER_28]: Excuse me.

116
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:18,301
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe that this draft charter really does constitute a very major step forward towards a better functioning and more modernized guiding structure for our city.

117
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:26,925
[SPEAKER_28]: I especially want to shout out the simple fact that this charter would require a review of the charter every 10 years, which is really important.

118
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:35,950
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so glad that the draft charter would include a review of itself for going forward, because I think that this process has illustrated how much we need that to happen on a regular cadence.

119
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:43,582
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Tseng, I think, gave a really helpful overview of the two most substantive changes that the Council made in committee.

120
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:49,087
[SPEAKER_28]: I do believe that these will make our governance better and stronger for the people of Medford.

121
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:54,552
[SPEAKER_28]: I've said this before in our committee meetings, but I do believe that moving from an all-at-large

122
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:59,476
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor system to four district Councilors, plus three at large.

123
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:01,558
[SPEAKER_28]: I think this is a positive change.

124
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:06,422
[SPEAKER_28]: This is substantially more localized representation than Medford has ever seen before in its city council.

125
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:10,966
[SPEAKER_28]: Guaranteeing representation from all four quadrants of the city.

126
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:24,474
[SPEAKER_28]: while balancing against potential negatives that I do believe could come from having one Councilor from eight small wards such as uncompetitive elections and parochialism.

127
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:30,618
[SPEAKER_28]: We have had a really substantive back and forth about this issue in particular in these chambers.

128
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,760
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll speak as one Councilor.

129
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,861
[SPEAKER_28]: It's given me a lot to think about.

130
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:37,482
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that

131
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:44,240
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so grateful that the community challenged us to think really, really deeply about this issue of representation.

132
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:54,026
[SPEAKER_28]: I know that we do not have consensus on this council about what the best system of localized representation will be.

133
00:33:54,166 --> 00:34:03,031
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm so grateful that my belief is no matter how we go forward, Medford will enjoy more localized representation on the city council than it has before.

134
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:04,112
[SPEAKER_28]: And that is what the residents deserve.

135
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:12,518
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Tseng has also outlined additional technical edits, which I do think shore up this legal document and resolve unintended ambiguities.

136
00:34:12,558 --> 00:34:16,101
[SPEAKER_28]: That's again, that's a really important part of our responsibility here on the city council.

137
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:20,365
[SPEAKER_28]: And thank you Chair Tseng for your diligence in making sure that we caught all the nitty gritty.

138
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:29,372
[SPEAKER_28]: So I am grateful to my colleagues and all members of this process for such earnest participation.

139
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:34,777
[SPEAKER_28]: I second the motion from Councilor Tseng and I look forward to hearing further comment from my fellow councilors.

140
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:38,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

141
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:39,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

142
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Council President.

143
00:34:42,150 --> 00:35:05,462
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I thank Councilor Tseng to bring this forward, the changes forward, but I appreciate that he has the avenue to reach probably the smartest legal minds in the country at Harvard, but it'd be interesting to see the changes that are made to the call-in center or our legal team to look at what changes are made.

144
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:05,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that

145
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:10,763
[SPEAKER_10]: You did say a lot, so I'm lost in translation right now because I haven't seen anything.

146
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:28,368
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that it's a little premature to bring all these changes that were presented by legal support at Harvard when we had the Collins Center, who are attorneys, that we vetted all of these processes through with them.

147
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:31,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So I- I love the point of information.

148
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I did also work with the Collins Center on this.

149
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,570
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, good.

150
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:35,174
[SPEAKER_10]: some, right?

151
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:54,549
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that, you know, it'd be interesting once we get those, I think that, um, vetted properly again through the call and center to make sure that, uh, the ones that weren't, if they were, um, you know, like I said, I don't, I trust them, but again, that Harvard's not our legal representative to, um, to lead us.

152
00:35:54,749 --> 00:35:57,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that it's important that we make sure we do that.

153
00:35:57,551 --> 00:36:02,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, now with the process, the two big changes, I think that, uh,

154
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:11,225
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, the lesser of, uh, is the mayor, the mayor's position as the president of the other chair of the city of the school committee.

155
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:24,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I feel strongly that I think she or the mayor's position should be the leader of that, uh, that body and, um, and for many different reasons, but I leave it, I leave that at the will of the voters.

156
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:32,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but I think what's more important, I think that this council has been in, uh,

157
00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:38,087
[SPEAKER_10]: has been questioned over and over again, that are we making the right decisions for the whole community?

158
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:41,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Or are we doing this for one base?

159
00:36:42,669 --> 00:37:01,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we hear time after time, because I'm sure you got the emails, I'm sure you got the phone calls, I'm sure you got the communication with the community that are very, very perplexed that this council would run on a platform

160
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:05,269
[SPEAKER_10]: of eight ward representations and then three at large candidates.

161
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:14,094
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bothersome that the question of equity comes around and gets thrown around easily.

162
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:19,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And this format clearly is not equitable.

163
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:26,802
[SPEAKER_10]: To think that this council is going to make a decision, possibly vote for this format,

164
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:35,243
[SPEAKER_10]: and possibly leave wards and leave parts of our community unrepresented would be a travesty because it's not about this council.

165
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:42,187
[SPEAKER_10]: As been said before, this is about the council today, the council in five years, the council in 10 years, and the council in 20 years.

166
00:37:44,168 --> 00:37:48,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And being uniformed and giving people the opportunity to run for office.

167
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And we talked about all the pluses.

168
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:53,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember because I fought against those pluses, remember?

169
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:56,755
[SPEAKER_10]: I was against charter review for a long, long time.

170
00:37:57,865 --> 00:38:15,361
[SPEAKER_10]: And it took a lot of talking to different communities, talking to colleagues in different communities and understanding from members of the charter review team and surveys and really understanding the importance of equity and what that meant.

171
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:24,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And this format that you're proposing and you're changing is an absolute shame to the community

172
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:32,078
[SPEAKER_10]: that has worked for two years, over 200 meetings, and all identified an eight and three format.

173
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,121
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about why are people coming out?

174
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:40,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are people not connected to this process?

175
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:53,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And we identified the fact that we don't have board representation, and the fact that maybe there might be someone in that community that hasn't come out to vote,

176
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:58,496
[SPEAKER_10]: that re-energizes that community to be part of this process.

177
00:38:58,697 --> 00:38:59,537
[SPEAKER_10]: What an opportunity.

178
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:06,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we talk about running in as an at-large member and how expensive that would be.

179
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:11,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And how many people, if you look around this reel, we all look the same, most of us.

180
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:16,450
[SPEAKER_10]: And most of us work together to get funding one way or the other.

181
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:20,793
[SPEAKER_10]: But to run for an office, you know what it takes?

182
00:39:20,813 --> 00:39:21,594
[SPEAKER_10]: 20, 25,000 possibly.

183
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:32,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And looking at ward representation opens up the avenues for so many of the underprivileged that would never, ever, ever have the opportunity.

184
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:45,090
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's befuddling to me that I have openly read the platform of the Our Revolution Method that talked openly about ward representation.

185
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I know we could say that no district representation is ward representation.

186
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Misleading and not true.

187
00:39:51,872 --> 00:40:07,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Because as members of that organization that have reached out to me to speak on their behalf, they were clearly under the assumption it was eight representatives, every ward representative, big or small, elected population or not.

188
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:17,863
[SPEAKER_10]: To sit here and think that this process, this change is good, it's good for six people.

189
00:40:18,898 --> 00:40:22,340
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good for their future in the business of politics.

190
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:30,184
[SPEAKER_10]: You could say it isn't, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I've said it, it's a duck.

191
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:33,085
[SPEAKER_10]: This is self-serving.

192
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:35,186
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not what the community is asking for.

193
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:46,892
[SPEAKER_10]: And again and again, someone that might run for re-election and maybe not, you're giving a lot of people a lot of ammunition for one key factor for my colleagues here.

194
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:51,458
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just not listening to all of our residents.

195
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:52,979
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not.

196
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:14,073
[SPEAKER_10]: You had a body that was presented to you that you supported 1,000%, that had over 200 meetings and worked for two years, then sat with professionals with 80 years of experience that presented what this community is crying for.

197
00:41:14,954 --> 00:41:16,555
[SPEAKER_10]: And to sit up here tonight and say,

198
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,760
[SPEAKER_10]: This is so exciting.

199
00:41:21,201 --> 00:41:28,184
[SPEAKER_10]: This seven-member board, six are probably gonna vote for something the rest of the community is drastically against.

200
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:33,406
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't say they're not because I'm getting the emails, I'm getting the phone calls.

201
00:41:34,106 --> 00:41:37,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And so are our members that are on the Charter Review Committee.

202
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:43,289
[SPEAKER_10]: So I beg my fellow councilors.

203
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:45,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we don't see eye to eye.

204
00:41:46,883 --> 00:41:47,643
[SPEAKER_10]: and a lot of things.

205
00:41:49,644 --> 00:41:59,987
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know for sure the base that voted you in, that have reaching out to me, they want the eight ward representation.

206
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:01,787
[SPEAKER_10]: They want the 11 members.

207
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:11,930
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm actually begging for you to please consider voting this down and going back to the original format.

208
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:12,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And if not,

209
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:36,528
[SPEAKER_10]: As I've said to many people, I implore that you reach out to the mayor because that is the next step to veto this because what's going to happen is that there's enough negativity out there that when this does go to the people and it does go to the vote, all their hard work is going to go for naught because the intentions of this council seems to be self-serving.

210
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:39,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that might hurt.

211
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:40,529
[SPEAKER_10]: You might think it's inflammatory.

212
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:42,850
[SPEAKER_10]: You might think this is politics and you can cry whatever you want.

213
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:45,878
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's exactly what it says.

214
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:48,540
[SPEAKER_10]: What you're doing, it's exactly what it is.

215
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:55,726
[SPEAKER_10]: They put a lot of work, this committee put a lot of work into this process.

216
00:42:57,087 --> 00:42:57,847
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was clear.

217
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:11,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And for someone that was so negative about it, and I turned full force around, and I'm sitting here advocating for it to other members of our community, so they can understand.

218
00:43:11,157 --> 00:43:12,338
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's so clear.

219
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,361
[SPEAKER_10]: It is so clear.

220
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:18,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Eight leaves nobody behind.

221
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:19,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about that.

222
00:43:20,826 --> 00:43:22,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Eight leaves nobody behind.

223
00:43:24,028 --> 00:43:25,790
[SPEAKER_10]: The other option possibly will.

224
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:33,697
[SPEAKER_10]: When you talk about combining wards, that's still a big area.

225
00:43:34,498 --> 00:43:39,162
[SPEAKER_10]: That still doesn't entice the equity that we've so many times cried for here.

226
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:43,256
[SPEAKER_10]: We wanna see a more diverse council.

227
00:43:43,296 --> 00:43:44,177
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what you all said.

228
00:43:44,537 --> 00:43:45,757
[SPEAKER_10]: We only have one person of color.

229
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:46,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard that over and over again.

230
00:43:49,659 --> 00:44:04,946
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at neighboring communities, you see a group of elected officials that represent their communities because they're giving the opportunity to run for that office without limitations.

231
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:09,828
[SPEAKER_10]: So again,

232
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:23,171
[SPEAKER_10]: To be a politician, please vote 6 to 1 and give the people that are running for office against you, give them more ammunition that you're just simply not listening to the residents of the city.

233
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:27,092
[SPEAKER_10]: You're seeing it over and over and over again.

234
00:44:28,973 --> 00:44:32,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether you win a vote or whether you don't, it's still very close.

235
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:38,996
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll end with this.

236
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,457
[SPEAKER_10]: This will get voted and moved through.

237
00:44:43,928 --> 00:44:47,672
[SPEAKER_10]: If this goes the way it usually does, it'll be six to one.

238
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:53,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll go to the council meeting, then it'll be voted against six to one, and then it'll go to the mayor.

239
00:44:53,998 --> 00:44:57,802
[SPEAKER_10]: And then again, people will have to gather, people have to rally, right?

240
00:44:58,242 --> 00:45:01,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they'll say, Councilor Scarpelli is being negative again.

241
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,208
[SPEAKER_10]: He's starting a group to go against what?

242
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,050
[SPEAKER_10]: To go against

243
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:09,348
[SPEAKER_10]: what we're doing here and not listening to the residents.

244
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:17,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Because in every platform that I've been involved in, in this community and helping residents, there's one common denominator.

245
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,194
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not listening.

246
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,496
[SPEAKER_10]: This administration is not listening.

247
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:35,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether it's zoning issues, whether it's override issues, whether it's charter review issues, it's the same cry

248
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:41,083
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not listening to all 60,000 residents.

249
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:46,787
[SPEAKER_10]: You're making your decisions on your special interest, and that's it.

250
00:45:49,269 --> 00:46:03,599
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I know what it takes to be a bigger person and say, you know what, look yourself in the mirror and say, not what best for me, George Scapelli, because that's what I was doing when I was sitting back and saying, no, Mr. McDonald, I don't believe in this process.

251
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe in ward representation.

252
00:46:06,908 --> 00:46:08,990
[SPEAKER_10]: When you look yourself in the mirror and say, well, you know what?

253
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:14,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the variables and how positively it affects the pros and cons.

254
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And how could you not want eight representatives?

255
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:21,979
[SPEAKER_10]: How could you not want all wards represented?

256
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,363
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I offended anybody, I apologize.

257
00:46:27,603 --> 00:46:35,609
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, this is coming from people that have openly said they voted for members of this council and feel like they're not even being heard.

258
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:40,636
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you, Mr. President.

259
00:46:42,097 --> 00:46:42,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

260
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:44,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

261
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:51,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng? President Bears?, sorry about that.

262
00:46:52,707 --> 00:46:53,048
[SPEAKER_13]: No worries.

263
00:46:53,768 --> 00:46:54,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

264
00:46:55,570 --> 00:47:02,537
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot to unpack there, but I wanted to start with, let's talk about equity.

265
00:47:03,002 --> 00:47:13,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this is a guiding decision behind so much of our city's policies, behind this charter reform in particular.

266
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:19,091
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's make sure that equity isn't just treated like a slogan.

267
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:31,137
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we agree about the concerns that there is just one elected person of color in the city, that for decades there's only been one elected person of color in the city.

268
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:38,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I, you know what, I look in the mirror every morning after I get out of the shower and I see that.

269
00:47:41,036 --> 00:47:54,667
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, you know what, I ran on a platform the first time I got elected and when I got reelected, I ran on a platform, not just to take the easy answer when it comes to equity, but to examine policies through the lens of equity.

270
00:47:55,548 --> 00:48:00,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a much richer, much deeper, much more complicated conversation.

271
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:09,394
[SPEAKER_13]: it is easy to say that if we draw smaller districts, that everyone will get represented.

272
00:48:09,794 --> 00:48:13,616
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's not where the conversation has to end with equity.

273
00:48:13,656 --> 00:48:16,478
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, the conversation can't end there with equity.

274
00:48:17,058 --> 00:48:24,703
[SPEAKER_13]: The conversation has to end with whether the outcomes that a future city council makes reflects that equity in the first place.

275
00:48:25,524 --> 00:48:25,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Now,

276
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:37,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Research from decades, 40 years of research, have been really loud in saying that it's not enough to draw a majority-minority district.

277
00:48:37,573 --> 00:48:44,777
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not enough to have a Black representative for a Black district or an Asian representative for an Asian district.

278
00:48:45,077 --> 00:48:49,379
[SPEAKER_13]: And that actually drives worse outcomes for minority interests.

279
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:51,169
[SPEAKER_13]: It really does.

280
00:48:51,709 --> 00:49:10,064
[SPEAKER_13]: When we see that you have one person of color on the city council, and I'm not even talking about this city council, we see that that is the effect of tokenism, that we take the easy way out, that we say that's enough, that we have diversity, that we have equity, that we have inclusion.

281
00:49:10,785 --> 00:49:14,588
[SPEAKER_13]: And I implore the city council and I implore residents at home

282
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:16,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So look at the research.

283
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:19,257
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's quite a lot of papers on this.

284
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:22,458
[SPEAKER_13]: I will break this down, the general concepts really quickly.

285
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:33,182
[SPEAKER_13]: When you draw districts that are majority minority, the problem is that no one else is accountable to those voters or few people are accountable to those voters.

286
00:49:33,442 --> 00:49:43,446
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why political scientists and experts, sociologists suggest that we take a compromise approach to determining composition of elected bodies.

287
00:49:44,643 --> 00:49:55,425
[SPEAKER_13]: The idea is that if we want real equitable outcomes, we need to make politicians accountable to more voters, to more different types of voter bases.

288
00:49:56,325 --> 00:50:00,566
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we luck out with the district proposal.

289
00:50:01,827 --> 00:50:12,869
[SPEAKER_13]: We looked at the, in the governance committee, we looked at the percentages of majority minority, the majority minority share, especially in West Medford and Wellington.

290
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:16,267
[SPEAKER_13]: between the district model and the word-based model.

291
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:19,148
[SPEAKER_13]: And there truly is not a major statistical difference.

292
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:28,073
[SPEAKER_13]: But what that means is if we go to a district model, a district Councilor will be accountable to more minority interests.

293
00:50:28,313 --> 00:50:32,055
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if we're talking about equity, I think we need to trust the data.

294
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:33,995
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to trust the science on that one.

295
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:39,438
[SPEAKER_13]: We also see with equity, it's not just about race.

296
00:50:39,658 --> 00:50:40,358
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about income.

297
00:50:40,759 --> 00:50:42,620
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about the types of housing or

298
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:44,789
[SPEAKER_13]: lack of housing.

299
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:49,832
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also see that there is quite a lot of research.

300
00:50:49,852 --> 00:51:03,323
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just one study that shows that an overfocus on ward representation can heighten those problems of lack of housing development, of a further segregation of housing outcomes.

301
00:51:04,114 --> 00:51:07,555
[SPEAKER_13]: with lower income and working class residents.

302
00:51:08,075 --> 00:51:09,295
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what the data says.

303
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:18,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, I walked into this office, I walked into this situation, actually leaning towards supporting an 8-3 model for representation.

304
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,317
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wasn't married to it.

305
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:23,837
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was actually open to looking at other models.

306
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:32,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, as I'm sure councillors will discuss tonight, there are other models that are actually better than any of the proposals that we have on the table.

307
00:51:32,873 --> 00:51:38,337
[SPEAKER_13]: But our political process demands that we choose one of these ones.

308
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:50,084
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the thing, is when you do more research about this, there is a muddier picture.

309
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:55,568
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not to say that district representation is what's going to solve the world.

310
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:59,831
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to say that ward representation is what's going to solve the world.

311
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:01,772
[SPEAKER_13]: The picture is really complicated.

312
00:52:02,522 --> 00:52:11,628
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, talking about the point of this is a political game, and if it quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck.

313
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:15,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's funny, because we can also look at the data about that.

314
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:23,276
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not convinced that the proposal that we have here, the 4-5 split, is actually more expedient to

315
00:52:24,213 --> 00:52:30,018
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, the certain group of politicians in the city, I actually think the data backs the other way.

316
00:52:30,498 --> 00:52:36,102
[SPEAKER_13]: And so in supporting this amendment, I'm actually likely weakening my own position going forward.

317
00:52:37,043 --> 00:52:43,248
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's, you know, really important to also say the most politically expedient decision I could make tonight

318
00:52:43,983 --> 00:52:46,284
[SPEAKER_13]: is to revert to an 8-3 system.

319
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:52,607
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not convinced that that system solves the problems that we see today in our city.

320
00:52:53,227 --> 00:52:59,469
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not convinced that that would be better than a 4-5 system.

321
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:13,455
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not saying that the 4-5 system, the district system is gonna solve all of our problems, but the 4-5 system has problems that we can solve using other measures.

322
00:53:14,455 --> 00:53:21,219
[SPEAKER_13]: through redistricting, through changing incentives, that we can't solve as easily with a ward-based system.

323
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:23,720
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's my research.

324
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:29,364
[SPEAKER_13]: I've spent all day on the phone with people who very strongly support a ward-based system.

325
00:53:29,404 --> 00:53:43,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've come to a consensus that there is no perfect system and that it should be my, it's incumbent upon me as an elected official to make the decision that I think is morally right for the city.

326
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,309
[SPEAKER_13]: not the politically expedient one.

327
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:49,111
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, there's a lot to be said.

328
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:52,433
[SPEAKER_13]: We can delve more into the proposals, but I just wanted to put that out there.

329
00:53:55,174 --> 00:53:56,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

330
00:53:56,035 --> 00:53:56,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

331
00:53:58,176 --> 00:54:02,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

332
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:13,225
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing I concur with my colleague is that this process doesn't stop with this process for equity.

333
00:54:15,522 --> 00:54:21,665
[SPEAKER_10]: but I can guarantee you an eight ward council moves us forward a lot quicker in equity.

334
00:54:22,985 --> 00:54:27,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And as we move forward, the equity builds off of that eight.

335
00:54:28,327 --> 00:54:30,908
[SPEAKER_10]: By not going with the eight, you're limiting that equity.

336
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:37,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's great when you could take numbers, and my colleague is a brilliant individual, we know that.

337
00:54:40,552 --> 00:54:44,654
[SPEAKER_10]: But I revert back to a very important comment I've made.

338
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:53,915
[SPEAKER_10]: The residents feel strongly with the 8-3 format, period.

339
00:54:55,536 --> 00:55:02,980
[SPEAKER_10]: What works, what doesn't work, what communities it works in, we can mold whatever we want to fit your narrative.

340
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:15,048
[SPEAKER_10]: But understand very simply, we've heard from the call-in center, the professionals, for all due respect to my colleague, 80 years of experience between the two of them.

341
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:27,971
[SPEAKER_10]: We've heard that I believe there's only a handful of councils throughout the commonwealth that aren't based the way of an A3 council.

342
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:36,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And doing my research and reaching out to those councils that do have that ward representation, it works.

343
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,621
[SPEAKER_10]: The voices are heard.

344
00:55:41,882 --> 00:55:43,043
[SPEAKER_10]: The neighborhoods come out.

345
00:55:44,304 --> 00:55:45,505
[SPEAKER_10]: People are rejuvenated.

346
00:55:47,092 --> 00:55:48,093
[SPEAKER_10]: There's more energy.

347
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:55,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And to say that this process might hurt my colleague, that's not true at all.

348
00:55:56,878 --> 00:55:57,778
[SPEAKER_10]: You're an incumbent.

349
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:10,626
[SPEAKER_10]: That's now controlling a base, where now this opens the process of eight wards, depending where we all live.

350
00:56:12,107 --> 00:56:15,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it could be that a few of you might be running against each other in a few years.

351
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:19,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can't have that because it's true.

352
00:56:22,957 --> 00:56:24,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a very simple format.

353
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:34,405
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easy to speak and spin dialogue and understand, but I want you to go back to the most important piece that I brought up and that I implore all of you to listen to.

354
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:43,031
[SPEAKER_10]: The community has worked very, very hard with the leadership of our Charter Review Committee.

355
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,041
[SPEAKER_10]: They have done years of data.

356
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:50,583
[SPEAKER_10]: They've done years of door knocking.

357
00:56:50,603 --> 00:56:51,984
[SPEAKER_10]: They've done years of meetings.

358
00:56:53,085 --> 00:56:54,085
[SPEAKER_10]: They've done the work.

359
00:56:55,126 --> 00:56:59,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a few weeks in between talking to friends at Harvard.

360
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:01,530
[SPEAKER_10]: They've done the work.

361
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:02,910
[SPEAKER_10]: They pulled up the information.

362
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:10,835
[SPEAKER_10]: They came to us for what their view was with the residents, all of the residents that they queried.

363
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:21,574
[SPEAKER_10]: They met with an organization that had nothing to gain, just experience, and they shared their opinions.

364
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:27,515
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can talk as much as we want and spin it as much as we want.

365
00:57:27,995 --> 00:57:29,256
[SPEAKER_10]: The bottom line is this.

366
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:42,378
[SPEAKER_10]: If you go against the 8-3 representation, if we go against it, you are truly going against what the majority of this community is asking for through the Charter Review Committee.

367
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:50,551
[SPEAKER_10]: And you are definitely not accelerating the process of equity, period.

368
00:57:50,711 --> 00:58:06,894
[SPEAKER_10]: You could say whatever you wanna say, whatever daddy you wanna say, but I will guarantee you, if we have a member in our community that feels like they need to run and they might be marginalized, it's not gonna work when you have to do it with two wards, that's even difficult.

369
00:58:08,295 --> 00:58:09,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And at large, we know how hard that is.

370
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:15,701
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, the vote will be the vote.

371
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:26,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope that my colleagues reconsider and actually go back to November past and remember what you promised your people.

372
00:58:28,689 --> 00:58:39,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Because again, I'm only bringing this up because they're calling me and they're sharing it with me to share this council publicly.

373
00:58:41,697 --> 00:58:41,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So

374
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,270
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave you with that.

375
00:58:44,431 --> 00:58:50,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important that we could spin anything we want, and we can say whatever we want to make it fit whatever narrative we want.

376
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:59,440
[SPEAKER_10]: But if it's right in front of you, and I won't say duck anymore, if it's right in front of you, and if it's black and white, it's black and white.

377
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:02,561
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's been said and heard.

378
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:11,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you've gotten a bunch of emails yourselves, phone calls yourselves, people from the podium, people that were on Zoom in the last couple of meetings, they've shared this.

379
00:59:14,783 --> 00:59:21,325
[SPEAKER_10]: because I haven't heard one person come back and say, hey, Councilor Scarpelli, what a great format, five and four.

380
00:59:25,327 --> 00:59:25,867
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

381
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:28,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

382
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:30,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan.

383
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:34,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

384
00:59:35,191 --> 00:59:39,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just want to give my kind of perspective on things.

385
00:59:40,973 --> 00:59:44,314
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, if this were coming into

386
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:45,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

387
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:53,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

388
00:59:53,544 --> 01:00:05,770
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this were coming into, because I was not on the governance committee, if this were coming into this body, whether it was eight and three or five and four, four and five, I guess, either way, I would vote in favor.

389
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:16,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that we want a combination of more localized members as well as at-large members.

390
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:18,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is what I am for.

391
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:23,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So either way, whichever of those it was, I would be voting in favor of it.

392
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:40,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is also fair to say that the survey that the study committee did included a question about combination of wards and at large.

393
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It did not ever ask

394
01:00:43,927 --> 01:00:48,016
[SPEAKER_04]: whether that should be four districts or eight wards.

395
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:51,925
[SPEAKER_04]: A little odd because they are recommending four

396
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:56,143
[SPEAKER_04]: for school committee and eight for city council.

397
01:00:56,183 --> 01:01:02,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like maybe you include that in your survey so that you can get that information.

398
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:11,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally don't believe that we have any idea how many people in Medford would prefer the eight wards versus how many people in Medford would prefer four districts.

399
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:19,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I can look at the numbers right now, people who want a combination of wards and at large, and you know,

400
01:01:22,498 --> 01:01:26,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it that ward in Medford means a very specific thing.

401
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:29,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I think our wards in Medford are quite small compared to a lot of the other cities.

402
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:36,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So combination of some sort of localized and at large is 60% of people.

403
01:01:36,263 --> 01:01:39,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is what we are voting on.

404
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:45,306
[SPEAKER_04]: To stay as is, meaning all at large, 18% of people think we should stay all at large.

405
01:01:46,466 --> 01:01:48,787
[SPEAKER_04]: 17% of people think we should be all wards.

406
01:01:53,749 --> 01:01:58,531
[SPEAKER_04]: you have approximately the same number of people who think it should stay like 20%, 20% almost.

407
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:06,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 18%, 17% say that it should be all at large, 17% say it should be all ward, and 60% say it should be a combination.

408
01:02:07,514 --> 01:02:16,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a decent argument to say that something that is near half and half is maybe

409
01:02:18,327 --> 01:02:20,188
[SPEAKER_04]: something that people in Medford want.

410
01:02:21,268 --> 01:02:29,370
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunate that we really have no idea whether the community would prefer eight or four, because that was never asked.

411
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to push back a little bit on this.

412
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:36,072
[SPEAKER_04]: We know absolutely certainly that everyone in Medford wants eight words.

413
01:02:36,312 --> 01:02:39,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that that question was ever asked or answered.

414
01:02:40,893 --> 01:02:46,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah, like I said, I would be in favor of mixed whether it was eight or four.

415
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think going to a slightly larger council is good too.

416
01:02:49,923 --> 01:02:51,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's just my position.

417
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:54,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

418
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:56,771
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro and then Councilor Collins.

419
01:02:56,811 --> 01:02:57,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Lazzaro.

420
01:02:58,330 --> 01:02:59,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

421
01:03:00,091 --> 01:03:12,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to mention that, though it would be wonderful if we could do this, we can't take a survey of every resident of the city every time we vote on something as a council.

422
01:03:13,115 --> 01:03:15,036
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're a representative democracy.

423
01:03:15,076 --> 01:03:19,618
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about things, we think hard thoughts about the nitty gritty.

424
01:03:19,678 --> 01:03:21,579
[SPEAKER_03]: We do the research, we learn about things.

425
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:24,700
[SPEAKER_03]: We were elected by the residents to

426
01:03:26,342 --> 01:03:27,822
[SPEAKER_03]: think more deeply about stuff.

427
01:03:27,982 --> 01:03:42,566
[SPEAKER_03]: The vast majority of people that live in the city don't want to have to learn about the intricacies of ward-based representation versus at-large versus a combination versus other options.

428
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:46,226
[SPEAKER_03]: The same holds for the Charter Study Committee.

429
01:03:46,246 --> 01:03:47,467
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a ton of work.

430
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,407
[SPEAKER_03]: They presented us with some options.

431
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:51,868
[SPEAKER_03]: We took them.

432
01:03:54,682 --> 01:04:06,185
[SPEAKER_03]: vast majority of the people that voted for us said, hey, we think that based on your background and what you've presented to us about who you are, you're the kind of person that we would like to make these decisions for us.

433
01:04:07,486 --> 01:04:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: They may not be able to tell us what they think about each individual issue.

434
01:04:12,387 --> 01:04:16,108
[SPEAKER_03]: They're telling us they would like us to look into it and figure it out and make a decision.

435
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:21,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So similar to what Councilor Callahan was saying,

436
01:04:22,903 --> 01:04:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

437
01:04:24,424 --> 01:04:25,785
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing our best here.

438
01:04:26,485 --> 01:04:49,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be so wonderful if we had good faith from our neighbors and the residents that we are trying hard to figure out what the best thing is that we can suggest and offer as we make these choices going forward.

439
01:04:50,047 --> 01:04:57,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it would be wonderful if we could pull every single resident of Medford on every single question, but we can't.

440
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:01,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're just thinking hard about it and trying to figure out what the best choices.

441
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:02,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

442
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,261
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

443
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:06,542
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Councilor Collins.

444
01:05:09,024 --> 01:05:09,865
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, President Bears.

445
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:14,369
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate the discussion from my colleagues on this.

446
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:14,429
[SPEAKER_28]: Um,

447
01:05:20,673 --> 01:05:31,383
[SPEAKER_28]: in this question of who we're talking about, not the only change we've made to the charter, but one of the changes that I think a lot of the community that's paying attention to this issue at all is most delighted to.

448
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:37,248
[SPEAKER_28]: And I hear it being brought up a lot, what we don't know, what we can't know, what we do know.

449
01:05:37,748 --> 01:05:47,397
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think some of my fellow Councilors have made the point quite well that we cannot purport to know what the community

450
01:05:49,185 --> 01:05:52,127
[SPEAKER_28]: as a monolith knows or feels.

451
01:05:53,388 --> 01:06:00,614
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't believe that we know what the majority of the community thinks about this particular issue specifically.

452
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:03,096
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm really grateful for the outreach that was done.

453
01:06:03,116 --> 01:06:07,400
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that's informed this process very meaningfully.

454
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:13,725
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm glad that we have data from the residents that were polled through the Charter Study Committee's process.

455
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:23,907
[SPEAKER_28]: But I don't think that what we can say is that we know how the community feels about this proposal.

456
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:28,869
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think that anybody can say that.

457
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,449
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't say that my fellow councillors have said that they don't feel that they can make that statement.

458
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:33,430
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think that anybody can.

459
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:43,612
[SPEAKER_28]: However, I think what's important for this city council, what feels important to me as a councillor is to focus on what we can know for certain

460
01:06:44,952 --> 01:07:10,798
[SPEAKER_28]: which is that what residents want out of this process is a governance structure that works better than before and gets us closer to what we can know will be better for this community, which is more localized representation that seeks to balance what it seems like what we can extrapolate from the community feedback that we've gotten, which is that most people favor a mixed system, and to balance that with the research and the data statistics that we've gathered in good faith,

461
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:25,424
[SPEAKER_28]: from various sources, including the Collins Center, including also supplementary studies and research from sources that are renowned and should be respected in the field and certainly shouldn't be condescended in this conversation that are enriching this process.

462
01:07:27,124 --> 01:07:31,026
[SPEAKER_28]: Our responsibility is not to take a vote that will make

463
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:36,333
[SPEAKER_28]: people closest to us happy with us.

464
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:45,159
[SPEAKER_28]: Our responsibility is to take the votes that we think are right and best for the community long term, even if it will cost us politically short or long term.

465
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:48,421
[SPEAKER_28]: The responsibility is to outcomes and not popularity.

466
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:57,507
[SPEAKER_28]: That is why I have come down in favor of four district Councilors and five at-large Councilors.

467
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:22,680
[SPEAKER_28]: And I just think not exclusive to this issue, but in general, when we start talking about knowing for certain what the community as a whole feels and believes, the community feedback that we know that we have, the input that we know that we've gotten should always be considered and treated with all of the gravity and meaningfulness that it deserves and

468
01:08:24,769 --> 01:08:42,626
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it does a disservice to the outcomes when we let ourselves believe that what we have heard from the people who are most tuned in and most easy to access and most plugged in to feedback channels in the city, when we let ourselves believe that that is the whole picture, I think we do a disservice to the greater outcomes.

469
01:08:43,447 --> 01:08:49,333
[SPEAKER_28]: And the overall point to me of reinvestigating representation in the city council

470
01:08:52,211 --> 01:09:05,802
[SPEAKER_28]: is to focus the consequences of those outcomes of the people who are least engaged in these processes already, the people that we are least likely to have heard from in this process and in others, people who are least likely to be represented or that we're hearing from in any form.

471
01:09:06,303 --> 01:09:07,744
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's why I think it's so important to

472
01:09:10,487 --> 01:09:25,680
[SPEAKER_28]: way what we know some people feel, many people feel, and to not diminish that feedback whatsoever, to not diminish it as an ingredient in this process whatsoever, but to balance it with what else we know about the consequences of these various strategies.

473
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:27,102
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

474
01:09:29,363 --> 01:09:30,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

475
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Callahan.

476
01:09:32,246 --> 01:09:33,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

477
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:34,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

478
01:09:36,336 --> 01:09:40,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've heard this over and over again with this council is we were voted for.

479
01:09:41,519 --> 01:09:43,159
[SPEAKER_10]: We were voted to make these decisions.

480
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:57,967
[SPEAKER_10]: We were, what we did was support a body that would go out to the public to do all the work for us, to do everything that we're looking for.

481
01:09:57,987 --> 01:09:59,408
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just saying that's not happening.

482
01:10:00,248 --> 01:10:00,888
[SPEAKER_10]: They did that.

483
01:10:02,809 --> 01:10:03,870
[SPEAKER_10]: The charter review committee,

484
01:10:05,057 --> 01:10:14,565
[SPEAKER_10]: was given the ability to go out all over the community and get what this community as a whole thought was best for this community, our community.

485
01:10:16,026 --> 01:10:22,111
[SPEAKER_10]: To say that we can't go out and survey the whole community, let's do that.

486
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:34,770
[SPEAKER_10]: But even to that point, we have a charter review committee that this council voted for, that we pushed through, that we, excuse me, excuse me, I take that back, you're right, we didn't vote for it, but we support it.

487
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,312
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to clarify, the council was not involved in the formation of the charter.

488
01:10:37,332 --> 01:10:41,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so we support it, that we support and we applaud it every time you came up.

489
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:49,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry, because I'm getting testimony from people on the committee that feel a little slighted from my colleagues' comments.

490
01:10:50,006 --> 01:11:03,851
[SPEAKER_10]: that felt some of the charter members feel that while they're insulted right now for the way that things were presented just now, just to share with you that the idea that that work wasn't done, the work was done.

491
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,492
[SPEAKER_10]: We applauded these members.

492
01:11:07,172 --> 01:11:08,212
[SPEAKER_10]: We applauded the two years.

493
01:11:08,252 --> 01:11:10,133
[SPEAKER_10]: We applauded the over 200 meetings.

494
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,314
[SPEAKER_10]: They went out, went to corner to corner.

495
01:11:12,354 --> 01:11:15,415
[SPEAKER_10]: They got the information that you are saying that we don't have.

496
01:11:15,755 --> 01:11:16,335
[SPEAKER_10]: We have it.

497
01:11:17,796 --> 01:11:18,216
[SPEAKER_10]: We have it.

498
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:19,649
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they came back with.

499
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:26,533
[SPEAKER_10]: They came back with the report that favorably said, unanimously from the people that I've talked to, that it was eight and three.

500
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:37,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you say, you know, well, we were elected to make these decisions.

501
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:46,942
[SPEAKER_10]: We're minimizing the fact that this elected body understood that there was a charter review committee that went out and did the work.

502
01:11:48,065 --> 01:11:59,430
[SPEAKER_10]: And we sat through maybe four or five meetings, and all of a sudden came back with an idea or a process that you think, six of you think, that that might be the best way to go.

503
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:00,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Five and four.

504
01:12:03,711 --> 01:12:09,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's disingenuous to say that the work wasn't done, that people didn't do their homework, that they didn't listen to people.

505
01:12:09,394 --> 01:12:10,674
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not listening to people.

506
01:12:11,334 --> 01:12:12,755
[SPEAKER_10]: They said it over and over again.

507
01:12:13,945 --> 01:12:19,246
[SPEAKER_10]: that the Charter Review Committee did their homework, they talked to people, they came back.

508
01:12:20,886 --> 01:12:39,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll guarantee you this, maybe we didn't hit 100 out of 100 people, but if you asked 100 people, hey, would you like a city council representative in your neighborhood or

509
01:12:40,881 --> 01:12:48,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you want to share with another ward and minimize how important your ward is?

510
01:12:48,428 --> 01:12:50,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's what the questioning is, because that's what I'm hearing.

511
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:51,771
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what people have said to me.

512
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:58,236
[SPEAKER_10]: So wait, so saying that possibly my ward won't be represented, that's saying what?

513
01:12:58,316 --> 01:13:03,341
[SPEAKER_10]: That the council doesn't feel that my neighborhood is that important?

514
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:06,944
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the questions that were asked to me.

515
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:31,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we're hearing tonight is truly a lot of talk, but you haven't answered the questions that's being asked by, when I say 20 out of 20 people that reached out to me, are you doing what the residents are asking for?

516
01:13:31,345 --> 01:13:35,306
[SPEAKER_10]: And you don't need a survey to say that.

517
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:37,167
[SPEAKER_10]: The people did their homework.

518
01:13:38,108 --> 01:13:41,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if anybody in the Charter Review Committee feels slighted,

519
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope it's not for me, it's not intended.

520
01:13:45,222 --> 01:13:46,984
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate the work that you've done.

521
01:13:47,564 --> 01:13:52,328
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I unanimously supported your 8-3 format.

522
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:55,951
[SPEAKER_10]: We went through the process, the exercise with the call-in center.

523
01:13:57,112 --> 01:13:59,875
[SPEAKER_10]: They supported the 8-3, it was very clear.

524
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:10,704
[SPEAKER_10]: So, excuse me, they didn't support that, but understanding they've shown me enough information that the 8-3 format is what I would support.

525
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:23,122
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I just don't think that you're making a decision for what's best for this community and the future of this community when it comes to the elected body.

526
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:29,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you talk about equity, you're looking to see what fits this dialogue for this council.

527
01:14:32,984 --> 01:14:40,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And no matter what you say after this comment that I just made, I'm just telling you, that's the perception that's out to the public.

528
01:14:40,622 --> 01:14:47,626
[SPEAKER_10]: not not the George Scarpelli public, but the public that have reached out to me that normally wouldn't talk to me.

529
01:14:49,327 --> 01:15:00,334
[SPEAKER_10]: So and, you know, I'm just imploring you that I'm sharing this with people that support the six of you have called me and said, Thank you, Council Scarpelli.

530
01:15:00,754 --> 01:15:07,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really taken back with the people that I supported because I was under the impression that it was 83.

531
01:15:07,898 --> 01:15:07,958
[SPEAKER_10]: So

532
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:10,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

533
01:15:11,161 --> 01:15:11,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

534
01:15:11,481 --> 01:15:17,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I knew I have three Councilors, but I just want to go and say, I think what you just said, Councilor Scarpelli, about the people contacting you is healthy.

535
01:15:20,147 --> 01:15:23,909
[SPEAKER_17]: If again, I don't think the issue is that we're not listening people to people.

536
01:15:23,989 --> 01:15:26,211
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the issue is that there are people we disagree with.

537
01:15:27,712 --> 01:15:30,334
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's, that's what's at the core here, right?

538
01:15:30,574 --> 01:15:33,676
[SPEAKER_17]: There are people who might agree with me on 95% of what I do.

539
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:34,637
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't agree with me on this.

540
01:15:35,635 --> 01:15:38,896
[SPEAKER_17]: might disagree with you on 95% of what you do and say, but they agree with you on this.

541
01:15:39,676 --> 01:15:40,717
[SPEAKER_17]: That's democracy.

542
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:54,942
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm confident I've had conversations with residents who don't agree with me on this, residents who do agree with me on this, members of the Charter Study Committee who disagree with me on this, but don't think I'm a bad person for having a different opinion.

543
01:15:56,242 --> 01:15:58,343
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what I think healthy civic discourse is about.

544
01:16:00,434 --> 01:16:06,836
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not saying, and I'm not saying you're saying I'm a person, but you know, and there are going to be people who for this is the most important thing.

545
01:16:06,877 --> 01:16:11,938
[SPEAKER_17]: And they had an assumption that I felt a way that the platform didn't say.

546
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:17,200
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I don't think I said, never said there shall be eight and three.

547
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,761
[SPEAKER_17]: It was not written that way.

548
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:21,422
[SPEAKER_17]: There'll be people who this is their most important thing.

549
01:16:21,462 --> 01:16:24,843
[SPEAKER_17]: And they don't believe that that's the interpretation and we're going to disagree.

550
01:16:24,883 --> 01:16:27,904
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to have a conversation, I think, and we're going to get through it.

551
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:34,014
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's going to be people who aren't going to want to have that conversation and aren't going to be happy with me and aren't going to support me in the future.

552
01:16:34,754 --> 01:16:49,805
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are people who are going to feel otherwise and I'm confident that the body of work that we do collectively and the individual work that we all do speaks to all of our roles and if the voters disagree.

553
01:16:51,115 --> 01:16:53,816
[SPEAKER_17]: bless them and thank them because that is their right.

554
01:16:54,356 --> 01:17:00,017
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe you're right, maybe all six of us will be out of here because people don't like that we made this choice.

555
01:17:00,597 --> 01:17:02,417
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe all six of us might not even vote for it.

556
01:17:04,137 --> 01:17:10,359
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe we'll get thrown in the bag with everyone else, even if we did disagree on this or had different opinions on this.

557
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:13,879
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to note for the record, I didn't propose five and four.

558
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,280
[SPEAKER_17]: I came to the council

559
01:17:19,477 --> 01:17:24,480
[SPEAKER_17]: I put out to the public a different proposal, my colleagues felt it should be adjusted, it was adjusted.

560
01:17:26,701 --> 01:17:33,145
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think, and I really, the only piece of this that I really have a struggle with is that idea that

561
01:17:33,986 --> 01:17:35,267
[SPEAKER_17]: We all knew what the process was.

562
01:17:35,307 --> 01:17:38,630
[SPEAKER_17]: There would be a charter study committee that would put forward a proposal.

563
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:41,372
[SPEAKER_17]: This council would review and amend that proposal.

564
01:17:42,013 --> 01:17:43,574
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor would review and amend that proposal.

565
01:17:43,634 --> 01:17:52,321
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor got to make changes on her own, not in this meeting, not with public comment, not in front of everyone else.

566
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:59,346
[SPEAKER_17]: She'll get to make that choice after we send her what we send up as well in terms of whether she wants to support it or not.

567
01:18:00,858 --> 01:18:06,720
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, this is the process this council was elected and is legally required to review the proposal.

568
01:18:07,381 --> 01:18:16,484
[SPEAKER_17]: And this council went through an extensive process and made what I believe to be adjustments to 10% of the content of this charter.

569
01:18:17,284 --> 01:18:24,627
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just going to close there I have more to say, but I'm going to go to the rest of my fellow Councilors first but it just really on those points, you know,

570
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:27,332
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not that we're not listening.

571
01:18:27,392 --> 01:18:29,073
[SPEAKER_17]: It's that we don't agree with some people.

572
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:34,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people don't agree with me and they don't agree with some others of us for multitude of reasons.

573
01:18:34,558 --> 01:18:38,241
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm very confident that we can work through those disagreements.

574
01:18:40,502 --> 01:18:41,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan.

575
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:42,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

576
01:18:42,832 --> 01:18:50,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually wanted to bring up a totally different topic, the topic of ranked choice voting for single seat elections.

577
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:54,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be any districts or wards as well as the mayor.

578
01:18:56,484 --> 01:18:59,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize that I did not attend the final

579
01:19:02,844 --> 01:19:06,005
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know whether this was discussed.

580
01:19:06,645 --> 01:19:07,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not on the committee.

581
01:19:07,726 --> 01:19:13,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I did try to attend the other two meetings, but I would love to raise the topic.

582
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and here.

583
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:18,531
[SPEAKER_04]: From folks about the topic of ranked choice voting.

584
01:19:20,432 --> 01:19:20,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

585
01:19:20,932 --> 01:19:23,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, Councilor Kelly and and I will go to

586
01:19:26,671 --> 01:19:29,798
[SPEAKER_17]: multi-member districts, proportional bodies, ranked choice voting.

587
01:19:30,258 --> 01:19:33,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of these were things that I brought up in my conversations with the Charter Study Committee.

588
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:46,891
[SPEAKER_17]: If this had a ranked choice voting element to the Ward and District, to the eight and three model, I would feel much more confident about the upsides of that model and much less confident about the downsides.

589
01:19:47,051 --> 01:19:58,777
[SPEAKER_17]: But from the conversations that we had with the CSC and the Collins Center, essentially they said, because we're going through the special act process, things that the legislature has not approved before,

590
01:20:00,298 --> 01:20:08,445
[SPEAKER_17]: We should not include them because they're more likely to slow down the process of moving through the legislature or that the legislature is likely to not allow them at all.

591
01:20:08,865 --> 01:20:21,816
[SPEAKER_17]: And my understanding is that the places that do have ranked choice voting did so through home rule processes, and not through special act processes so that's my understanding of the discussion I don't know if Councilor Tseng if you have a further summary.

592
01:20:22,897 --> 01:20:24,098
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I think that's, that's about it.

593
01:20:25,312 --> 01:20:34,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so there's kind of a constriction on the models we're able to look at because of the Special Act process and the need for approval from the legislature, especially in a timely manner.

594
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,256
[SPEAKER_17]: I had Councilor Collins and Councilor Lembing.

595
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:42,657
[SPEAKER_17]: No, sorry, Councilor Lazzaro.

596
01:20:45,978 --> 01:20:49,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Me first, thank you.

597
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:50,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to

598
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:53,706
[SPEAKER_03]: mention a couple of things.

599
01:20:54,167 --> 01:21:06,811
[SPEAKER_03]: The first being that similar to what my colleagues have mentioned that we can sometimes disagree with our constituents or people that we frequently agree with.

600
01:21:07,852 --> 01:21:18,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there were even moments when the Charter Study Committee had disagreements with some of the results of the survey and didn't even include some elements of the survey that were

601
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:22,061
[SPEAKER_03]: respondents to the survey said they wanted one thing.

602
01:21:22,081 --> 01:21:35,558
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't what the recommendation was because of the committee's experience and their thoughts and their opinions and what they wanted to see in the charter, and so that wasn't included.

603
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:37,641
[SPEAKER_03]: These things were also already done.

604
01:21:40,001 --> 01:21:42,402
[SPEAKER_03]: That is similar to what we are also doing.

605
01:21:42,442 --> 01:21:47,603
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are happening in the process, throughout the process.

606
01:21:49,323 --> 01:21:49,803
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing.

607
01:21:49,883 --> 01:21:57,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing I wanted to say is that I think like changing our mind as people who work in politics and government is a wonderful thing to do.

608
01:21:58,145 --> 01:22:01,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, my colleague saying that he's changed his mind on such a

609
01:22:02,566 --> 01:22:04,728
[SPEAKER_03]: in such a clear and concrete way is amazing.

610
01:22:04,788 --> 01:22:06,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have changed my mind 87 times on this topic.

611
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:09,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I still, I change my mind every five minutes.

612
01:22:10,914 --> 01:22:20,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I am going to probably end up saying that I think it's, I think I will vote for Ward-based 8 and 3 only because I

613
01:22:28,028 --> 01:22:40,876
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's the main reason being because I talked to a number of people in Malden where they have word-based counsellors and the people that I've talked to who know their word counsellor have had positive experiences with that.

614
01:22:41,016 --> 01:22:45,579
[SPEAKER_03]: They like their word-based counsellor, they like having direct access to them.

615
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:51,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I presented that question to people in a direct way and with no like kind of

616
01:22:51,922 --> 01:22:53,663
[SPEAKER_03]: background, and they said, oh, yeah, I really like it.

617
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:55,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

618
01:22:56,704 --> 01:22:57,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, wow, that's OK.

619
01:22:59,284 --> 01:23:01,145
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a very valuable piece of data for me.

620
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:08,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you can't ask anybody in Medford what that's like because we've never had that, I just felt like that was useful.

621
01:23:10,108 --> 01:23:17,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really, really hard to tell for a city that's never had this form of government before.

622
01:23:20,457 --> 01:23:24,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think it's very frustrating when the discourse is, it's gonna be six and one.

623
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:30,185
[SPEAKER_03]: When people keep forgetting that when we voted about this in committee, I voted with Councilor Scarpelli.

624
01:23:31,346 --> 01:23:32,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody remembers that.

625
01:23:33,107 --> 01:23:34,228
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not a monolith.

626
01:23:34,548 --> 01:23:36,530
[SPEAKER_03]: We have frequently been voting differently from each other.

627
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:37,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

628
01:23:40,853 --> 01:23:42,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Some might call that spin.

629
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:45,577
[SPEAKER_17]: What are Councilors saying?

630
01:23:46,607 --> 01:23:47,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

631
01:23:49,628 --> 01:23:52,590
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought someone else was in queue for me, but I'll go.

632
01:23:55,511 --> 01:24:02,274
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, you know, I hear what Councilor Lazzaro is hearing too.

633
01:24:03,254 --> 01:24:06,536
[SPEAKER_13]: That is something I've heard from people in different cities.

634
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:17,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I have to say, I hear equally from people who live in cities with districts instead of wards that they also feel the same, that they also feel like they have a direct line to their Councilor.

635
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:26,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Something that came up in a phone call today was that the wards don't necessarily align with the neighborhoods of the city as well.

636
01:24:27,425 --> 01:24:32,067
[SPEAKER_13]: And so at the edges, all in all, they make sense.

637
01:24:32,347 --> 01:24:36,448
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the edges, sometimes they can be arbitrary because we need to get the math to work out.

638
01:24:37,432 --> 01:24:47,464
[SPEAKER_13]: And then this was from someone you know this concern was from someone who is leaning towards word representation at the start of the call and you know he brought up the fact that.

639
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:58,874
[SPEAKER_13]: he lives in one ward and feels like he's more of a resident of the other ward because that's where he goes to do his shopping and that's where things happen for him.

640
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:14,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think a strength for me of the district system is that you at least have, and we can disagree about this, this is just an open conversation about policy, but strength of the district system for me is that I think most people will fall into a district that they feel a part of.

641
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:23,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas you risk, with ward representation people on the margins, feeling like they're not really a member of that ward because they live one street over.

642
01:25:24,145 --> 01:25:34,588
[SPEAKER_13]: And people who, certain wards might vote certain ways, and they might feel politically isolated in that sense as well, and not being able to run for office because of that.

643
01:25:36,169 --> 01:25:37,349
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a complicated debate.

644
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:40,550
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no right or wrong answer.

645
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:42,271
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all imperfect answers.

646
01:25:44,866 --> 01:26:00,870
[SPEAKER_13]: I another concern I've heard, and I feel is compelling, and that ties to this is to is that the wind count for, you know, getting a Councilor elected in one ward might be dramatically different from getting a Councilor elected in another word.

647
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:11,372
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, we've heard that perhaps moving toward representation will ease the problem, because, because there's more local engagement but

648
01:26:12,393 --> 01:26:18,080
[SPEAKER_13]: That Medford is a unique city to, we have one word that's essentially half the university.

649
01:26:18,761 --> 01:26:26,711
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a ward, that is half apartment blocks, and that in itself is a whole other challenge when it comes to campaigning to.

650
01:26:27,532 --> 01:26:30,555
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think part of what's affecting my decision.

651
01:26:32,427 --> 01:26:44,091
[SPEAKER_13]: leaning towards district over ward is that I don't think it's fair for one Councilor to be elected with, you know, 200 votes and another Councilor to need a thousand votes to get elected.

652
01:26:44,531 --> 01:26:46,531
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually see that happening at the Senate, right?

653
01:26:46,571 --> 01:26:49,952
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of complaints about how the U.S.

654
01:26:49,992 --> 01:26:58,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Senate determines representation via geography more than representation via people who live and engage with the process.

655
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:15,392
[SPEAKER_13]: And even though our wards and precincts are nominally drawn to be quite even a number, that's not reflected in other metrics in terms of who people are engaging for civic services, who's registered to vote, who's on the city census, right?

656
01:27:15,412 --> 01:27:16,492
[SPEAKER_13]: All those numbers are different.

657
01:27:17,553 --> 01:27:25,580
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's something I think our committee talked about in the governance committee, but something that we should consider as well.

658
01:27:26,727 --> 01:27:27,388
[SPEAKER_13]: moving forward.

659
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:35,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I mean, I've received constituent requests from top students, but by and large, their requests are with the Tufts administration, and not us.

660
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:40,075
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, you know, I've, I've heard about equity of workload.

661
01:27:40,935 --> 01:27:44,277
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's just, you know, Medford is a unique city in that sense.

662
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:47,881
[SPEAKER_13]: There's much more to say.

663
01:27:47,901 --> 01:27:52,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I've heard a lot said about the survey that was conducted as well.

664
01:27:53,364 --> 01:27:59,167
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I mean, I did surveys for a few years, for four years as a job.

665
01:27:59,948 --> 01:28:02,389
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, surveys are hard to design.

666
01:28:02,409 --> 01:28:04,110
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a very exact science to them.

667
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:09,532
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I appreciate that our Charter Study Committee did a survey.

668
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:14,415
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's way better that they did a survey than not to have this information.

669
01:28:15,155 --> 01:28:21,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the risk is letting the survey dictate every decision that we make.

670
01:28:22,457 --> 01:28:23,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it can inform our decisions.

671
01:28:24,437 --> 01:28:27,958
[SPEAKER_13]: But as Councilor Callahan brought up, the questions aren't all precise, right?

672
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:30,658
[SPEAKER_13]: There are 663 respondents.

673
01:28:30,818 --> 01:28:33,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that look like the city of Medford?

674
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:41,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the Charter Study Committee did actually work really hard to try to reach constituencies that normally aren't reached in the political process.

675
01:28:42,761 --> 01:28:51,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, still, we see that the survey is very stacked towards homeowners in a way that is nowhere representative of our city as a whole.

676
01:28:52,008 --> 01:28:54,350
[SPEAKER_13]: It's stacked towards, you know,

677
01:28:55,661 --> 01:28:57,363
[SPEAKER_13]: It's stacked against people of color as well.

678
01:28:57,704 --> 01:29:07,055
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think those are, you know, things to consider when we talk about the survey you know it's important to me as someone who's worked in the field before to treat it with nuance.

679
01:29:07,436 --> 01:29:08,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, let's not throw it away.

680
01:29:09,098 --> 01:29:13,243
[SPEAKER_13]: It's helpful, but it's, we have to be careful when we analyze the data as well.

681
01:29:14,253 --> 01:29:25,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, something you know, Councilor Collins mentioned to to all of us how their residents who aren't completely in the know about charter review as well.

682
01:29:26,197 --> 01:29:27,198
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've actually had

683
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:41,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are a lot of the conversations that I've been having too, is me going to, for example, Asian community events and talking to residents about what I'm doing this year on the city council.

684
01:29:41,683 --> 01:29:45,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And obviously charter review has been the main thing on my docket for the last two months.

685
01:29:46,404 --> 01:29:48,985
[SPEAKER_13]: And when they hear about it, they're like, why are you changing it at all?

686
01:29:49,405 --> 01:29:50,906
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually quite a lot of that.

687
01:29:51,306 --> 01:29:54,667
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people don't understand that actually an all at large system isn't great.

688
01:29:55,207 --> 01:29:56,508
[SPEAKER_13]: And I still think it's not great.

689
01:29:56,728 --> 01:29:59,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, actually, all at large, it's the worst system that we could have.

690
01:29:59,971 --> 01:30:11,780
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are people out there who aren't dissatisfied with things how they are and who we just have to have a real deep conversation about.

691
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,021
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's something.

692
01:30:13,061 --> 01:30:19,245
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like when we talk about engaging the public on these issues, we need to engage with a deep conversation.

693
01:30:20,246 --> 01:30:27,673
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what democracy actually looks like, is when we have those roundtable discussions at community events.

694
01:30:27,893 --> 01:30:29,915
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes they might lead us to one answer.

695
01:30:29,955 --> 01:30:31,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes they might lead us to other answers.

696
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:32,797
[SPEAKER_13]: That's natural.

697
01:30:32,837 --> 01:30:34,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And in democracy, not everyone agrees.

698
01:30:34,919 --> 01:30:36,901
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think those are just things to consider.

699
01:30:36,921 --> 01:30:41,805
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think on the role of it's been brought up that

700
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:57,810
[SPEAKER_13]: what we're doing is not necessarily respectful of the Charter Study Committee, but I have to say, from the way I see it, is that we're adding to the product of the Charter Study Committee.

701
01:30:58,231 --> 01:31:07,839
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't, as Councilor Collins noted earlier tonight, we haven't rewritten, but besides, you know, the proposals we've talked, the self-substantive edits that we're talking about tonight,

702
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,581
[SPEAKER_13]: 90% of the charter is exactly the same document, if not 95%.

703
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:17,583
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that because I went through line by line last week and made red line edits.

704
01:31:18,503 --> 01:31:28,066
[SPEAKER_13]: And substantively, most of the ideas that are in there, again, 90% of the ideas that are in there are in the version of the document before us tonight.

705
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:32,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, where I see our role is coming in is due diligence.

706
01:31:32,408 --> 01:31:32,908
[SPEAKER_13]: It's us

707
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:45,432
[SPEAKER_13]: doing the diligent review of the proposals, us adding in the really important experience of being city councilors ourselves, seeing the job in action and knowing how it works.

708
01:31:46,153 --> 01:31:55,883
[SPEAKER_13]: It is in reviewing the literature, again, the voting rights literature, the civil rights literature, the urban development, housing, suburban development literature out there that

709
01:31:57,083 --> 01:32:04,905
[SPEAKER_13]: that we heard from our governance committee didn't get covered in the charter study committees, you know, meeting in their discussions.

710
01:32:05,465 --> 01:32:05,905
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine.

711
01:32:06,205 --> 01:32:09,086
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we, you know, that's why we have a role in this as well.

712
01:32:09,226 --> 01:32:15,888
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why our governance committee reviewed the proposals so thoroughly, but there's lots to be said.

713
01:32:16,128 --> 01:32:17,168
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't want to monopolize time.

714
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:19,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

715
01:32:19,129 --> 01:32:20,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any of the councillors would like to speak at this time?

716
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:28,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, I'm going to share my viewpoint at this point.

717
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:44,993
[SPEAKER_17]: First thing I wanna go around us and is disagreeing can be hard and there'll be hard feelings and people won't be happy because someone disagreed with them on something that they didn't expect them to disagree with them on.

718
01:32:46,414 --> 01:32:48,775
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're gonna work through that.

719
01:32:52,437 --> 01:32:54,259
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna bring us back to in general,

720
01:32:55,045 --> 01:32:56,545
[SPEAKER_17]: and this is my five bullet points.

721
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:19,632
[SPEAKER_17]: If we take the sum total of the survey and what the Charter Study Committee brought us for public process, and to be honest, my own conversations over the last five years, in general, this proposal reflects a consensus of the people.

722
01:33:21,193 --> 01:33:24,474
[SPEAKER_17]: I think both the Charter Study Committee proposal and the amended proposal.

723
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:30,844
[SPEAKER_17]: It's to keep a mayor council form of government, no city manager, we're not doing that.

724
01:33:31,744 --> 01:33:40,471
[SPEAKER_17]: To have a balance of powers where the council is slightly stronger and the mayor is slightly less stronger, but to maintain a strong mayor weak council system, which both do.

725
01:33:40,491 --> 01:33:48,337
[SPEAKER_17]: To have hybrid representation for the council and the school committee, meaning some at large and some localized.

726
01:33:49,453 --> 01:33:59,056
[SPEAKER_17]: to create a clear document that is modern and that residents can access and read when they wanna understand what the foundational document of our community is.

727
01:34:00,836 --> 01:34:03,877
[SPEAKER_17]: And quite frankly, that there would be less mayoral involvement in the school committee.

728
01:34:04,637 --> 01:34:15,140
[SPEAKER_17]: That seems pretty clear as well, both from my conversations and the discussion we've had and from the Charter Study Committee's materials and report, which I have read the whole thing a couple of times.

729
01:34:17,972 --> 01:34:20,593
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what the people seem to want.

730
01:34:22,093 --> 01:34:25,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I think both of these proposals reflect that.

731
01:34:28,656 --> 01:34:45,562
[SPEAKER_17]: On the specifics, I also wanna just talk about the process really quickly that when we talk about this council's involvement, I think in addition to whatever anyone else wants to bring up, this is also the most diverse council with the most women, the youngest,

732
01:34:46,656 --> 01:34:50,518
[SPEAKER_17]: with the first person of color under this form of government, and I believe under the last form of government.

733
01:34:51,418 --> 01:34:53,419
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that should be taken into account as well.

734
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:59,503
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe Councilor Tseng is the first person of color to vote in this process so far, from Sim to Stern.

735
01:34:59,523 --> 01:35:02,244
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that should be accounted for as well.

736
01:35:03,725 --> 01:35:09,688
[SPEAKER_17]: When we talk about the proposal of what does hybrid representation look like on both bodies.

737
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,521
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I came in with a different thought.

738
01:35:13,581 --> 01:35:17,962
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought, wow, I really like what the charter study committee proposed for the school committee.

739
01:35:18,163 --> 01:35:19,343
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it works for the council.

740
01:35:19,363 --> 01:35:19,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it.

741
01:35:21,724 --> 01:35:23,965
[SPEAKER_17]: I was summarily told from all sides that I was wrong.

742
01:35:26,506 --> 01:35:31,748
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have a different proposal in front of us, which is five at-large Councilors and four district Councilors.

743
01:35:33,389 --> 01:35:39,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Am I unhappy that what I thought was a good idea was not moved ahead?

744
01:35:39,932 --> 01:35:40,372
[SPEAKER_17]: I might be.

745
01:35:44,061 --> 01:35:54,066
[SPEAKER_17]: But the reason I think the principle around how I feel about the localized and at-large representation and hybrid representation on the council is one of balance.

746
01:35:55,286 --> 01:35:57,207
[SPEAKER_17]: There are costs and benefits to every decision.

747
01:35:57,227 --> 01:36:02,510
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe that this model minimizes the costs.

748
01:36:03,658 --> 01:36:06,881
[SPEAKER_17]: of more localized representation and maximizes the benefits.

749
01:36:07,582 --> 01:36:10,524
[SPEAKER_17]: The core benefit we've heard is this question of equity.

750
01:36:11,245 --> 01:36:17,170
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think Councilor Tseng really spoke to maximizing that this can maximize that benefit.

751
01:36:18,011 --> 01:36:21,554
[SPEAKER_17]: There are real costs when we talk about the localized representation.

752
01:36:21,634 --> 01:36:26,819
[SPEAKER_17]: I also have talked to councillors in many communities, district and ward, both hybrid communities.

753
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:37,588
[SPEAKER_17]: And they do talk about some of the downsides, seats that go with an incumbent for 10, 20, 30 years, almost always unchallenged.

754
01:36:38,809 --> 01:36:39,429
[SPEAKER_17]: That happens.

755
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:55,015
[SPEAKER_17]: They talk about maybe it's not formally in the charter that a ward Councilor gets a power, but there's informal power that comes through process and relationship with the mayor where a ward Councilor or a localized Councilor in any model district or ward

756
01:36:55,897 --> 01:37:03,579
[SPEAKER_17]: ends up having significantly more say in something that's going on in their district or ward than the other members of the council.

757
01:37:03,839 --> 01:37:06,240
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe something never even gets to the other Councilors.

758
01:37:08,461 --> 01:37:10,201
[SPEAKER_17]: There is no consideration by everybody.

759
01:37:10,381 --> 01:37:12,622
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what has happened in some communities.

760
01:37:12,662 --> 01:37:13,962
[SPEAKER_17]: People have talked to me about that.

761
01:37:16,243 --> 01:37:23,905
[SPEAKER_17]: As I noted, I think because we're going through the special act process, there are a lot of options that could have mitigated these costs.

762
01:37:25,476 --> 01:37:30,220
[SPEAKER_17]: like a ranked choice model, or looking at multi-member districts, or looking at proportional representation.

763
01:37:32,641 --> 01:37:45,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng cited social science research, best practices, and I won't reiterate it, but just to say again, that looking at those other ways of voting,

764
01:37:46,924 --> 01:37:50,085
[SPEAKER_17]: like a ranked choice model, like multi-member districts.

765
01:37:50,786 --> 01:37:57,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are ways to solve the costs that are associated with localized representation and preserve the benefits.

766
01:37:58,349 --> 01:38:01,350
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not tools available to us because of the process that we're going through.

767
01:38:04,032 --> 01:38:15,737
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just gonna finish and remind everyone and say that by and large, from every conversation that I've had and from what the Charter Study Committee report said, people want a charter that keeps the mayor council form of government.

768
01:38:16,702 --> 01:38:21,365
[SPEAKER_17]: that slightly strengthens the council but maintains a strong mayor weak council form of government.

769
01:38:22,425 --> 01:38:29,690
[SPEAKER_17]: That is a clear document that is modern and easy for people to access and understand the foundation of our community's governance.

770
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:37,154
[SPEAKER_17]: That there is less mayoral involvement in the school committee and that there's hybrid representation for both the council and the school committee.

771
01:38:37,779 --> 01:38:55,448
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am confidently happy to say that this proposal, if the amendment voted by Councilor Tseng is, or proposed by Councilor Tseng has moved to the regular meeting, and if the council at its regular meeting refers us to the mayor, that it fulfills those principles.

772
01:38:57,830 --> 01:39:00,311
[SPEAKER_17]: We may disagree on specifics.

773
01:39:01,031 --> 01:39:02,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone who disagrees with me,

774
01:39:03,797 --> 01:39:04,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Call me, email me.

775
01:39:05,619 --> 01:39:07,340
[SPEAKER_17]: I know some folks have tried to get in touch today.

776
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,701
[SPEAKER_17]: I've had a personal issue today.

777
01:39:10,483 --> 01:39:12,805
[SPEAKER_17]: And I apologize, I couldn't respond to people today.

778
01:39:12,825 --> 01:39:16,968
[SPEAKER_17]: I will try to as we move forward, as I move through this myself.

779
01:39:20,191 --> 01:39:22,092
[SPEAKER_17]: I've talked to a lot of people about this.

780
01:39:23,233 --> 01:39:27,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Anywho, but there has been some today, a few, who've contacted me today.

781
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:37,964
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just gonna say at the end of this that I feel that sometimes doing the right thing, what we believe to be the right thing is hard.

782
01:39:38,905 --> 01:39:48,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes it's not what our friends want or what the people who are most active want or what our colleagues want, but sometimes we still have to do it.

783
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:55,553
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm confident that as amended and referred out, this charter will pass.

784
01:39:56,538 --> 01:40:00,581
[SPEAKER_17]: with the voters because I don't think the voters are going to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

785
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:02,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I really don't.

786
01:40:03,503 --> 01:40:25,978
[SPEAKER_17]: And quite frankly, I hope as I will, and as I think many others will, that even though we didn't all get everything that we wanted to see in this charter, those of us who believe in changing this charter will work together to get this done and not put it into a political process and you say it gives ammunition to whomever or whatever.

787
01:40:27,017 --> 01:40:35,163
[SPEAKER_17]: I really hope that we can all work together and do that because I think the voters know that this reflects what they've said they'd like to see from a charter change.

788
01:40:35,403 --> 01:40:43,788
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we can all work together to fulfill that and have a new charter in effect in 2027 for the 2027 elections.

789
01:40:44,469 --> 01:40:45,490
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what I'll be doing.

790
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:46,911
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where I stand.

791
01:40:47,911 --> 01:40:53,155
[SPEAKER_17]: And to those who are frustrated or angry or confused or feel that I don't

792
01:40:54,768 --> 01:40:58,073
[SPEAKER_17]: have not, that this wasn't the way that I would approach this.

793
01:40:58,494 --> 01:41:00,457
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy to talk to you and I think we can work through it.

794
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:00,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

795
01:41:01,699 --> 01:41:02,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming.

796
01:41:05,265 --> 01:41:05,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

797
01:41:08,686 --> 01:41:15,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Apologies, I've been sitting here silently this whole time just listening to the discourse.

798
01:41:17,189 --> 01:41:24,131
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just did feel the need to put my own thoughts out there.

799
01:41:24,231 --> 01:41:26,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been kind of hesitant to do this.

800
01:41:28,217 --> 01:41:49,913
[SPEAKER_09]: do this at previous meetings like at the Governance Committee mainly because I'm not a voting member on those and partially because I think that the more the more kind of drama that comes out of this process, I think the less likely it is that people be inclined to vote on it.

801
01:41:49,953 --> 01:41:50,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So my

802
01:41:51,651 --> 01:42:05,819
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of my conversations have taken place with, you know, I've called up individual members of the Charter Study Committee to try to get, have a conversation with them about merits, the ins and out of different issues.

803
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:11,903
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been very grateful in instances where, you know, we could

804
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:22,878
[SPEAKER_09]: talk about like the actual issues, like if I vote on a certain part of the charter, if I vote one way or the other, what will be the best outcome in practice?

805
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:39,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't have that same conversation with everybody, but for the folks who I can have reasonable disagreements with and good conversations about the issues, I'm very grateful.

806
01:42:42,382 --> 01:42:51,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a member of the Medford Charter Review Coalition back in 2022, and I was one of the early members of the Charter Study Committee.

807
01:42:52,848 --> 01:42:59,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I stepped down after a couple of months when I started my city council campaign.

808
01:43:00,232 --> 01:43:09,777
[SPEAKER_09]: But the point is that seeing some form of charter review pass is very important to me personally.

809
01:43:09,797 --> 01:43:10,598
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that if you

810
01:43:11,461 --> 01:43:18,486
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, if you don't actually want this to pass, uh, the voters, the key, what you do is you make this as dramatic as possible.

811
01:43:18,566 --> 01:43:24,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And you, uh, just try to inflame tension so much that you come up with a pretense to go against it.

812
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:26,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not something I want to do.

813
01:43:26,752 --> 01:43:36,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I honestly think that the five, four system or the eight, three system, um, would be an improvement over what we have now.

814
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:38,561
[SPEAKER_09]: My view is that I,

815
01:43:40,247 --> 01:44:04,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the more important thing than either of those systems is getting the component of the charter whereby it's reviewed once every 10 years, because that way, if we end up passing 5-4, for instance, and we find out that it doesn't work as well as folks thought or 8-3, then the charter's reviewed once every 10 years, you can come back with a recommendation and then you can end up passing something new.

816
01:44:07,947 --> 01:44:16,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think it would be harder to go from 8-3 to 5-4 and cut two councillors off than it would be to expand from 9 to 11.

817
01:44:19,333 --> 01:44:22,935
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is one part of my calculus.

818
01:44:24,556 --> 01:44:31,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I also do actually agree that, you know, based on the conversations I've had that the

819
01:44:32,655 --> 01:44:39,123
[SPEAKER_09]: 8.3 model is the most popular among the folks I've talked with.

820
01:44:39,163 --> 01:44:48,035
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's also mainly because nothing else has really been presented as an option or kind of gone out into the public discourse.

821
01:44:50,358 --> 01:45:07,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've had the experience multiple times where I've had folks who I've worked with in the past, they'll send me an email saying, please go for the 8.3 system, call them up, have a conversation with them.

822
01:45:07,827 --> 01:45:10,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I bring up some of my concerns with it.

823
01:45:11,429 --> 01:45:15,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll say, OK, no, I see where you're coming from.

824
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:18,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the fact that they, I think,

825
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:26,665
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day there, they were saying that they really just want to get away from the seven at large system and go with something else.

826
01:45:27,645 --> 01:45:44,956
[SPEAKER_09]: So the issues, I've been a bit disappointed with the conversations that we've had in these chambers mainly because it's just gotten so politicized like so many other issues that it's kind of impossible to actually talk about the issues themselves.

827
01:45:44,996 --> 01:45:45,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also been,

828
01:45:46,437 --> 01:45:51,941
[SPEAKER_09]: thinking very strongly about, you know, the potential of offending people that I used to work with burning bridges.

829
01:45:52,862 --> 01:46:05,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And none of those are really, none of those are really considerations of like the central question of what will actually work out best for the city moving forward, like what practically will work out.

830
01:46:06,853 --> 01:46:11,837
[SPEAKER_09]: With the 8-3 system, I think it's the most popular, it's the most intuitive.

831
01:46:12,417 --> 01:46:16,060
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what folks have been emailing me about.

832
01:46:17,201 --> 01:46:21,864
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern with it has to do mainly with turnout.

833
01:46:22,484 --> 01:46:30,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have an Excel spreadsheet in front of me with the 2021 municipal elections turnout.

834
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:31,651
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a

835
01:46:33,668 --> 01:46:43,052
[SPEAKER_09]: there's like a 3.1 to one ratio between the turnout of voters in Ward three to the voters in Ward seven.

836
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:56,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And that reflects that Senate issue where like a Senator elected in California was elected with 36 million to represent 36 million voters, whereas one in Wyoming, like less than a million.

837
01:46:57,798 --> 01:47:02,360
[SPEAKER_09]: With the district system, it's mitigated a little bit.

838
01:47:02,481 --> 01:47:03,241
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Ward,

839
01:47:05,527 --> 01:47:14,476
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the, let's see, I have my, so the ratio between the highest average turnout district and the lowest average turnout district will be like 1.9 to one.

840
01:47:14,516 --> 01:47:17,399
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is that issue there.

841
01:47:17,419 --> 01:47:19,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's mainly what I'm thinking about.

842
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:19,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that,

843
01:47:31,252 --> 01:47:43,303
[SPEAKER_09]: There are there were philosophical differences in the approach of the Charter Study Committee versus the approach that Council has in the sense that I think the Charter Study Committee was

844
01:47:44,443 --> 01:48:03,366
[SPEAKER_09]: looking at what is kind of like theoretically the best model, like almost from a political science perspective, like what is, so, and I think that a lot of what Councilors are thinking about is what will practically happen, like what will be the outcome in effect.

845
01:48:03,786 --> 01:48:10,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's where a lot of this discrepancy is coming from between sort of the two approaches.

846
01:48:10,827 --> 01:48:12,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're both legitimate.

847
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:21,231
[SPEAKER_09]: but there does tend to be a little bit of, does tend to be a little bit of not seeing eye to eye there.

848
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:28,953
[SPEAKER_09]: So now there's a bit of a rambling speech right there, but I just wanted to, you know, I just wanted to offer my thoughts.

849
01:48:28,993 --> 01:48:32,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this, this is an issue that, that means a lot to me.

850
01:48:34,494 --> 01:48:39,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's something that I've thought about a lot over the past two years.

851
01:48:39,154 --> 01:48:40,995
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something I thought about a lot when campaigning.

852
01:48:42,818 --> 01:48:49,849
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, just because I've been keeping my mouth shut most of the time, it doesn't mean I haven't been thinking about it a lot.

853
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:50,771
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

854
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:52,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

855
01:48:53,856 --> 01:48:55,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Do any further comments by members of the council?

856
01:49:00,206 --> 01:49:03,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, could you read, read, sorry, Councilor Lazzaro.

857
01:49:03,827 --> 01:49:04,688
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have a motion on the floor.

858
01:49:04,728 --> 01:49:08,149
[SPEAKER_17]: I was gonna have the clerk read it, but this is, I'll go to you.

859
01:49:08,689 --> 01:49:27,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to offer a motion to, I would like to vote in favor of all of Councilor Tseng's amendments, but I would like to sever one,

860
01:49:29,218 --> 01:49:29,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that possible?

861
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:31,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we could do that.

862
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:34,519
[SPEAKER_17]: We could also if this is a motion to amend Councilor Sagan's motion.

863
01:49:34,539 --> 01:49:35,160
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

864
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:41,981
[SPEAKER_17]: If he doesn't want it, we could vote on the proposal to amend the motion, whichever one you prefer.

865
01:49:42,821 --> 01:49:49,303
[SPEAKER_17]: So are you essentially proposing to have a vote on the representation?

866
01:49:49,643 --> 01:49:50,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, separately.

867
01:49:56,621 --> 01:50:08,445
[SPEAKER_03]: motion to sever the council representation portion of the... There's a motion to sever and have a vote, separate vote on council.

868
01:50:13,187 --> 01:50:15,467
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to say that we could, there's two ways we could do this.

869
01:50:15,507 --> 01:50:25,751
[SPEAKER_17]: We could sever out the compensation or Councilor Zizaro could vote to try to amend this, could say, I would like to amend this to eight words and three at large, and we could vote on that amendment.

870
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:41,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so there's a motion from Councilor Lazzaro to sever the vote on adopting the Governance Committee's recommendation on the composition of the Council with a second from Councilor Leming.

871
01:50:42,249 --> 01:50:43,049
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

872
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:45,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Opposed?

873
01:50:46,752 --> 01:50:47,432
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that a yes or?

874
01:50:48,993 --> 01:50:49,513
[SPEAKER_17]: You oppose?

875
01:50:49,714 --> 01:50:50,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

876
01:50:51,475 --> 01:50:53,376
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a vote to sever.

877
01:50:57,470 --> 01:51:16,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so council is our move to sever the vote to adopt the governance committee's recommendation regarding council composition.

878
01:51:19,774 --> 01:51:21,114
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just gonna call a roll on that.

879
01:51:23,595 --> 01:51:24,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor Leming, yes.

880
01:51:26,989 --> 01:51:35,055
[SPEAKER_17]: So this means we would vote on all of the other recommendations and then, or vote on the composition and then all the other ones, there'd be two separate votes.

881
01:51:54,269 --> 01:51:55,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

882
01:52:00,162 --> 01:52:01,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, this is on the motion to sever.

883
01:52:02,523 --> 01:52:04,224
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you vote yes, you vote to sever.

884
01:52:19,674 --> 01:52:20,494
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice president Collins.

885
01:52:24,116 --> 01:52:25,257
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the vote to sever.

886
01:52:25,537 --> 01:52:27,859
[SPEAKER_17]: So all this means is that we would have two separate votes.

887
01:52:30,861 --> 01:52:31,641
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lazzaro?

888
01:52:31,841 --> 01:52:32,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

889
01:52:33,062 --> 01:52:33,622
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Leming?

890
01:52:33,642 --> 01:52:34,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

891
01:52:34,582 --> 01:52:35,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli?

892
01:52:35,322 --> 01:52:35,722
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

893
01:52:36,723 --> 01:52:37,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Tseng?

894
01:52:37,263 --> 01:52:37,303
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

895
01:52:38,883 --> 01:52:39,483
[SPEAKER_19]: President Bears?

896
01:52:44,685 --> 01:52:45,905
[SPEAKER_17]: On the day of my daughter's wedding.

897
01:52:49,986 --> 01:52:50,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Come to me.

898
01:52:52,727 --> 01:52:52,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

899
01:52:55,988 --> 01:52:57,488
[SPEAKER_17]: So that means that the motion is severed.

900
01:52:59,164 --> 01:53:00,145
[SPEAKER_17]: And we will have two votes.

901
01:53:00,685 --> 01:53:07,908
[SPEAKER_17]: So just in case anyone wondered, I'm voting for us to have a special specific vote on this specific item.

902
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:13,871
[SPEAKER_17]: Just so in case people say later, I'm a dictator, I'm not.

903
01:53:22,135 --> 01:53:23,155
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna wait for the clerk.

904
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:51,400
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, motion severed.

905
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,622
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll start with the council composition.

906
01:53:53,863 --> 01:53:54,804
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a motion.

907
01:53:55,544 --> 01:54:01,931
[SPEAKER_17]: We're gonna do it, but I'm gonna just... We will have public participation on the motion.

908
01:54:01,951 --> 01:54:03,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that the motion is severed, I wanna reread.

909
01:54:04,214 --> 01:54:05,755
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's two motions now.

910
01:54:06,016 --> 01:54:07,978
[SPEAKER_17]: So I wanna make sure that we know what we're talking about.

911
01:54:09,974 --> 01:54:20,762
[SPEAKER_17]: So the first motion is the motion to adopt the governance committee's recommendation on the council composition, which is a five at large for district.

912
01:54:21,403 --> 01:54:24,946
[SPEAKER_17]: A vote yes is a vote to say yes to five at large and four district.

913
01:54:25,446 --> 01:54:28,768
[SPEAKER_17]: A vote no is to say no to five at large and four district.

914
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:31,350
[SPEAKER_17]: That is what we're talking about now.

915
01:54:31,671 --> 01:54:33,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we will talk about all the other amendments.

916
01:54:34,613 --> 01:54:37,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any further discussion by members of the council on this motion?

917
01:54:39,863 --> 01:54:41,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

918
01:54:41,504 --> 01:54:45,807
[SPEAKER_17]: This is about council composition only, and then we will have comment on the other items.

919
01:54:46,848 --> 01:54:49,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Please raise your hands on Zoom or come to the podium in person.

920
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:51,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record.

921
01:54:53,692 --> 01:54:54,713
[SPEAKER_17]: One second here.

922
01:54:58,875 --> 01:55:02,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And you will have three minutes and we'll go to you at the podium.

923
01:55:02,197 --> 01:55:02,858
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record.

924
01:55:03,248 --> 01:55:05,231
[SPEAKER_22]: Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

925
01:55:05,451 --> 01:55:06,572
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to try to talk fast.

926
01:55:07,674 --> 01:55:11,479
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a lot of things said about the committee, so I just want to address a few of those.

927
01:55:11,499 --> 01:55:21,271
[SPEAKER_22]: I may have misunderstood, but I thought I heard someone say that the Charter Study Committee left information out of the survey that we didn't want

928
01:55:21,952 --> 01:55:22,672
[SPEAKER_22]: to include.

929
01:55:23,013 --> 01:55:26,934
[SPEAKER_22]: So if I misunderstood that, I would like, please correct me.

930
01:55:26,994 --> 01:55:32,397
[SPEAKER_22]: But I would just want to say, if you have that impression, please come and talk to me.

931
01:55:32,537 --> 01:55:35,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Because as far as I know, it is absolutely not true.

932
01:55:36,258 --> 01:55:46,403
[SPEAKER_22]: I also just wanted to say, and this has been said before, district representation was not asked about because it does not happen in Massachusetts on city councils.

933
01:55:46,563 --> 01:55:49,844
[SPEAKER_22]: And there have been references by Councilors to communities that have it.

934
01:55:49,924 --> 01:55:53,765
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would love to hear the names of them other than Boston and Worcester.

935
01:55:54,225 --> 01:55:56,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Boston is essentially not comparable.

936
01:55:57,106 --> 01:56:01,667
[SPEAKER_22]: State law even separates it out from other municipalities.

937
01:56:02,207 --> 01:56:04,348
[SPEAKER_22]: And Worcester is the second largest city in the state.

938
01:56:04,748 --> 01:56:09,689
[SPEAKER_22]: So I am truly interested in hearing about the other communities that have it on city council.

939
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:15,291
[SPEAKER_22]: Ward representation has a definition that is understood.

940
01:56:15,831 --> 01:56:17,112
[SPEAKER_22]: People know what it means.

941
01:56:17,632 --> 01:56:20,675
[SPEAKER_22]: So when all of you ran on it, that's what they understood.

942
01:56:21,115 --> 01:56:34,105
[SPEAKER_22]: When all of you have said for five years, 100% in favor of ward representation, when you said to us in interviews that you were in favor of ward representation, everybody knew what you meant.

943
01:56:35,867 --> 01:56:40,489
[SPEAKER_22]: So the reason it wasn't asked was because it wasn't on our radar, because it's not really done.

944
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:48,014
[SPEAKER_22]: When the school committee subcommittee started digging in, they found that it is, there are a few school committees that have it.

945
01:56:48,594 --> 01:56:56,359
[SPEAKER_22]: And I won't go into the, I've said it before, it's in the final report, why it was considered to school committee, but not city council.

946
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:59,801
[SPEAKER_22]: I also wanna say, this is not like the Senate.

947
01:57:01,142 --> 01:57:14,392
[SPEAKER_22]: The problem with the Senate of our country is that you have senators who represent very small numbers of people and others who represent massive numbers of people who have the same power.

948
01:57:16,027 --> 01:57:20,510
[SPEAKER_22]: each ward representative would represent the same number of people.

949
01:57:20,990 --> 01:57:32,077
[SPEAKER_22]: So you may have a problem with the fact that some wards have low voter turnout and ward three that has high voter turnout has had a disproportionate number of representation.

950
01:57:32,117 --> 01:57:38,301
[SPEAKER_22]: And I personally don't think that's an accident, but please don't say it's like the Senate because it's not.

951
01:57:40,807 --> 01:57:46,512
[SPEAKER_22]: The demographic research that has been done is great, but the demographics will change.

952
01:57:47,072 --> 01:57:51,456
[SPEAKER_22]: And this charter is going to be in place for, if it passes, for at least 12 years.

953
01:57:52,577 --> 01:58:02,165
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're confident that the demographics are going to be exactly the same and the district method will serve, will fix whatever you think ward representation won't,

954
01:58:03,386 --> 01:58:05,508
[SPEAKER_22]: That makes sense, but I don't think, okay.

955
01:58:06,909 --> 01:58:09,450
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think any of us think that demographics are gonna stay the same.

956
01:58:09,991 --> 01:58:13,673
[SPEAKER_22]: The housing studies that have been mentioned, we also addressed that.

957
01:58:14,654 --> 01:58:16,816
[SPEAKER_22]: If there are more, I want to see them.

958
01:58:16,916 --> 01:58:17,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Please show them to me.

959
01:58:18,497 --> 01:58:20,538
[SPEAKER_22]: There's one study that we were able to find.

960
01:58:21,139 --> 01:58:28,364
[SPEAKER_22]: I've asked repeatedly, several people, no one has been able to produce anything but that one study, which is not very conclusive.

961
01:58:29,745 --> 01:58:32,086
[SPEAKER_22]: So, and just one more thing.

962
01:58:33,399 --> 01:58:36,620
[SPEAKER_22]: It has been said, no system is perfect.

963
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:38,821
[SPEAKER_22]: This isn't a moral issue.

964
01:58:38,921 --> 01:58:43,423
[SPEAKER_22]: This isn't something, there's no perfect system.

965
01:58:43,483 --> 01:58:56,827
[SPEAKER_22]: So a district system is not gonna be perfect either, but you're willing to ignore your constituents because on the idea that this is some moral issue, that it's right.

966
01:58:59,407 --> 01:59:03,569
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't understand that, because charter review is not easy.

967
01:59:04,109 --> 01:59:07,851
[SPEAKER_22]: There are a lot more stops that this charter has to go to after you.

968
01:59:08,872 --> 01:59:10,232
[SPEAKER_22]: The last one is the voters.

969
01:59:12,534 --> 01:59:16,576
[SPEAKER_22]: And people have talked about word representation in the city for years.

970
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:18,297
[SPEAKER_22]: It was the biggest issue.

971
01:59:18,657 --> 01:59:22,279
[SPEAKER_22]: When we talked to people, that is what they talked about.

972
01:59:23,019 --> 01:59:23,259
[SPEAKER_22]: So,

973
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:34,294
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't understand why you would abandon that when you have all supported it in the past and your constituents are asking you for it.

974
01:59:34,914 --> 01:59:35,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

975
01:59:36,395 --> 01:59:36,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

976
01:59:36,895 --> 01:59:41,377
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to go to Zoom, Glenn Dixon.

977
01:59:42,177 --> 01:59:43,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record.

978
01:59:43,078 --> 01:59:45,959
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes and I am going to try to hold closer to the three minutes going forward.

979
01:59:50,661 --> 01:59:52,602
[SPEAKER_24]: Glenn Dixon, 61 Monument Street.

980
01:59:53,740 --> 02:00:07,005
[SPEAKER_24]: I would just like to say that the majority at large in your new proposal nine, five and four, still the majority of the Councilors will be at large.

981
02:00:07,305 --> 02:00:10,706
[SPEAKER_24]: So that disempowers the districts.

982
02:00:11,206 --> 02:00:18,429
[SPEAKER_24]: They won't be able to overpower the majority at large, the at large Councilors.

983
02:00:18,849 --> 02:00:21,990
[SPEAKER_24]: And those at large Councilors are again gonna get

984
02:00:22,594 --> 02:00:29,497
[SPEAKER_24]: the most votes from the same districts that they've been getting, awards that they've been getting for years.

985
02:00:29,798 --> 02:00:37,501
[SPEAKER_24]: And so, those at-large Councilors are going to mostly be from the same districts where they've always been from.

986
02:00:38,322 --> 02:00:41,163
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, let's see.

987
02:00:42,044 --> 02:00:44,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Nova made a lot of the points that I was going to make.

988
02:00:44,265 --> 02:00:45,085
[SPEAKER_24]: The, yeah.

989
02:00:52,529 --> 02:00:58,573
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I just don't, I don't really even understand your reasons for going to four districts instead of seven.

990
02:00:58,993 --> 02:01:02,795
[SPEAKER_24]: None of, you haven't really given any compelling reasons in my opinion.

991
02:01:04,596 --> 02:01:08,137
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, there's, you talk about it being like the Senate.

992
02:01:08,217 --> 02:01:11,439
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not like the Senate, as Melva said.

993
02:01:11,839 --> 02:01:13,720
[SPEAKER_24]: All the wards are the same size.

994
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,583
[SPEAKER_24]: So regardless of how many people vote, they're representing the same number of people.

995
02:01:19,337 --> 02:01:24,578
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's, I don't know, I can't understand why you keep saying that.

996
02:01:26,178 --> 02:01:40,742
[SPEAKER_24]: And the thing about, yeah, I think those are my main points, that it's still going to be majority at large Councilors with your proposal, and that just makes no sense to me.

997
02:01:42,042 --> 02:01:46,083
[SPEAKER_24]: If you go to wards, you'll have three at large, and then the wards will have the,

998
02:01:48,232 --> 02:01:50,213
[SPEAKER_24]: the majority, and that makes more sense.

999
02:01:50,733 --> 02:01:54,736
[SPEAKER_24]: I do not understand this, keeping the majority at large.

1000
02:01:55,176 --> 02:01:56,456
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, that's all I have to say.

1001
02:01:57,417 --> 02:01:57,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1002
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:03,860
[SPEAKER_17]: The address record you have, three minutes.

1003
02:02:04,081 --> 02:02:13,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Ron Givino, 326 East Border Road, Medford, two-year member of the Charter Review Committee, chairperson of the Ward Representation Committee.

1004
02:02:14,026 --> 02:02:15,227
[SPEAKER_18]: I ask your indulgence.

1005
02:02:15,247 --> 02:02:16,367
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot has been added here.

1006
02:02:16,387 --> 02:02:17,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to try to get to the three

1007
02:02:18,272 --> 02:02:21,533
[SPEAKER_18]: But if I go a little bit older, I'd appreciate it.

1008
02:02:21,573 --> 02:02:22,854
[SPEAKER_18]: We took this very seriously.

1009
02:02:23,134 --> 02:02:27,896
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe board representation is the most symbolic way we can show change in this city.

1010
02:02:28,496 --> 02:02:33,298
[SPEAKER_18]: When we talked, surveys were a small piece of our decision.

1011
02:02:33,678 --> 02:02:38,400
[SPEAKER_18]: When we talked with Councilor Callahan, she told us that she was undecided.

1012
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:41,781
[SPEAKER_18]: She told us she had concerns, and she told us what those concerns were.

1013
02:02:42,381 --> 02:02:46,163
[SPEAKER_18]: She did say that, in general, she was in favor of a hybrid system.

1014
02:02:46,832 --> 02:03:05,207
[SPEAKER_18]: When we talked to President Bears, he told us he was worried about ward representation might create more dysfunction as Councilors may only vote on things that improve their ward instead of focusing on the whole city, and legitimately had questions about ward authority and needed more information.

1015
02:03:06,542 --> 02:03:19,712
[SPEAKER_18]: When we talked to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Tseng said he was in favor of ward representation, citing the benefits of representation by ward would help give more diverse, inclusive community government.

1016
02:03:20,093 --> 02:03:22,134
[SPEAKER_18]: A ward system is better than what we have now.

1017
02:03:22,494 --> 02:03:30,901
[SPEAKER_18]: He commented that Medford has the smallest council for the size of the city and increasing the size of the wards would make the council more efficient.

1018
02:03:31,521 --> 02:03:36,005
[SPEAKER_18]: When we talked to Councilor Collins in an interview I was present at, she said,

1019
02:03:36,732 --> 02:03:45,295
[SPEAKER_18]: She was in favor of ward hybrid representation, citing the benefits of representation by ward would help give more diverse and equitable community government.

1020
02:03:45,995 --> 02:03:51,357
[SPEAKER_18]: She thinks ward representation is appropriate and loves the idea.

1021
02:03:52,177 --> 02:03:55,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Having ward-based reps would be a huge improvement.

1022
02:03:55,798 --> 02:04:01,040
[SPEAKER_18]: She also agrees that ward representation makes campaigning less financially challenging.

1023
02:04:02,767 --> 02:04:04,347
[SPEAKER_18]: when we talked to Councilor Lazzaro.

1024
02:04:04,908 --> 02:04:08,288
[SPEAKER_18]: She said ward representation for city council was important.

1025
02:04:08,768 --> 02:04:13,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Diversity of Medford is not yet represented in our city government.

1026
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:24,292
[SPEAKER_18]: To save some time, I direct you all to an article on the Emily for Medford site on diversity, the searing pain of editing and Medford's city charter.

1027
02:04:24,632 --> 02:04:31,674
[SPEAKER_18]: That will give you a more in-depth view on her, which sounds like she's in favor still of ward representation.

1028
02:04:33,596 --> 02:04:40,583
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor has made her statement by giving you her version, which leaves ward representation unamended.

1029
02:04:40,603 --> 02:04:46,008
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to talk about Councilor Leming, who said- You have 30 seconds, Ron.

1030
02:04:46,869 --> 02:04:47,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me?

1031
02:04:47,810 --> 02:04:49,832
[SPEAKER_18]: You have 30 seconds and I'll give you 15 more because we just talked.

1032
02:04:49,852 --> 02:04:51,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1033
02:04:51,473 --> 02:04:53,275
[SPEAKER_18]: On his blog page.

1034
02:04:54,875 --> 02:04:55,996
[SPEAKER_18]: right from his blog page.

1035
02:04:56,276 --> 02:05:03,380
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone who thinks about charter review habitually has a strong opinion about some specific aspect.

1036
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:06,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Personally, I think city council composition.

1037
02:05:06,622 --> 02:05:12,365
[SPEAKER_18]: The lack of board representation in Medford is one area that I believe is not a benefit to the city.

1038
02:05:12,845 --> 02:05:19,189
[SPEAKER_18]: It makes the city council homogenous and has historically focused resources in an imbalanced way.

1039
02:05:19,469 --> 02:05:20,490
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna skip a little bit.

1040
02:05:21,974 --> 02:05:25,689
[SPEAKER_18]: That being said, says Council Lemmy, if I were elected,

1041
02:05:26,527 --> 02:05:32,351
[SPEAKER_18]: and the Medford Charter Study Committee recommended some change that I personally disagreed with.

1042
02:05:32,851 --> 02:05:33,612
[SPEAKER_18]: What would I do?

1043
02:05:34,052 --> 02:05:37,894
[SPEAKER_18]: In all likelihood, I'd side with the Medford Charter Study Committee.

1044
02:05:38,395 --> 02:05:44,439
[SPEAKER_18]: This is partially because I worked with them and trust them to do their job.

1045
02:05:45,179 --> 02:05:53,985
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also because I've seen city councilors in the past reject expert advice and public feedback and call it independent thinking.

1046
02:05:54,683 --> 02:06:05,215
[SPEAKER_18]: If I were to write a paper on a topic like chemistry or medieval Iranian art or number theory, it would, it would would full of independent thinking.

1047
02:06:05,595 --> 02:06:07,758
[SPEAKER_18]: It just wouldn't be terribly good.

1048
02:06:08,098 --> 02:06:08,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1049
02:06:08,438 --> 02:06:09,680
[SPEAKER_18]: We're, we're a minute over.

1050
02:06:14,091 --> 02:06:14,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1051
02:06:14,511 --> 02:06:17,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron, could you let us know when those interviews happened?

1052
02:06:17,612 --> 02:06:18,553
[SPEAKER_18]: I can get you the dates.

1053
02:06:18,653 --> 02:06:19,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1054
02:06:19,253 --> 02:06:25,836
[SPEAKER_18]: That article I just read was September 24th, prior to Councilor Leming's election to the city council.

1055
02:06:25,976 --> 02:06:27,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the dates as well.

1056
02:06:27,876 --> 02:06:30,738
[SPEAKER_18]: And the documentary reports are on the public file.

1057
02:06:31,218 --> 02:06:31,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1058
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:40,521
[SPEAKER_17]: And we don't have it that way.

1059
02:06:40,561 --> 02:06:41,842
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't give people our time.

1060
02:06:46,681 --> 02:06:47,941
[SPEAKER_17]: In public participation?

1061
02:06:48,241 --> 02:06:49,022
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we can't.

1062
02:06:49,202 --> 02:06:59,667
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do have two members of the council who would like to comment, but I did want to note too, and Anna may have more information on this.

1063
02:07:01,988 --> 02:07:05,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me, if we could take conversations outside, if we're going to have them.

1064
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:05,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1065
02:07:07,851 --> 02:07:08,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1066
02:07:08,531 --> 02:07:12,153
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to take it outside and then come back in after you've discussed it, that's welcome.

1067
02:07:13,221 --> 02:07:13,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1068
02:07:14,563 --> 02:07:25,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So, first I want to say to Zach on zoom if you could please add a last name last time I unmuted someone who did not have a last name I regretted it please add your last name to your name on zoom to.

1069
02:07:28,627 --> 02:07:42,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Melvin McDonald's question about other cities that have districts in addition to Boston and Worcester Lowell has districts, Lawrence has districts, Methuen has districts, Amesbury has districts, these are all on the city council I'm reading their websites.

1070
02:07:43,744 --> 02:08:02,082
[SPEAKER_17]: The town acting as the city of barn city acting as a town of Barnesville has districts, the city acting as the town of Randolph has districts, the city acting as the town of Amherst has districts and Framingham, Massachusetts also has districts so those are all cities who have districts that are a combination of precincts or wards.

1071
02:08:36,654 --> 02:08:39,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I'd have to do a little bit more research.

1072
02:08:43,306 --> 02:08:43,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1073
02:08:44,447 --> 02:08:47,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Methuen right here it's multiple precincts combined into districts.

1074
02:08:48,671 --> 02:08:49,672
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the city of Methuen.

1075
02:08:51,073 --> 02:08:51,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1076
02:08:51,994 --> 02:08:57,458
[SPEAKER_17]: The town of Amherst also has that and that's a town but it's a city government form act labeled as a town.

1077
02:08:57,979 --> 02:08:59,220
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

1078
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:02,763
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Tseng.

1079
02:09:02,783 --> 02:09:03,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming.

1080
02:09:05,606 --> 02:09:07,848
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to keep it brief so we can move into more public comment.

1081
02:09:07,888 --> 02:09:08,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1082
02:09:08,733 --> 02:09:19,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I did write a blog post during my campaign, which Mr. Giovino brought up.

1083
02:09:20,757 --> 02:09:33,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, a lot of my silence on this

1084
02:09:37,353 --> 02:09:46,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I think most other Councilors, especially those on the governance committee have said a lot more about a lot of different issues.

1085
02:09:46,316 --> 02:09:58,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And I definitely said a lot of comments about Article 8, for instance, during the last governance committee meeting.

1086
02:09:59,681 --> 02:10:01,162
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, I've...

1087
02:10:02,494 --> 02:10:06,755
[SPEAKER_09]: tried to stay out of this for the most part.

1088
02:10:06,835 --> 02:10:26,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I was originally the person who suggested the 5-4 model, largely because I thought that keeping it, I didn't support the 7-3, and I thought it was a good compromise between the ward-based system and what Council President Bears proposed.

1089
02:10:26,539 --> 02:10:31,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So the way I viewed it was as a good compromise between the two systems.

1090
02:10:32,771 --> 02:10:47,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, I think that the Chair of the Charter Study Committee just now brought up a very good point, which is that the comparison to the Senate is a little more nuanced.

1091
02:10:47,565 --> 02:10:51,329
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a bit of an extreme example, mainly because the wards are

1092
02:10:56,220 --> 02:11:02,962
[SPEAKER_09]: do have approximately equal population, whereas Senate districts are very, very disproportionate.

1093
02:11:03,022 --> 02:11:13,024
[SPEAKER_09]: But the point about voter turnout was something that, come on, just, guys.

1094
02:11:13,844 --> 02:11:13,944
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1095
02:11:14,084 --> 02:11:14,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry.

1096
02:11:14,664 --> 02:11:15,805
[SPEAKER_17]: We can, we'll hold.

1097
02:11:15,825 --> 02:11:20,526
[SPEAKER_17]: If we're going to have private discussions, can we please take them out of the room?

1098
02:11:20,586 --> 02:11:20,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1099
02:11:21,366 --> 02:11:23,887
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the point about voter turnout

1100
02:11:25,663 --> 02:11:37,552
[SPEAKER_09]: does need to be addressed because during, I mean, during my campaign, I was very, I was convinced that voter turnout was primarily due to engagement, self-fulfilling prophecies.

1101
02:11:37,592 --> 02:11:41,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do, I think that that's definitely true to an extent.

1102
02:11:41,475 --> 02:11:44,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is a fact that is definitely a factor.

1103
02:11:45,879 --> 02:11:53,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Ward three has higher voter turnout because they feel a lot more connected to the high numbers of Councilors that have been elected out of there.

1104
02:11:54,085 --> 02:11:54,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's very true.

1105
02:11:56,744 --> 02:12:02,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ward 7, you know, so voter turnout does turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

1106
02:12:03,407 --> 02:12:13,952
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing is that I don't think that ward representation would actually solve the voter turnout issue, and that's because of the different institutions that are present in the different wards.

1107
02:12:13,992 --> 02:12:21,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Ward 4 has a lot of tough students who, a lot of them don't even register to vote locally.

1108
02:12:21,496 --> 02:12:24,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Ward 7 has a lot of high-rise apartment buildings that,

1109
02:12:24,617 --> 02:12:27,881
[SPEAKER_09]: city council candidates can't actually physically access.

1110
02:12:28,001 --> 02:12:42,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So the voter turnouts for single family homes is, I think it's just inherently biased to have more people who vote in municipal elections.

1111
02:12:45,884 --> 02:13:00,617
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I will say with the Charter Study Committee is that I still have good relationships with most of the people on there personally.

1112
02:13:01,158 --> 02:13:05,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I worked with them, I respect them, I feel like I can have a conversation with them.

1113
02:13:07,283 --> 02:13:10,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I wrote the blog post saying I would support them,

1114
02:13:11,824 --> 02:13:22,847
[SPEAKER_09]: an effort to put some degree of faith in their work to, you know, to raise the status of what they were doing.

1115
02:13:22,887 --> 02:13:34,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I, you know, I did work with three of them on the Charter Review Coalition, and I knew that they just wanted to see, that they wanted to see it, some form of charter review pass.

1116
02:13:38,130 --> 02:13:40,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I've, there have been a,

1117
02:13:41,803 --> 02:13:55,946
[SPEAKER_09]: small number of members that have said things that I wish they did not, that I wish they didn't say in public.

1118
02:13:56,506 --> 02:14:08,789
[SPEAKER_09]: One member in particular put out a death threat against a sitting elected official and said that she hates most of council and 95% of our supporters.

1119
02:14:11,673 --> 02:14:30,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when she was saying those things, and I felt like I was trying, especially in the beginning of this term, to support the work of the Charter Study Committee, I just felt like that was a betrayal of that trust.

1120
02:14:30,282 --> 02:14:34,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wish that had never happened.

1121
02:14:34,965 --> 02:14:39,507
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that the vast majority of the work of the people on the committee has been

1122
02:14:40,603 --> 02:14:41,464
[SPEAKER_09]: very admirable.

1123
02:14:42,184 --> 02:14:48,270
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, once again, I think I've been talking for a bit too long here.

1124
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:49,971
[SPEAKER_09]: So I apologize for that.

1125
02:14:50,151 --> 02:14:55,916
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've had a lot of thoughts on the way that this whole process has gone down.

1126
02:14:57,938 --> 02:15:05,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have largely kept silent because I just think that more drama won't do it any favors.

1127
02:15:06,705 --> 02:15:07,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do want to see this pass.

1128
02:15:08,086 --> 02:15:08,707
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1129
02:15:10,564 --> 02:15:11,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1130
02:15:14,662 --> 02:15:17,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be very brief, just because I know we have more public comment.

1131
02:15:18,723 --> 02:15:19,524
[SPEAKER_13]: My words were quoted.

1132
02:15:19,804 --> 02:15:21,004
[SPEAKER_13]: They were quoted accurately.

1133
02:15:21,324 --> 02:15:33,568
[SPEAKER_13]: They were quoted especially accurately when Mr. Givino said that I said Ward was better than At-Large as a system, because that's the context in which I said those things.

1134
02:15:34,088 --> 02:15:37,649
[SPEAKER_13]: My words were quoted accurately when I said that we need a bigger council.

1135
02:15:37,909 --> 02:15:42,070
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was actually one of the hesitations I had with the initial proposal as well.

1136
02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:57,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard from constituents that they wanted more voices on the City Council, and I was happy that Councilor Leming made the suggestion to increase the seats from seven to nine at that first Governance Committee meeting.

1137
02:15:57,336 --> 02:16:02,459
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's really interesting to hear what I said in the meeting that wasn't quoted.

1138
02:16:03,859 --> 02:16:09,922
[SPEAKER_13]: I really emphasized the need, my view, that we need to look at multi-member districts that rank choice.

1139
02:16:10,662 --> 02:16:16,145
[SPEAKER_13]: I really emphasized the need for us to look at bigger districts in that meeting.

1140
02:16:16,205 --> 02:16:17,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember that very crystal clear.

1141
02:16:18,427 --> 02:16:26,771
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember bringing it up when I was canvassing around the same time and having a constituent who didn't see eye to eye on me on that.

1142
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:28,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I just looked at my campaign website.

1143
02:16:28,792 --> 02:16:32,294
[SPEAKER_13]: It said that I could consider award representation.

1144
02:16:33,255 --> 02:16:38,738
[SPEAKER_13]: And I very much still believe that this is moving towards pretty much a very similar model.

1145
02:16:40,491 --> 02:16:51,782
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanted, and I do think it should be said that maybe it's my age, but when I sat in that interview, I didn't get to any real content until the 30th minute.

1146
02:16:52,482 --> 02:16:59,850
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been giving the Charter Study Committee a lot of good faith, because I do think that they're doing their work in good faith, but

1147
02:17:01,453 --> 02:17:11,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't I don't know if the best interview of a candidate are of an elected Councilors to not hear from them in the first not hear substance from them in the first 30 minutes.

1148
02:17:15,703 --> 02:17:16,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1149
02:17:16,624 --> 02:17:22,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry.

1150
02:17:23,589 --> 02:17:25,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Last person who spoke was wrong.

1151
02:17:26,691 --> 02:17:27,812
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll go back to zoom.

1152
02:17:28,905 --> 02:17:30,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record on Zoom.

1153
02:17:30,966 --> 02:17:31,907
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go to Zach on Zoom.

1154
02:17:31,947 --> 02:17:32,767
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

1155
02:17:35,628 --> 02:17:36,769
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you for mentioning your name.

1156
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:39,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Zachary Chertok, 5 Almond Street.

1157
02:17:40,211 --> 02:17:42,992
[SPEAKER_26]: I apologize for the two Zachary Chertoks.

1158
02:17:43,052 --> 02:17:46,014
[SPEAKER_26]: I just have to be on visual on the computer and audio on the phone tonight.

1159
02:17:48,375 --> 02:17:56,339
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the things that I wanted to call attention to is the fact that the city council referenced cited studies without specifying the studies that were cited in the city or outside the city.

1160
02:17:56,988 --> 02:18:15,773
[SPEAKER_26]: In the last governance committee, I spoke up in public commentary to note national studies that have been done by minority representation groups, including the ACLU and NAACP and MALDEF that all advocate for local ward governance structures on the basis of representative adequacy.

1161
02:18:16,773 --> 02:18:20,014
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm happy to submit those studies to the city council.

1162
02:18:21,394 --> 02:18:24,815
[SPEAKER_26]: I also wanted to call attention to the fact that there are

1163
02:18:25,538 --> 02:18:38,447
[SPEAKER_26]: There have been a number of comments by the city council reference saying, you know, the public commentary, either polarizing the issue or jeopardizing passage of an issue.

1164
02:18:39,027 --> 02:18:50,595
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to remind the city council that there are a number of trained experts in our community, and we're lucky enough to have a rich combination of trained professionals, experienced participants, and longtime residents familiar with the fabric of this city.

1165
02:18:51,248 --> 02:19:00,195
[SPEAKER_26]: I myself am a fifth generation Bostonian whose family has had industry in and around this city for all of my 36 years now.

1166
02:19:01,516 --> 02:19:13,886
[SPEAKER_26]: If we are going to be host to an open governance system as noted by the city council, I highly encourage more respect for the process and that the public voicing their opinion here is not about throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

1167
02:19:14,555 --> 02:19:21,697
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, as codified in the public process, the efforts by people participating are very much in the spirit of passing a more perfect proposal.

1168
02:19:21,917 --> 02:19:22,298
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1169
02:19:26,999 --> 02:19:27,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1170
02:19:28,019 --> 02:19:30,300
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe I was the one who said throw the baby out with the bathwater.

1171
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:31,901
[SPEAKER_17]: I meant the voters in November.

1172
02:19:32,501 --> 02:19:33,421
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to the podium.

1173
02:19:35,222 --> 02:19:36,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

1174
02:19:37,903 --> 02:19:39,043
[SPEAKER_17]: And you have three minutes.

1175
02:19:40,756 --> 02:19:42,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.

1176
02:19:43,458 --> 02:19:52,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I start talking and I get my three minutes, I would like to mention that I think it's somewhat disrespectful to the Charter Review Committee members who are here.

1177
02:19:52,784 --> 02:19:55,767
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not here as community members.

1178
02:19:55,827 --> 02:19:58,588
[SPEAKER_05]: They are here representing the Charter Review Committee.

1179
02:19:58,889 --> 02:20:07,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And to the extent that you're making comments about the Charter Review itself, that they wrote the proposal, and about what they did themselves,

1180
02:20:08,488 --> 02:20:14,253
[SPEAKER_05]: allowing them only three minutes is incredibly disrespectful and disrespects the reason that they are here.

1181
02:20:14,854 --> 02:20:32,009
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys get to speak forever, and that's just part of you being on city council, but not allowing them the time to respond is disrespectful and unfair, and it interferes with the process, too, because you're not giving them a chance to actually respond to what you're saying about the work that they did.

1182
02:20:35,137 --> 02:20:46,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I will read my whole I sent an email to the mayor and I will say that I thought about sending it to the city council, but in the end I decided not to, because I don't feel like I didn't feel like it would be heard.

1183
02:20:46,902 --> 02:20:49,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't feel like it would be really considered.

1184
02:20:52,945 --> 02:21:04,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to say Councilors are I really appreciate that earlier in the meeting you did talk about, you know, you're still making up your mind on this and you're listening to feedback and that's changing your opinion sometimes so I appreciate that.

1185
02:21:05,312 --> 02:21:09,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm not going to say a whole lot I will say that as a.

1186
02:21:10,975 --> 02:21:28,060
[SPEAKER_05]: As a progressive, as a person who was a member of the progressive group that's represented by a lot of people here, I know that myself, every conversation that I had about charter review and representation, we talked about ward representation.

1187
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:35,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the conversations I had with those who are currently here who were on that progressive group at that time.

1188
02:21:36,362 --> 02:21:46,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, people can change their mind, I understand that, but to suggest that that wasn't the conversations that were being had is not, in my experience, true.

1189
02:21:46,051 --> 02:21:47,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I will also say that

1190
02:21:49,397 --> 02:22:07,742
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the driving force, I understood behind that while there are other issues to that desire from the community for word based representation to feel like each word have their own Councilor that people had better connection with their Councilors that they had more of an opportunity maybe to vote.

1191
02:22:09,542 --> 02:22:16,905
[SPEAKER_05]: a single person in, you know, that was a driving force behind this in my recollection of all the conversations I was a part of.

1192
02:22:18,045 --> 02:22:25,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the earlier comments about well we've accepted 90% like we're in agreement, it's just one little piece.

1193
02:22:27,653 --> 02:22:29,094
[SPEAKER_05]: This is democracy.

1194
02:22:29,755 --> 02:22:43,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Representation on this on the city council is arguably the largest and most important piece of our city charter, because it's how we as a community as we as residents are represented.

1195
02:22:44,169 --> 02:22:46,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, at this moment, I don't feel very represented.

1196
02:22:49,047 --> 02:22:50,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we can disagree.

1197
02:22:50,748 --> 02:22:52,269
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't a minor disagreement.

1198
02:22:52,569 --> 02:22:57,611
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a major disagreement because this is the major piece of this charter.

1199
02:22:57,772 --> 02:22:59,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I hear my timer's going.

1200
02:22:59,713 --> 02:23:03,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop now because that's the most important thing to say.

1201
02:23:03,414 --> 02:23:03,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1202
02:23:03,755 --> 02:23:07,216
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go back to Zoom.

1203
02:23:07,236 --> 02:23:09,738
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Alyssa on Zoom.

1204
02:23:11,699 --> 02:23:12,619
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll have three minutes.

1205
02:23:12,719 --> 02:23:14,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

1206
02:23:16,261 --> 02:23:17,461
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, yes, Alyssa Nugent.

1207
02:23:17,781 --> 02:23:19,642
[SPEAKER_23]: I reside at 98 Sheridan Avenue.

1208
02:23:21,782 --> 02:23:27,884
[SPEAKER_23]: I am frankly disappointed that this amendment has been given as much weight as it has.

1209
02:23:29,564 --> 02:23:35,706
[SPEAKER_23]: We, Medford by and large, the constituents would like ward-based representation.

1210
02:23:36,646 --> 02:23:43,248
[SPEAKER_23]: There are numerous, numerous, innumerable court decisions that say at large districts,

1211
02:23:44,208 --> 02:23:47,709
[SPEAKER_23]: are discriminatory against minorities and people of color.

1212
02:23:48,189 --> 02:24:02,874
[SPEAKER_23]: What is proposed in this amendment would take Ward 7, our sole ward that is minority-majority, and group it together with Ward 1, making it no longer a minority-majority district.

1213
02:24:03,374 --> 02:24:11,117
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be a white-majority district, diluting the votes of the minorities in Ward 7

1214
02:24:12,077 --> 02:24:20,699
[SPEAKER_23]: And just generally, since that's where the largest population of people of color reside, diluting those votes, that's one dilution.

1215
02:24:20,899 --> 02:24:29,100
[SPEAKER_23]: On top of that, we have five at-large district seats, as opposed to, and only four district elected seats.

1216
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:35,141
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're again diluting the vote of people of color in our community.

1217
02:24:35,481 --> 02:24:37,882
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're supposed to say, well, this is less dilution

1218
02:24:38,542 --> 02:24:40,823
[SPEAKER_23]: than it used to be when we were all at large.

1219
02:24:41,183 --> 02:24:43,083
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's an improvement and we should accept that.

1220
02:24:43,544 --> 02:24:49,005
[SPEAKER_23]: But we are, it's not as though this is the only proposal, this four, five setup.

1221
02:24:49,705 --> 02:25:01,769
[SPEAKER_23]: The eight, three proposal made by the Charter Review Committee, which again, put hours and hours and hours of time into considering this exact issue has just been disregarded.

1222
02:25:02,409 --> 02:25:07,833
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's just incredibly disappointing that the council has given it this much weight.

1223
02:25:08,353 --> 02:25:10,194
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't even know if this will pass muster.

1224
02:25:10,314 --> 02:25:14,157
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, it certainly doesn't seem like it would pass muster under the Voting Rights Act.

1225
02:25:14,497 --> 02:25:18,980
[SPEAKER_23]: So we don't know if the state would approve it when it's clear that this is going to dilute.

1226
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,902
[SPEAKER_23]: the votes of people of color in our city.

1227
02:25:23,362 --> 02:25:27,084
[SPEAKER_23]: And we want to be more representative, not less representative of our population.

1228
02:25:27,885 --> 02:25:37,990
[SPEAKER_23]: It's incredibly disappointing that the progressive arm that controls the city council, which I would consider myself a Democrat and a progressive.

1229
02:25:38,370 --> 02:25:40,852
[SPEAKER_23]: I've campaigned for Elizabeth Warren many, many, many times.

1230
02:25:41,813 --> 02:25:43,034
[SPEAKER_23]: that this is where we would go.

1231
02:25:43,094 --> 02:25:49,699
[SPEAKER_23]: We would look at a proposal that promotes more representative democracy and we would say, no, that's not for us.

1232
02:25:50,000 --> 02:26:05,753
[SPEAKER_23]: We would prefer this other proposal that allows the wards that have essentially been able to provide most of the city councilors to continue to have that extra weight and to be able to continue to control the city council.

1233
02:26:06,634 --> 02:26:06,994
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just-

1234
02:26:08,665 --> 02:26:10,626
[SPEAKER_23]: I understand, it's incredibly disappointing.

1235
02:26:10,666 --> 02:26:12,987
[SPEAKER_23]: I would urge everyone to vote no on this amendment.

1236
02:26:13,367 --> 02:26:17,229
[SPEAKER_23]: I do think that it violates the Voting Rights Act, and I do think that that should be considered.

1237
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:18,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1238
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:20,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1239
02:26:21,311 --> 02:26:26,153
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go back to the podium, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1240
02:26:26,253 --> 02:26:27,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me one second here.

1241
02:26:32,716 --> 02:26:34,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Victor Leo, 40 Robinson Road.

1242
02:26:35,492 --> 02:26:44,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So with my comment I would just like to take a step back here and just remind the Council of kind of what is the overall goal of this process of getting charter out to the people to decide on.

1243
02:26:45,282 --> 02:26:52,810
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, it seems like one of the major objectives here is we need a charter that makes our local government accessible to the people of our city.

1244
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:53,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1245
02:26:53,871 --> 02:26:55,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's just a matter of common sense.

1246
02:26:55,672 --> 02:27:09,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really going to advocate strongly for one of these systems or the other in this comment, but I think just as a matter of common sense, I lean kind of more towards the word based system as representing this way of getting people

1247
02:27:10,365 --> 02:27:14,048
[SPEAKER_06]: directly to their elected representatives so they can feel themselves heard.

1248
02:27:14,989 --> 02:27:20,974
[SPEAKER_06]: But kind of focusing on this process, you know, I would say that it really does seem like we're really speeding through it here.

1249
02:27:21,455 --> 02:27:33,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I understand the charter review process has been going on for a while, but it really does seem like we're trying to make an extremely consequential decision that will dramatically impact our city at a very fast speed.

1250
02:27:33,625 --> 02:27:36,368
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there would be value in potentially slowing things down

1251
02:27:37,329 --> 02:27:41,211
[SPEAKER_06]: and talking more to the people to try to get a better sense of what they actually want.

1252
02:27:41,892 --> 02:27:43,393
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are benefits of doing that.

1253
02:27:44,174 --> 02:27:48,797
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also other aspects of the charter we could take a look at that I think would deserve some of our time, right?

1254
02:27:48,877 --> 02:27:56,863
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at some of the provisions, changes that were being made to kind of make it easier to reduce public participation in our city government.

1255
02:27:56,963 --> 02:28:00,546
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we can go back, we can look at those and try to eliminate those.

1256
02:28:01,306 --> 02:28:03,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's all I have to say.

1257
02:28:03,147 --> 02:28:03,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for listening.

1258
02:28:05,568 --> 02:28:06,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Joliot.

1259
02:28:06,429 --> 02:28:13,839
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to the point about the speed, I don't personally entirely disagree with you, but the reason that we...

1260
02:28:14,879 --> 02:28:26,471
[SPEAKER_17]: are on this timeline, as we've been told by the Collins Center, that if we don't submit it to the legislature by the end of March, it's unlikely that they will consider it in time to be placed on the November 2027 ballot.

1261
02:28:26,831 --> 02:28:31,956
[SPEAKER_17]: And that has been raised as a consideration by the Collins Center and, sorry, November 2025, thank you, ballot and

1262
02:28:38,114 --> 02:28:43,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's as it was written as such that if you read the full thing, it's written as an act of the legislature.

1263
02:28:43,557 --> 02:28:54,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And it says to be placed on November 4th, 2025 ballot that came from the study committee and the legislature and the call-in center said to keep that timeline, you really should get it to the legislature by the end of March.

1264
02:28:55,044 --> 02:29:04,669
[SPEAKER_17]: I have my own personal views about maybe where we could go back and do more on this, but that seems to have been what people, the timeline people have wanted.

1265
02:29:06,611 --> 02:29:06,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1266
02:29:08,057 --> 02:29:16,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng, I just wanted to quickly address the legal aspect of it makes sense for me because I'm a law student and I think about this all the time.

1267
02:29:16,783 --> 02:29:23,728
[SPEAKER_13]: I just found case law where the Supreme Court explicitly backs a system like this.

1268
02:29:24,384 --> 02:29:27,186
[SPEAKER_13]: where there was a merger of districts to make a larger district.

1269
02:29:27,587 --> 02:29:29,148
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a mix of district in that large.

1270
02:29:30,389 --> 02:29:34,212
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Supreme Court says that it is OK with the Voting Rights Act.

1271
02:29:34,673 --> 02:29:35,994
[SPEAKER_13]: It says that that's not the test.

1272
02:29:36,234 --> 02:29:40,637
[SPEAKER_13]: It says the test is an invidious discrimination.

1273
02:29:41,038 --> 02:29:44,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And the case is Dutch v. Davis.

1274
02:29:45,121 --> 02:29:46,362
[SPEAKER_13]: And this was settled in the 60s.

1275
02:29:47,943 --> 02:29:49,345
[SPEAKER_17]: You also had demographic data.

1276
02:29:49,365 --> 02:29:51,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have that available?

1277
02:29:54,030 --> 02:29:55,011
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Councilor Leming.

1278
02:29:55,031 --> 02:30:10,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to quickly say I actually am kind of sympathetic to the timeline thing and the idea that this is a little bit rushed from City Council's perspective.

1279
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:20,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that the Charter Study Committee worked for a while on it, but I do wish that we had

1280
02:30:21,917 --> 02:30:23,997
[SPEAKER_09]: more time to flesh things out.

1281
02:30:24,117 --> 02:30:38,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of wish that we'd gotten some more progress updates or that individual articles were presented at a given time throughout the process.

1282
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:43,741
[SPEAKER_09]: But obviously, that's just not how things went down.

1283
02:30:43,821 --> 02:30:50,683
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, I actually am sympathetic to the idea that I wish council had more time to do this.

1284
02:30:53,173 --> 02:31:00,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally would rather see a good chart that we all agree on than necessarily prioritizing the November 2025 ballot.

1285
02:31:00,381 --> 02:31:06,027
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do understand that more people probably want to see it come onto this ballot instead of more delays.

1286
02:31:06,107 --> 02:31:07,989
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just my two cents.

1287
02:31:09,391 --> 02:31:09,771
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1288
02:31:09,831 --> 02:31:25,435
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will go back to Councilors saying we did approach Councilors saying I approached the mayor about trying to Start this process of the council element of this process earlier last summer last fall, and we decided to wait for the study committee to finish its process.

1289
02:31:26,216 --> 02:31:28,356
[SPEAKER_17]: And that that was the decision we made.

1290
02:31:28,896 --> 02:31:31,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng Thank you.

1291
02:31:31,897 --> 02:31:32,497
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the data.

1292
02:31:33,058 --> 02:31:34,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I think the

1293
02:31:35,267 --> 02:31:38,729
[SPEAKER_13]: the speaker is misunderstanding the argument about racial justice.

1294
02:31:38,909 --> 02:31:51,714
[SPEAKER_13]: The argument is that if we explicitly, if we go very small, we dilute, we end up hurting racial justice because we make politicians less accountable to different groups of voters.

1295
02:31:52,634 --> 02:32:02,639
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I'm positing that, and the literature posits, that a compromise model would be the best to handle the situation right now.

1296
02:32:03,519 --> 02:32:14,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so, with regards to the main minority majority majority minority district being being talked about, which is Wellington East Medford.

1297
02:32:15,565 --> 02:32:19,447
[SPEAKER_13]: The district is the Ward seven is currently.

1298
02:32:21,918 --> 02:32:27,145
[SPEAKER_13]: 55% white, oh, sorry, 48% white and the district would be 55%.

1299
02:32:27,545 --> 02:32:38,219
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a difference of 7%, which, you know, I said earlier at a governance committee meeting, we can go back and forth about how significant that is.

1300
02:32:39,343 --> 02:32:50,071
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the, I said earlier in this meeting that I think that we can remedy that problem because this draft charter actually gives us the power to redraw precincts and districts.

1301
02:32:50,552 --> 02:33:03,902
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we can actually, having looked at the census block data, block by block in Medford, I think we can draw a district that is majority minority, even if that is the interest.

1302
02:33:04,935 --> 02:33:15,680
[SPEAKER_13]: With regards to West Medford, this, give me one second.

1303
02:33:17,901 --> 02:33:21,702
[SPEAKER_13]: West Medford is currently, so this is Ward 6.

1304
02:33:21,902 --> 02:33:24,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Ward 6 is currently 72% white.

1305
02:33:25,184 --> 02:33:29,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Under the district representation system, it would be 71% white.

1306
02:33:29,665 --> 02:33:30,306
[SPEAKER_13]: So a difference of 1%.

1307
02:33:32,785 --> 02:33:33,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1308
02:33:33,925 --> 02:33:35,226
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go back to Zoom.

1309
02:33:35,546 --> 02:33:36,326
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go to Sheila.

1310
02:33:36,426 --> 02:33:39,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Sheila, name and address for the record, please, and we'll have three minutes.

1311
02:33:47,771 --> 02:33:49,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Sheila, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

1312
02:33:57,375 --> 02:33:58,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I saw you for a second.

1313
02:33:59,175 --> 02:34:00,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna send the request again, Sheila.

1314
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:03,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry, here you go.

1315
02:34:17,610 --> 02:34:19,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Sheila, I'm gonna request that you unmute one more time.

1316
02:34:20,332 --> 02:34:22,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I think I accidentally muted you on the last one.

1317
02:34:22,853 --> 02:34:23,754
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go, you're unmuted.

1318
02:34:23,774 --> 02:34:23,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1319
02:34:24,434 --> 02:34:25,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you okay now?

1320
02:34:25,355 --> 02:34:25,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

1321
02:34:26,536 --> 02:34:29,958
[SPEAKER_17]: We can hear you, and I'm gonna start the timer when you say your name and your address.

1322
02:34:30,581 --> 02:34:33,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Sheila Aaron's 19 Sagamore Park.

1323
02:34:34,062 --> 02:34:36,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I had mentioned this at the last meeting.

1324
02:34:36,582 --> 02:34:47,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in Somerville for many years and was very involved in the community and we had a ward representation and it was a fantastic system.

1325
02:34:48,505 --> 02:34:54,707
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had any questions or concerns, I could go to the ward Councilor.

1326
02:34:54,727 --> 02:35:00,368
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew the neighborhood, they were very involved and it was very, very effective.

1327
02:35:01,089 --> 02:35:14,929
[SPEAKER_01]: um so I really encourage us to um to vote for ward representation and I do have to say it was my impression when I voted for City Council that OR

1328
02:35:15,630 --> 02:35:35,350
[SPEAKER_01]: supported ward representation so it's a little bit disturbing for me now to see that some people have changed their minds and I know people do change their minds but that's that's been a very important issue in this community and something that has um

1329
02:35:39,290 --> 02:35:40,911
[SPEAKER_01]: has really riled people up.

1330
02:35:40,991 --> 02:35:43,131
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that's very important to them.

1331
02:35:43,231 --> 02:35:49,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to say I'm very disappointed with the switch in some of the Councilors about this.

1332
02:35:50,514 --> 02:35:58,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have to wonder, you know, what is the thought process to make you change your mind?

1333
02:35:58,776 --> 02:36:05,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would think that it was thought through before because it's a pretty simple,

1334
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:09,220
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a pretty simple concept.

1335
02:36:09,260 --> 02:36:12,162
[SPEAKER_01]: You either have ward representation or you don't.

1336
02:36:13,143 --> 02:36:19,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what they were saying about Ward 6, which is where I live, is very important.

1337
02:36:19,708 --> 02:36:25,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to see everybody represented and I want to see a diverse City Council.

1338
02:36:26,152 --> 02:36:28,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much and I hope you'll all do the right thing.

1339
02:36:29,275 --> 02:36:29,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1340
02:36:31,536 --> 02:36:31,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1341
02:36:32,017 --> 02:36:35,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron, there are three more people who haven't spoken yet and then I'll come back to you.

1342
02:36:36,301 --> 02:36:38,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Go to Zoom, I have a D Silva.

1343
02:36:38,803 --> 02:36:49,031
[SPEAKER_17]: D, I'm gonna unmute you and then I will start the timer after you give your name and address.

1344
02:37:01,001 --> 02:37:01,742
[SPEAKER_17]: D Silva.

1345
02:37:08,265 --> 02:37:11,066
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I'll go then to Paul Geraghty.

1346
02:37:13,047 --> 02:37:14,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul, I'm going to unmute you.

1347
02:37:14,448 --> 02:37:18,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Please give your name and address, and then I'll start the timer for three minutes.

1348
02:37:18,409 --> 02:37:18,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul.

1349
02:37:21,551 --> 02:37:24,372
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, my name is Paul Geraghty, 40 Cedar Road.

1350
02:37:26,073 --> 02:37:35,857
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been sitting here and listening quietly, and I'm trying to identify a compelling argument for which of the configurations the council would support.

1351
02:37:36,577 --> 02:37:37,598
[SPEAKER_27]: But right now what I've heard,

1352
02:37:38,458 --> 02:37:41,900
[SPEAKER_27]: some of the basis that the councils are using for making their determination.

1353
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:59,669
[SPEAKER_27]: I know presentation, uh, looking at, uh, forecasting future, um, difficulty of managing large numbers of council, uh, to get through important goals and, uh, the city's hopes to reach.

1354
02:38:00,590 --> 02:38:06,353
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm hearing issues about, uh, references to law, uh, citations.

1355
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:11,082
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm saying I want to bring it back to the local environment.

1356
02:38:11,922 --> 02:38:20,607
[SPEAKER_27]: What I'm not hearing is that the council's willingness to support the general will of their constituency that they want ward representation.

1357
02:38:20,707 --> 02:38:34,554
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, I'm confused in terms of why we spent the time and effort for the Charter Commission and just totally overlooking and disregarding their role.

1358
02:38:36,395 --> 02:38:36,655
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1359
02:38:38,797 --> 02:38:39,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Paul.

1360
02:38:39,357 --> 02:38:42,638
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I'm seeing D Silva's hand again.

1361
02:38:42,658 --> 02:38:44,439
[SPEAKER_17]: I will go back to you.

1362
02:38:44,459 --> 02:38:49,140
[SPEAKER_17]: D Silva, I'm requesting that you unmute.

1363
02:38:55,282 --> 02:38:57,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you seeing the button come up for you to unmute?

1364
02:39:08,708 --> 02:39:10,849
[SPEAKER_17]: I've pressed it again, requesting the unmute.

1365
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:20,634
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I will go to then Daniel Mazinski.

1366
02:39:20,854 --> 02:39:22,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Daniel, you'll have three minutes.

1367
02:39:23,175 --> 02:39:24,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

1368
02:39:26,096 --> 02:39:29,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, my name's Daniel Mazinski, 98 Sheridan Ave.

1369
02:39:29,238 --> 02:39:34,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna reiterate what a lot of other citizens around here have stated.

1370
02:39:34,180 --> 02:39:37,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I urge the council to

1371
02:39:38,428 --> 02:39:50,196
[SPEAKER_14]: go back to the proposed ward representation, gives people, someone nearby that represents their community more tightly and provides better representation.

1372
02:39:51,256 --> 02:39:51,577
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

1373
02:39:51,637 --> 02:39:51,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1374
02:39:53,878 --> 02:39:54,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1375
02:39:54,358 --> 02:39:56,020
[SPEAKER_17]: I will go to Marie Izzo.

1376
02:39:56,080 --> 02:40:00,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Marie, I'm going to request to unmute, and then I'll start the timer when you give your name and address.

1377
02:40:01,003 --> 02:40:01,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Marie.

1378
02:40:05,645 --> 02:40:09,066
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

1379
02:40:10,887 --> 02:40:25,413
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I just want to say in reference to 60,000 people being represented here, all I know is that the same people come out to vote, the same people come to these meetings.

1380
02:40:26,854 --> 02:40:27,474
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm one of them.

1381
02:40:30,427 --> 02:40:33,691
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything today is politicized, so we cannot ignore that.

1382
02:40:34,232 --> 02:40:37,456
[SPEAKER_25]: When I voted for ward representation, which I did,

1383
02:40:38,613 --> 02:40:41,374
[SPEAKER_25]: I really didn't consider it to be one way or the other.

1384
02:40:42,375 --> 02:40:43,575
[SPEAKER_25]: Hybrid is fine for me.

1385
02:40:44,195 --> 02:40:52,819
[SPEAKER_25]: Any change at all that will bring some level of inclusivity and diversity in this city would make all the difference in the world, I think, to all of us.

1386
02:40:53,779 --> 02:40:57,581
[SPEAKER_25]: But I don't know that that's sort of everyone's intention here.

1387
02:40:58,681 --> 02:41:00,842
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I just want to say that out loud.

1388
02:41:03,423 --> 02:41:05,684
[SPEAKER_25]: I respect the work that the committee did.

1389
02:41:05,704 --> 02:41:06,844
[SPEAKER_25]: I understand.

1390
02:41:06,864 --> 02:41:09,404
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we have good momentum for change in this city.

1391
02:41:09,424 --> 02:41:23,567
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there's opposing factors to any kind of change, and that we will continuously see obstruction in any movement that we make, because I think it's been our legacy in this city.

1392
02:41:24,127 --> 02:41:29,188
[SPEAKER_25]: So arguing over some of this, I don't believe that we will see diversity immediately.

1393
02:41:29,928 --> 02:41:37,917
[SPEAKER_25]: And I still believe there will be the pitfalls of the same people running over and over and over again, as we have for generations.

1394
02:41:37,937 --> 02:41:42,982
[SPEAKER_25]: So any change in this charter and any move forward is what I voted for.

1395
02:41:43,661 --> 02:41:55,865
[SPEAKER_25]: And I absolutely think that if one person is representing two wards, that it's still pretty good as opposed to not.

1396
02:41:56,905 --> 02:42:01,847
[SPEAKER_25]: And that it wouldn't be as costly for those people, but I'm all for hybrid.

1397
02:42:02,147 --> 02:42:02,507
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1398
02:42:04,548 --> 02:42:05,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Marie.

1399
02:42:06,128 --> 02:42:07,569
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Mike on Zoom.

1400
02:42:07,649 --> 02:42:08,669
[SPEAKER_17]: Mike, I'm gonna unmute you.

1401
02:42:08,709 --> 02:42:10,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

1402
02:42:10,450 --> 02:42:11,450
[SPEAKER_17]: And you have three minutes.

1403
02:42:12,413 --> 02:42:13,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Council.

1404
02:42:13,153 --> 02:42:16,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike Mastroboni, 73 Fulton Spring Road.

1405
02:42:16,514 --> 02:42:17,955
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be brief.

1406
02:42:18,215 --> 02:42:25,517
[SPEAKER_16]: I think either proposal moving to ward or district-based representation is a positive move.

1407
02:42:25,537 --> 02:42:34,640
[SPEAKER_16]: I think for a couple of reasons, one, lowering the barrier to entry for people trying to campaign in terms of cost, in terms of effort.

1408
02:42:34,740 --> 02:42:39,542
[SPEAKER_16]: I think secondly, having a representative

1409
02:42:41,088 --> 02:42:46,266
[SPEAKER_16]: That you can go to on a local basis, I think, for me pushes me towards the.

1410
02:42:48,505 --> 02:42:52,228
[SPEAKER_16]: eight individual board Councilors approach.

1411
02:42:52,688 --> 02:43:02,314
[SPEAKER_16]: I respect the immense amount of work that the Charter Review Committee did over a number of years, the level of effort they did in reaching out to as many residents as possible.

1412
02:43:03,075 --> 02:43:10,900
[SPEAKER_16]: And the last thing I'll say, this isn't really my area of expertise, but I think looking retrospectively at turnout numbers and voting numbers,

1413
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:23,902
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a bit of a red herring, you know, when people are able to when people running for office are able to focus on individual wards, you know, different wards have different ways of outreach.

1414
02:43:25,222 --> 02:43:31,104
[SPEAKER_16]: and people be able to meet people where they are in a way that makes sense, whether it's tough students or folks in apartments.

1415
02:43:31,425 --> 02:43:34,446
[SPEAKER_16]: We're gonna be having a lot more big apartment buildings coming in the city, hopefully.

1416
02:43:34,466 --> 02:43:39,128
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a challenge that everybody will have to face.

1417
02:43:39,148 --> 02:43:47,271
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think for that reason, I support word-based city councilors, and I look forward to hearing the rest of the conversation.

1418
02:43:47,291 --> 02:43:49,032
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate the work everyone's done on this.

1419
02:43:49,052 --> 02:43:49,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1420
02:43:50,713 --> 02:43:51,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mike.

1421
02:43:53,180 --> 02:43:55,766
[SPEAKER_17]: I will go back to the podium, run another three minutes.

1422
02:43:59,755 --> 02:44:00,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1423
02:44:04,902 --> 02:44:09,005
[SPEAKER_18]: I just need this time to rebut, hopefully you'll respect my three minutes.

1424
02:44:09,766 --> 02:44:14,329
[SPEAKER_18]: I did neglect to mention Councilor Scarpelli during my process.

1425
02:44:15,430 --> 02:44:24,637
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been clear through these governance meetings that Councilor has changed his mind and now is fully supportive of ward representation.

1426
02:44:26,858 --> 02:44:28,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the Chair to Councilor Leming.

1427
02:44:29,740 --> 02:44:36,604
[SPEAKER_18]: When you put something on a blog that's still there to this day, the voters believe it's a sincere representation.

1428
02:44:38,045 --> 02:44:44,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the chair to Councilor Tseng, did he say the quote was inaccurate?

1429
02:44:45,609 --> 02:44:49,132
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he said it was without context and didn't include other elements of what he said.

1430
02:44:49,152 --> 02:44:53,474
[SPEAKER_18]: And did he say the substance of the interview was less than exciting the first half?

1431
02:44:53,514 --> 02:44:54,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Did I hear that correctly?

1432
02:44:54,314 --> 02:44:56,476
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to speak to things I can't characterize.

1433
02:44:56,496 --> 02:44:57,376
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll come back when he's here.

1434
02:44:57,396 --> 02:44:58,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you do that?

1435
02:45:00,701 --> 02:45:02,582
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he's- First 30 minutes had no sound.

1436
02:45:02,622 --> 02:45:06,204
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I think that he said, I don't think we should characterize his words.

1437
02:45:06,404 --> 02:45:07,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's fine.

1438
02:45:08,266 --> 02:45:12,388
[SPEAKER_18]: So we need to continue or should we wait?

1439
02:45:12,568 --> 02:45:13,209
[SPEAKER_18]: You can continue.

1440
02:45:13,469 --> 02:45:14,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I will continue.

1441
02:45:16,410 --> 02:45:19,212
[SPEAKER_18]: To Councilor Collins- Through the chair, please.

1442
02:45:20,873 --> 02:45:28,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the chair to Councilor Collins' point, there is no delusion from the committee that we thought we were gonna get it right.

1443
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:32,541
[SPEAKER_18]: It's impossible, as you all know, on a daily basis.

1444
02:45:32,601 --> 02:45:33,221
[SPEAKER_18]: We all know that.

1445
02:45:34,281 --> 02:45:39,023
[SPEAKER_18]: All I knew is that our solution guarantees board representation.

1446
02:45:39,863 --> 02:45:43,144
[SPEAKER_18]: Your solution doesn't.

1447
02:45:44,025 --> 02:45:53,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the chair to Councilor Tseng, in a three-minute presentation, it's hard to capture one hour of a conversation.

1448
02:45:53,908 --> 02:45:57,209
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sorry if the first half of that conversation was not stimulating enough.

1449
02:45:58,036 --> 02:46:12,661
[SPEAKER_18]: But to call me out as inaccurate or missing a piece, when we started my interview with Councilor Tseng, I asked him if it was OK if I recorded for accuracy of the record, not to be used in any public way.

1450
02:46:13,261 --> 02:46:17,662
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what I did, used a recording of his exact words.

1451
02:46:18,342 --> 02:46:21,884
[SPEAKER_18]: And if he wants to see those words, I would allow him to see it.

1452
02:46:22,664 --> 02:46:26,065
[SPEAKER_18]: But to say I made incorrect statements

1453
02:46:26,877 --> 02:46:27,637
[SPEAKER_18]: is a vibe.

1454
02:46:27,717 --> 02:46:29,558
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just it's added to the disrespect.

1455
02:46:29,578 --> 02:46:30,739
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to hear.

1456
02:46:33,140 --> 02:46:37,321
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he actually he did state that what you had said was correct, but not out of context.

1457
02:46:37,621 --> 02:46:40,663
[SPEAKER_17]: But there were other statements that he made that provided context.

1458
02:46:41,243 --> 02:46:41,523
[SPEAKER_17]: I get it.

1459
02:46:41,583 --> 02:46:43,624
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just think I don't think he was saying you were lying.

1460
02:46:43,684 --> 02:46:48,206
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he was saying, well, I'm getting old and not hearing well because I thought I heard inaccurate.

1461
02:46:50,365 --> 02:46:53,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng has said that he said accurate, but there were other comments.

1462
02:46:53,569 --> 02:46:54,050
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.

1463
02:46:54,850 --> 02:46:59,276
[SPEAKER_18]: And my final point is, you know, a lot has been mentioned about surveys.

1464
02:46:59,336 --> 02:47:01,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Surveys was a piece, we threw it out.

1465
02:47:02,279 --> 02:47:09,147
[SPEAKER_18]: People were allowed to submit it, we gathered all the information, every piece of information, put it together.

1466
02:47:10,914 --> 02:47:21,937
[SPEAKER_18]: It was another piece of the puzzle, along with interviews of citizens at Wright's Pond passing out popsicles, asking their opinion about ward representation.

1467
02:47:21,957 --> 02:47:24,698
[SPEAKER_18]: And by the way, educating them on what that was.

1468
02:47:25,758 --> 02:47:29,299
[SPEAKER_18]: We knew about the district solution because we applied it to the school committee.

1469
02:47:31,479 --> 02:47:33,640
[SPEAKER_18]: We used every tool we had.

1470
02:47:34,425 --> 02:47:48,237
[SPEAKER_18]: to make sure, including talking to you folks, talking to folks who had your seats before, talking to school committees, talking to superintendents, interviewing people in the departments in the city, talking to the mayor, talking to previous mayors.

1471
02:47:49,822 --> 02:47:55,966
[SPEAKER_18]: This solution, I am confident, is the people's solution on ward representation.

1472
02:47:56,286 --> 02:48:00,609
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope you will reconsider whatever it is you're thinking in this process.

1473
02:48:00,669 --> 02:48:01,369
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't hear it.

1474
02:48:01,730 --> 02:48:05,972
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the people's document.

1475
02:48:06,112 --> 02:48:11,176
[SPEAKER_18]: It's heartbreaking to know that you're not listening.

1476
02:48:11,556 --> 02:48:12,897
[SPEAKER_17]: We've gone over about a minute now.

1477
02:48:13,017 --> 02:48:13,677
[SPEAKER_17]: You can come up again.

1478
02:48:13,697 --> 02:48:14,818
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just want to respect.

1479
02:48:14,938 --> 02:48:15,579
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm done.

1480
02:48:15,699 --> 02:48:17,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to respect hearing from all.

1481
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:17,360
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm done.

1482
02:48:17,420 --> 02:48:18,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Two years.

1483
02:48:18,540 --> 02:48:19,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Two years.

1484
02:48:20,305 --> 02:48:24,286
[SPEAKER_18]: running big committees, presenting, and here, I'm done.

1485
02:48:24,386 --> 02:48:25,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ron.

1486
02:48:25,607 --> 02:48:28,828
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to go try D Silva one more time, D on Zoom.

1487
02:48:29,028 --> 02:48:29,968
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to unmute you.

1488
02:48:31,108 --> 02:48:32,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

1489
02:48:36,870 --> 02:48:38,630
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to take people who haven't spoken first.

1490
02:48:38,650 --> 02:48:42,512
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to yield my time back to Ron.

1491
02:48:42,932 --> 02:48:46,993
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to take people who haven't spoken first, but I'm trying to go to D Silva on Zoom right now, D.

1492
02:48:54,497 --> 02:48:55,437
[SPEAKER_17]: They've disappeared again.

1493
02:48:55,518 --> 02:48:57,418
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will go back to the podium.

1494
02:48:58,719 --> 02:49:01,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record of Bob Jones five St.

1495
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:01,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Mary's Street.

1496
02:49:01,580 --> 02:49:07,203
[SPEAKER_15]: All I was going to do was yield my time back to Ron, a guy who was on the chatter group committee spent his own time unpaid.

1497
02:49:07,343 --> 02:49:10,044
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll take Ron after we've heard from people who haven't had a chance to speak yet.

1498
02:49:10,405 --> 02:49:11,825
[SPEAKER_17]: Just think he needs to be heard.

1499
02:49:11,885 --> 02:49:13,286
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all we'll hear from him.

1500
02:49:13,326 --> 02:49:13,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1501
02:49:13,666 --> 02:49:14,867
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to hear from everyone.

1502
02:49:15,127 --> 02:49:15,687
[SPEAKER_17]: And equally.

1503
02:49:15,787 --> 02:49:16,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1504
02:49:17,448 --> 02:49:18,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record.

1505
02:49:18,769 --> 02:49:19,589
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

1506
02:49:19,985 --> 02:49:21,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

1507
02:49:22,327 --> 02:49:24,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for letting me speak here tonight.

1508
02:49:24,870 --> 02:49:43,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to speak in favor of the proposal to not have a system that's just... To back up for a second, I think we're getting very caught up on a lot of the semantics around what the

1509
02:49:44,093 --> 02:49:48,094
[SPEAKER_08]: what makes a ward versus a precinct versus a district.

1510
02:49:49,414 --> 02:50:00,937
[SPEAKER_08]: In other cities, I think Quincy is one, there are fewer wards with larger populations.

1511
02:50:02,418 --> 02:50:06,799
[SPEAKER_08]: These are bodies that we use to make up a district, right?

1512
02:50:07,619 --> 02:50:12,180
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, you know,

1513
02:50:14,562 --> 02:50:29,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I've spoken before the previous committee about concerns, particularly in Ward 4 where I live, where Tufts takes up a large part of the ward.

1514
02:50:30,145 --> 02:50:41,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And just for perspective or background, it's maybe already been said tonight, but precincts are made up based off of the population of an area.

1515
02:50:41,815 --> 02:50:46,958
[SPEAKER_08]: not off of the eligible voters in an area, they're formed based off of census blocks.

1516
02:50:47,539 --> 02:50:55,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, where I live in my ward, we would have a disproportionate share of the vote due to the fact that

1517
02:50:56,833 --> 02:51:05,117
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have a very large population due to the students housed on campus, but these students do not, cannot, will not vote in Massachusetts.

1518
02:51:05,137 --> 02:51:06,378
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not registered to vote here.

1519
02:51:06,418 --> 02:51:07,719
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't register to vote here.

1520
02:51:07,819 --> 02:51:09,079
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't register to vote here.

1521
02:51:09,820 --> 02:51:20,625
[SPEAKER_08]: And this creates a dynamic where the votes in, you know, my precinct, you know, are weighted much more heavily than the votes in, say, you know, Ward 6 would be.

1522
02:51:22,206 --> 02:51:23,606
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't think this is fair.

1523
02:51:25,437 --> 02:51:27,278
[SPEAKER_08]: other parts of town where this is an issue.

1524
02:51:27,298 --> 02:51:44,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I also do just, it's a little, I think we've been talking a lot about a survey and I think the city habitually has defaulted to surveying in a sort of casual way where, you know,

1525
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:48,901
[SPEAKER_08]: people go out and we'll put a questionnaire forth or try to like talk to folks.

1526
02:51:49,501 --> 02:51:57,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, there's a technical scientific way to conduct a poll, to conduct a survey.

1527
02:51:57,284 --> 02:51:58,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have 30 seconds.

1528
02:51:58,644 --> 02:52:06,286
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, these things are not, you know, it hasn't been the practice of the city of Medford to do that.

1529
02:52:06,346 --> 02:52:09,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I sincerely hope that the city of Medford does that.

1530
02:52:09,107 --> 02:52:12,288
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, you know, I'm excited that the city is,

1531
02:52:13,350 --> 02:52:18,538
[SPEAKER_08]: taking up these changes to the charter and that we'll get to have a new one.

1532
02:52:18,639 --> 02:52:19,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you all.

1533
02:52:19,620 --> 02:52:20,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night.

1534
02:52:20,762 --> 02:52:21,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1535
02:52:25,368 --> 02:52:27,589
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm seeing no hands on zoom, I will go back to the podium.

1536
02:52:27,609 --> 02:52:28,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone who'd like to speak?

1537
02:52:28,889 --> 02:52:29,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. South, would you like to speak?

1538
02:52:29,990 --> 02:52:31,730
[SPEAKER_17]: You haven't spoken yet, so I'll take you first.

1539
02:52:32,491 --> 02:52:35,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes and then I'll go back to you, Chair McDowell.

1540
02:52:36,252 --> 02:52:37,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Beasley.

1541
02:52:37,292 --> 02:52:38,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Steven South, No.

1542
02:52:38,073 --> 02:52:39,613
[SPEAKER_07]: 6, Monroe.

1543
02:52:39,933 --> 02:52:50,757
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing I'd like to do is take the opportunity to thank the 11 members of the Charter Review Committee and just point out one thing I haven't really heard a lot about is that they

1544
02:52:53,129 --> 02:53:08,613
[SPEAKER_07]: As talking to them, they had over 200 meetings in over two years that they spent thousands of hours collectively working on this with all of the different aspects of this work.

1545
02:53:09,193 --> 02:53:12,154
[SPEAKER_07]: And that the most important thing is they weren't paid.

1546
02:53:12,894 --> 02:53:17,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanna point out that they did all of this for their love of the city of Medford.

1547
02:53:17,336 --> 02:53:19,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that very admirable and amazing.

1548
02:53:19,696 --> 02:53:21,757
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanted to thank them for their hard work.

1549
02:53:22,498 --> 02:53:31,427
[SPEAKER_07]: With that being said, along with the professionals that the call and center who the two of them I believe have over 80 years of experience.

1550
02:53:32,068 --> 02:53:38,835
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I just find it a little bit uneasy that it at the beginning of the meeting meeting Justin saying put in.

1551
02:53:39,295 --> 02:53:43,878
[SPEAKER_17]: a bunch of a bunch of what's that just if you could address the other Councilors through my I am.

1552
02:53:44,299 --> 02:53:44,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1553
02:53:44,719 --> 02:53:51,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So through the chair, Justin saying yes made many amendments that are, I believe are first being seen tonight.

1554
02:53:52,084 --> 02:53:55,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a few minutes later, I believe it was Councilor Collins has said let's vote on these.

1555
02:53:56,367 --> 02:54:03,893
[SPEAKER_07]: When I saw Councilors trying to write down what he was saying that I believe they, this is the first they're hearing of it and then I hear.

1556
02:54:04,693 --> 02:54:06,554
[SPEAKER_07]: that it has to be done by March 29.

1557
02:54:07,014 --> 02:54:08,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think these are huge changes.

1558
02:54:09,654 --> 02:54:12,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally believe in the eight and three.

1559
02:54:12,615 --> 02:54:13,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's amazing.

1560
02:54:14,016 --> 02:54:17,677
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing that I agreed with all of you on over the years.

1561
02:54:18,737 --> 02:54:25,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that I just don't know how six of you, and I know that at the vote, you won't make it six to one.

1562
02:54:25,879 --> 02:54:32,341
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to make it look a little more different, but how do the six of you or the majority of you

1563
02:54:34,058 --> 02:54:53,231
[SPEAKER_07]: overrule the thousands of hours of work that was put into this and the 80 years of experience from the Collins Center and all of the data just by, you know, and I know Justin said he researched this all day and talked to scientists and researchers, didn't name any of them and talked to lawyers.

1564
02:54:53,352 --> 02:55:01,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there were the city's lawyers, but I just, I find it disheartening that this council is looking to overturn thousands of hours of hard work

1565
02:55:02,758 --> 02:55:13,963
[SPEAKER_07]: real research, not just saying there was research, real hard work and the professionalism and the 80 years of experience of the Collins Center.

1566
02:55:14,243 --> 02:55:17,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I just find it very disheartening and I hope that you'll all reconsider.

1567
02:55:17,765 --> 02:55:19,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do thank you all for your time.

1568
02:55:19,626 --> 02:55:20,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1569
02:55:21,027 --> 02:55:21,547
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do.

1570
02:55:21,907 --> 02:55:24,428
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate you bringing up the volunteer piece of this.

1571
02:55:24,448 --> 02:55:25,389
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't said that enough.

1572
02:55:26,269 --> 02:55:27,890
[SPEAKER_17]: And Chairman McDonald can certainly correct me.

1573
02:55:28,485 --> 02:55:29,946
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe you were all volunteer.

1574
02:55:30,526 --> 02:55:40,413
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure what the call center had a grant or something or if they did this out of for free and also I believe you can correct me I don't think any city budget was allocated to the review study committee.

1575
02:55:40,962 --> 02:55:41,162
[SPEAKER_17]: either.

1576
02:55:41,182 --> 02:55:41,923
[SPEAKER_17]: You can correct me.

1577
02:55:42,283 --> 02:55:42,943
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't.

1578
02:55:43,403 --> 02:55:49,306
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever the situation with the Collins Center is, that wasn't something that we negotiated, so I can't speak to it.

1579
02:55:49,406 --> 02:55:52,428
[SPEAKER_22]: But the members of the Charter Study Committee were all volunteers.

1580
02:55:52,688 --> 02:55:52,868
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1581
02:55:53,428 --> 02:55:56,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And did you have any funds allocated for your outreach?

1582
02:55:56,190 --> 02:55:56,390
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1583
02:55:57,350 --> 02:55:57,610
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1584
02:55:57,650 --> 02:55:58,571
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't have a budget.

1585
02:55:58,591 --> 02:55:59,511
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't have a staff.

1586
02:56:01,232 --> 02:56:04,654
[SPEAKER_22]: Some charter committees actually have support staff.

1587
02:56:04,694 --> 02:56:07,535
[SPEAKER_22]: We did have a city liaison who was very helpful.

1588
02:56:08,216 --> 02:56:08,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1589
02:56:08,416 --> 02:56:09,336
[SPEAKER_22]: Frances Nwaje.

1590
02:56:09,356 --> 02:56:09,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1591
02:56:11,148 --> 02:56:12,609
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to you again for another three minutes.

1592
02:56:14,449 --> 02:56:16,430
[SPEAKER_22]: Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

1593
02:56:16,710 --> 02:56:27,395
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't really, I just wanted to, because I had asked the question about other communities that have district representation, but as has been pointed out, it is a semantic issue.

1594
02:56:27,415 --> 02:56:36,779
[SPEAKER_22]: What we're talking about is representation where two of the designated sections of the city, whether they're called wards or districts, are combined.

1595
02:56:40,701 --> 02:56:51,050
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Methuen and Amherst, they also have multi-member, but as we heard from the Collins Center, that probably wouldn't fly at the Statehouse.

1596
02:56:51,511 --> 02:56:55,855
[SPEAKER_22]: And they also said that one of those communities was changing their form of government.

1597
02:56:56,295 --> 02:57:03,141
[SPEAKER_22]: It's also notable that those communities have home rule charters, which means the Statehouse never saw those charters.

1598
02:57:05,644 --> 02:57:10,516
[SPEAKER_22]: Lowell says district on their website, but they are just it's their

1599
02:57:11,122 --> 02:57:13,584
[SPEAKER_17]: I reviewed that, you were right, I was wrong, I apologize for making that statement.

1600
02:57:13,604 --> 02:57:14,425
[SPEAKER_22]: That's okay.

1601
02:57:14,525 --> 02:57:16,567
[SPEAKER_22]: And it looks to me like Amesbury is the same.

1602
02:57:16,687 --> 02:57:24,653
[SPEAKER_22]: So the only two that I could find outside of Worcester and Boston were those two, and also Worcester is also a home rule charter.

1603
02:57:24,713 --> 02:57:26,134
[SPEAKER_22]: So those are all home rule charters.

1604
02:57:26,194 --> 02:57:33,761
[SPEAKER_22]: So we really don't know if the state has seen a charter that does this for city council.

1605
02:57:34,421 --> 02:57:35,362
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to make that point.

1606
02:57:35,722 --> 02:57:36,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1607
02:57:36,503 --> 02:57:38,805
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to, I did further,

1608
02:57:39,637 --> 02:57:40,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Quick research on it as well.

1609
02:57:40,718 --> 02:57:41,679
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate you doing that.

1610
02:57:42,099 --> 02:57:44,561
[SPEAKER_17]: The Amesbury, they combine precincts.

1611
02:57:44,881 --> 02:57:49,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Framingham also combines precincts and they recently adopted a new charter moving from town to city.

1612
02:57:50,325 --> 02:57:52,307
[SPEAKER_17]: So it does seem more common in the town context.

1613
02:57:52,367 --> 02:57:54,969
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to feel free.

1614
02:57:56,630 --> 02:58:02,995
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm saying I pull back some of what I said earlier and thank you for bringing up the piece.

1615
02:58:03,055 --> 02:58:03,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1616
02:58:04,089 --> 02:58:04,669
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

1617
02:58:05,310 --> 02:58:07,391
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have some technical things.

1618
02:58:07,851 --> 02:58:12,954
[SPEAKER_13]: The first most important thing is I distributed the list of edits to the clerk.

1619
02:58:13,515 --> 02:58:14,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yeah.

1620
02:58:14,135 --> 02:58:18,098
[SPEAKER_13]: At the very start of the meeting, he then redistributed it to all the councilors.

1621
02:58:18,498 --> 02:58:22,801
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll have time to read it and we can walk through it if need be.

1622
02:58:22,961 --> 02:58:27,724
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can explain the edits in even more detail to the councilors, but we're not on that part.

1623
02:58:28,164 --> 02:58:29,985
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion on the table.

1624
02:58:30,645 --> 02:58:31,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's the next motion.

1625
02:58:31,446 --> 02:58:32,006
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not this one.

1626
02:58:34,138 --> 02:58:42,996
[SPEAKER_13]: I, you know, I have a lot of respect for the call center people I've been working with them a lot, but it's true that there were also really important legal questions that.

1627
02:58:44,735 --> 02:58:45,535
[SPEAKER_13]: they couldn't answer.

1628
02:58:46,076 --> 02:58:52,681
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are a lot of- They specifically stated they weren't providing legal advice, nor were they providing a recommendation.

1629
02:58:53,061 --> 02:58:53,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1630
02:58:53,882 --> 02:59:00,127
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's important to note, there's one part of the charter, for example, that got a lot of scoffs in the audience when I brought it up.

1631
02:59:00,307 --> 02:59:11,717
[SPEAKER_13]: But under temporary absence of the mayor, the text as is, the way you read it, does allow the city council by unanimous vote to remove the mayor permanently.

1632
02:59:12,737 --> 02:59:16,421
[SPEAKER_13]: And I talked to a bunch of lawyers about it.

1633
02:59:16,901 --> 02:59:20,004
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the value of talking to lawyers about this kind of thing.

1634
02:59:20,964 --> 02:59:29,712
[SPEAKER_13]: There are at least three legal rules that would support that reading, including the rule of surplusage, rule against titles, and the rejected proposal rule.

1635
02:59:29,972 --> 02:59:33,595
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are three legal canons that judges use to interpret statutes.

1636
02:59:33,795 --> 02:59:35,537
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not, and the idea is,

1637
02:59:37,048 --> 02:59:41,972
[SPEAKER_13]: The way that jurisprudence is moving in nowadays is that it's not enough to look at intention.

1638
02:59:42,032 --> 02:59:46,255
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not enough to look at committee reports or what happened in a committee meeting.

1639
02:59:46,735 --> 02:59:48,597
[SPEAKER_13]: The assumption is that the text rules.

1640
02:59:49,117 --> 02:59:51,339
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really important that we get the text right.

1641
02:59:51,379 --> 02:59:54,281
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I've suggested a bunch of those edits.

1642
02:59:54,681 --> 02:59:55,842
[SPEAKER_13]: None of them are substantive.

1643
02:59:56,342 --> 03:00:01,312
[SPEAKER_13]: None of them change anything that we talked about in this committee or in the governance committee.

1644
03:00:02,173 --> 03:00:08,525
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just meant to align more with what both the Charter Study Committee and this in City Council wants.

1645
03:00:09,453 --> 03:00:18,821
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on the Quincy proposals, or the Quincy comparison, I did look up the wards in Quincy are actually very large.

1646
03:00:19,121 --> 03:00:20,302
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have six wards.

1647
03:00:21,303 --> 03:00:23,025
[SPEAKER_13]: That's their representation on city council.

1648
03:00:23,445 --> 03:00:26,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Each ward has about 16,000 to 17,000 people.

1649
03:00:27,388 --> 03:00:32,953
[SPEAKER_13]: With the exact same proportion, we'd actually have less than four district Councilors in Medford.

1650
03:00:33,193 --> 03:00:35,095
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we're actually being more generous in there.

1651
03:00:37,545 --> 03:00:39,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And some are both twice the size and yeah.

1652
03:00:40,448 --> 03:00:40,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1653
03:00:41,028 --> 03:00:49,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Councilor Callahan did put up a document I think at the January 22nd Governance Committee meeting.

1654
03:00:49,275 --> 03:01:02,807
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a copy of the minutes in the reports, but the recording is available comparing many communities in Massachusetts, the average size of the various districts, wards or precincts that compose their local representation in their hybrid models.

1655
03:01:04,247 --> 03:01:08,389
[SPEAKER_17]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, seeing no other public comment, Councilor Scarpelli.

1656
03:01:09,249 --> 03:01:29,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I bring this to light because it has been an issue for this council for almost four years now, maybe more now, is that I appreciate that Councilor Tseng did his due diligence in reaching out to legal minds that he is directly involved with, but as one councilor, not having a city solicitor and not having that opportunity

1657
03:01:30,523 --> 03:01:43,351
[SPEAKER_10]: or running these changes through a city solicitor is something this council should be really upset about and hopefully do something about it because this is a huge concern.

1658
03:01:45,032 --> 03:01:56,680
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that what we're hearing is just common sense where I think we're saying things to be too smart.

1659
03:02:00,589 --> 03:02:02,931
[SPEAKER_10]: where instead it's right in front of you.

1660
03:02:04,112 --> 03:02:24,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's in front of you is there is no doubt that an eight ward representation, that there is no concern, there is no question that anybody has brought up or anybody has talked about, even tonight, that how the eight representatives will negatively affect us.

1661
03:02:25,168 --> 03:02:29,772
[SPEAKER_10]: But we've also heard how the eight is really the will of the people.

1662
03:02:32,681 --> 03:02:38,923
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I know we don't want to talk about politicizing anything, but this is what it comes down to.

1663
03:02:41,383 --> 03:02:43,464
[SPEAKER_10]: At least that's what it seems like to my colleagues.

1664
03:02:46,184 --> 03:02:47,045
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's very simple.

1665
03:02:47,425 --> 03:02:48,805
[SPEAKER_10]: You could deny it all you want.

1666
03:02:49,265 --> 03:02:57,027
[SPEAKER_10]: You can question it or run numbers or state legal genre, whatever it is.

1667
03:02:57,127 --> 03:02:59,628
[SPEAKER_10]: But the bottom line is very simple.

1668
03:03:02,100 --> 03:03:05,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember where we were two years ago in a day.

1669
03:03:07,262 --> 03:03:16,006
[SPEAKER_10]: We had residents over and over again, door knocking, trying to get signatures, and it just wasn't happening.

1670
03:03:18,027 --> 03:03:29,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So we turned to a child review committee and give them the energy to go out and do the will of the people, bring us back the information of the people.

1671
03:03:29,872 --> 03:03:30,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what they did.

1672
03:03:33,127 --> 03:03:47,674
[SPEAKER_10]: And even in all these committees, all these governance committees, we didn't hear out of that 5-4, and I haven't even looked into it for the fact that I think it's wrong in every sense of the way, how that satisfies everybody.

1673
03:03:48,715 --> 03:03:55,138
[SPEAKER_10]: But the truth of the matter is even the people that supported the 5-4 didn't have an issue with 8.

1674
03:03:59,243 --> 03:04:02,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And then again, we talk about the lack of turnout.

1675
03:04:03,526 --> 03:04:08,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I know one resident said the lack of turnout and the same people come here, the same people do this.

1676
03:04:08,550 --> 03:04:14,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, this is one of the intents of an eight person ward.

1677
03:04:15,756 --> 03:04:19,939
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to generate, to rejuvenate that base, to get people out.

1678
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:25,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether there's 10 people that vote in the ward or 10,000 people that vote in the ward.

1679
03:04:27,141 --> 03:04:33,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know it hurts people's feelings when people call them on things, but that's too bad.

1680
03:04:36,568 --> 03:04:37,629
[SPEAKER_10]: This is our job.

1681
03:04:37,669 --> 03:04:46,435
[SPEAKER_10]: My job is to make sure that people wanna spin it as much as they want and saying this is, he's polarizing, he's making this into something it isn't.

1682
03:04:47,716 --> 03:04:55,742
[SPEAKER_10]: All I've done from the beginning of this process is share the information and questions that residents have sent to me.

1683
03:04:58,099 --> 03:05:04,041
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've shared my personal opinion where I was and where I am today with the charter review.

1684
03:05:06,502 --> 03:05:11,563
[SPEAKER_10]: So you could sit back and when I get off and defend it and say, he's bad, he's trying to rattle the tree again.

1685
03:05:12,604 --> 03:05:25,788
[SPEAKER_10]: The bottom line is this, you haven't shown your constituency that for some reason this eight ward representation brings a negative light to the city of Medford in any way.

1686
03:05:28,847 --> 03:05:29,367
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

1687
03:05:31,609 --> 03:05:32,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1688
03:05:32,870 --> 03:05:34,351
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think you described it well.

1689
03:05:34,371 --> 03:05:45,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I think everyone here has had the interview they had listed or it's been mentioned, yours wasn't, but it was mentioned that your position had changed from that interview.

1690
03:05:46,839 --> 03:05:52,403
[SPEAKER_17]: There were the positions then, there's the positions now, people have vocalized them and we are where we are.

1691
03:05:52,503 --> 03:05:54,564
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will go to Councilor Leming, then Councilor Collins.

1692
03:05:56,526 --> 03:05:56,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming.

1693
03:05:57,801 --> 03:06:02,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the signature process is an interesting thing to bring up.

1694
03:06:02,323 --> 03:06:07,566
[SPEAKER_09]: That was what the Medford Charter Review Coalition was trying to do for a very long time.

1695
03:06:07,666 --> 03:06:14,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually looking through my email the other day to try to figure out how many signatures had been collected.

1696
03:06:14,249 --> 03:06:15,569
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the number was about 2,600.

1697
03:06:17,210 --> 03:06:22,753
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them were by a former school committee member, Michael Ruggiero, who was a,

1698
03:06:23,787 --> 03:06:27,350
[SPEAKER_09]: like a machine when it came to doing that.

1699
03:06:27,410 --> 03:06:35,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe the number that would have needed to be required to trigger a home rule petition would have been closer to 5,300.

1700
03:06:36,937 --> 03:06:42,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially in the COVID years, I thought it was 15% of 44,000.

1701
03:06:54,721 --> 03:06:55,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay.

1702
03:06:55,342 --> 03:06:55,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1703
03:06:55,582 --> 03:06:56,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's true.

1704
03:06:56,263 --> 03:06:57,944
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think, I think we're shooting for like 7,500.

1705
03:06:58,265 --> 03:07:08,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but strictly speaking, like 44,100, it would be about 5,300, um, would be, uh, would be about the number that you need.

1706
03:07:09,395 --> 03:07:16,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and so that was, that was the effort for, that was the effort for a while.

1707
03:07:16,361 --> 03:07:18,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that if that had succeeded, this process would look

1708
03:07:19,772 --> 03:07:20,592
[SPEAKER_09]: very different.

1709
03:07:20,972 --> 03:07:36,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be better in some ways, although as Chair McDonald told me, we actually did have a successful petition, I think back in like the 70s or 80s, 1978, and it kind of fell apart because there were some dissenting members.

1710
03:07:37,115 --> 03:07:43,456
[SPEAKER_09]: But the point is that at some point in the charter review process, you do need some kind of an elected body.

1711
03:07:43,476 --> 03:07:48,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And under the Home Rule petition process, the nine members that comprise that themselves are elected.

1712
03:07:48,257 --> 03:07:48,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why

1713
03:07:50,138 --> 03:07:57,023
[SPEAKER_09]: you can end up getting much more unique processes, like much more unique charters that are home rule charters.

1714
03:07:57,524 --> 03:08:03,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's how, I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that's how Cambridge got ranked choice voting.

1715
03:08:03,569 --> 03:08:08,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Their charter's 1938 and it's not ranked choice, it's way weirder than that, but we'll digress, sorry.

1716
03:08:08,533 --> 03:08:11,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, that was my impression.

1717
03:08:11,616 --> 03:08:15,299
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, like I'm,

1718
03:08:15,822 --> 03:08:23,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been very cognizant about that blog post and the context at the time when I wrote it, that was brought up.

1719
03:08:23,871 --> 03:08:29,417
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of me, like a lot of the reason that, again, I haven't been too, too,

1720
03:08:32,682 --> 03:08:44,830
[SPEAKER_09]: vocal about a lot of this stuff is because I do think that there were some issues with the way that the Charter Study Committee happened.

1721
03:08:44,870 --> 03:08:47,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think that they were actually the fault of most members of the committee.

1722
03:08:47,832 --> 03:08:50,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I don't want to...

1723
03:08:52,400 --> 03:09:01,930
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I think is that the charter study committee really should have been confirmed by a vote of the city council and I can understand the reason that it wasn't done at the time.

1724
03:09:01,950 --> 03:09:08,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that with three members who didn't want charter review to happen like the mayor just wanted to simplify the process at the time.

1725
03:09:10,258 --> 03:09:14,920
[SPEAKER_09]: and create a charter study committee that she just appointed.

1726
03:09:15,300 --> 03:09:23,222
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think that it's really done without any council involvement in pretty much any other context.

1727
03:09:23,262 --> 03:09:35,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, that's not the fault of the people on, that was the decision by the mayor, but I do think that this process would be going a lot more smoothly if there were integration from

1728
03:09:37,307 --> 03:09:41,590
[SPEAKER_09]: the body that would eventually be voting on that charter much earlier in the process.

1729
03:09:41,830 --> 03:09:49,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why in the current draft of the charter, it is written that the City Council confirms the Charter Study Committee when it's when it's re-reviewed.

1730
03:09:51,656 --> 03:09:53,577
[SPEAKER_09]: So like every every 10 years.

1731
03:09:53,918 --> 03:09:55,519
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, I

1732
03:09:58,120 --> 03:10:00,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a lot of thoughts on this.

1733
03:10:01,084 --> 03:10:06,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank the members of the Charter Study Committee that did try to address the concerns that I brought up.

1734
03:10:07,232 --> 03:10:11,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that is reflective of what an expert body should try to do.

1735
03:10:11,318 --> 03:10:14,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that it should be

1736
03:10:15,443 --> 03:10:20,226
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to, you know, lobby or grandstand or, or anything like that to get their way.

1737
03:10:20,266 --> 03:10:31,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that if you're, if you're an expert body, you need to address the specific concerns that are being brought up by a body like this one, and have a calm conversation about that.

1738
03:10:32,792 --> 03:10:35,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do appreciate it when that happened.

1739
03:10:37,714 --> 03:10:38,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, anyway, I'm sorry, I've

1740
03:10:39,805 --> 03:10:41,747
[SPEAKER_09]: been quite long winded tonight.

1741
03:10:42,167 --> 03:10:45,850
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we've been talking about this for far too long.

1742
03:10:46,050 --> 03:10:50,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to thank everybody for their work on this.

1743
03:10:50,333 --> 03:11:00,060
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to thank all the folks on Zoom, Charter Study Committee for all of their work and everybody for listening to this very long Committee of the Whole meeting.

1744
03:11:00,300 --> 03:11:01,381
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1745
03:11:02,782 --> 03:11:03,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1746
03:11:03,163 --> 03:11:04,904
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng.

1747
03:11:05,644 --> 03:11:06,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

1748
03:11:11,251 --> 03:11:11,531
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1749
03:11:11,551 --> 03:11:22,763
[SPEAKER_28]: So I know everybody knows how I feel about City Council composition at this point.

1750
03:11:22,783 --> 03:11:23,523
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been pretty clear.

1751
03:11:23,563 --> 03:11:25,005
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been pretty clear for several meetings.

1752
03:11:25,685 --> 03:11:27,227
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not really interested in repeating myself.

1753
03:11:27,307 --> 03:11:29,790
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sure everybody else is even less interested in me repeating myself.

1754
03:11:33,072 --> 03:11:38,457
[SPEAKER_28]: But I did hear a Councilor say that nobody has articulated concerns with the three system and that is just not true.

1755
03:11:38,778 --> 03:11:40,379
[SPEAKER_28]: And I do want to correct the record on that point.

1756
03:11:41,320 --> 03:11:47,827
[SPEAKER_28]: I won't speak for other Councilors, I know other Councilors have brought up other concerns, some of which will overlap with mine as one Councilor.

1757
03:11:49,567 --> 03:11:54,390
[SPEAKER_28]: I have brought up concerns with having one ward Councilor for each of eight small wards.

1758
03:11:55,811 --> 03:12:04,717
[SPEAKER_28]: Something I said back in January when we first talked about city council composition, my research has indicated to me that in small ward systems like ours would be, the pool of candidates would be very small.

1759
03:12:05,297 --> 03:12:09,660
[SPEAKER_28]: I also went on to say, wards do not deserve simple representation full stop.

1760
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:13,002
[SPEAKER_28]: Wards deserve compelling and competitive elections each and every time.

1761
03:12:13,162 --> 03:12:14,042
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what they deserve.

1762
03:12:14,483 --> 03:12:16,964
[SPEAKER_28]: This is still my main concern with an 8-3 system.

1763
03:12:18,505 --> 03:12:25,633
[SPEAKER_28]: And just to reiterate my other concern is parochialism, I think I've never been shy that one of my two main issues on the council is housing and housing production.

1764
03:12:28,542 --> 03:12:44,651
[SPEAKER_28]: that by having the bulk of the council being small work Councilors, there would be some very real potential harms for strategies that by necessity have to be citywide, in which the city council would have to work across district boundaries and get ahead of the tendency to be protective of one's own home base.

1765
03:12:46,733 --> 03:12:47,673
[SPEAKER_28]: We've talked about that before.

1766
03:12:47,693 --> 03:12:48,834
[SPEAKER_28]: I've raised these concerns before.

1767
03:12:48,854 --> 03:12:50,895
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't bring that up because I want to relitigate that before.

1768
03:12:50,995 --> 03:12:55,878
[SPEAKER_28]: I know that people disagree with me about those concerns, but it's not accurate to say that we are

1769
03:12:57,770 --> 03:12:59,732
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not accurate to say that I have one Councilor.

1770
03:12:59,752 --> 03:13:04,096
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm forwarding a strategy, having cited no concerns with another approach.

1771
03:13:04,156 --> 03:13:05,037
[SPEAKER_28]: That is just not true.

1772
03:13:05,057 --> 03:13:08,400
[SPEAKER_28]: I've never been shy about saying what my concerns with H3 are.

1773
03:13:09,701 --> 03:13:12,704
[SPEAKER_28]: I will accept that my fellow Councilors will disagree with me when they disagree.

1774
03:13:12,724 --> 03:13:15,607
[SPEAKER_28]: I can accept that community members will disagree with me when they disagree.

1775
03:13:16,427 --> 03:13:21,709
[SPEAKER_28]: I can fully accept that community members may not want to support me in the future if I do things that they disagree with.

1776
03:13:21,749 --> 03:13:25,290
[SPEAKER_28]: That is your right, and I accept that.

1777
03:13:26,090 --> 03:13:28,131
[SPEAKER_28]: And I would not want to go forward.

1778
03:13:28,491 --> 03:13:35,393
[SPEAKER_28]: I would not think that I would earn this seat if I was supporting an approach that I did not think was best for the community just because I think it would make me more popular.

1779
03:13:36,213 --> 03:13:45,318
[SPEAKER_28]: But what I do not accept is being prescribed a reasoning for my vote that is not my own, and I don't think it is productive to this conversation.

1780
03:13:45,378 --> 03:13:53,502
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think it's fair to the residents for us to, I don't think it is in any way additive for us to have this conversation.

1781
03:13:53,522 --> 03:14:05,568
[SPEAKER_28]: And we can disagree, and that's great, and I think that's really important, and I'm glad we're disagreeing out in the open, but I don't think it adds anything for anybody for us to be putting words in each other's mouths about why the way we feel the way that we do.

1782
03:14:07,633 --> 03:14:14,498
[SPEAKER_28]: I do not want to cut off discussion if there are any other members of the public who would like to speak, but if there are not, I would move the question.

1783
03:14:14,518 --> 03:14:15,959
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Councilor Tseng.

1784
03:14:16,820 --> 03:14:18,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

1785
03:14:18,381 --> 03:14:18,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1786
03:14:18,741 --> 03:14:19,302
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be brief.

1787
03:14:20,423 --> 03:14:33,373
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when I think about just taking a step back from this whole conversation, when I think about what people want in their elected officials, and look, I could be wrong about this, but I keep, I always hear about

1788
03:14:34,037 --> 03:14:44,660
[SPEAKER_13]: people wanting their elected officials to act with integrity to do the thing that they think is right, even if it's politically unpopular, to follow data and to follow the law and not to disregard it.

1789
03:14:45,421 --> 03:14:48,522
[SPEAKER_13]: And look, that's the ideal I grew up with.

1790
03:14:48,982 --> 03:14:53,843
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe that doesn't align with what people are feeling at home.

1791
03:14:54,864 --> 03:14:57,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And to that, I apologize.

1792
03:14:58,185 --> 03:14:58,365
[SPEAKER_13]: But

1793
03:14:59,605 --> 03:15:09,280
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't not vote my conscience on this, and I urge all the Councilors to vote their conscience on it too, because I think what I said about morality was misconstrued.

1794
03:15:09,621 --> 03:15:11,003
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think there is a right answer.

1795
03:15:11,163 --> 03:15:13,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think this proposal or any proposal is perfect.

1796
03:15:14,291 --> 03:15:16,373
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think we should vote our consciences.

1797
03:15:16,593 --> 03:15:17,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's our job.

1798
03:15:19,015 --> 03:15:21,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, we don't have to buy into every concern.

1799
03:15:21,797 --> 03:15:29,964
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm concerned about some of the stuff that Councilor Collins brought up, the parochialism, about competitive elections.

1800
03:15:30,024 --> 03:15:33,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm concerned also about what this means for racial justice.

1801
03:15:34,888 --> 03:15:38,091
[SPEAKER_13]: And you don't have to find all those concerns compelling.

1802
03:15:38,151 --> 03:15:38,931
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a democracy.

1803
03:15:39,012 --> 03:15:42,094
[SPEAKER_13]: We live in a free world where we are going to disagree with each other.

1804
03:15:43,873 --> 03:15:45,874
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not to say that those concerns don't exist.

1805
03:15:46,254 --> 03:15:54,559
[SPEAKER_13]: And my voters voted for someone who is thinking about these issues and who is concerned about these things.

1806
03:15:55,340 --> 03:16:01,003
[SPEAKER_13]: And if voters decide this fall that they don't agree with that, they're welcome not to vote for me.

1807
03:16:01,383 --> 03:16:07,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love your vote, but look, if I'm not the right choice for you, then I'm not the right choice for you.

1808
03:16:08,007 --> 03:16:11,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the last thing I want to say is that

1809
03:16:13,763 --> 03:16:17,785
[SPEAKER_13]: This job isn't just being here on Tuesday night or Wednesday night.

1810
03:16:18,025 --> 03:16:34,790
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a lot to this job about scheduling meetings about working on legislation about thinking through long term political impacts and long term social impacts and it's, it's not just that it's actually not just social politics, it's the economy, it's health, it's all these different things right.

1811
03:16:35,814 --> 03:16:36,814
[SPEAKER_13]: the job is complicated.

1812
03:16:37,334 --> 03:16:40,355
[SPEAKER_13]: And oftentimes, we see things that aren't really intuitive.

1813
03:16:40,655 --> 03:16:47,476
[SPEAKER_13]: We see when, you know, certain structures that we think should be working actually lead to unintended consequences.

1814
03:16:47,797 --> 03:17:01,900
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's our job, I think, as politicians and as elected, you know, public servants of this community to be able to respond to new information that we see, and to, to embody that in the decisions that we make.

1815
03:17:02,420 --> 03:17:03,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope

1816
03:17:04,451 --> 03:17:14,033
[SPEAKER_13]: that people in this community understand and want elected officials who will adjust their thoughts based on new information.

1817
03:17:14,813 --> 03:17:17,034
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't say that that's true for everyone.

1818
03:17:17,054 --> 03:17:29,117
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe that's not exactly what all people want, but I think it's important to be said that when we encounter new information, we should be open-minded enough to adjust our priors.

1819
03:17:33,945 --> 03:17:34,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1820
03:17:37,347 --> 03:17:37,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1821
03:17:37,667 --> 03:17:49,374
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have downloaded from the state of Massachusetts, a database that includes the sizes of all wards and precincts of every city and town in Massachusetts.

1822
03:17:51,275 --> 03:18:01,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say it looks like most cities, and of course we're only looking at cities because towns have a totally different government structure.

1823
03:18:01,901 --> 03:18:02,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're only looking at cities.

1824
03:18:04,223 --> 03:18:10,306
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to clarify, there are things that call themselves towns but operate as cities, and I'm betting that database includes them, but it might not.

1825
03:18:10,446 --> 03:18:11,387
[SPEAKER_17]: So just something to remember.

1826
03:18:12,167 --> 03:18:14,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this database includes all towns and cities.

1827
03:18:14,329 --> 03:18:14,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, good.

1828
03:18:14,789 --> 03:18:16,650
[SPEAKER_04]: All municipalities in all of Massachusetts.

1829
03:18:16,670 --> 03:18:23,094
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some things that call themselves towns, but they operate under a city structure with a council and a mayor or a manager rather than a town meeting.

1830
03:18:23,986 --> 03:18:27,927
[SPEAKER_04]: sadly, this particular database, I wish I'd done this before, because I would have marked them as cities or towns.

1831
03:18:27,967 --> 03:18:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So this particular database does not in fact tell me which ones are cities, which ones are towns.

1832
03:18:33,848 --> 03:18:49,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I am looking through it, I've gone up through letter N, and I have not yet found any cities that have wards

1833
03:18:50,590 --> 03:18:51,530
[SPEAKER_04]: as small as our wards.

1834
03:18:52,370 --> 03:19:01,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, everything looks about twice as large, one and a half times as large, three times as large in terms of population, just the population.

1835
03:19:03,833 --> 03:19:05,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, look at Chelsea.

1836
03:19:05,633 --> 03:19:10,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these are considerably smaller cities than we are in population.

1837
03:19:10,834 --> 03:19:12,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that really matters, right?

1838
03:19:12,675 --> 03:19:17,416
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks like Chelsea's are

1839
03:19:19,184 --> 03:19:21,766
[SPEAKER_04]: twice the size of ours.

1840
03:19:24,048 --> 03:19:31,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicopee actually would be similar.

1841
03:19:31,155 --> 03:19:40,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Everett, we're looking one and a half times, not quite one and a half times.

1842
03:19:40,983 --> 03:19:42,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Somerville are twice the size.

1843
03:19:43,566 --> 03:19:44,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Fall River.

1844
03:19:47,476 --> 03:19:51,238
[SPEAKER_04]: more than one and a half times.

1845
03:19:51,499 --> 03:19:57,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just looking, I understand that people want local representation.

1846
03:19:57,302 --> 03:20:01,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that we are unusual in Massachusetts.

1847
03:20:01,525 --> 03:20:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: And I made the argument last time that in other states, we are not at all unusual in terms of the representation that we have, either the current representation that we have in terms of being at large, because all over the country, that still is the same.

1848
03:20:18,148 --> 03:20:30,874
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the point I'm trying to make is the argument that we should definitely be wards, because that is just like all the other Massachusetts cities.

1849
03:20:32,475 --> 03:20:35,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I would love to dig a little bit more into this database.

1850
03:20:35,676 --> 03:20:44,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sort of trying to understand at a glance, like, am I making sure we're looking at, I think all of those I mentioned are cities and not towns.

1851
03:20:45,902 --> 03:20:57,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would want to double check that those are in fact the ones that are, that the size of the wards are as listed, the things that are listed as wards, though they each have like a person per ward.

1852
03:21:01,415 --> 03:21:06,899
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does look like our wards are smaller than most cities wards.

1853
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:08,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make that point.

1854
03:21:10,401 --> 03:21:14,424
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that because that's the last thing I was hopefully the last thing to say.

1855
03:21:14,444 --> 03:21:25,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And where I was going with it is, you know, the fundamental question that we're disputing and debating and we have now for two very long meetings on this topic is how big should the local districts be.

1856
03:21:26,432 --> 03:21:33,897
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are confined by the structure that we have right, you can make the argument that eight

1857
03:21:34,721 --> 03:21:38,042
[SPEAKER_17]: wards leaves out eight precincts, so we should have 16 precinct Councilors.

1858
03:21:38,222 --> 03:21:42,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think anyone would say that because we shouldn't have a 30-person council like Newton.

1859
03:21:42,744 --> 03:21:44,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody wants that, but it's the same argument.

1860
03:21:45,925 --> 03:21:50,947
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we're trapped by the fact that we don't have six wards with three precincts each.

1861
03:21:50,967 --> 03:21:57,029
[SPEAKER_17]: If we had six wards with three precincts each, I think everyone here would say, let's do six ward Councilors, five at-large Councilors.

1862
03:21:57,069 --> 03:21:58,150
[SPEAKER_17]: You have a majority ward.

1863
03:21:58,550 --> 03:21:59,710
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pretty evenly balanced.

1864
03:21:59,750 --> 03:22:00,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's go for it.

1865
03:22:00,611 --> 03:22:00,911
[SPEAKER_17]: I would.

1866
03:22:01,911 --> 03:22:02,711
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what Weymouth has.

1867
03:22:04,742 --> 03:22:15,508
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't want to draw districts, we don't want to draw six districts, which might be in between these four districts in the eight ward size, because the city, you know, the State House hasn't seen that quite.

1868
03:22:15,909 --> 03:22:18,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we don't want to have the model where we're drawing districts, right?

1869
03:22:18,090 --> 03:22:24,814
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there's a million different reasons, many of them stemming from the Special Act process and the legislature, why we are where we are.

1870
03:22:25,374 --> 03:22:26,855
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, that is my concern.

1871
03:22:26,915 --> 03:22:28,036
[SPEAKER_17]: How small is too small?

1872
03:22:29,872 --> 03:22:31,033
[SPEAKER_17]: I think eight is too small.

1873
03:22:31,093 --> 03:22:36,278
[SPEAKER_17]: That's based on the additional research I've done over the past five years, and especially over the last year and six months.

1874
03:22:37,219 --> 03:22:42,864
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems there's an assertion that four is too big, but there's no way to split up 16 precincts six ways.

1875
03:22:44,446 --> 03:22:45,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Math doesn't work.

1876
03:22:46,608 --> 03:22:49,591
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, we are constrained by the process.

1877
03:22:51,099 --> 03:23:06,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have had a discussion about the process extensively saying as to why we're not exploring ranked choice voting, why we're not exploring proportional, why we're not exploring multi-member districts, why we're not exploring council authority for the budget, why we're not exploring council authority on other matters.

1878
03:23:08,634 --> 03:23:16,081
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a whole bunch of things that we've just said we're not gonna do because the legislature is probably gonna delay or deny.

1879
03:23:18,565 --> 03:23:27,052
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, quite frankly, we have here a model that is used in another part of the charter recommended by the study committee, a district model.

1880
03:23:27,952 --> 03:23:35,438
[SPEAKER_17]: If it was gonna be muster for the school committee, we felt it seems that it would meet muster for the council on a legal basis only.

1881
03:23:35,638 --> 03:23:36,399
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are where we are.

1882
03:23:37,560 --> 03:23:39,001
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish we had a different number of awards.

1883
03:23:41,222 --> 03:23:41,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan.

1884
03:23:42,637 --> 03:23:43,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, I gotta correct myself.

1885
03:23:43,957 --> 03:23:44,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicopee would be smaller.

1886
03:23:45,218 --> 03:23:46,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

1887
03:23:46,618 --> 03:23:48,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't dug deeply into this.

1888
03:23:48,879 --> 03:23:51,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is really just kind of trying to get a sense.

1889
03:23:51,300 --> 03:23:53,781
[SPEAKER_17]: My view, I didn't look at a full database.

1890
03:23:53,801 --> 03:23:54,761
[SPEAKER_17]: I looked at specific cities.

1891
03:23:54,821 --> 03:24:04,124
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very similarly that our wards tend to, on average, the average population of our wards is smaller than wards in most of the places that have this model.

1892
03:24:05,505 --> 03:24:06,085
[SPEAKER_17]: I will go back.

1893
03:24:06,125 --> 03:24:07,085
[SPEAKER_17]: We have one hand on Zoom.

1894
03:24:07,105 --> 03:24:09,026
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone else in the chamber who'd like to speak?

1895
03:24:09,346 --> 03:24:10,226
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna go to the hand on Zoom.

1896
03:24:10,246 --> 03:24:11,547
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a new person, and then I'll come back

1897
03:24:12,148 --> 03:24:13,149
[SPEAKER_17]: to the podium.

1898
03:24:14,549 --> 03:24:17,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Muneer Germanis, name and address for the record.

1899
03:24:17,231 --> 03:24:18,272
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

1900
03:24:20,393 --> 03:24:27,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Muneer Germanis, 3 Summit Road, and long time residents of Medford.

1901
03:24:29,078 --> 03:24:30,519
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.

1902
03:24:30,939 --> 03:24:38,523
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here three years old, and he and his family have as much right to discuss this as myself or anybody else.

1903
03:24:39,744 --> 03:24:40,845
[SPEAKER_00]: I have long been

1904
03:24:42,005 --> 03:24:57,577
[SPEAKER_00]: a proponent of the concept of ward representation, because I always thought that it would be more representative of our population and a more democratic process, if that were so.

1905
03:25:00,519 --> 03:25:07,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, as I've been listening to the discussion and to the amazing work of this city council,

1906
03:25:09,320 --> 03:25:27,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am one who has voted for the city council and I expect them to do their best to do the, make their decisions based on all the studies and all the research that they did that I wasn't able to do.

1907
03:25:28,453 --> 03:25:33,336
[SPEAKER_00]: So I commend them for doing that and I fully respect their vote and we'll support it.

1908
03:25:34,017 --> 03:25:34,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much.

1909
03:25:36,719 --> 03:25:36,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1910
03:25:40,711 --> 03:25:41,971
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

1911
03:25:41,991 --> 03:25:43,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Eileen, I'm going to try to unmute you.

1912
03:25:43,432 --> 03:25:46,193
[SPEAKER_17]: And you'll have three minutes.

1913
03:25:47,353 --> 03:25:48,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

1914
03:25:49,834 --> 03:25:53,656
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1915
03:25:59,930 --> 03:26:16,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I have found the discussion extremely interesting and illuminating, and I've been trying to understand all sides of this disagreement.

1916
03:26:18,054 --> 03:26:25,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And because everybody here is well-intentioned,

1917
03:26:26,723 --> 03:26:30,045
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, there's no badness here.

1918
03:26:30,826 --> 03:26:33,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's trying to do the right thing.

1919
03:26:33,107 --> 03:26:41,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I think it's, it's the committee has done an amazing thing.

1920
03:26:42,634 --> 03:26:43,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing job.

1921
03:26:44,855 --> 03:26:45,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and

1922
03:26:47,519 --> 03:26:51,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so proud and they're so proud of their work and they should be.

1923
03:26:51,844 --> 03:26:54,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an exercise in democracy.

1924
03:26:54,468 --> 03:27:00,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And so part of me wants to be totally supportive of that.

1925
03:27:01,036 --> 03:27:06,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am in a way, but also I feel like we have to be flexible

1926
03:27:07,163 --> 03:27:13,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to listen to the concerns of people who might have a different point of view.

1927
03:27:13,825 --> 03:27:29,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really concerned about the woman who talked about, you know, the impact on racial minorities in our community and that it could be discriminatory.

1928
03:27:30,150 --> 03:27:34,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that's a reason not to vote for it, but I think

1929
03:27:36,199 --> 03:27:50,807
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing, whatever you guys decide, whatever gets passed, we definitely need to be thinking about equity and justice and doing the right thing.

1930
03:27:50,827 --> 03:27:54,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm confident in you.

1931
03:27:55,009 --> 03:27:58,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm confident that you will do the right thing for us.

1932
03:27:59,212 --> 03:28:02,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I just,

1933
03:28:04,627 --> 03:28:08,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been painful, but I think it's been healthy.

1934
03:28:09,109 --> 03:28:14,052
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly has put out the issues for people like me.

1935
03:28:14,852 --> 03:28:28,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been paying as much attention as I might have at one point, but I just wanna thank everybody and remind everybody that we're all trying to do the right thing.

1936
03:28:30,080 --> 03:28:30,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1937
03:28:32,662 --> 03:28:33,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Eileen.

1938
03:28:37,568 --> 03:28:38,448
[SPEAKER_17]: No more hands on Zoom.

1939
03:28:38,989 --> 03:28:40,449
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go back to the podium.

1940
03:28:40,469 --> 03:28:42,230
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

1941
03:28:42,250 --> 03:28:43,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Steven South, 106 Damon Road again.

1942
03:28:45,172 --> 03:28:46,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Bears.

1943
03:28:46,492 --> 03:28:50,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanna point out one thing I think is important.

1944
03:28:50,874 --> 03:29:01,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard many of the Councilors tonight cite anonymous research, conversations with scientists, lawyers.

1945
03:29:01,719 --> 03:29:06,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard Councilors talk about different studies and legal decisions.

1946
03:29:08,498 --> 03:29:14,343
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to point out and just like me, none of you are our attorneys, none of you are lawyers.

1947
03:29:15,363 --> 03:29:21,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was here years ago when it was a big to do I believe we were here till about 130 in the morning.

1948
03:29:22,590 --> 03:29:23,591
[SPEAKER_07]: regarding the budget.

1949
03:29:24,072 --> 03:29:27,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the biggest things was the council was fighting for legal representation.

1950
03:29:28,336 --> 03:29:36,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question is that before this goes gets voted on at the council before it gets sent to the mayor and sent to the state.

1951
03:29:38,187 --> 03:29:40,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the council plan to have

1952
03:29:41,227 --> 03:29:51,015
[SPEAKER_07]: these changes reviewed officially by an attorney, not conversations at a, you know, coffee shop or at work or something with someone, you know, that's an attorney.

1953
03:29:51,315 --> 03:30:05,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the city council plan to have this, all these changes officially reviewed by an attorney who works for the city or is contracted through the city to officially look at this and the legality of the changes.

1954
03:30:05,986 --> 03:30:09,069
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my concern.

1955
03:30:09,249 --> 03:30:09,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1956
03:30:09,962 --> 03:30:10,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1957
03:30:10,542 --> 03:30:13,503
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not 100% sure if it already has been.

1958
03:30:14,704 --> 03:30:21,367
[SPEAKER_17]: If the mayor involved the KP Law team at some point, they are currently serving as the acting city solicitor.

1959
03:30:23,287 --> 03:30:27,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly, sorry, if you'd like to respond.

1960
03:30:27,869 --> 03:30:37,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just ask, wouldn't that be important to know the answer to that before you vote on this here and vote on it officially at a council meeting and forward it to the mayor?

1961
03:30:38,054 --> 03:30:38,354
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

1962
03:30:39,800 --> 03:30:45,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be something that would be important to know, is this legal, everything that you're voting on before you vote on it.

1963
03:30:45,725 --> 03:30:45,965
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all.

1964
03:30:45,985 --> 03:30:46,325
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly.

1965
03:30:46,465 --> 03:30:50,728
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I 100% support this being reviewed by council.

1966
03:30:51,889 --> 03:30:59,075
[SPEAKER_17]: And in addition to council for the city, we have been told that will be reviewed by house and Senate council if it is submitted to the legislature.

1967
03:30:59,535 --> 03:31:01,757
[SPEAKER_17]: So there'd be at least two legal review processes.

1968
03:31:01,797 --> 03:31:06,400
[SPEAKER_17]: There may have already been another one, which is just, I just wanted to put that out there.

1969
03:31:06,480 --> 03:31:08,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if the mayor already did that once.

1970
03:31:10,614 --> 03:31:11,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

1971
03:31:11,354 --> 03:31:23,978
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that school committee council has looked at the school, the parts that would touch the school committee and school committee council is also looking, will be looking the next few days at it again.

1972
03:31:24,058 --> 03:31:25,359
[SPEAKER_17]: That's attorney Greenspan.

1973
03:31:25,399 --> 03:31:26,679
[SPEAKER_17]: He works for the Metro Public Schools.

1974
03:31:26,739 --> 03:31:26,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1975
03:31:27,219 --> 03:31:35,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say I have no objections to having more, you know, council look at it, but yeah, we, we have it built it into the,

1976
03:31:36,362 --> 03:31:37,183
[SPEAKER_13]: into the process.

1977
03:31:38,443 --> 03:31:46,907
[SPEAKER_13]: If the question is whether the substantive edits are legal, there are actually two Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court cases that are quite parallel.

1978
03:31:46,927 --> 03:31:51,449
[SPEAKER_13]: You just be Wellesley, and you will be rent bored.

1979
03:31:52,129 --> 03:31:53,370
[SPEAKER_13]: of Peabody, I believe.

1980
03:31:54,571 --> 03:32:01,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are similar cases with similar facts where the Supreme Court sided with their city or town councils.

1981
03:32:02,575 --> 03:32:02,995
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1982
03:32:03,775 --> 03:32:04,056
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1983
03:32:04,076 --> 03:32:07,958
[SPEAKER_17]: I see no further public comment in the chamber, if I'm correct.

1984
03:32:09,118 --> 03:32:09,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Len?

1985
03:32:10,359 --> 03:32:10,539
[SPEAKER_17]: No?

1986
03:32:12,120 --> 03:32:13,621
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't see any hands on Zoom.

1987
03:32:13,641 --> 03:32:15,682
[SPEAKER_17]: So that brings us back to the motion.

1988
03:32:15,702 --> 03:32:17,303
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion on the floor is

1989
03:32:20,605 --> 03:32:21,506
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a while here.

1990
03:32:27,029 --> 03:32:28,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we just want to read it out loud.

1991
03:32:28,790 --> 03:32:30,391
[SPEAKER_18]: No, don't worry.

1992
03:32:30,491 --> 03:32:31,471
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm saying that to Justin.

1993
03:32:34,273 --> 03:32:35,093
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll be right above that.

1994
03:32:37,595 --> 03:32:38,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Tomorrow.

1995
03:32:39,016 --> 03:32:39,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1996
03:32:43,658 --> 03:32:44,439
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's when it happened.

1997
03:32:45,199 --> 03:32:48,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but I didn't put the...

1998
03:32:50,075 --> 03:32:52,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Right above that there's a, oh, sorry.

1999
03:33:30,137 --> 03:33:30,517
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

2000
03:33:35,159 --> 03:33:45,624
[SPEAKER_17]: So there was a motion to sever and that was to vote on the motion to adopt the governance committee recommendations regarding the composition of the council.

2001
03:33:47,445 --> 03:33:53,388
[SPEAKER_17]: And just a reminder, a yes vote would have five at-large members and four district members.

2002
03:33:54,148 --> 03:34:01,371
[SPEAKER_17]: A no vote would revert to the initial recommendation of the study committee of eight ward members and three at-large members.

2003
03:34:06,193 --> 03:34:07,333
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm guessing we want a roll call.

2004
03:34:07,353 --> 03:34:08,374
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone want to request one?

2005
03:34:11,395 --> 03:34:11,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2006
03:34:11,815 --> 03:34:14,676
[SPEAKER_17]: A yes is for five at-large, four district.

2007
03:34:14,897 --> 03:34:23,080
[SPEAKER_17]: A no would not adopt the recommendation and would revert the language back to the initial proposal of eight ward and three at-large.

2008
03:34:25,463 --> 03:34:26,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a request for roll?

2009
03:34:26,603 --> 03:34:28,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll requested by Councilor Lazzaro.

2010
03:34:28,404 --> 03:34:29,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

2011
03:34:39,507 --> 03:34:42,288
[SPEAKER_19]: That was actually her motion because of the... Yes.

2012
03:34:42,908 --> 03:34:44,608
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a motion by Councilor Lazzaro.

2013
03:34:45,789 --> 03:34:49,970
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2014
03:34:57,728 --> 03:34:57,928
All right.

2015
03:35:03,250 --> 03:35:03,950
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Callahan.

2016
03:35:05,391 --> 03:35:06,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Collins.

2017
03:35:06,251 --> 03:35:06,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2018
03:35:07,892 --> 03:35:08,752
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2019
03:35:15,214 --> 03:35:15,534
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2020
03:35:17,495 --> 03:35:18,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Leming.

2021
03:35:18,075 --> 03:35:18,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2022
03:35:19,956 --> 03:35:20,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2023
03:35:20,936 --> 03:35:21,136
No.

2024
03:35:22,257 --> 03:35:22,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Tseng.

2025
03:35:24,172 --> 03:35:24,752
[SPEAKER_19]: President Bears?

2026
03:35:24,893 --> 03:35:27,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion is adopted.

2027
03:35:28,555 --> 03:35:34,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Next order of business is the motion to refer to the council for the next regular meeting agenda.

2028
03:35:34,680 --> 03:35:43,727
[SPEAKER_17]: The draft as amended by the Governance Committee with the technical amendments he outlined and with the amendment proposed by Councilor Scarpelli to include a residency requirement for multi-member bodies.

2029
03:35:45,215 --> 03:35:47,796
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a second on that motion from Vice President Collins.

2030
03:35:48,657 --> 03:35:54,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Would members of the council like the technical amendments read back?

2031
03:35:56,301 --> 03:35:58,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a request to read back the technical amendments?

2032
03:36:00,423 --> 03:36:07,146
[SPEAKER_17]: We will include them in the record of the committee report and they will be included in the red line draft that appears before the council at regular meetings.

2033
03:36:08,807 --> 03:36:11,128
[SPEAKER_17]: On that motion, is there any further discussion by members of the council?

2034
03:36:12,686 --> 03:36:15,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

2035
03:36:15,348 --> 03:36:19,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Public participation, you will provide your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

2036
03:36:19,470 --> 03:36:22,572
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's any public participation in the room, please approach the podium.

2037
03:36:23,072 --> 03:36:24,253
[SPEAKER_17]: There is one hand on Zoom.

2038
03:36:25,094 --> 03:36:28,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Eunice, I think you're Eunice Brown, and I hope so.

2039
03:36:28,516 --> 03:36:29,777
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not a Zoom bomber.

2040
03:36:30,457 --> 03:36:32,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Eunice, I'll ask you to unmute, and you'll have three minutes.

2041
03:36:33,839 --> 03:36:35,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

2042
03:36:36,733 --> 03:36:37,274
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, good evening.

2043
03:36:37,374 --> 03:36:38,876
[SPEAKER_20]: Eunice Brown Greenleaf Avenue.

2044
03:36:38,976 --> 03:36:39,777
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

2045
03:36:41,139 --> 03:36:48,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Full disclosure for those watching at home, I was a member of the Charter Study Committee and I have two questions.

2046
03:36:49,469 --> 03:36:49,569
[SPEAKER_20]: One,

2047
03:36:51,357 --> 03:37:08,090
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a section of the final report and charter that we did that was inadvertently left off of our final report and charter sent to the mayor and yourselves.

2048
03:37:08,770 --> 03:37:12,293
[SPEAKER_20]: And in that there was a section entitled public comment.

2049
03:37:12,493 --> 03:37:14,535
[SPEAKER_20]: It was to go into article nine.

2050
03:37:15,635 --> 03:37:19,939
[SPEAKER_20]: And it has since been sent to the mayor

2051
03:37:20,734 --> 03:37:35,056
[SPEAKER_20]: and I believe to Mr. Sang and possibly to you too, President Bears, I have not seen that section discussed at all in any way or voted on or

2052
03:37:36,143 --> 03:37:39,345
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, disposed with one way or the other.

2053
03:37:39,886 --> 03:37:43,388
[SPEAKER_20]: So my question is, what has happened to that?

2054
03:37:44,348 --> 03:37:46,710
[SPEAKER_20]: And do you want me to ask my second question?

2055
03:37:46,890 --> 03:37:49,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Or do you want to answer that and then go to my second question?

2056
03:37:50,112 --> 03:37:52,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, we'll hear your second question.

2057
03:37:52,614 --> 03:37:54,135
[SPEAKER_20]: That one is about the timeline.

2058
03:37:54,155 --> 03:37:57,717
[SPEAKER_20]: And you touched on that a little bit earlier.

2059
03:37:57,737 --> 03:37:58,858
[SPEAKER_20]: We know that

2060
03:38:00,657 --> 03:38:04,840
[SPEAKER_20]: The goal is to get this to the state legislature at the end of this month.

2061
03:38:05,580 --> 03:38:14,405
[SPEAKER_20]: So if I understand the process correctly, you are voting, you've already voted on one part, you're gonna vote on the amendments shortly.

2062
03:38:15,286 --> 03:38:26,313
[SPEAKER_20]: And then from there, you'll be voting on the entire, it goes to the council floor for next Tuesday's meeting to be voted on the council floor, is that correct?

2063
03:38:26,973 --> 03:38:27,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

2064
03:38:28,054 --> 03:38:28,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2065
03:38:28,945 --> 03:38:32,447
[SPEAKER_20]: And then from there, it goes to the mayor, correct?

2066
03:38:33,188 --> 03:38:33,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2067
03:38:34,429 --> 03:38:34,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2068
03:38:35,409 --> 03:38:52,280
[SPEAKER_20]: So there are, I've gone through with a fine tooth comb, the Charter Study Commission's version, comparing it to the mayor's and then comparing the mayor's version to the two red line documents that were in the packet for tonight.

2069
03:38:53,035 --> 03:39:01,962
[SPEAKER_20]: And there are clearly some discrepancies that being, you know, the big ones, the, what we just disposed of the word representation.

2070
03:39:01,982 --> 03:39:04,564
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor is chair of the school committee.

2071
03:39:05,960 --> 03:39:13,902
[SPEAKER_20]: And a lot of, you made a lot of changes to article eight, citizen participation, and she left that largely untouched, I believe.

2072
03:39:14,682 --> 03:39:18,923
[SPEAKER_20]: So, and then there were other bits and pieces as well that are discrepancies.

2073
03:39:19,683 --> 03:39:26,665
[SPEAKER_20]: So with a goal of getting this to the state legislature at the end of the month, what happens now?

2074
03:39:27,025 --> 03:39:31,466
[SPEAKER_20]: So it goes to the mayor next Wednesday, March 12th, and

2075
03:39:33,259 --> 03:39:40,604
[SPEAKER_20]: she takes a look at your work and decides what she's gonna do with it.

2076
03:39:40,765 --> 03:39:58,978
[SPEAKER_20]: And then if there's some negotiation back and forth and maybe you tweak something, then does that need to come back to the council floor for another vote or to a committee of the whole and then the council floor and so on and so on?

2077
03:40:01,150 --> 03:40:11,680
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there enough time to get all of this negotiation done and come up with something that you both agree on to get out shortly?

2078
03:40:11,700 --> 03:40:14,862
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a fair question.

2079
03:40:15,883 --> 03:40:19,046
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say that we did, I believe, accept all the edits that the mayor made.

2080
03:40:20,167 --> 03:40:23,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether she intends to do the same or not, that's up to her.

2081
03:40:26,145 --> 03:40:36,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, certainly if there is a significant further negotiation, there would be likely at least a need for another vote of the council at a regular meeting, probably another committee meeting.

2082
03:40:38,575 --> 03:40:40,776
[SPEAKER_17]: And that would probably move us past the March deadline.

2083
03:40:41,957 --> 03:40:45,079
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, because after next Tuesday, there's only one more.

2084
03:40:45,099 --> 03:40:52,225
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, you can call a meeting whenever you want, obviously, but according to the schedule, there's only one more regular meeting on the 25th.

2085
03:40:52,245 --> 03:40:54,446
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a pretty big deadline.

2086
03:40:56,183 --> 03:41:08,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly if the mayor were to return a draft to us two days after we sent it, we would try to schedule a committee or a special meeting to get something back on for the 25th that she could send out.

2087
03:41:08,751 --> 03:41:13,394
[SPEAKER_17]: But really that is up to her, how quickly she returns a response to us.

2088
03:41:13,634 --> 03:41:19,838
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if changes are needed, how quickly we can work through the differences.

2089
03:41:21,627 --> 03:41:24,670
[SPEAKER_17]: To your first question regarding the public comment.

2090
03:41:25,631 --> 03:41:33,619
[SPEAKER_17]: We have been considering the charter as submitted the language was sent to Councilor Tseng and was then sent.

2091
03:41:34,120 --> 03:41:37,123
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the public comment language that you mentioned is sent a chair saying.

2092
03:41:37,703 --> 03:41:40,084
[SPEAKER_17]: who through the clerk submitted it to the full council.

2093
03:41:41,485 --> 03:41:45,466
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was not submitted as part of the charter as drafted.

2094
03:41:46,847 --> 03:41:50,528
[SPEAKER_17]: And no Councilor raised an amendment to include it at any of our meetings.

2095
03:41:50,608 --> 03:41:51,788
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not included.

2096
03:41:53,809 --> 03:41:56,630
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you very, that's disappointing, but thank you very much.

2097
03:41:57,511 --> 03:41:57,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2098
03:41:59,731 --> 03:42:01,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion on the motion?

2099
03:42:05,238 --> 03:42:24,006
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Tseng, as seconded by Vice President Collins, to refer this to the Council for the next agenda, the draft as amended by the Governance Committee with the technical amendments outlined by Councilor Tseng, and with the amendment proposed by Councilor Scarpelli to include a residency requirement for multi-member bodies.

2100
03:42:25,467 --> 03:42:28,028
[SPEAKER_17]: Further comment, name and address, just give me.

2101
03:42:29,458 --> 03:42:30,879
[SPEAKER_22]: Donald 61 Monument Street.

2102
03:42:30,899 --> 03:42:31,640
[SPEAKER_22]: It's getting late.

2103
03:42:31,680 --> 03:42:32,301
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm very tired.

2104
03:42:32,341 --> 03:42:39,647
[SPEAKER_22]: So there, the committee, the language that Eunice just referred to was supposed to be in the draft charter.

2105
03:42:39,727 --> 03:42:42,249
[SPEAKER_22]: So technically, it should have been considered as part of it.

2106
03:42:42,369 --> 03:42:50,176
[SPEAKER_22]: But there was also language on residence requirement for multi-member boards that the committee crafted that got left off.

2107
03:42:50,436 --> 03:42:53,659
[SPEAKER_22]: We were very rushed at the end, as was previously mentioned.

2108
03:42:53,699 --> 03:42:54,580
[SPEAKER_22]: We had no staff.

2109
03:42:55,901 --> 03:43:25,488
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, we were trying to meet a deadline and and a couple of things fell off the radar But there is language that the committee created about a residency requirement from multi-member boards, which I sent Several weeks ago probably months uh to uh, councillor sang so I just want to say that thanks Yeah, and we had discussed it and then we said that counts I think we'll if we wherever we have that we'll run it by the collins center because there was also about to have the collins center draft it Maybe it just got lost in translation who had drafted it

2110
03:43:27,505 --> 03:43:28,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

2111
03:43:30,063 --> 03:43:38,146
[SPEAKER_13]: I, what I understood from earlier this meeting was that we take the language and present it for the regular meeting, just to give Councilors days, a few days to look over.

2112
03:43:38,166 --> 03:43:40,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that makes sense.

2113
03:43:40,847 --> 03:43:46,749
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some, some language from the CFC, but it's not the call center language.

2114
03:43:47,489 --> 03:43:53,331
[SPEAKER_17]: So we just have to make sure there will be language that goes into the draft for next week that has a residency requirement.

2115
03:43:53,872 --> 03:43:56,632
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's whatever its sources, it will be included.

2116
03:43:56,813 --> 03:43:57,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, right.

2117
03:43:59,574 --> 03:44:14,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, this is a bit of a curveball point, but it's something that came up between the last governance committee meeting on Article 8 and now, and I figured we're in a committee the whole meeting about this, so I might as well bring it up, float it around as an idea.

2118
03:44:16,458 --> 03:44:35,554
[SPEAKER_09]: A resident brought up the proposal to me that the free petition in section, I believe, or Article 8, Section 1, should not just be limited to registered voters, since there are also potentially non-voters.

2119
03:44:36,675 --> 03:44:42,720
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just going to throw out that I guarantee you the legislature would say that's an opening to things that they don't want to do around

2120
03:44:43,901 --> 03:44:47,563
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if anyone else has an opinion on that, but that's my read of the legislature.

2121
03:44:48,443 --> 03:44:52,584
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just something that I thought seemed like a good idea when it was brought up.

2122
03:44:52,604 --> 03:45:00,247
[SPEAKER_17]: In principle, I completely agree with you, but the non-citizen, the under 18, 16 plus voting legislature has been pretty cool to both of those.

2123
03:45:00,287 --> 03:45:09,191
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think they'd see anything in a charter that allows participation in the electoral process from non-registered voters would probably raise a flag for them.

2124
03:45:11,111 --> 03:45:12,332
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's just my opinion.

2125
03:45:13,283 --> 03:45:14,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other thoughts on that?

2126
03:45:14,723 --> 03:45:19,565
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's unfortunate.

2127
03:45:20,345 --> 03:45:20,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

2128
03:45:20,665 --> 03:45:27,347
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think it goes to the point that several Councilors have made about, you know, in an ideal world, we would be able to do so much more.

2129
03:45:27,367 --> 03:45:37,830
[SPEAKER_13]: And this, I believe, is a good product for a world where the state legislature does have, you know, restrictions on what cities can do.

2130
03:45:38,470 --> 03:45:38,991
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2131
03:45:39,791 --> 03:45:40,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2132
03:45:41,075 --> 03:45:43,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Eunice, is that an old hand or a new hand?

2133
03:45:49,437 --> 03:45:51,297
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just ask you to unmute in case it's new.

2134
03:45:53,777 --> 03:45:55,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, old hand, sorry.

2135
03:45:55,338 --> 03:45:56,418
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, thank you.
