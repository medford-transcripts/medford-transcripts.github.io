1
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:03,557
Hi, ma'am.

2
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:23,957
[SPEAKER_16]: uh

3
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:39,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please?

4
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:44,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Can everyone please step behind the yellow line?

5
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:06,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we have the elected officials here, please?

6
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:21,383
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on, classmate.

7
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:21,863
[SPEAKER_16]: How you doing?

8
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:38,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Stand in front of me.

9
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:41,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Turn around and wave to the camera.

10
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:42,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn around.

11
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:43,626
[SPEAKER_19]: The camera's over here.

12
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:49,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Mike Colombo, United States Marine Corps.

13
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:58,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And on behalf of Mayor Michael J. McQuinn and the elected officials of our community, I'd like to welcome you to the 83rd Day Ceremony.

14
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:02,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you all please stand to attention.

15
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:05,013
[SPEAKER_04]: As the 1st New Hampshire Regiment

16
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:07,670
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Revolutionary War of both colors.

17
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:19,061
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, Chief Sands will post the United States colors to the sound of the National Anthem.

18
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:25,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Company, present arms!

19
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:54,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome former World War II POW, former mayor of our community, City Councilor Alfred Pompeo.

20
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:12,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I am glad my comrades, auxiliaries, friends, this morning we are participating

21
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:14,438
[SPEAKER_02]: and a unique ceremony.

22
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:37,357
[SPEAKER_02]: The stars and stripes of our nation's banner of freedom, democracy, and courage is joined by the flag that symbolizes the sacrifice of America's prisoners of war and that of her unaccounted for heroes who remain on the roads of the missing in action.

23
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:41,140
[SPEAKER_02]: The flag raised is not a colorful flag,

24
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:43,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not an inspiring emblem.

25
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not intended to be.

26
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:50,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Black is the garb of mourners.

27
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:56,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the color of those who grieve for their lost ones.

28
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:06,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Returned POWs and all others still long for the news of those missing in action.

29
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:11,794
[SPEAKER_02]: On this somber black flag is a profiled head,

30
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:29,294
[SPEAKER_02]: that once was held proudly high, that once stood stalwart against the enemy, but now vowed it is the portrayal of a crestfallen captive under the watchful eye of his tower guard.

31
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:37,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the image of an American serviceman who has been stripped of all dignity and self-respect.

32
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,343
[SPEAKER_02]: The POWMIA flag

33
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:52,886
[SPEAKER_02]: is a stark and haunting reminder of man's inhumanity to man and a nation's pledge that their POWs and MIAs will never be forgotten.

34
00:07:54,427 --> 00:08:03,293
[SPEAKER_02]: To submit to the enemy, to surrender in battle, is a decision arrived at when no alternative remains.

35
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:10,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting down one's arms when to resist is futile is to acknowledge

36
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:14,072
[SPEAKER_02]: that discretion is the better part of valor.

37
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:36,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Forced marches, torturous interrogations, unfit living conditions, rodent-ridden camps, life-infested bodies, starvation, dysentery, disease, and death for all the companions of prisoners of war.

38
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:40,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Life in the Stalags, the German prison camps,

39
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:47,789
[SPEAKER_02]: like all other war prison camps, was a psychological as well as a physiological ordeal.

40
00:08:49,069 --> 00:09:01,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Coping with confinement and boredom in a barbed wire compound tested one's will not to succumb to depression and self-pity.

41
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:06,815
[SPEAKER_02]: While incarceration was made more tolerable

42
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,644
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about mother's home-cooked meals, many found it helpful not to be too proud to pray.

43
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:21,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Survival, it seems, was as much reliant on faith as on food.

44
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Prisoners of war knew that America would prevail against her enemies.

45
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:32,456
[SPEAKER_02]: They never doubted their nation's resolve to effect their liberation.

46
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:37,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, while mindful that their country would not abandon them,

47
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:41,679
[SPEAKER_02]: many petitioned for help from a higher authority.

48
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:49,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, they humbly confess that it was amazing grace that set them free.

49
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on in.

50
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:59,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over there to the fire alarm.

51
00:09:59,767 --> 00:09:59,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Warned!

52
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:01,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire alarms!

53
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:05,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the POW MIA ceremony here at City Hall.

54
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:17,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask at this point that you allow the 1st New Hampshire Regiment and the Memphis High School Band to lead all those present to the ceremony as we honor our revolutionary heroes.

55
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:19,637
[SPEAKER_04]: At the scope.

56
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Form up, march on.

57
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:29,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Company, to the right, face.

58
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,687
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to catch my patience.

59
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:46,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, my name is John McNair, and I'll be honored to admit to Allied Veterans Council, and Kimberly Floreno, Director of Veterans Services here in the City of Medford, we welcome you to another phase of our Patriot's Day celebration.

60
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:50,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Our re-invocation is morning.

61
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:57,147
[SPEAKER_05]: said by Reverend Dr. Adelaide Everson of the Westminster Catholic Church.

62
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:03,290
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Everson.

63
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:03,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Let us pray.

64
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:18,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Eternal God of the past, present, and future, Lord of history, through whose power men have won their freedom,

65
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:24,582
[SPEAKER_05]: To thy justice be held a vision of a righteous nation.

66
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:34,931
[SPEAKER_05]: To thy will lay down their lives to dedication in the purchase of liberty.

67
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,995
[SPEAKER_05]: We are mindful of the heritage which is ours.

68
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:47,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Help us to be worthy to stand in this place of hallowed ground.

69
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:59,434
[SPEAKER_05]: men and women of the Revolution who were buried here and whose memory we honor today.

70
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:07,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And all men and women who have given of themselves to serve their nation.

71
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us who came here this day.

72
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:24,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope with my whole body to be steadfast in service, unwavering in fulfilling the task we gave before.

73
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:41,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And in satisfying dedication, may our hearts and minds sing with the liberty of the song we love, and may the prayer come to be, my country's destiny,

74
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:45,159
[SPEAKER_05]: sweet land of liberty.

75
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Of thee I will sing.

76
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:53,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Long may thy light be bright, with freedom's holy light.

77
00:18:54,407 --> 00:19:00,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Protect us with thy might, great God, our King.

78
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:03,314
[SPEAKER_05]: In thy holy name we pray.

79
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:04,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

80
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Ferguson.

81
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen,

82
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:27,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael J. McClendon, here to receive the proclamation issued by His Excellency Governor William F. Weld.

83
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:28,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.

84
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:35,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here to issue this proclamation by His Excellency Governor William F. Weld.

85
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:39,131
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at April 19th, 1775, at a profound bearing on the history of our nation,

86
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:57,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas on that day, three famous patriots, Paul Revere, William Dodd, and Dr. Samuel Prescott rose through the night to warn fellow colonists that British troops had been assembled and were coming with the intention of capturing the colonists' leaders and seizing their supplies.

87
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:06,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas answering that alarm, men and women congregated on the village green in Lexington on the morning of April 19, 1775,

88
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,856
[SPEAKER_06]: took up arms and commenced the struggle that would end with the colonies independent from England.

89
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:15,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And where is the shark heard around the world?

90
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:42,003
[SPEAKER_06]: was fired in pocket by determined patriots from the Middlesex countryside who confronted the Red Coast and ultimately forced the British to turn back at the North Bridge, and whereas joining forces along the battle road at Menominee, now known as Arlington, men and men, militia and colonists from cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth decided to go repulse and excrete the British, and whereas it is appropriate

91
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:53,106
[SPEAKER_06]: that all Massachusetts citizens recognize the importance of this day in our history and pay tribute to the dedicated people who fought at the military in Lexington on that decisive day.

92
00:20:53,566 --> 00:21:09,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, therefore, I, William S. Wells, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, do hereby proclaim April 19, 1995 as Patriot's Day and observe April 18, 1895 as a day of celebration and urge the citizens of the Commonwealth

93
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:21,068
[SPEAKER_06]: take cognizance of this event by paying tribute to these valiant individuals of Massachusetts, and by recognizing their loyalty, courage, and dedication to our priceless heritage of freedom.

94
00:21:21,508 --> 00:21:27,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Given to the Executive Chamber, William F. Weld Governor, William F. Gallivan, Secretary of the Commonwealth.

95
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:36,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, a beautiful story for you.

96
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with the three of you seen in your uniform,

97
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,212
[SPEAKER_05]: fate of all of us.

98
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:24,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

99
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:31,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the Medford City Council, the Honorable Robin A. Good morning.

100
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:41,701
[SPEAKER_03]: We are again privileged this morning to gather here at the Salem Street Burying Ground to renew a tradition and to fulfill an imperative obligation.

101
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:49,025
[SPEAKER_03]: That of paying homage to the early settlers of our community who on that fateful April day in 1775 sent forth 59 brave men

102
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,501
[SPEAKER_03]: to join in the battle of Lexington and Concord.

103
00:23:56,521 --> 00:24:06,804
[SPEAKER_03]: The men of Penton Company and the volunteers that they picked up along the way joined with Reading Company and fought the British at Marion's Corner in Lexington.

104
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:09,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of the 59 gave the allowance to the cause.

105
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:20,708
[SPEAKER_03]: In today's society, there are those who claim that patriotism is out of fashion, that to remember the deeds and the sacrifices of those who founded, who built,

106
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,182
[SPEAKER_03]: and whoever offended this free nation of ours is to say the least, passe.

107
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:32,126
[SPEAKER_03]: But we in Memphis continue to meet for that purpose as we do this morning.

108
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:42,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to our historical, veterans, and scout organizations, and to the efforts of caring individuals to take this day duly observed with appropriate ceremonies in our community.

109
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:46,474
[SPEAKER_03]: To them, I offer our thanks for their dedication to take this day.

110
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:48,996
[SPEAKER_03]: As citizens of the community,

111
00:24:49,698 --> 00:25:05,905
[SPEAKER_03]: that is blessed with such a rich heritage, a history that is unsurpassed by any locality, we remember with deep pride and venerate with lasting appreciation the men who answered with gallantry the call to violence at the beginning of the wall for American independence.

112
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:08,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Those patriots were the giants of the time.

113
00:25:10,747 --> 00:25:18,190
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we not be proud as we look with lasting respect to that great pyramid that stands at the center of this burial ground?

114
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:20,860
[SPEAKER_03]: a monument that honors General John Wilkes.

115
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: As a young man, he was among those who took up arms on April 19th.

116
00:25:26,844 --> 00:25:36,750
[SPEAKER_03]: His service in Lexington was but an early page in a long and distinguished career as a soldier, a physician, a public servant, and as a respected citizen.

117
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:45,975
[SPEAKER_03]: We would be remiss as a community if we failed to remember people like John Wilkes, forbearers who stand out so boldly in Memphis history.

118
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:48,317
[SPEAKER_03]: A friendly comrade of George Washington,

119
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:56,272
[SPEAKER_03]: John Brooks went on to achieve the rank of Major General, and as a public servant, he served the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as its governor.

120
00:25:57,113 --> 00:26:03,094
[SPEAKER_03]: To this day, he remains the only Bedford resident to have ever served in the state's highest office, its governorship.

121
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:12,958
[SPEAKER_03]: That grand monument was erected in 1838, eight years following his death, by some very proud citizens of the then small town of Bedford.

122
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,959
[SPEAKER_03]: The inscription on that monument is vivid in telling us

123
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: why that great patriot was so widely known, so highly honored, and so truly beloved.

124
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:31,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It reads, sacred to the memory of John Brooks, who was born in that visit in May of 1752, and educated at the town school.

125
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:37,240
[SPEAKER_03]: He took up arms for his country on the ancient day of April, 1775.

126
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:44,002
[SPEAKER_03]: He commanded a regiment which first entered the enemy's lines in Saratoga, and served with honor to the end of the war.

127
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:58,819
[SPEAKER_03]: He was appointed Marshal of the District of Massachusetts by President Washington, and after filling several important civic and military offices, he was, in the year 1816, chosen Governor of Commonwealth and discharged the duties of Asst.

128
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:02,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Station to seven successive years to General Acceptance.

129
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:13,762
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a kind and skillful physician, a brave and prudent officer, a wise, firm, and impartial magistrate, a true patriot, a good citizen, and a faithful friend.

130
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:26,212
[SPEAKER_03]: In his vanity as a gentleman, a moral cure, and in the profession and practice of a consistent Christian, he departed this life in peace on the 1st of March, 1825, aged 73.

131
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:33,616
[SPEAKER_03]: This monument to his honor and memory was erected by several of his fellow citizens and friends in the year 1838.

132
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:42,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who penned that inscription and erected that monument, I am confident, fully expected, that those who follow them in the future decades

133
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,713
[SPEAKER_03]: would continue to perpetuate the memories of men and women like General Brooks.

134
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:54,318
[SPEAKER_03]: People who played such a prominent role in the history of veteran, and of Massachusetts, and yes, of the United States.

135
00:27:55,339 --> 00:28:03,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, 157 years after the dedication of the Brooks Monument on this April morning in 1995, we do just that.

136
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:09,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to remember with pride and an appreciation of our heritage.

137
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It slew not only the 59 men of veteran company,

138
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:28,083
[SPEAKER_03]: who my collection can not only have recurred citizen soldier John Brooks, but all men and women who have followed them for more than two centuries, bravely and resolutely answering the call to arms whenever the freedom of our nation has been at risk.

139
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:38,489
[SPEAKER_03]: In remembering their deeds and their sacrifices, each of us can better appreciate what we enjoy in times of peace, the many bounties that arise as a free people.

140
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:40,370
[SPEAKER_03]: On this great crusade,

141
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:44,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming this year is the season of Easter and Passover.

142
00:28:44,890 --> 00:29:00,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us ask God to bless our community of Bethlehem and to bless the United States of America.

143
00:29:00,858 --> 00:29:01,158
Thank you.

144
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:18,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

145
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:27,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now decorate the graves of those ages who are buried in this particular cemetery.

146
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,684
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, there is another cemetery in the city of Medford where many others who fought in the Revolutionary War are buried.

147
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:42,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And in honoring those here today, we also honor those Medford residents who are buried

148
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:54,836
[SPEAKER_05]: cemetery alone in our com down the entire 13 homes by the Girl Scouts and C while they were doing so, K

149
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:00,342
[SPEAKER_05]: stand under it.

150
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:08,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, there are not only Manchurians, a.k.a.

151
00:33:08,424 --> 00:33:11,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Seward, buried in this particular graveyard.

152
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:20,886
[SPEAKER_05]: There are 0.7 members of the First Manchurian Regiment who were buried in a common grave to my immediate left.

153
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:25,127
[SPEAKER_05]: The engraving is marked by a plain stone.

154
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Those men who were buried in that grave

155
00:33:29,971 --> 00:33:34,413
[SPEAKER_05]: were killed in the battle of Conquered Hill.

156
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:40,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are very honored to have with us this morning members of the 1st Commandant's Regiment.

157
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:52,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to introduce to you, Captain Joseph Stokes, who is the standing officer of the 1st Commandant's Regiment of D-Mass.

158
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,382
[SPEAKER_05]: As we conclude D-Mass, the 1st Commandant's Regiment will decorate and decorate.

159
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:59,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain Stokes.

160
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:02,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

161
00:34:03,493 --> 00:34:10,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to thank Mayor McLennan and the citizens of Edgewood for inviting us to come here today to honor the fallen heroes who've been injured.

162
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,587
[SPEAKER_05]: As we reminded earlier the POWs of the suffering of POWs, in a sense

163
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,811
[SPEAKER_05]: These men are the ultimate fear-fighters.

164
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:28,073
[SPEAKER_05]: They left their homes, their families, their farms, to fight for 20 years and have never returned.

165
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:38,716
[SPEAKER_05]: The Crescent General Regiment has come to fight as a menace, as it was performed on Muskegon shortly after the Battles of Lexington and Congress.

166
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:46,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was on June 17th that they marched from that day to fortify their battle, throwing up the night before on Greece Day.

167
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:55,531
[SPEAKER_05]: They took up positions along a split metal fence and stone wall to the beach, and they withstood two furious attacks, and it was a battle.

168
00:34:56,452 --> 00:35:07,760
[SPEAKER_05]: When the third shot finally carried the result, John Stock formed his men behind the result and allowed them to retreat in an orderly manner and not be massacred by British troops coming up the hill.

169
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:18,602
[SPEAKER_05]: The last man killed at Bunker Hill was Nathan McClary, who was struck by a cannonball as he crossed the broadway trying to get to Somerville.

170
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:21,204
[SPEAKER_05]: He was also from New Hampshire.

171
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:27,530
[SPEAKER_05]: It appears from irony that the first man killed at Bunker Hill was also struck by a cannonball.

172
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,192
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Asa Pollock of Bill River.

173
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:34,797
[SPEAKER_05]: The first man to ride in a horn from there could fight many gods.

174
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:48,828
[SPEAKER_05]: It was finally discharged to New Berkeley Art in 1783, thus making it the longest-serving ribbon in the Revolutionary War.

175
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:51,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Class of 18, please separate your class and grades.

176
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:29,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your service.

177
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:43,447
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please collect them by the line at the end.

178
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:40,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Our benediction will be offered this morning.

179
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:51,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I pledge the presence of Her Majesty's Kingdom.

180
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

181
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:05,162
[SPEAKER_17]: On this beautiful morning, I'd like to share a blessing in honor of all the beautiful brave men and women buried here at the Salish Creek burial ground.

182
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:13,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Ubi caritas, ami, amor, ubi caritas, deus ex machina.

183
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:18,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Beloved, where God is, there is love.

184
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:24,627
[SPEAKER_17]: And God is right here today through the faith of our fathers and our mothers.

185
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:29,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Let us bow our heads for the benediction.

186
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:34,430
[SPEAKER_17]: And now, gracious God, our father, may God bless you,

187
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:39,360
[SPEAKER_17]: May his face shine upon you and be gracious unto you.

188
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:43,844
[SPEAKER_17]: May the God lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.

189
00:38:44,044 --> 00:38:49,148
[SPEAKER_17]: In the name of the Trinity, God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, amen.

190
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:53,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Reverend King.

191
00:38:54,392 --> 00:39:02,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to be honoring our fallen heroes with a ceremonial salute.

192
00:39:04,154 --> 00:39:09,657
[SPEAKER_05]: The first will be spawned by Code 45 American Legion firing squad.

193
00:39:10,477 --> 00:39:16,240
[SPEAKER_05]: The second will be spawned by the 1st Commandant's Sheriff's Regiment of Public Affairs.

194
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:25,225
[SPEAKER_05]: The third will be spawned by the 1st Commandant's Sheriff's Regiment of Public Affairs.

195
00:39:25,845 --> 00:39:30,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's located immediately outside the

196
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,482
[SPEAKER_05]: because that will be followed after the canon.

197
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:42,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be followed by deaths, by dropped landings, and post-45 emergencies.

198
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:09,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Handle turkey.

199
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:17,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Charge turkey.

200
00:41:17,236 --> 00:41:19,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Rim turkey.

201
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:52,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Ready for next?

202
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:53,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Fire.

203
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:55,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Ready for next?

204
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,320
Fire.

205
00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:17,193
Hey, Joe.

206
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:49,385
[SPEAKER_11]: How are ya?

207
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:50,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy Patriots Day.

208
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:51,306
[SPEAKER_11]: You too.

209
00:42:51,606 --> 00:42:53,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Patriots Day.

210
00:42:53,987 --> 00:43:07,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Right over here.

211
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:10,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the big sign?

212
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:12,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

213
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:13,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the big sign?

214
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,872
I probably will.

215
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:01,398
[SPEAKER_17]: well they have them all

216
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:58,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to start taking pictures.

217
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:33,996
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is John Sardone.

218
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:36,437
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the past commander of the Disabled Vets here at Meffitt.

219
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:41,018
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is one wonderful ceremony that they have every year.

220
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:50,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Patriot Day means a lot to the veterans because veterans go back as far back as the Boxer Rebellions years ago.

221
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:53,882
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is quite an event that takes place each and every year.

222
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:59,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And my name is Tom McCartney, Post 45 American Legion.

223
00:49:59,992 --> 00:50:09,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to be here to celebrate this great event and glad to see so many people here enjoying this thing.

224
00:50:10,603 --> 00:50:11,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

225
00:50:11,604 --> 00:50:12,445
[SPEAKER_12]: God love you all.

226
00:50:13,766 --> 00:50:14,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

227
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:59,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Marcia Caron, Coordinator of Fine Arts for the Public Schools.

228
00:54:00,283 --> 00:54:05,548
[SPEAKER_01]: We're glad to be here today on this beautiful sunny day and we love participating in the Patriot's Day Parade.

229
00:54:05,568 --> 00:54:09,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that I'm very proud of the Medford High School Band and Color Guard.

230
00:54:09,932 --> 00:54:11,193
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done a lot this year.

231
00:54:11,274 --> 00:54:12,535
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very happy to have them.

232
00:54:13,563 --> 00:54:15,064
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had such a successful year.

233
00:54:15,104 --> 00:54:16,185
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very proud of them.

234
00:54:16,205 --> 00:54:20,288
[SPEAKER_01]: They've just participated in an exchange concert with Tingsboro High School Band.

235
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:24,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And coming up on May 13th, we're hoping Channel 3 will be there.

236
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:29,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Mo Vaughn is coming to be guest conductor and he's going to make an appearance with the Medford High School Band.

237
00:54:29,435 --> 00:54:33,458
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very happy to have him and we look forward to seeing you all there.

238
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,719
[SPEAKER_01]: 7.30, Medford High School Cage.

239
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,741
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that can park in the square now is Paul Revere and his men.

240
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:44,125
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so we can win the war and go to Lexington.

241
00:54:46,388 --> 00:54:46,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye now.

242
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:48,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Good afternoon.

243
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:54,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to congratulate everybody on this excellent ceremony today.

244
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:56,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's wonderful to bring back

245
00:54:57,405 --> 00:55:01,546
[SPEAKER_11]: the Patriot Day activities for our younger generation.

246
00:55:02,126 --> 00:55:09,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And at this time, I'd like to introduce our past president of the Gold Star, Mother Anne Swain.

247
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:19,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Hannaford, past president of the American Legion Auxiliary, Unit 45.

248
00:55:22,923 --> 00:55:29,244

249
00:55:32,025 --> 00:55:37,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Ann Dean, its treasurer of the American Legion Auxiliary, Unit 45.

250
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:47,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Dolores Cicero-Lewis-Shy, and I'm Marion Daly, president

251
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:52,564
[SPEAKER_11]: of the American Legion Auxiliary Unit 45 and everybody have a wonderful day.

252
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:26,433
He is saving us.

253
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:58,434
Who is it, and what do you want?

254
00:59:59,314 --> 01:00:02,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, sir, the raider's coming out.

255
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:05,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Lay him on the floor.

256
01:00:05,878 --> 01:00:06,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

257
01:00:06,499 --> 01:00:09,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Come in.

258
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:26,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Allison.

259
01:00:58,835 --> 01:00:58,915
just

260
01:01:28,905 --> 01:01:29,106
Hey!

261
01:01:29,348 --> 01:01:29,490
Hey!

262
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:49,793
sure let me walk down with him

263
01:03:20,247 --> 01:03:20,327
Yeah.

264
01:03:52,782 --> 01:03:53,603
see that's the way they were dressed

265
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:24,647
How do you do?

266
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:26,348
Check it out.

267
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:42,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Good morning.

268
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:53,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to welcome everybody here for the re-enactment of the Midnight Ride.

269
01:05:54,037 --> 01:06:02,860
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, I'd like to call upon our senior at the high school, Alicia Indichati, who will recite the Midnight Ride.

270
01:06:14,299 --> 01:06:24,063
[SPEAKER_14]: On an eighteenth of April, he set up his fire, proudly danced, smiled, and said, I'm going to stay here.

271
01:06:24,363 --> 01:06:26,264
[SPEAKER_14]: He set up his friend.

272
01:06:26,884 --> 01:06:35,988
[SPEAKER_14]: In Cabrita Park, where I am standing from the top to the ninth, he hanged a lantern clock in the middle of the park, on the north shore of the tower, at a sitting point.

273
01:06:37,046 --> 01:06:45,070
[SPEAKER_14]: One was my name, and two was my sleep.

274
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:52,253
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, on the opposite shore of the morning, read to her I was writing a love, with every word that I knew in a thought, a little happy poem to be up in her tongue.

275
01:06:53,454 --> 01:06:59,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Then he said, good night, and with a muffled whore, silently rode to the top of the shore.

276
01:07:00,525 --> 01:07:21,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Just as the moon rose over the bay, when swinging wide as her moorings lay, the Somerset, British men of war, a phantom ship, with each mast in spout, across the moon like a prison barge, in a huge black hulk that was magnified by its own reflection in the tide.

277
01:07:21,494 --> 01:07:27,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwhile, his friend, the alley and street, wanders and watches with eager ears.

278
01:07:27,995 --> 01:07:41,283
[SPEAKER_15]: So in the silence around him he hears the muster of men at the barrack door, the sound of arms and the trance of feet, and the measured tread of the grenadiers marching down to the boats on the shore.

279
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:53,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church by the wooden stairs, the stealthy trench, the velvety chamber overhead, and startled the pigeons from their perch.

280
01:07:53,931 --> 01:08:13,354
[SPEAKER_15]: on the somber rafters that round him gave, masses of moving shapes of shade, by the trembling ladder, deep and tall, to the highest window in the wall, where he paused to listen and look down, a moment on the roofs of the town, and the moonlight glowing over all.

281
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:34,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Beneath in the churchyard lay the dead, in their night encampment on the hill, wrapped in silence, so deep and still, that he could hear, like a sentinel's trend, the watchful night wind as it went, creeping along from tent to tent, and seeming to whisper, all is well.

282
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:42,618
[SPEAKER_15]: A moment only reveals the spell of the place and the hour and the secret dread of the lonely belfry and the dead,

283
01:08:43,473 --> 01:08:57,118
[SPEAKER_15]: But suddenly, all his thoughts are bent on a shadowy someplace far away, where the river widens to meet the bay, a line of flat that bends and floats on the rising tide like a bridge of boats.

284
01:08:57,158 --> 01:09:05,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwhile, impatience now derives, scooted and spurred with a heavy stride, on the opposite shore, to what far reveals.

285
01:09:14,002 --> 01:09:15,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, great job.

286
01:09:15,383 --> 01:09:28,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I introduce our guest of honor, I want to introduce one other person here, a great note, 83 years young just recently, the original Paul Revere for many years, General Dino DeCarlo, if you could take a bow.

287
01:09:28,232 --> 01:09:38,279
[SPEAKER_07]: General, thanks for being here.

288
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:43,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I'd like to introduce the General's grandson, Paul Revere.

289
01:09:51,995 --> 01:09:55,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great to see a big crowd here, but I must go on.

290
01:09:56,338 --> 01:10:12,769
[SPEAKER_09]: The lights are dimmed to warn the rest of the people that the British are coming, and off we conquer.

291
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:14,630
Thank you.

292
01:10:19,095 --> 01:10:19,696
Thank you.

293
01:10:19,776 --> 01:10:20,917
Lisa, go right that way.

294
01:10:20,977 --> 01:10:22,439
I've got to get you to the right job.

295
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:22,659
Set us up.

296
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:57,399
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to stay back.

297
01:10:57,579 --> 01:11:00,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank everybody for coming today.

298
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:08,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to thank the 1st Regiment in New Hampshire for traveling all the way down to join with us today.

299
01:11:08,284 --> 01:11:10,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It's certainly added to our festivities.

300
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:23,550
[SPEAKER_07]: We also want to thank Sergeant Mike Palumbo, who was detached here from the Pentagon earlier this week to ensure the safety of Paul Revere and his riding crew.

301
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:24,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Sarge.

302
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:32,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but not least, Kenny Gaffney for the constant talent that he shows to all of us every year.

303
01:11:33,073 --> 01:11:40,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Gaffney.

304
01:12:14,358 --> 01:12:14,818
Thank you very much.

305
01:12:39,907 --> 01:12:42,971
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful day here in Medford Square on this Patriots Day.

306
01:12:43,312 --> 01:12:46,616
[SPEAKER_10]: We had Paul Revere come on down and say hello and warn us.

307
01:12:47,177 --> 01:12:49,099
[SPEAKER_10]: And look at, this is great.

308
01:12:49,139 --> 01:12:50,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's having a great day.

309
01:13:16,579 --> 01:13:16,659
The.
