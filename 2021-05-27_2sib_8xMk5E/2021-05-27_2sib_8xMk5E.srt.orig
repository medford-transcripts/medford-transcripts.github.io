1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi everyone, I'm unable to rename myself.

2
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:16,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if I can have that access, that capability.

3
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:20,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I'm just going through right now and making.

4
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:22,556
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm unable to rename myself.

5
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:24,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

6
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:26,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that was the YouTube feed in the background.

7
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:30,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am actually going through right now and making everybody code.

8
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I miss anyone, just let me know, but that should just take a few minutes.

9
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:38,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

10
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:58,795
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll just chime in while that's happening to say that I'm on a phone and in a car.

11
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:04,036
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I'll be in transit for some portion of things.

12
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:11,239
[SPEAKER_21]: And I might pop in and back out or pop out and back in at some point and switch devices.

13
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:13,860
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in the same boat.

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,701
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to mute myself because I

15
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:25,848
[SPEAKER_16]: just think it would be best to mute myself and not show myself driving, but I am here.

16
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:28,249
[SPEAKER_16]: So I feel you.

17
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:30,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Be safe.

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody be careful.

19
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:40,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Melissa and Lee, I'll actually be on the same track you are right now, probably in the car, on the phone.

20
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:44,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Won't be my first time running a Zoom from that type of situation.

21
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:06,603
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

22
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:08,064
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we got pretty good 18.

23
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:09,265
[SPEAKER_19]: I count.

24
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:11,466
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll take attendance first.

25
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:14,847
[SPEAKER_19]: Three brothers.

26
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:16,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

27
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Puccio present.

[SPEAKER_19]: Aaron.

31
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:28,394
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

32
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Beth Fuller.

33
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:35,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Grace Caldera.

34
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:37,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Aaron just logged on.

35
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:38,297
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

36
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:40,018
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

37
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:44,842
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, grace here and Aaron, are you there?

38
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:45,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me?

39
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:48,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

40
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:48,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

41
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:49,245
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

42
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,147
[SPEAKER_19]: Ken Mallon.

43
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:52,107
[SPEAKER_19]: I see here.

44
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Kristen Scalise here.

45
00:02:59,093 --> 00:02:59,453
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

46
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:01,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Laura Tolo.

47
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:02,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

48
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:05,097
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Lee, you're on the phone.

49
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:05,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Lila Fleur.

50
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:08,089
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I'm here.

51
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:09,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Lou and Tapa.

52
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, sir.

53
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:12,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Maria Rosha.

54
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:13,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

55
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:17,917
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, listen, Miguel, you're on the phone also.

56
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:21,400
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

57
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,800
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

58
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:24,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Patrick McCabe president.

59
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:32,069
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, then I don't, I think he's going to be a few minutes late.

60
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:33,450
[SPEAKER_19]: Ron.

61
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,971
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw Ron here.

62
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:37,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Seth Hill, I heard Seth.

63
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:38,999
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here.

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,180
[SPEAKER_19]: Kathy Kang.

65
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,141
[SPEAKER_19]: I see Kathy Kang.

66
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:42,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Present.

67
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Matt Abistro.

68
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:46,483
[SPEAKER_25]: Here.

69
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:49,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Caitlin Shaughnessy.

70
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:54,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Caitlin?

71
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:55,127
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

72
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:57,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Janelle Garland McKenzie.

73
00:03:58,308 --> 00:03:58,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Here.

74
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:00,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Josie DeFore.

75
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.

76
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

77
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:03,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

78
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:04,851
[SPEAKER_19]: And Jim Lister here.

79
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:05,572
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

80
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:05,992
[SPEAKER_19]: So we got,

81
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:07,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Two people missing.

82
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,699
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, call the meeting to order.

83
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Has everyone had a chance to look at the minutes of the previous meeting?

84
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:21,909
[SPEAKER_19]: Any changes, insertions, something that's not right?

85
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:27,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I have two things that I believe need to be corrected in the record.

86
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:30,536
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, Pat.

87
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:37,880
[SPEAKER_26]: First one is on page two, the fifth comment down.

88
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:43,485
[SPEAKER_26]: For me, for my comment, I believe I said recanted, not receded.

89
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you just send me the changes, Patrick?

90
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:53,293
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just easier if you can just email me the changes, because I'll have to make them over the weekend.

91
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,253
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

92
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:54,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

93
00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:00,832
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the second one, I wanna make sure it's not my words, it's Jim's words.

94
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:07,516
[SPEAKER_26]: Melissa had asked the question about why the number 12 was significant.

95
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:11,498
[SPEAKER_26]: And I believe Jim said that 12 was a majority of the committee.

96
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,841
[SPEAKER_26]: The notes say that 12 was the max score on the rubric, but do you remember that Jim?

97
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:18,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

98
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:22,264
[SPEAKER_19]: So you were saying 12 was- That was, because the question was if they got 12 votes,

99
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:25,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would they go to the final three?

100
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Because 12 is the majority.

101
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:27,023
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

102
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:28,063
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

103
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:29,103
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what I remembered.

104
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:30,663
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'll send those to you, Lisa.

105
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:31,483
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

106
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,084
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

107
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:32,464
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

108
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:34,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody else on the minutes?

109
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:38,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I get a motion to accept the minutes?

110
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:47,106
[SPEAKER_19]: The amendments and seconded all those in favor.

111
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,427
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

112
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:50,167
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone opposed?

113
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:50,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

114
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:53,517
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I have a couple of letters to read.

115
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:56,920
[SPEAKER_19]: First is from the teachers.

116
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:21,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Dear Columbus School Renaming Committee, as staff members of the Columbus Elementary School, many of whom are current or former Medford residents, we wish to thank you for the hard work and commitment that you have given to finding a name that truly embraces the spirit of learning, kindness, and diversity that is the Columbus School community.

117
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:28,130
[SPEAKER_19]: We know that is a very difficult task and I'm grateful that you gave your time and effort to the endeavor.

118
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:40,833
[SPEAKER_19]: As the selection of a name draws near, the debate over the best name has become more heated, including a Tuesday city council meeting in the patch and on social media.

119
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:46,614
[SPEAKER_19]: How can a name truly describe a community of diverse learners and unique individuals?

120
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Clearly many in Medford wish to select a name

121
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:54,170
[SPEAKER_19]: that they feel prioritizes the values that are important to them.

122
00:06:55,151 --> 00:07:05,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Many of us can't help but feel saddened that the name of a place that we associate with joy, growth, and learning has become a topic of anger or frustration for anyone.

123
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:17,405
[SPEAKER_19]: It can also be hard to accept that there may be people with few to no ties to the school have strong opinions about its naming for reasons of individual politics.

124
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:32,783
[SPEAKER_19]: As teachers frequently strive to find balance between the needs and wants of many individuals, one way to achieve balance with regards to renaming would be to steer away from the practice of renaming the school after an individual.

125
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:42,888
[SPEAKER_19]: No human is perfect, and it seems unfair to debate the merits of people who do not seek to be honored in this way, despite how well-intentioned the honor is.

126
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,191
[SPEAKER_19]: And who cannot advocate for themselves or add their voice to the discussion?

127
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:58,472
[SPEAKER_19]: Furthermore, choosing an individual's name may be perceived as being representative of only one group of people rather than the entire community.

128
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,696
[SPEAKER_19]: We believe that everyone should feel included and represented by the name.

129
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:10,823
[SPEAKER_19]: We respectfully ask that you can reconsider naming the school after a geographic feature or landmark that is tied to our school.

130
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:16,948
[SPEAKER_19]: South Medford Community School, South Mystic Elementary, or the Hicks Avenue School,

131
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:24,539
[SPEAKER_19]: all describe the area in which the school is located and in which the majority of our students live, learn, and grow.

132
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:32,564
[SPEAKER_19]: The geography is incontrovertible, and we hope less likely to leave any one group feeling as if they were left out.

133
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:40,969
[SPEAKER_19]: We recognize that this suggestion comes late in the game, but nonetheless, hope that you will consider the idea.

134
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for your time and hard work.

135
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:46,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Sincerely, the Columbus Elementary educators.

136
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:50,950
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's signed by a whole list of teachers, probably 25 of them.

137
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,412
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you want me to read those names.

138
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:59,995
[SPEAKER_19]: The next letter was a letter that was forwarded to me.

139
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:01,715
[SPEAKER_26]: Jim, I have a question on that.

140
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:02,396
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

141
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:07,878
[SPEAKER_26]: Principal K, how many teachers are there at your school?

142
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:09,439
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that 25 represent 50%?

143
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,041
[SPEAKER_26]: Does it represent greater than that?

144
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:13,561
[SPEAKER_26]: What's the?

145
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:22,854
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it's really hard because there's roughly 25 homeroom teachers, but then we have lots of support staff and specialists.

146
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:29,298
[SPEAKER_20]: So normally when we make copies, that would include the custodians and everybody.

147
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,060
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I rarely do just the teachers.

148
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,323
[SPEAKER_20]: It comes to, it's about, I'd say a third of everybody who works at the building.

149
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,884
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me, there's 43 names on this.

150
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:41,307
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know that they're all teachers, but it's signed by 43 people.

151
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:46,489
[SPEAKER_20]: So that would definitely be well more than half, well, well more than half close to almost full majority.

152
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:47,229
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

153
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:53,310
[SPEAKER_26]: And then, then the other question that I have, Jim is, did this come through the union or was this just a group of individuals?

154
00:09:53,350 --> 00:10:02,532
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a group of individual teachers that, uh, Vicki Mello forwarded to me, I guess she had said that the day of our last meeting and I didn't get it until the next day.

155
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:03,732
[SPEAKER_19]: And she called looking.

156
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:08,433
[SPEAKER_19]: So I went and found it in my emails and I told her I'd read it this meeting.

157
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:09,964
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, thank you.

158
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:12,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody else?

159
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:20,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, the next letter was sent to me, it was forwarded, it was sent to the mayor and then it was forwarded to me from the Italian American Alliance.

160
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:29,747
[SPEAKER_19]: It says, dear Mayor Cohen, for the record, the Italian American Alliance of Massachusetts does not support the decision made by the Medford School Committee.

161
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,780
[SPEAKER_19]: in regards to the renaming of the Christopher Columbus School in Medford.

162
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:46,725
[SPEAKER_19]: It shows a complete disregard for federal constitutional protections in regards to equity to ethnic group who do not support the name change while providing factual information concerning Christopher Columbus.

163
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:51,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Be advised that we fully expect to address this issue again in the future.

164
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:59,291
[SPEAKER_19]: Sincerely, James DeStefano, President of Italian American Alliance Massachusetts.

165
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:09,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, all right, we voted last week to have a procedure.

166
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:16,190
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Pat McCabe made the motion and I'm gonna read that process and then we're gonna get into it.

167
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:33,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion that the committee reduce the list of 18 nominees by starting with the lowest ranked name or names according to the rubric scoring and asking the committee if anyone would include said name in their top three to be submitted to the school committee for consideration.

168
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:45,238
[SPEAKER_19]: No one on the committee would include their name, if no one on the committee would include their said name, sorry, in the top three, said name is stricken from the list.

169
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:56,241
[SPEAKER_19]: After going through this process, each committee member shall have no more than three minutes to discuss which nominee or nominees they think should be sent forward to the school committee.

170
00:11:57,121 --> 00:12:02,343
[SPEAKER_19]: After each committee member presents, each committee member shall vote for one nominee.

171
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:09,715
[SPEAKER_19]: If a nominee receives 12 votes, that nominee shall be one of the committee's three recommendations to the school committee.

172
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:23,065
[SPEAKER_19]: If no nominee receives 12 votes on the first vote, first ballot, the bottom vote getters will be strickened, bottom vote getter or getters will be strickened and the committee will vote again.

173
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:27,288
[SPEAKER_19]: This process will continue until the nominee receives 12 votes.

174
00:12:28,268 --> 00:12:30,150
[SPEAKER_19]: After selecting one nominee to advance,

175
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:41,359
[SPEAKER_19]: All nominees will be placed back into the pool, and the committee shall repeat the same process to select the second nominee, and repeat a third time to select the third nominee.

176
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:53,667
[SPEAKER_19]: So, going by the school- Point of order, Mr. Chair.

177
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:57,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Just looking at the time, is it right that we do have to end at six?

178
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,111
[SPEAKER_15]: And if so,

179
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,916
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, what should we do if we don't get through the whole process by six?

180
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:07,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it, you know, do we envision having to stop somewhere in the middle?

181
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:13,019
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we have to end at six, so we'll have to carry it on in the next meeting.

182
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of order.

183
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:27,663
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some friendly amendments and language that had changed from Patrick's submitted

184
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,126
[SPEAKER_04]: motion last week, namely that we were going to just do it alphabetically rather than starting with the lowest ranked.

185
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:53,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And that I think it was up to three names, because the way in which Pat's language is now written, we have to do it until a nominee receives 12.

186
00:13:55,757 --> 00:14:05,322
[SPEAKER_04]: a nominee may never reach 12, or we may not reach 12 votes for three names.

187
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:06,603
[SPEAKER_04]: We might only do one or two.

188
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:15,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those were friendly amendments that we had made last week.

189
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,850
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you remind me of those friendly amendments?

190
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Patrick, do you?

191
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,812
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, the alphabetical.

192
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:29,851
[SPEAKER_26]: We did alphabetical rather than the rubric because there was some confusion about the rubric, so.

193
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:37,496
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we had to wait for the rubric because not everyone had all the information last week.

194
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:45,722
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion, however, was amended to go alphabetical rather than starting with the lowest scored person on the rubric.

195
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:48,744
[SPEAKER_26]: It's inconsequential to the outcome.

196
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:52,167
[SPEAKER_26]: All 18 candidates are going to be heard.

197
00:14:54,623 --> 00:15:08,754
[SPEAKER_26]: Um in the first round here, so It doesn't matter if we go alphabetical or if we go by score Okay point of clarification Just two two things.

198
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:17,081
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to make sure we're tracking that everybody every committee member has Can three times state not more than that only three times you can state.

199
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:20,404
[SPEAKER_24]: It's one of your top three And the other one is there are

200
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:22,933
[SPEAKER_24]: We're gonna make 66 votes here.

201
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:33,742
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think if you get 12, you're automatically necessarily in because it could be a potential of four candidates getting, four names getting 12.

202
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:42,089
[SPEAKER_24]: So we just have to be cautious that if there's a tie and there's more than three names that come up with a 12 or whatever, that's possible to happen.

203
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:46,333
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think it is gonna happen, but if it is, they don't automatically get in.

204
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:50,285
[SPEAKER_26]: No, Ron, it's not, people aren't voting for three candidates.

205
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:52,986
[SPEAKER_26]: They're voting for one candidate three times.

206
00:15:54,267 --> 00:16:01,750
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand, but what I'm saying is name A comes up, 12 people could vote for that one person.

207
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,132
[SPEAKER_24]: Name D comes up, 12 people could vote for that person.

208
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:06,132
[SPEAKER_24]: F comes up, 12.

209
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:07,673
[SPEAKER_24]: G comes up, 12.

210
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,494
[SPEAKER_24]: That's only 48 of the 66 votes.

211
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:12,815
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's potential that that could happen.

212
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:16,217
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't anticipate it, but when you get caught not doing

213
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:24,084
[SPEAKER_24]: So I would just say that when you say 12 automatically get you in, it's subject to only three getting 12.

214
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:27,105
[SPEAKER_26]: Right, that's what would happen.

215
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:30,526
[SPEAKER_26]: We only vote three times if there were to be.

216
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:40,728
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, my point only is mathematically with 22 of us voting, it's potential that more than three people could get a 12.

217
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:43,368
[SPEAKER_26]: We're only voting for one candidate in the first round.

218
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:46,949
[SPEAKER_24]: You're voting for every name eight

219
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:53,386
[SPEAKER_24]: every name in the alphabet, so what if everybody got, what if three people got 12, then we don't need another round.

220
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,550
[SPEAKER_26]: We're not voting for three people, we're voting for one person in the first round.

221
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:07,799
[SPEAKER_24]: No, when you say A, I can pick, if that's one of my three, I can say that's one of my three, is that correct?

222
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,981
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

223
00:17:11,283 --> 00:17:13,925
[SPEAKER_24]: You're saying that's my pick is that one.

224
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:20,510
[SPEAKER_26]: No, no, the only reason going one of your top three is just to filter out people, right?

225
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:31,098
[SPEAKER_26]: So if nobody wants to vote for candidate A, then candidate A doesn't make it to the final round, right?

226
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:37,724
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so just for clarification, if I say A is my vote, I can't vote again in this round?

227
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:41,684
[SPEAKER_26]: No, you will vote again, you just, if- In this round.

228
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:47,187
[SPEAKER_26]: Correct, in this round, if A was the bottom vote getter, then you would vote for somebody else.

229
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:51,549
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, no, no, what I'm saying is you're gonna read off A to Z here, right?

230
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,590
[SPEAKER_24]: Once I say- One at a time.

231
00:17:54,191 --> 00:18:02,655
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, so we're gonna say number one, A. Everybody's gonna vote, everybody's gonna say it's one of your to vote on, correct?

232
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:08,351
[SPEAKER_26]: No, we're just saying, does anyone have A as their first choice?

233
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:11,734
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, and then they're just going to say, does anyone have B as their first choice?

234
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,155
[SPEAKER_26]: So it could be all 18.

235
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:14,456
[SPEAKER_26]: We could end up voting on all 18.

236
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:21,062
[SPEAKER_26]: The idea was just to pare the list down, assuming that there's some people that may not make the top 18.

237
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:28,949
[SPEAKER_19]: So after the first vote, say we have six names, seven names with votes, then we what?

238
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:29,650
[SPEAKER_19]: We vote again.

239
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:30,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Correct.

240
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,784
[SPEAKER_26]: Then at that point, we, everybody votes who their first choice is.

241
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:38,387
[SPEAKER_19]: Out of the remaining seven.

242
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:39,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

243
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

244
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:49,056
[SPEAKER_19]: And how many times are we going to go through that on that particular, so that we get it down to four.

245
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,018
[SPEAKER_26]: Until someone gets 12 votes.

246
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:55,301
[SPEAKER_26]: So on that first round, if someone gets 12 votes, then.

247
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:57,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

248
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:09,215
[SPEAKER_14]: point of clarification, are we doing this with a poll, or are we doing this by roll call?

249
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:18,961
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe it needs to be by roll call, you know, per the guidance that we got originally from Lisa, because it is a Zoom meeting.

250
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:25,444
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, we're not going to be able to do a vote, a voice, you know, voice vote.

251
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:27,045
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think it has to be roll call.

252
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:34,350
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could just jump in two quick things, Paul Donato is on the call and the latest I can leave is 6.30.

253
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,191
[SPEAKER_17]: So you have an extra half hour.

254
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:38,432
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, thanks.

255
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:40,554
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

256
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:48,278
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll read down the list.

257
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:53,953
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have, let me get this list.

258
00:19:53,993 --> 00:20:01,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of clarification, so at this point, we are being, you'll read the last 18 in alphabetical order, Mr. Chair, right?

259
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:05,197
[SPEAKER_15]: And the question is, is this person on your top three, right?

260
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:06,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that the first question we're asking?

261
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:12,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's your top person, if it's your top person.

262
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:15,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Your top person, your number one top person, okay.

263
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,083
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion said top three.

264
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:19,303
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I thought, yeah.

265
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:20,724
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought it was the top three.

266
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:22,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, okay.

267
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,999
[SPEAKER_25]: If the name is wed and their top three, you're voting affirmatively, correct, Patrick?

268
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:28,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Correct.

269
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that makes sense.

270
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:41,125
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I think it would be, you know, the proper way to probably present it would to say, does anybody object to the removal of this name?

271
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:44,707
[SPEAKER_26]: And then, you know, if someone's new top three, you'd say I object.

272
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:52,211
[SPEAKER_15]: But just to be clear, it doesn't have to be a top three, because I have a top like five or 10, you know, that I would love.

273
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:53,852
[SPEAKER_26]: It has to be a top three.

274
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:56,333
[SPEAKER_26]: It has to be a top three.

275
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:57,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

276
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:00,396
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

277
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,598
[SPEAKER_19]: So if I read down the list.

278
00:21:04,198 --> 00:21:05,098
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I ask a question?

279
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,339
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, point of clarification.

280
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:06,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

281
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,021
[SPEAKER_20]: What if you have a tie on your list?

282
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,042
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I do.

283
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,044
[SPEAKER_20]: I have four names with the same score.

284
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:29,127
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I think you could potentially hope that somebody else raises, wants one of your three to move on, and then you could save that vote for later on.

285
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:29,748
[SPEAKER_26]: Got it.

286
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,228
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

287
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:35,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would say that if you're not able to choose, then you have to abstain and only have two choices.

288
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:47,132
[SPEAKER_04]: or your rubrics are one thing that you are considering in your choices, in your top three choices.

289
00:21:47,212 --> 00:21:58,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if your rubric does have a tie, you are totally allowed to use your own methodology in order to choose your top three at this point.

290
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:02,937
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so we're not going to eliminate anybody from the list yet.

291
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,363
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we going to speak out three minutes on each candidate first, or are we going to wait till after we?

292
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:17,527
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I think if we wait to just call the list down, Jim, just to reduce the list.

293
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:23,831
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I think the list is reduced, then we have three minutes for statements.

294
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:26,293
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

295
00:22:26,753 --> 00:22:31,256
[SPEAKER_04]: If a name's not on anyone's top three, then it does get eliminated now.

296
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:32,036
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

297
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:36,943
[SPEAKER_19]: So each person is going to give me their top three then.

298
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:38,404
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

299
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:46,969
[SPEAKER_26]: So you would start with the first name alphabetically and say, does anyone have an objection to this name being stricken?

300
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:48,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

301
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,852
[SPEAKER_26]: And then if someone raises an objection, so everyone here would have three objections that they could raise.

302
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,994
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

303
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,536
[SPEAKER_19]: And everyone has to pick three.

304
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:07,282
[SPEAKER_26]: They don't have to, but they can pick fewer than three, but not more than three.

305
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:08,042
[SPEAKER_26]: Correct.

306
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:08,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

307
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,945
[SPEAKER_15]: So there will be a roll call for each one of these names in alphabetical order.

308
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:13,546
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

309
00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:17,048
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first one is.

310
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:27,494
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just wondering how we got here when we've now 25 minutes into the meeting and we still don't have clear understanding on what we're doing.

311
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:40,761
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna make a motion to say that we reevaluate how we are the large group of us who do not understand actually what we're doing here.

312
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:46,624
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's now taking us 25 minutes to try and figure out the proper way to eliminate the names.

313
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:53,988
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have great concerns about holding an election for this or a nomination when people are very concerned.

314
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:00,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of order.

315
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:23,178
[SPEAKER_04]: The discussion for that would, which would be a motion to rescind and require two thirds vote from the entirety of the committee would surely be longer than any needed explanation for us going forward now.

316
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:25,900
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here to

317
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:30,667
[SPEAKER_04]: what we have to do tonight.

318
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,388
[SPEAKER_04]: If we need to explain it again, we can do that.

319
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:37,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now- Point of clarification, please.

320
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:39,229
[SPEAKER_16]: We're here to narrow down the names.

321
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that is what I said.

322
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,171
[SPEAKER_16]: To figure out the proper way to narrow down these names.

323
00:24:46,891 --> 00:24:48,632
[SPEAKER_16]: This has been going on for one year.

324
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:52,093
[SPEAKER_16]: We have already made a- Excuse me.

325
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:54,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me, please don't speak over me.

326
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:55,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Please don't speak over me.

327
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:57,314
[SPEAKER_16]: Share your clarification.

328
00:24:59,002 --> 00:25:05,703
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to come up with a system where we're not spending 25 minutes trying to help each other understand how we're voting.

329
00:25:06,063 --> 00:25:13,205
[SPEAKER_16]: It's apparent now over the last 25 minutes that there's gross confusion as to this process that we voted on last week.

330
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of order, we did vote on it last week.

331
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:21,207
[SPEAKER_04]: We have had a week in order to figure it out.

332
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:27,408
[SPEAKER_04]: If there needs to get explanations tonight, we can do that.

333
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:45,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of privilege.

334
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:46,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Melissa, you're breaking up and I can't hear you.

335
00:25:47,001 --> 00:26:01,468
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to remind everybody that we're supposed to be doing the top three because you do have to present to school committee on June 7th and maybe we can get one more meeting prior to that.

336
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:04,690
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, that's my point of clarification.

337
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,803
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, can we explain this one more time for Melissa?

338
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:11,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Pat, do you wanna go through it now?

339
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,126
[SPEAKER_19]: We're gonna go alphabetically.

340
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:15,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Ken has been waving his hand.

341
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:16,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, Ken has his hand up.

342
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:17,770
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Ken, you wanna speak?

343
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:32,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I have grave concerns that people are not expressing concerns until we get to a meeting and then suddenly it's we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

344
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:33,702
[SPEAKER_01]: This is,

345
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:40,652
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly simple, and I don't think it's been explained in the most simple form today.

346
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:44,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take a stab at it, Patrick, if that's okay.

347
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

348
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:49,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Jim is going to read Achi Sulo.

349
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:56,655
[SPEAKER_01]: He is going to say, does anybody have objection with removing Achi Sulo from the list?

350
00:26:58,335 --> 00:27:01,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on the score, I would think that

351
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:05,975
[SPEAKER_01]: most people would not say anything and we could remove him from the list.

352
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:09,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he's going to move to Amelia Earhart.

353
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:14,037
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to say, does anybody have objection to remove her from the list?

354
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:18,638
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody does have an objection, then she stays on the list.

355
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:22,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he's gonna read Arthur de la Russo.

356
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,780
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna say, does anybody have any objection to removing Arthur de la Russo from the list?

357
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:36,758
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on if somebody has an objection, he either stays or goes, then moves on to Belinda Sutton and that on and that on.

358
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:40,178
[SPEAKER_01]: That calls the list, okay?

359
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that smaller list, that's when we start doing our voting.

360
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to add to Ken, we each have three objections.

361
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:59,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are based on the people that we believe, however we support it, are our top three people.

362
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:01,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

363
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:07,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Melissa?

364
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,521
[SPEAKER_19]: You with us?

365
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:15,422
[SPEAKER_22]: Lost her.

366
00:28:15,442 --> 00:28:21,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Give her a minute.

367
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have quorum.

368
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,001
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to proceed.

369
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:26,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Melissa.

370
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:27,344
[SPEAKER_19]: You're there.

371
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:31,868
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

372
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:33,809
[SPEAKER_20]: No, she's bounced off.

373
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:34,850
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

374
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,851
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure she'll be back.

375
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:39,915
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

376
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:45,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there any objections to removing him from the list?

377
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:52,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody?

378
00:28:58,381 --> 00:28:59,142
[SPEAKER_19]: No objections?

379
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:01,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

380
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:05,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Amelia Earhart, any objections?

381
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:08,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an objection.

382
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:10,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I do as well.

383
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,610
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody else?

384
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I also do.

385
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:17,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Who's?

386
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:18,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Janelle.

387
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,073
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you.

388
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:22,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I do as well.

389
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:33,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey folks, can you say your name because I don't know everybody yet and I have to really record this appropriately.

390
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:39,798
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's so far it's Josie, Kathy, Janelle and Dan, correct?

391
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:41,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

392
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:44,499
[SPEAKER_10]: May I ask a question?

393
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

394
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,180
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Kristen Scalise.

395
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,681
[SPEAKER_10]: If someone do, should we object

396
00:29:51,599 --> 00:30:02,864
[SPEAKER_10]: every time, or if like four people already objected and you would have objected, is it enough that like, I should also object or I don't have to because they already did.

397
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:08,067
[SPEAKER_23]: One objection gets keeps them on the list.

398
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:09,027
[SPEAKER_23]: So yeah, okay.

399
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:09,868
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

400
00:30:10,568 --> 00:30:10,868
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

401
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:12,629
[SPEAKER_20]: And can I take my objection back?

402
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,310
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I don't want a three.

403
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, you don't get three, you get as many as you want, right?

404
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:22,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We only get three top three.

405
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's fine.

406
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:24,960
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

407
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,380
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of my names anyway.

408
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't care.

409
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

410
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:29,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

411
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:29,261
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

412
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:29,681
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

413
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:31,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Kathy.

414
00:30:31,882 --> 00:30:32,202
[SPEAKER_20]: What's that?

415
00:30:32,402 --> 00:30:32,562
[SPEAKER_20]: Lisa?

416
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:33,022
[SPEAKER_20]: Say that again.

417
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:33,362
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

418
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:33,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy.

419
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:35,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you in or out on a minute?

420
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:36,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, somebody already objected.

421
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:39,904
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm okay with not having to object and save my other three for something else.

422
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:41,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Taking you off.

423
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:42,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

424
00:30:43,985 --> 00:30:46,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, the next one's out the Dela Russo.

425
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:50,805
[SPEAKER_22]: I object.

426
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:51,226
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

427
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:56,370
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

428
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,711
[SPEAKER_19]: The next one's Belinda Sutton.

429
00:30:59,452 --> 00:30:59,873
[SPEAKER_17]: I object.

430
00:31:00,093 --> 00:31:01,554
[SPEAKER_17]: I object.

431
00:31:02,575 --> 00:31:05,397
[SPEAKER_17]: I need everybody's names again, please.

432
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,879
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're objecting, I need your name.

433
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:09,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Three brothers.

434
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:13,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

435
00:31:14,864 --> 00:31:15,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Josie Dufour.

436
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:18,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Beth Fuller.

437
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:22,825
[SPEAKER_21]: Lila Fleur.

438
00:31:26,587 --> 00:31:27,427
[SPEAKER_25]: Matt Haberstroh.

439
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Seth Hill.

440
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you got me.

441
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:34,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope.

442
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:35,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Seth.

443
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:41,593
[SPEAKER_17]: So Seth, Matt, Leroy, Beth, Josie, Grace, and Brie, correct?

444
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:43,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone else?

445
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:48,276
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll ask a question.

446
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,837
[SPEAKER_19]: Is Dr. Cushing still on here?

[SPEAKER_24]: Jim, just point of information, Jim.

467
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:07,289
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no reason why she can't be on the phone.

468
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:10,652
[SPEAKER_24]: Just leave her on the phone as we go through this process while we're waiting for to get on.

[SPEAKER_19]: Is that all right?

472
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:32,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, is there a phone number to call in?

473
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:34,279
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't necessarily have to be the link.

474
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,060
[SPEAKER_10]: There's usually a Zoom phone call.

475
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,220
[SPEAKER_10]: You can just dial in if she's on the phone.

476
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,821
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be a better connection for her.

477
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:54,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, yes, there is a phone number that's on the agenda.

478
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:05,922
[SPEAKER_25]: How long are we going to wait?

479
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:11,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, is there any luck?

480
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:12,787
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

481
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:18,310
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a phone number on the agenda that you can call in instead of trying to do the Zoom link.

482
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:20,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Would someone like me to read off the phone number?

483
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:21,585

[SPEAKER_19]: There we go.

493
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:38,096
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do this.

00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:45,612
[SPEAKER_10]: as the school name, and I thought that was a fantastic idea, but unfortunately it came after we had the, you know, we had to drill down.

00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:25,597
[SPEAKER_26]: Patrick.

613
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:33,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Any more?

614
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:34,722
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry?

615
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:35,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Any more?

616
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:37,103
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard

617
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:39,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Laura and Patrick, was there any more objections?

618
00:40:39,818 --> 00:40:47,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

619
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:49,065
[SPEAKER_19]: Raymond Marano.

620
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:54,709
[SPEAKER_21]: I object.

621
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:55,950
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Lila Fleur.

622
00:40:57,611 --> 00:40:58,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Donato Jr.

623
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:05,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul, anybody else?

624
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:17,514
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

625
00:41:18,815 --> 00:41:20,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Bruce Bader Ginsburg.

626
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:31,423
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody?

627
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:32,424
[SPEAKER_19]: Bruce Bader Ginsburg.

628
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:49,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold on one second.

629
00:42:15,645 --> 00:42:16,726
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, Sagamore John.

630
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody?

631
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:46,388
[SPEAKER_19]: And the last one, Wampanoag.

632
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Objections?

633
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:01,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody?

634
00:43:08,106 --> 00:43:09,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, we've eliminated five.

635
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:16,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Achi Sulo, Crispus Attucks, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sagamore John, and Wampanoag.

636
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:25,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Final clarification, could you just repeat the ones that we eliminated?

637
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:26,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Eliminated.

638
00:43:28,081 --> 00:43:28,702
[SPEAKER_19]: Achi Sulo.

639
00:43:30,438 --> 00:43:38,240
[SPEAKER_19]: Christmas Addicts, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sagamore John, and Wampanoag.

640
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:41,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

641
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:53,164
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, so now we voted on this next, Pat, or are we each speaking?

642
00:43:53,304 --> 00:43:56,945
[SPEAKER_26]: Everyone speaks now so that when people make their vote on their

643
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:58,735
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, next round.

644
00:43:58,775 --> 00:44:01,958
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the way I thought we were going to do it, but I just double checking.

645
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:03,659
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

646
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:11,886
[SPEAKER_19]: So Amelia Earhart, anyone that would like to speak on Amelia Earhart?

647
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:20,573
[SPEAKER_11]: A point of clarification, we're able to speak on multiple names.

648
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:25,918
[SPEAKER_11]: This is simply each person gets three minutes to speak on

649
00:44:26,744 --> 00:44:28,345
[SPEAKER_11]: their top three, correct?

650
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:30,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

651
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:35,728
[SPEAKER_26]: Start with the committee in any order you think is appropriate, Mr. Chair.

652
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:40,910
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to go alphabetically.

653
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Would anyone like to speak on Amelia Earhart first?

654
00:44:43,491 --> 00:44:45,952
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll listen to everyone that would like to speak on Amelia Earhart.

655
00:44:47,222 --> 00:44:53,426
[SPEAKER_26]: And what she was saying is that everyone gets three minutes total, not three minutes per candidate.

656
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:56,068
[SPEAKER_26]: So some people may give one minute for one candidate.

657
00:44:56,128 --> 00:45:00,671
[SPEAKER_26]: So the format would be for everyone just to give their three-minute speech.

658
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:01,191
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

659
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:03,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, why don't we get on the list then?

660
00:45:04,073 --> 00:45:04,513
[SPEAKER_19]: How's that?

661
00:45:04,854 --> 00:45:05,114
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

662
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:08,576
[SPEAKER_19]: So Bree, would you like to go first?

663
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:11,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

664
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:18,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Just a point of, just a point of, sorry, Brie.

665
00:45:20,824 --> 00:45:28,451
[SPEAKER_24]: I just, the only concern I have with the individual going and speaking on a name is that it doesn't lead to debate.

666
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:38,280
[SPEAKER_24]: If we have Amelia Earhart up on the board and anybody wants to speak to it, it also gives an opportunity to compliment what Brie would say about Amelia Earhart, for example.

667
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:51,904
[SPEAKER_24]: So instead of listening to Bree say Amelia Earhart and then when we get down to Danny he does Amelia Earhart too, calling the name off for our scenes to be more conducive to a whole building a whole story.

668
00:45:52,064 --> 00:45:52,904
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my comment.

669
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,201
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, that makes sense, but that's not what we voted on, that's all, so.

670
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:16,782
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just trying to make sense prevail in this case.

671
00:46:18,363 --> 00:46:19,483
[SPEAKER_26]: I think either way.

672
00:46:19,503 --> 00:46:23,364
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I think we'll remember the good things that everybody says over the next hour.

673
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:31,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I go?

674
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:32,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I?

675
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:33,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know now.

676
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:36,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

677
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:37,249
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to start?

678
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:37,749
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

679
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:38,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just trying to...

680
00:46:39,198 --> 00:46:40,819
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm getting the emails from Melissa.

681
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:45,442
[SPEAKER_19]: She's not getting, she didn't get the email, Kathy K. She hasn't got any email, any emails.

682
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:49,384
[SPEAKER_20]: I sent it to her twice, maybe her work email address.

683
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:52,986
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, is Peter back on?

684
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:56,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim, I also put, sorry.

685
00:46:57,709 --> 00:46:59,910
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I sent it to her twice as well.

686
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:04,653
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have a quorum, so you know what I mean?

687
00:47:04,693 --> 00:47:06,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim, Jim, I put the number.

688
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:15,526
[SPEAKER_10]: I put the number to call in and the meeting ID that she would have to enter in the chat if you wanna text it to her, if you have her number and you're speaking to her right now.

689
00:47:16,046 --> 00:47:16,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, let me do that.

690
00:47:16,946 --> 00:47:22,309
[SPEAKER_10]: She just has to dial in and then add in that number and she'll get in on her phone.

691
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:23,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

692
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:31,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I go ahead or?

693
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:31,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, please.

694
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks.

695
00:47:33,174 --> 00:47:34,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

696
00:47:37,261 --> 00:47:37,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, everyone.

697
00:47:38,782 --> 00:47:42,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be speaking on behalf of Belinda Sutton.

698
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:50,371
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could, I would like to quote one of the submissions that we got from the public input survey.

699
00:47:50,611 --> 00:47:52,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that allowed?

700
00:47:52,153 --> 00:47:52,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we do that?

701
00:47:56,016 --> 00:47:56,276
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

702
00:47:56,796 --> 00:47:57,176
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, great.

703
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:06,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So Eileen Lerner said, there are no photos or paintings of the black enslaved people who helped build Medford.

704
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:14,330
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no public statues or paintings of black people enslaved or free in city hall or any public building.

705
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,052
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no streets or squares dedicated to their memory.

706
00:48:19,253 --> 00:48:26,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Belinda Sutton was not only an enslaved person, she was also a fighter who sued for a pension following the departure of the royal family.

707
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:29,738
[SPEAKER_09]: during the revolution and after her emancipation.

708
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:40,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Naming the Columbus School the Belinda Sutton School would indicate a new consciousness and awareness of the injustices black people have suffered in the United States and in Medford.

709
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:50,851
[SPEAKER_09]: This name would signal a desire to redress the many wrongs perpetrated against black people and acknowledge the long history of suffering they've endured.

710
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:54,974
[SPEAKER_09]: It would proclaim a new day and a new era in the city of Medford.

711
00:48:58,253 --> 00:49:06,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I also, I love that the, I understand that the fifth graders at the Columbus School take a field trip to the Royal House every year.

712
00:49:06,718 --> 00:49:23,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it would be really meaningful to the students of Medford to go there to learn about this person who helped build Medford with her hands and then go back to that school knowing what a great honor that is.

713
00:49:25,137 --> 00:49:50,096
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, I just want to take a spin that, you know, it's one of the most, the most difficult pieces of this process has been trying to get positive and negative feedback on people to, you know, to figure out who was marginalized, who marginalized, and literally selecting a black female person that was enslaved.

714
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:51,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just,

715
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,738
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the most wonderful underdog story.

716
00:49:55,339 --> 00:50:14,953
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just being in an enslaved position like that, we know there's no way she marginalized people because she herself is the epitome of who was marginalized because of the ideals of people like Christopher Columbus.

717
00:50:16,118 --> 00:50:26,324
[SPEAKER_02]: For the clarifications to the chair brief, did you say that there was no persons of color in the city of Medford have anything named after them?

718
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:29,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you said?

719
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:33,949
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that is not what the, and to be, I'm quoting someone who submitted this.

720
00:50:35,851 --> 00:50:41,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that quote, you did say that there was nothing named after anyone's a person of color.

721
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:42,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you not say that?

722
00:50:44,717 --> 00:50:46,158
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's not what it said.

723
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:53,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It said there are no public statues or paintings of black people enslaved or free in City Hall or any public building.

724
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,521
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a public building.

725
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:56,421
[SPEAKER_02]: You're incorrect there.

726
00:50:57,121 --> 00:51:05,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Madeline Dugger Andrews is a person of color who a middle school is named after.

727
00:51:06,425 --> 00:51:13,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we allowed to interrupt members as they're speaking and correct them on information?

728
00:51:14,983 --> 00:51:19,166
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this is a fact finding information about the city of Medford.

729
00:51:19,787 --> 00:51:25,151
[SPEAKER_11]: However, our resolution states that each member of the committee gets three minutes to speak.

730
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:29,754
[SPEAKER_11]: There is nothing in there that says that one can interrupt and correct.

731
00:51:29,774 --> 00:51:32,416
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to wait till we have a discussion afterwards, Paul.

732
00:51:32,797 --> 00:51:33,097
[SPEAKER_19]: OK?

733
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,499
[SPEAKER_19]: Let her have her three minutes before we go into debates.

734
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:37,580
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll debate afterwards.

735
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:39,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Ray, can you send me that quote, please?

736
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:40,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

737
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:44,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Melissa Miguel is in the waiting room.

738
00:51:44,555 --> 00:51:45,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Who has access to let her in?

739
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:50,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you reread that quote, please?

740
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:51,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

741
00:51:52,158 --> 00:51:52,478
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

742
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:59,181
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no photos or paintings of the black enslaved people who helped build Medford.

743
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:06,504
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no public statues or paintings of black people enslaved or free in City Hall or any public building.

744
00:52:08,145 --> 00:52:10,466
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no public statues or paintings

745
00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:13,319
[SPEAKER_09]: in City Hall or any public building.

746
00:52:13,419 --> 00:52:16,322
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no streets or squares dedicated to their memory.

747
00:52:17,923 --> 00:52:28,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Belinda Sutton was not only an enslaved person, she was also a fighter who sued for a pension following the departure of the royal family during the revolution and after her emancipation.

748
00:52:29,592 --> 00:52:38,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Naming the Columbus School the Belinda Sutton School would indicate a new consciousness and awareness of the injustices Black people have suffered in the United States and in Medford.

749
00:52:39,804 --> 00:52:47,895
[SPEAKER_09]: It was named to signal a desire to redress the many wrongs perpetrated against black people and acknowledge the long history of suffering they have endured.

750
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:52,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And a new day and a new era in the city of Medford.

751
00:52:56,852 --> 00:53:07,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, there is a portrait of Prince Hall and City Hall that was done by a local artist to celebrate our centennial in 1992.

752
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:12,745
[SPEAKER_17]: It was taken down, which I don't believe it was, when Mayor McGlynn left.

753
00:53:13,526 --> 00:53:15,988
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right in the Rotunda area of City Hall.

754
00:53:16,468 --> 00:53:21,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And secondly, I believe Duggar Park is named after a World War I veteran, Edward Duggar.

755
00:53:22,213 --> 00:53:24,515
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was also at the Rotary,

756
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:37,954
[SPEAKER_17]: If you go into West Medford into Arlington, that Rotary is also named for an African American gentleman who I believe served in Vietnam, but I am, I'm sorry, I can't come up with his name.

757
00:53:38,855 --> 00:53:44,480
[SPEAKER_17]: But just for clarification, I'm sorry, I'm history buff, and I'm sorry, I just can't let it go.

758
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:49,345
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just like, I'm sorry, Matt.

759
00:53:49,845 --> 00:53:50,806
[SPEAKER_25]: Who's speaking?

760
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:51,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Lisa?

761
00:53:52,912 --> 00:54:04,278
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I would say to this and that list of people that you named, does it overcome the mural in the post office?

762
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:07,360
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been named in honor of anyone.

763
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,461
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I stop you here, please?

764
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:13,843
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to give everybody the three minutes, and then we'll discuss all this, OK?

765
00:54:14,624 --> 00:54:18,666
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to get through this if we're going to debate every person as they talk.

766
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:22,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Jim, real quick, if you would like, I'll keep time.

767
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:23,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

768
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:25,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

769
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:26,369
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me know in three minutes.

770
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:27,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

771
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,451
[SPEAKER_20]: Is Melissa in?

772
00:54:28,491 --> 00:54:30,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I don't see her.

773
00:54:30,492 --> 00:54:30,812
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

774
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:32,293
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

775
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:35,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you all done?

776
00:54:36,216 --> 00:54:36,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.

777
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:36,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

778
00:54:37,337 --> 00:54:37,557
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

779
00:54:37,597 --> 00:54:38,018
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

780
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,098
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

781
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:40,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Dan, do you want to go next?

782
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, I can go next.

783
00:54:50,891 --> 00:54:56,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So I prepared a little statement that I kind of whipped up right before the meeting.

784
00:54:59,353 --> 00:55:08,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, as a leader in the Italian American community, myself and my family have been deeply saddened about this whole entire situation.

785
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:12,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be quite frank, this goes well beyond Christopher Columbus.

786
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,216
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't about Christopher Columbus.

787
00:55:15,216 --> 00:55:19,377
[SPEAKER_05]: In more recent times, two words seem to come out of every public elected official's mouth.

788
00:55:20,472 --> 00:55:23,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Those words are equitable and inclusiveness.

789
00:55:24,556 --> 00:55:28,499
[SPEAKER_05]: The large amount of people, including Italian-Americans have been totally disregarded.

790
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Then where is the inclusiveness?

791
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:32,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the equitability?

792
00:55:33,643 --> 00:55:41,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether Columbus was a slave owner or not, Italian-Americans in this city have been treated badly with this whole situation.

793
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:47,235
[SPEAKER_05]: The feelings of many residents of the city have been disregarded.

794
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:52,957
[SPEAKER_05]: This is causing a horrific divide like we have never seen.

795
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:56,358
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not fair and it's definitely not inclusive.

796
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:04,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Jean Barry Sutherland in life left a mark on our children, on our educators, on our staff.

797
00:56:05,982 --> 00:56:17,007
[SPEAKER_05]: In death, Jean Barry Sutherland can help heal this city from this horrific division that this whole situation has caused.

798
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:30,468
[SPEAKER_05]: We as a committee have an amazing opportunity here to reunite everyone by simply understanding and listening to one another with what our wants are.

799
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:42,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I humbly ask that this committee really, really consider reunifying this city and putting forth Jean Barry Sutherland's name.

800
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:45,553
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for me.

801
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:46,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Dan.

802
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:50,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Erin, would you like to go next?

803
00:56:53,594 --> 00:56:54,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, thank you.

804
00:56:56,616 --> 00:57:05,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I had actually picked my top three that I would like to speak about, but it seems like people are just talking about one.

805
00:57:08,645 --> 00:57:09,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that true?

806
00:57:10,366 --> 00:57:13,588
[SPEAKER_19]: You can read through three minutes if you wanna read through your top three.

807
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:14,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

808
00:57:14,128 --> 00:57:14,669
[SPEAKER_19]: That's fine.

809
00:57:15,703 --> 00:57:36,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So my first choice is after reading through all of the information that people sent in on the surveys, talking with community members in my own conscience, I believe that the school should be named after the river, the Mystic River or Missitech River.

810
00:57:38,357 --> 00:57:41,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that for one thing,

811
00:57:43,331 --> 00:58:07,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I took to heart the words of the teachers of the school in wanting to not name it after a person, and also to recognize the river as the life force that it brings into our community, what it has given to our community throughout history.

812
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:11,245
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why Medford exists here today is because of the trade,

813
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:15,969
[SPEAKER_06]: when settlers came here to trade along the river.

814
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:25,570
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was inhabited and still is inhabited by tribal people who call this place home.

815
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:37,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I feel that it would be a good way for the students to connect to that, to this land where we live.

816
00:58:38,452 --> 00:58:40,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And also in thinking ahead to

817
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:51,698
[SPEAKER_06]: issues that we're all facing, looking at climate change coming nearer, looking at sea level rise nearing.

818
00:58:53,119 --> 00:59:02,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Many young people that I work with have a very strong connection to wanting to be more ecologically minded.

819
00:59:02,968 --> 00:59:05,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that by naming the school

820
00:59:06,184 --> 00:59:20,111
[SPEAKER_06]: after the river, that would be a really amazing step towards that and to support the students in their leadership around those issues.

821
00:59:20,131 --> 00:59:31,538
[SPEAKER_06]: My second choice would be for Belinda Sutton to be named, the school to be named after her, because I believe that

822
00:59:32,927 --> 00:59:44,476
[SPEAKER_06]: We are in a period right now of a reckoning around racial justice and the legacy of colonization in our, not only in our community, but in the larger world.

823
00:59:45,837 --> 01:00:02,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And many young students of color are looking up, looking for role models that they can look to and- Jim, three minutes.

824
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:03,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that three minutes?

825
01:00:03,991 --> 01:00:04,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

826
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:04,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

827
01:00:06,233 --> 01:00:06,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

828
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just to sum it up.

829
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:12,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so Belinda Sutton would be my second choice.

830
01:00:13,138 --> 01:00:21,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my, my third choice would be Jean Barry Sutherland, who is well, a well-loved person in this community who has made a huge impact.

831
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, thank you for your time.

832
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jim.

833
01:00:27,009 --> 01:00:29,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to give a one, like a 15 second warning?

834
01:00:31,704 --> 01:00:32,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

835
01:00:32,224 --> 01:00:34,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is that going to make a difference?

836
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:37,005
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

837
01:00:38,505 --> 01:00:40,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Shua, you can give him a 15 second warning.

838
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,106
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see how that works out.

839
01:00:41,786 --> 01:00:42,766
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

840
01:00:42,786 --> 01:00:43,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

841
01:00:44,567 --> 01:00:45,447
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, Beth Fuller.

842
01:00:49,468 --> 01:00:50,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Very nice to see all of you again.

843
01:00:52,648 --> 01:01:01,110
[SPEAKER_12]: My first choice would be the Misituk because

844
01:01:03,072 --> 01:01:05,293
[SPEAKER_12]: This is why the city of Medford exists.

845
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:15,940
[SPEAKER_12]: We were the Ford in the river, the Mystic River, we called it, but it was known by the other name, Misatoch, for much longer than perhaps even we've been here.

846
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:24,925
[SPEAKER_12]: I did a quick survey to see if there were any other schools named Mystic

847
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:29,236
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, name for a river in the United States.

848
01:01:29,797 --> 01:01:35,619
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one in Winchester, but it is since closed and not even in Mystic, Connecticut.

849
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:37,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a school named that way?

850
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,222
[SPEAKER_12]: And Misatoch doesn't come up either as a school name.

851
01:01:42,422 --> 01:01:48,785
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be a dramatic, a dramatic name to have on the front of the school.

852
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:53,307
[SPEAKER_12]: It would recognize the people who were here long before we were

853
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:58,878
[SPEAKER_12]: and that we are grateful for their presence and for allowing us to be here.

854
01:01:59,979 --> 01:02:13,390
[SPEAKER_12]: My second choice would be Belinda Sutton because she did something illiterate, uneducated woman who knew that she deserved better.

855
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:19,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Like other workers of this world, she knew that she deserved to be paid

856
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:22,697
[SPEAKER_12]: and compensated for the years that she spent in service.

857
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:25,479
[SPEAKER_12]: And she went after that and was successful.

858
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:39,349
[SPEAKER_12]: My third choice is Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, who not only taught at the Lincoln School, but also lived in South Medford at the time that Amelia Earhart, her sister, flew over the Atlantic.

859
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:45,033
[SPEAKER_12]: And Grace went on to teach, well Muriel is how we knew her, went on to teach

860
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:52,209
[SPEAKER_12]: and to teach in the Belmont school system where she spent most of her years teaching.

861
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:55,110
[SPEAKER_12]: But she also served on the Medford School Committee.

862
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:58,992
[SPEAKER_12]: She served on the Library Board of Trustees.

863
01:02:59,252 --> 01:03:05,175
[SPEAKER_12]: She helped to start the League of Women Voters, the Zonta Club, I think the West Medford Book Club.

864
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:11,358
[SPEAKER_12]: She was a member of the DAR, which started the Royal House Museum.

865
01:03:12,492 --> 01:03:16,873
[SPEAKER_12]: and was a longtime member of the Medford Historical Society and Grace Episcopal Church.

866
01:03:19,114 --> 01:03:33,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Amelia Earhart only lived 39 years, but Grace Muriel Morrissey Earhart, Earhart Morrissey, spent over 60 years in Medford and really devoted herself to this community.

867
01:03:34,317 --> 01:03:38,819
[SPEAKER_12]: She was an outstanding educator and a civic presence.

868
01:03:39,779 --> 01:03:40,199
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 seconds.

869
01:03:41,596 --> 01:03:42,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, done.

870
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:45,159
[SPEAKER_19]: Great job.

871
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:47,681
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

872
01:03:48,602 --> 01:03:49,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Very nice.

873
01:03:51,464 --> 01:03:52,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Grace Caldera.

874
01:03:53,286 --> 01:03:55,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

875
01:03:55,307 --> 01:04:01,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to take this opportunity to thank the Medford community for giving us a wonderful list of name suggestions.

876
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:10,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate and honor the time and work each member took to present their arguments for or against each of the 18 remaining names.

877
01:04:11,286 --> 01:04:22,704
[SPEAKER_08]: After hours of research, careful consideration of public input, weighing the options, and thinking about which names will help bring the community together, my top three choices are Belinda Sutton,

878
01:04:23,183 --> 01:04:25,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Crystal Campbell and Lydia Maria Child.

879
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:30,727
[SPEAKER_08]: All three of them individually highlight and exemplify the best of what Medford has to offer.

880
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:36,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Belinda Sutton was kidnapped from her homeland and sold into slavery to the royal family.

881
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:41,572
[SPEAKER_08]: She was brought to the South Medford Plantation to do unpaid labor for the family.

882
01:04:41,772 --> 01:04:42,633
[SPEAKER_08]: She gained her freedom

883
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,119
[SPEAKER_08]: upon the death of Isaac Royal Jr.

884
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:49,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And due to the Massachusetts law at the time, the Royal estate was to pay her.

885
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:53,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So she would not be a charge of the town of Medford.

886
01:04:54,306 --> 01:04:59,991
[SPEAKER_08]: She initially was not paid, but she was owed and petitioned the Commonwealth a total of five times for the money.

887
01:05:00,632 --> 01:05:08,479
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a bold and courageous move for an uneducated free black woman to go before a court to request money that was denied.

888
01:05:09,648 --> 01:05:17,772
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only because of her bravery to fight for what is right that we even have record of her existence and what her life was like for an enslaved woman during this time.

889
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:24,115
[SPEAKER_08]: She fought for what she believed in, she fought for her humanity, and she worked on this land to help build Medford.

890
01:05:24,695 --> 01:05:35,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an opportunity for us to honor Belinda's bravery under the most difficult circumstances and select a person who invested herself in the community and has made a positive impact.

891
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:45,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Lydia Marie Child was a well-known abolitionist, women's rights activist, Native American rights activist, novelist, journalist, and opponent of American expansionism.

892
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:46,919
[SPEAKER_08]: She was also a teacher.

893
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:54,627
[SPEAKER_08]: She was born and lived in Medford until she was 11, and then she returned to Medford in 1821 and was baptized at the first parish.

894
01:05:55,396 --> 01:06:00,219
[SPEAKER_08]: She went on to write over the river and through the woods about visiting her grandfather in Medford.

895
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:03,381
[SPEAKER_08]: She stood up for those who were marginalized by society.

896
01:06:03,541 --> 01:06:07,844
[SPEAKER_08]: She fought for rights to exist and to be treated as fully human and not property.

897
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:17,429
[SPEAKER_08]: She is a model for what it looks like to be an ally and activist and an accomplice to those who need help and what it means to advocate for against injustice.

898
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:24,255
[SPEAKER_08]: She wasn't afraid to address the systemic problems in order to make our country a more perfect union.

899
01:06:24,616 --> 01:06:26,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, Crystal Campbell.

900
01:06:26,704 --> 01:06:31,145
[SPEAKER_08]: was a promising young woman who tragically lost her life in the Boston Marathon bombing.

901
01:06:31,665 --> 01:06:36,086
[SPEAKER_08]: This act of hate rocked the Boston area and this community to its core.

902
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:52,491
[SPEAKER_08]: In all of the sadness and devastation, the Medford community in the state of Massachusetts was able to come together to honor her memory, united to mourn her death and to celebrate her life, naming the school after Crystal will bring the community together while honoring her life and her legacy.

903
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:52,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

904
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:54,231
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

905
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:58,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Ken Mallon, would you like to go next?

906
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, thank you.

907
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:10,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to reiterate what some other people have said, and I think that most of the names on this list would be perfectly appropriate for the school.

908
01:07:11,913 --> 01:07:17,174
[SPEAKER_01]: My top three were Lydia Maria Child, Belinda Sutton, and Missituk.

909
01:07:18,474 --> 01:07:25,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And for Lydia and Belinda, I have nothing to add to what people have already said.

910
01:07:26,384 --> 01:07:45,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what has been said has been a pretty good overview and Missittuc in third place, again to the teacher's point, it's not a name, it's not controversial, it represents the city, you know, we

911
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,903
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire city is tied to the Mystic River.

912
01:07:52,445 --> 01:07:55,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Our history is tied to the Mystic.

913
01:07:55,608 --> 01:07:59,832
[SPEAKER_01]: The ships, the Native Americans, everybody.

914
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:02,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all I have to say.

915
01:08:02,834 --> 01:08:05,517
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

916
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:08,500
[SPEAKER_19]: Kristen Scalise.

917
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:21,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, so this was very rough because like so many other people have said, we just have this incredible wealth of amazing choices.

918
01:08:24,169 --> 01:08:32,834
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a woman of 100% Italian background, I am proud to be here and helping to replace Columbus's name with someone more deserving.

919
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:40,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it does a great disservice to our culture by honoring someone who did so much harm to a vulnerable population.

920
01:08:40,398 --> 01:08:42,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're better than that.

921
01:08:43,297 --> 01:08:46,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank everyone that did submit names and comments.

922
01:08:47,143 --> 01:08:49,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I literally read every single one.

923
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:56,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I read someone's master's thesis from 1961 just because it included like Arthur de la Rousseau's name in it.

924
01:08:58,428 --> 01:09:00,130
[SPEAKER_10]: was we took this very seriously.

925
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:13,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also a testament to Dr. Caldera's rubric and how great it was that my top choices all ended up being people that I never heard of before joining this committee.

926
01:09:13,744 --> 01:09:18,850
[SPEAKER_10]: So it did a fantastic job of eliminating biases if it was used

927
01:09:19,879 --> 01:09:21,781
[SPEAKER_10]: the way that Dr. Caldera intended.

928
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:28,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So my top three ended up being Belinda Sutton, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Pauline Walker.

929
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:41,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I chose Belinda Sutton because someone pointed out in one of the public comments that not only was it impressive that she fought so hard to get what was fairly owed to her,

930
01:09:43,024 --> 01:10:01,304
[SPEAKER_10]: but that as a woman and as a former slave at that time, not only did she fight for it, she worked within the system, which is not an avenue that is usually open to someone in her situation in that era, which is very impressive.

931
01:10:02,608 --> 01:10:05,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean Barry Sutherland, I wish I could have met her.

932
01:10:06,129 --> 01:10:11,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I worked in a school when I lived in Connecticut and she just seems like the type of educator that you wanna work for.

933
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:14,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I also really love the idea of naming the school after an educator.

934
01:10:15,631 --> 01:10:17,692
[SPEAKER_10]: The comments on her obituary made me cry.

935
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:23,933
[SPEAKER_10]: The public comments that were submitted were so moving.

936
01:10:24,113 --> 01:10:30,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just so many people just saying how they used to ride their bikes to her house when they were young students and just, I was a mess.

937
01:10:31,932 --> 01:10:51,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And Pauline Walker, same situation, deeply involved with Medford, very impressive educator, great write-up on Wicked Local after she passed and it was just incredibly moving and had so much detail and she just seemed to be beloved by the community.

938
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:57,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we have so many great options here.

939
01:10:57,422 --> 01:10:59,283
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done, thank you.

940
01:11:02,589 --> 01:11:06,173
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

941
01:11:06,473 --> 01:11:07,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Laura.

942
01:11:08,776 --> 01:11:09,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

943
01:11:09,837 --> 01:11:20,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I also just want to like my colleagues on this committee, just thank everyone from Medford who made submissions and answered the survey and sent letters.

944
01:11:21,505 --> 01:11:29,510
[SPEAKER_15]: So much of that was just so thoughtful, well-researched, we got links we could follow up on, heartfelt information.

945
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:36,974
[SPEAKER_15]: I read every single one, online paper submissions, and I learned so much about people that I didn't know about.

946
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:44,118
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm just really grateful to the Medford community that came out and really put a lot of heart into this.

947
01:11:44,598 --> 01:11:48,440
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I also want to acknowledge that change is difficult and it can be painful.

948
01:11:49,821 --> 01:11:52,625
[SPEAKER_15]: But I am glad that this committee is rising to the occasion.

949
01:11:54,467 --> 01:12:01,436
[SPEAKER_15]: And so many of these names are worth having their stories told and I'm sad that we can only pick one or at least three to send and one to be picked.

950
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:13,147
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope that at the end of this process we could somehow, a few of us get together and put some of this together because I would really love for the Medford community to hear about these stories that we have gotten to learn about.

951
01:12:14,628 --> 01:12:23,854
[SPEAKER_15]: There were three teachers on there, Pauline Walker, Jean Barry Sutherland and Raymond Murano who clearly made an impact on their students and I thought,

952
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:31,883
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I would love to honor them in some way I didn't put them in my top three but I just want to say for the record that I was so touched by all those stories.

953
01:12:33,413 --> 01:12:41,619
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope that we can honor them in maybe some other way, because, you know, there's nothing more important, I think, you know, than having an educator who touches people's lives.

954
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,524
[SPEAKER_15]: That said, in my top three, I really gave a lot of weight to the historical significance per the rubric.

955
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:54,869
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we had, one of the things that we were scoring on was like a legacy that could last decades and bring people together.

956
01:12:55,270 --> 01:13:01,634
[SPEAKER_15]: And so my top three were Belinda Sutton, Prince Hall, and the word Mississippi, the name of the river.

957
01:13:02,662 --> 01:13:07,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to read quickly on Belinda Sutton, so many of the submissions were really touching.

958
01:13:08,505 --> 01:13:12,547
[SPEAKER_15]: One person who works at the school said, you know, I've worked here for six years.

959
01:13:13,047 --> 01:13:15,989
[SPEAKER_15]: I have seen many children come and go through these falls at this school.

960
01:13:16,369 --> 01:13:18,150
[SPEAKER_15]: They all have hopes and dreams of a better life.

961
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Belinda Sutton had these dreams.

962
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:21,171
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I get choked up.

963
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:24,933
[SPEAKER_15]: She fought for over a decade to receive a pension from Isaac Royals Estate.

964
01:13:25,053 --> 01:13:30,136
[SPEAKER_15]: She's an inspiration to any race, sex, or religion that to keep fighting for what you believe in,

965
01:13:31,104 --> 01:13:35,589
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's a quality that we want to instill into our young students coming through the doors of our school.

966
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:42,296
[SPEAKER_15]: And one other person wrote, I'm a lifelong resident of Medford and Belinda Sutton's name was never mentioned in my education.

967
01:13:42,777 --> 01:13:49,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Medford educators, students and residents are, you know, now, this person does say now I'm adding that in, working to highlight our history.

968
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,713
[SPEAKER_15]: people who had been enslaved or buried in Medford Square until later.

969
01:13:55,733 --> 01:14:00,916
[SPEAKER_15]: So this kind of narrative, I think, just really spoke to why her name is so important.

970
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:05,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Prince Hall, I confess, I did not know about, and it was fascinating to learn about him.

971
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,201
[SPEAKER_15]: I look forward to seeing that mural.

972
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:16,327
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. Tuck, I think, is an important hats off to our river and our environment, but I think we do need to be cautious.

973
01:14:16,667 --> 01:14:19,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Several people said that we do need to have more input.

974
01:14:19,509 --> 01:14:21,430
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not see anything in the public commentary

975
01:14:21,834 --> 01:14:24,335
[SPEAKER_15]: from somebody who has a connection to the- Three minutes, sorry.

976
01:14:24,355 --> 01:14:25,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Originally, thank you.

977
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:30,197
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to caution us to look into that work to make sure that it's appropriate and correct.

978
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:32,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

979
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:34,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

980
01:14:35,998 --> 01:14:36,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Leela Fleur.

981
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, I am back home now, but still on the phone.

982
01:14:48,707 --> 01:14:53,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Like we have already heard, I do want to thank the community for all of their input.

983
01:14:53,971 --> 01:15:09,863
[SPEAKER_21]: This has been such a helpful process for getting to know not only the names that they submitted, but also feeling at least a little bit like we were also getting to know a little bit more, I should say, about the people of Medford.

984
01:15:10,143 --> 01:15:11,444
[SPEAKER_21]: So this has been really great.

985
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:17,548
[SPEAKER_21]: printed submissions that were taken to City Hall, all of that.

986
01:15:17,948 --> 01:15:20,349
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's been really informative to this process.

987
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:28,693
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also just want to thank all of you because this process has been really helpful getting to hear your thoughts and your input as well.

988
01:15:29,934 --> 01:15:32,175
[SPEAKER_21]: I had more like a top five.

989
01:15:32,635 --> 01:15:35,096
[SPEAKER_21]: It was very difficult for me to get down to three.

990
01:15:35,456 --> 01:15:42,459
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm really glad that again, for all of you and your input, I'll speak primarily about my top two.

991
01:15:43,115 --> 01:15:49,042
[SPEAKER_21]: which were very clear to me, Belinda Sutton, whose name has been mentioned now numerous times in this group.

992
01:15:51,105 --> 01:15:56,211
[SPEAKER_21]: And I will just say that, you know, based even on the rubric, you know, Belinda Sutton

993
01:15:58,042 --> 01:16:07,550
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, came to Medford in the 1700s, in 1737 from Antigua, so from the Caribbean, as an enslaved person.

994
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:12,975
[SPEAKER_21]: So she has a long history of being associated with Medford.

995
01:16:13,915 --> 01:16:24,124
[SPEAKER_21]: In addition to that, her petition also is a noted document, not only in Medford or in the state of Massachusetts, but around the world.

996
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:37,350
[SPEAKER_21]: And so people look to her, historians look to her and that document as really seminal for thinking about enslavement in the North and in the United States.

997
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:40,551
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that her name on that school would be a real honor.

998
01:16:41,091 --> 01:16:43,511
[SPEAKER_21]: My other top person was Jean Barry Sutherland.

999
01:16:43,851 --> 01:16:48,552
[SPEAKER_21]: She received high support both from members of this group and also from the community.

1000
01:16:48,952 --> 01:16:53,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Her role as a beloved principal at Columbus School and at the Dame School

1001
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:57,352
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I've earned her a clear place in Medford history.

1002
01:16:57,672 --> 01:17:04,418
[SPEAKER_21]: She has a memorial at the school, and I think that the community would be honored to have her name on the school.

1003
01:17:04,518 --> 01:17:08,221
[SPEAKER_21]: And I believe that her name should go forward to the school committee.

1004
01:17:09,081 --> 01:17:16,727
[SPEAKER_21]: I won't speak much about Lydia Maria Child, who was an abolitionist and a women's rights activist.

1005
01:17:16,907 --> 01:17:17,988
[SPEAKER_21]: Others have spoken to her.

1006
01:17:18,389 --> 01:17:21,251
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, Laura just spoke about Ray Marano.

1007
01:17:21,641 --> 01:17:25,444
[SPEAKER_21]: another Italian-American, served the public schools for 44 years.

1008
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:26,604
[SPEAKER_21]: He was a veteran.

1009
01:17:26,945 --> 01:17:28,886
[SPEAKER_21]: He was very active in the community.

1010
01:17:28,926 --> 01:17:31,748
[SPEAKER_21]: And I learned about all of these people through this process.

1011
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:38,212
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm looking forward to wrapping it up right now and hearing from the rest of you.

1012
01:17:38,372 --> 01:17:39,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1013
01:17:39,593 --> 01:17:40,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Lee.

1014
01:17:42,595 --> 01:17:43,536
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, Lou and Tapa.

1015
01:17:44,637 --> 01:17:44,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1016
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:54,940
[SPEAKER_22]: With a lot of my family going through the Columbus, including two of my kids, I wasn't in favor of the name of the change of the name change.

1017
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,560
[SPEAKER_22]: And it really has nothing to do with the name.

1018
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,701
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the way it was done.

1019
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,402
[SPEAKER_22]: It was the fact that the public had absolutely no voice.

1020
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:09,543
[SPEAKER_22]: I really only have one choice that I think qualifies for this particular school that actually had anything to do with that school.

1021
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,264
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's more recent history.

1022
01:18:12,424 --> 01:18:16,185
[SPEAKER_22]: We talk about unity and Jean Barry Sutherland was all about unity.

1023
01:18:17,281 --> 01:18:21,583
[SPEAKER_22]: She was for every child, and not just at schools she taught at, but every school.

1024
01:18:23,303 --> 01:18:24,124
[SPEAKER_22]: She was Medford.

1025
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:29,146
[SPEAKER_22]: She was for Medford, and she was Medford, a true leader that was involved with everything.

1026
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:40,710
[SPEAKER_22]: Huge on the community working together, like the Jingle Bell Festival, Medford Health Matters, Oil Express ride, also involved with the women working together for the better of the community.

1027
01:18:42,411 --> 01:18:45,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, Jean represented Medford on a global level with our sister city in Japan.

1028
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:53,180
[SPEAKER_22]: I miss seeing Jean and her sister walking through the city almost every day.

1029
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:57,144
[SPEAKER_22]: She's my choice and it seems like it's the public's choice.

1030
01:18:58,366 --> 01:18:59,947
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's really all I got to say.

1031
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Lou.

1032
01:19:04,793 --> 01:19:05,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Maria Rocha.

1033
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:22,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, today I will be speaking in support of the names Belinda Sutton and miss a tuck Belinda Sutton was an exceptional woman with a concrete historical legacy will inspire students to create change in their communities and resist injustice in all forms.

1034
01:19:23,148 --> 01:19:25,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time they see that her name on the building.

1035
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:33,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Misituk is a name that honors the history of those to whom Medford originally belonged and the river that is so central to our home.

1036
01:19:34,697 --> 01:19:37,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Both of these names will unite and inspire Medford.

1037
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:44,445
[SPEAKER_11]: More importantly, they will allow students of color to see the name of their school and think, this place was built for me.

1038
01:19:45,026 --> 01:19:51,191
[SPEAKER_11]: There are so few buildings and places in Medford that truly honor or empower students of color.

1039
01:19:51,671 --> 01:19:54,594
[SPEAKER_11]: So why should we not take this as the opportunity to do that?

1040
01:19:55,669 --> 01:20:02,313
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like to speak about the two other names with the highest scores on the rubric, Jean Barry Sutherland and Lydia Maria Child.

1041
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:05,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not know Jean Barry personally.

1042
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:08,736
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure that she did have a positive impact on many Medford students.

1043
01:20:09,116 --> 01:20:15,520
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I strongly believe that her legacy is not historical and simply too contemporary.

1044
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,242
[SPEAKER_11]: While we have received positive anecdotes from the public,

1045
01:20:19,662 --> 01:20:26,949
[SPEAKER_11]: choosing the name of someone who passed away so recently and who current Medford residents knew personally is incredibly risky.

1046
01:20:27,609 --> 01:20:33,374
[SPEAKER_11]: My reservations are similar to the reasons why we chose not to consider names of people who are still alive today.

1047
01:20:34,215 --> 01:20:38,779
[SPEAKER_11]: If some negative aspect of Jean Barry's legacy is revealed someday,

1048
01:20:39,219 --> 01:20:46,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Given how many people in the city knew her personally, we are risking soon being in the exact same spot as we are here today.

1049
01:20:46,863 --> 01:20:52,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Both Belinda Sutton and Missituck are historical, and nobody knows either of these entities personally.

1050
01:20:53,027 --> 01:21:04,013
[SPEAKER_11]: This avoids that situation of eventually having to rename the school, while simultaneously empowering and inspiring students of color in the exact manner that we should be striving to empower them in MPS.

1051
01:21:04,753 --> 01:21:15,326
[SPEAKER_11]: With regards to Lydia Maria Child, I agree that she is a historical figure with an important legacy as an abolitionist, Native rights activist, and author of a poem with direct ties to Medford.

1052
01:21:16,107 --> 01:21:21,734
[SPEAKER_11]: However, if we admire Lydia Maria Child for being an abolitionist, why shouldn't we honor her then

1053
01:21:22,495 --> 01:21:27,000
[SPEAKER_11]: a Black woman who went through great lengths to free herself like Belinda Sutton did.

1054
01:21:27,561 --> 01:21:40,315
[SPEAKER_11]: If we love the connection to Medford and over the river and through the wood, then why not honor the river that is in the poem, touches all of our lives, and uplifts Native communities whose land was stolen from them by selecting the name Missituck.

1055
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:48,264
[SPEAKER_11]: The matter of renaming the school is a matter of repairing the harm done to our community by honoring the genocidal legacy of Columbus.

1056
01:21:48,825 --> 01:21:54,889
[SPEAKER_11]: What better way to do this than uplifting students of color who are still harmed by that genocidal legacy today.

1057
01:21:55,609 --> 01:22:09,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Regardless of how much some people may want to hang on to nostalgia and precedent, I am here today as a representative of high schoolers and of youth to tell you that most of us want change and change is coming.

1058
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:14,040
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the opportunity here to be on the right side of history.

1059
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:14,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1060
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:15,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1061
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:19,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Melissa Miguel.

1062
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:23,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you on with us?

1063
01:22:30,906 --> 01:22:33,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Was she made a host when she got back on?

1064
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:36,788
[SPEAKER_19]: She said she's on Zoom.

1065
01:22:40,316 --> 01:22:41,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Melissa, you there?

1066
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:48,039
[SPEAKER_19]: She's here.

1067
01:22:48,499 --> 01:22:49,179
[SPEAKER_19]: What's it say?

1068
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,260
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm on mute here.

1069
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:51,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Unmute me.

1070
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,081
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we unmute her?

1071
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,381
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't find her name.

1072
01:22:55,802 --> 01:22:56,982
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what she's listed as.

1073
01:22:57,042 --> 01:23:03,024
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's several cell phones here that I just don't want to make them co-hosts if I don't know which one she is.

1074
01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:05,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear me now?

1075
01:23:06,085 --> 01:23:06,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1076
01:23:06,205 --> 01:23:07,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear me now?

1077
01:23:07,346 --> 01:23:07,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1078
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:10,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you everybody.

1079
01:23:10,184 --> 01:23:12,265
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize for the technical difficulties.

1080
01:23:12,285 --> 01:23:15,646
[SPEAKER_16]: This is why I cannot wait till we will all be meeting in person again soon.

1081
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:28,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so I was passionate about joining this committee because I have been a member and a parent of the Columbus family since 2007 and a homeowner in South Medford for the last 20 years.

1082
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:33,152
[SPEAKER_16]: However, none of that has anything to do with the naming of the Columbus school.

1083
01:23:33,532 --> 01:23:36,473
[SPEAKER_16]: This committee is not about me or my personal feelings.

1084
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:46,760
[SPEAKER_16]: This committee is about representing the popular vote and the desires of our neighbors, friends, and family within the community of Medford.

1085
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:55,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Therefore, my top three names will be the top three names submitted by my friends, family, and neighbors.

1086
01:23:56,103 --> 01:24:05,987
[SPEAKER_16]: My first vote goes for Jean Barry Sutherland, who astonishingly had four times the community vote of the next name, Amelia Earhart.

1087
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,841
[SPEAKER_16]: who almost tied with crystal Campbell.

1088
01:24:11,321 --> 01:24:20,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Therefore, I'm not going to sit here and tell the committee why my name, the name that I feel should be presented to the school committee.

1089
01:24:21,063 --> 01:24:28,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause I agree with Lou and Tapa that the whole process at which this is taking place is an abomination.

1090
01:24:29,605 --> 01:24:36,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Therefore I, Melissa Miguel choose to represent my neighbors and friends and family in the city of Medford.

1091
01:24:36,781 --> 01:24:41,864
[SPEAKER_16]: and put forth a name with 420 submissions of Jean Barry Sutherland.

1092
01:24:43,065 --> 01:24:48,248
[SPEAKER_16]: As we've spoken about, there's a name and place for every person on this list in Medford.

1093
01:24:49,429 --> 01:24:54,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Crystal Campbell has a place, Amelia Earhart has a place, Belinda Sutton has a place.

1094
01:24:55,673 --> 01:25:00,917
[SPEAKER_16]: But the place that Dean Barry Sutherland belongs is at the Columbus Elementary School.

1095
01:25:01,737 --> 01:25:06,160
[SPEAKER_16]: And as again, I speak for the citizens of Medford, not my own personal bias.

1096
01:25:06,636 --> 01:25:07,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1097
01:25:09,181 --> 01:25:09,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1098
01:25:11,726 --> 01:25:13,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Matt McCabe, would you like to speak?

1099
01:25:15,272 --> 01:25:16,054
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, thank you.

1100
01:25:17,588 --> 01:25:23,670
[SPEAKER_26]: The best way for our city to move forward is to emulate the wonderful nominees who've been brought forward and listen to one another.

1101
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:29,512
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think a single one of these nominees would endorse an all or nothing approach to renaming a school.

1102
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:35,353
[SPEAKER_26]: They'd recognize the excellence of each candidate and respect each person's contributions to the city.

1103
01:25:36,054 --> 01:25:39,515
[SPEAKER_26]: And even more importantly, our society and our humanity.

1104
01:25:40,355 --> 01:25:42,196
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why these people are on this list.

1105
01:25:42,216 --> 01:25:46,157
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to read a poem by Rita Dove, Belinda's Petition.

1106
01:25:47,335 --> 01:25:54,477
[SPEAKER_26]: Boston, February 1782, to the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of this country, newborn.

1107
01:25:55,297 --> 01:25:59,239
[SPEAKER_26]: I am Belinda, an African, since the age of 12, a slave.

1108
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:06,641
[SPEAKER_26]: I will not take too much of your time, but to plead and place my pitiable life unto the fathers of this nation.

1109
01:26:07,748 --> 01:26:10,709
[SPEAKER_26]: Lately, your countrymen have severed the binds of tyranny.

1110
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:18,931
[SPEAKER_26]: I would hope you would consider the same for me, pure air being the sole advantage of which I can boast in my present condition.

1111
01:26:19,991 --> 01:26:25,412
[SPEAKER_26]: As to the accusation that I am ignorant, I received existence on the banks of the Rio de Volta.

1112
01:26:26,132 --> 01:26:29,833
[SPEAKER_26]: All my childhood, I expected nothing, if that be ignorance.

1113
01:26:31,054 --> 01:26:33,294
[SPEAKER_26]: This poem's about Medford's own Belinda Sutton.

1114
01:26:33,574 --> 01:26:37,155
[SPEAKER_26]: Unlike many of our immigrant families who came to the United States for a better life,

1115
01:26:38,556 --> 01:26:43,601
[SPEAKER_26]: and faced her horrible treatment and discrimination, Belinda did not choose to come here.

1116
01:26:44,382 --> 01:26:50,367
[SPEAKER_26]: She was taken from the shores of Ghana's Rio de Volta and enslaved in the newly formed United States of America.

1117
01:26:50,868 --> 01:26:54,831
[SPEAKER_26]: Her conditions were worse than any European immigrants who immigrated here.

1118
01:26:55,572 --> 01:26:58,594
[SPEAKER_26]: How on earth would somebody born into such conditions make history?

1119
01:26:59,275 --> 01:27:03,578
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me share, because before this process, I had no idea who Belinda Sutton was.

1120
01:27:04,359 --> 01:27:21,091
[SPEAKER_26]: After obtaining her freedom from the royal family upon the death of Isaac Royal Jr., despite him willing Sutton to his wife as property, Sutton petitioned the United States House of Representatives for reparations from the royal family estate in order to support herself and her disabled daughter.

1121
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:23,352
[SPEAKER_26]: Sutton won those reparations.

1122
01:27:24,193 --> 01:27:30,496
[SPEAKER_26]: a woman, an African woman, a freed slave petitioning for justice more than 200 years ago.

1123
01:27:31,277 --> 01:27:32,317
[SPEAKER_26]: That is historical.

1124
01:27:33,137 --> 01:27:34,818
[SPEAKER_26]: Why should we name a school after her?

1125
01:27:35,358 --> 01:27:41,882
[SPEAKER_26]: Because we should know her history the same way we know the history of more modern Medford residents for whom schools have been named.

1126
01:27:42,682 --> 01:27:49,549
[SPEAKER_26]: Belinda never had a chance to be recognized because of society's views towards Black people and women during that time.

1127
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:51,491
[SPEAKER_26]: Today, we feel differently.

1128
01:27:52,132 --> 01:27:54,314
[SPEAKER_26]: We know better, and we can right those wrongs.

1129
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,916
[SPEAKER_26]: That is why my first preference would be Belinda Sutton.

1130
01:27:57,257 --> 01:27:57,617
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1131
01:27:57,637 --> 01:28:01,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Pat.

1132
01:28:02,622 --> 01:28:03,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Baldonado.

1133
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:05,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1134
01:28:05,933 --> 01:28:10,214
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I'd like to thank Beth Fuller for talking so hotly about Miriam Morrissey.

1135
01:28:10,974 --> 01:28:12,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew her very well.

1136
01:28:12,415 --> 01:28:14,695
[SPEAKER_02]: She was actually one of my babysitters.

1137
01:28:16,036 --> 01:28:22,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew a lot of the people on the list personally, Ray Marano, Pauline Walker, and Jean Barry Sutherland.

1138
01:28:23,338 --> 01:28:24,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I just would...

1139
01:28:25,819 --> 01:28:29,200
[SPEAKER_02]: like you to consider Jean as one of your top choices.

1140
01:28:30,581 --> 01:28:35,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers are arguably the most important members of our society and often are undervalued.

1141
01:28:36,063 --> 01:28:45,706
[SPEAKER_02]: They give children purpose, set them up for success as citizens of our world, and inspire them to drive to do well and succeed in life.

1142
01:28:46,707 --> 01:28:52,969
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, not only do they educate, but they help parent and mentor our children during the day.

1143
01:28:53,922 --> 01:29:01,891
[SPEAKER_02]: The children of today are the leaders of tomorrow, and teachers are that critical point that makes a child ready for their future.

1144
01:29:02,872 --> 01:29:10,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I think past three years opened the eyes of many parents as to how much our children depend on their teachers.

1145
01:29:11,789 --> 01:29:30,830
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, what better way to honor an educator who dedicated her life to children, the city of Medford, and fighting for equality than to name the Columbus School after Jean Barry, who just so happens to be a former principal of the school.

1146
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:43,299
[SPEAKER_02]: This also is our chance as a city to stand with all educators and let them know how much we appreciate them and support them, especially after this difficult year.

1147
01:29:44,139 --> 01:29:50,724
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, Jean has met all four of the criteria rubric with almost a perfect score.

1148
01:29:51,224 --> 01:29:55,427
[SPEAKER_02]: We have given the city a chance to vote and the number of votes Jean has

1149
01:29:56,348 --> 01:29:58,189
[SPEAKER_02]: received speaks volumes.

1150
01:29:58,969 --> 01:30:02,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you strongly consider Jean Barry as your choice.

1151
01:30:03,592 --> 01:30:04,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1152
01:30:06,473 --> 01:30:07,113
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Paul.

1153
01:30:10,215 --> 01:30:11,275
[SPEAKER_19]: Ron, would you like to go next?

1154
01:30:11,295 --> 01:30:12,516
[SPEAKER_24]: I would.

1155
01:30:12,636 --> 01:30:13,056
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1156
01:30:14,377 --> 01:30:19,619
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just going to add on to my number one selection, which is Jean Barry Sutherland.

1157
01:30:21,328 --> 01:30:29,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Not only did she score the highest average score in the rubric, she did receive 34% of the over 1,200 amazing votes from our citizens.

1158
01:30:29,752 --> 01:30:41,077
[SPEAKER_24]: While this number does not have any significance in terms of votes or total legitimate entries, it is important to note that the most positive anecdotes and feedback were received for Jean.

1159
01:30:42,674 --> 01:30:54,596
[SPEAKER_24]: You've all read some of them from the teachers who's been inspired to city leaders who were inspired by her loving, compassionate leadership.

1160
01:30:57,176 --> 01:31:01,077
[SPEAKER_24]: Jean was the first principal in that actual building on Hicks Ave.

1161
01:31:02,437 --> 01:31:06,218
[SPEAKER_24]: Jean cared for children, all the children.

1162
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:12,099
[SPEAKER_24]: In my 62 years of living in the city, I never had the pleasure of meeting Jean.

1163
01:31:13,865 --> 01:31:19,409
[SPEAKER_24]: But what I know now, which I didn't know until this committee started, was what an amazing educator she was.

1164
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:22,250
[SPEAKER_24]: What a loving, caring teacher.

1165
01:31:23,491 --> 01:31:25,112
[SPEAKER_24]: What an inspirational leader.

1166
01:31:26,873 --> 01:31:28,194
[SPEAKER_24]: Jean worked 12-hour days.

1167
01:31:28,254 --> 01:31:29,295
[SPEAKER_24]: She painted the school.

1168
01:31:29,935 --> 01:31:31,216
[SPEAKER_24]: She led by example.

1169
01:31:31,677 --> 01:31:33,278
[SPEAKER_24]: Jean was Columbus School.

1170
01:31:34,779 --> 01:31:36,760
[SPEAKER_24]: Naming it Jean Barry Sutherland School

1171
01:31:37,182 --> 01:31:41,065
[SPEAKER_24]: will give the children of Medford a modern day historical hero.

1172
01:31:41,445 --> 01:31:42,426
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, historical.

1173
01:31:42,486 --> 01:31:49,590
[SPEAKER_24]: We're funny that we're questioning if she's historical or not, but when David Ortiz hits a home run against the Yankees, he's a historic hero.

1174
01:31:50,991 --> 01:31:58,056
[SPEAKER_24]: She actually walked the corridors and hugged the children right in that building on Hicks Ave.

1175
01:31:58,376 --> 01:32:02,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Jean's story lives in the hearts of so many current members of our community.

1176
01:32:03,168 --> 01:32:09,472
[SPEAKER_24]: the children would get a chance to know that the person their school was named after stood for love, caring, and compassion.

1177
01:32:10,652 --> 01:32:12,513
[SPEAKER_24]: And she did it right there in their school.

1178
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:18,357
[SPEAKER_24]: Some people may say that, how can this person be so good?

1179
01:32:19,798 --> 01:32:21,218
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there something we're missing here?

1180
01:32:21,919 --> 01:32:24,981
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I'm willing to take that chance on Jean Barry Sutherland.

1181
01:32:25,421 --> 01:32:32,425
[SPEAKER_24]: She's the right name at the right time, and most importantly, in the right building, the building on Hicks Ave.

1182
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:33,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1183
01:32:34,579 --> 01:32:35,199
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Ron.

1184
01:32:37,581 --> 01:32:39,101
[SPEAKER_19]: Seth Hill, would you like to go next, please?

1185
01:32:41,483 --> 01:32:42,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1186
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:50,928
[SPEAKER_04]: When I thought about what I wanted to say, I wasn't sure whether or not I was going to be saying anything.

1187
01:32:52,549 --> 01:32:57,432
[SPEAKER_04]: As a member of this committee and as a member of the community, I've

1188
01:33:03,564 --> 01:33:09,868
[SPEAKER_04]: tried to evaluate how better to lift up voices rather than centering my own.

1189
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:32,303
[SPEAKER_04]: The process of trying to narrow down these names and the process of deciding that the name needed to be changed has been divisive, and it has been controversial.

1190
01:33:33,547 --> 01:33:36,969
[SPEAKER_04]: and it has caused risks in the community.

1191
01:33:41,231 --> 01:34:02,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to focus on how unification can happen around ideas like self-advocacy and putting forward your own story when no one else is listening to you.

1192
01:34:03,837 --> 01:34:04,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Belinda Sutton did.

1193
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:29,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Belinda Sutton represents someone that was being held down from all aspects of society, and as a result, all society can look to her as a model for bringing people together.

1194
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll speak directly to

1195
01:34:34,275 --> 01:34:35,215
[SPEAKER_04]: American community.

1196
01:34:36,896 --> 01:34:46,298
[SPEAKER_04]: The Christopher Columbus School was originally named because Italian Americans were a marginalized group.

1197
01:34:48,459 --> 01:34:51,340
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the same language that we hear today used.

1198
01:34:55,241 --> 01:35:00,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And people spoke about Italian's criminality.

1199
01:35:01,343 --> 01:35:02,703
[SPEAKER_04]: There were racial profiling.

1200
01:35:03,826 --> 01:35:06,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It was beer that they would take jobs away.

1201
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:10,630
[SPEAKER_04]: They have radical politics, et cetera, et cetera.

1202
01:35:14,892 --> 01:35:30,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when we look at what we need in order to go forward and what we need in order to bring the entire community together, we can think about which voices we choose to lift up and which stories we choose to lift up.

1203
01:35:32,068 --> 01:35:45,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we can choose someone like 15 seconds, which everybody can look to and see themselves in that story.

1204
01:35:47,882 --> 01:35:48,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1205
01:35:52,466 --> 01:35:53,106
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Seth.

1206
01:35:55,288 --> 01:35:55,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Kathy King.

1207
01:36:04,417 --> 01:36:05,498
[SPEAKER_19]: Cathy, are you ready for us?

1208
01:36:10,204 --> 01:36:10,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1209
01:36:10,624 --> 01:36:12,607
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I couldn't unmute, so I'm unmuted now.

1210
01:36:13,307 --> 01:36:13,548
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1211
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:13,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1212
01:36:14,618 --> 01:36:15,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1213
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:21,383
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to say thank you to everybody who's on this screen tonight and who have been on the screen in past nights.

1214
01:36:22,603 --> 01:36:33,410
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely appreciate and I'm thankful for your commitment to this cause and to the many community members who submitted some input on the names through the form that was sent out.

1215
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:34,331
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to all of you.

1216
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,262
[SPEAKER_20]: The names that were put forward, they're all worthy for their many, many different reasons.

1217
01:36:40,302 --> 01:36:50,887
[SPEAKER_20]: So it is a hard task that we have in front of us, but I'd like to use my three minutes to just speak to the one that I think would be best for the Columbus Elementary School as a new name.

1218
01:36:52,908 --> 01:36:56,529
[SPEAKER_20]: I think Missittuck would be the best choice for the Columbus Elementary School.

1219
01:36:57,570 --> 01:37:02,612
[SPEAKER_20]: And in the research that I've done, I saw at one point, Missittuck stands for great river.

1220
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:08,803
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a great river that flows through the heart of Medford, connecting east to west.

1221
01:37:09,904 --> 01:37:15,607
[SPEAKER_20]: The Mystic is considered central to Medford's identity, at least from many of the inputs that I read.

1222
01:37:16,548 --> 01:37:19,230
[SPEAKER_20]: The river has long been a source of community pride.

1223
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:24,373
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it's important for us as this committee to consider that a river never bends.

1224
01:37:24,633 --> 01:37:27,635
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, that a river does bend, but it never breaks.

1225
01:37:28,922 --> 01:37:36,367
[SPEAKER_20]: Rivers have the ability to change course, which is a much needed skill for all of our students at any school.

1226
01:37:38,008 --> 01:37:52,458
[SPEAKER_20]: I also full-heartedly continue to feel and do agree with the Columbus Elementary teachers that the name for the school would be best served if it is not named for one individual person.

1227
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:58,542
[SPEAKER_20]: By not choosing one individual person, we're not idealizing one person over another.

1228
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:10,092
[SPEAKER_20]: And the choice of a non-person name would hopefully not promote disagreement over someone's past deeds well into the future that I believe Maria might've made reference to before.

1229
01:38:11,292 --> 01:38:16,274
[SPEAKER_20]: Mississippi honors the indigenous people who lived here long before any of us.

1230
01:38:17,894 --> 01:38:21,035
[SPEAKER_20]: The river is and has been important to Medford's history.

1231
01:38:21,935 --> 01:38:27,536
[SPEAKER_20]: It provides and it promotes a source of genuine environmental education for our students as well.

1232
01:38:28,905 --> 01:38:40,812
[SPEAKER_20]: Choosing this name would also lend stewardship, not only to nature, but to Medford's local treasure that many times brings people together, picnics, hikes, kayaking on the river.

1233
01:38:42,153 --> 01:38:56,562
[SPEAKER_20]: Naming the Columbus, I should say renaming the Columbus, the Missittuck, would act, I believe, as a reuniting force, as a uniting force, and bring people together with a shared piece of Medford's identity, past and present.

1234
01:38:57,674 --> 01:39:18,149
[SPEAKER_20]: And when I was reading through many of the inputs that we got from the community, I thought that someone very eloquently, and I'm paraphrasing, so I'm sure they said it better than I will right now, but what they said is, naming the schools shows a way to remember those from whom much has been taken and to whom much is owed.

1235
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:19,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for my three minutes.

1236
01:39:21,612 --> 01:39:22,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1237
01:39:22,032 --> 01:39:25,375
[SPEAKER_19]: Next is Matt Habistro.

1238
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:32,733
[SPEAKER_25]: I wrote some notes and now I've been tearing them all up because of what everyone's been talking about.

1239
01:39:32,773 --> 01:39:41,419
[SPEAKER_25]: But I basically wanted to talk about how, when considering renaming Columbus, I want it to be a name that kids experience as aspiring.

1240
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:48,023
[SPEAKER_25]: There are well-known national and international names on our list, some of which are risen to the top of our choices.

1241
01:39:48,303 --> 01:39:50,985
[SPEAKER_25]: These names, all of us in Medford should be proud of.

1242
01:39:51,966 --> 01:40:03,735
[SPEAKER_25]: Some grew up in Medford, some lived here for a few years, but it was their accomplishments, accomplishments, not time spent in Medford that will inspire great aspirations in the young people of the Columbus.

1243
01:40:05,056 --> 01:40:09,839
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I tend to call how we do things in Medford as systemic parochialism.

1244
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,421
[SPEAKER_25]: We generally speaking don't reach for the stars.

1245
01:40:13,102 --> 01:40:14,603
[SPEAKER_25]: We settle for good enough.

1246
01:40:15,304 --> 01:40:18,386
[SPEAKER_25]: We look in for what we know and who we know.

1247
01:40:19,542 --> 01:40:31,126
[SPEAKER_25]: I encourage you not to let systemic parochialism sway you from a truly aspirational name, an aspiring name that represents breaking barriers of gender, race, and yes, accomplishment.

1248
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:41,649
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't let systemic parochialism sway you from choosing an aspiring name that represents exploration, bravery, or daring.

1249
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:46,351
[SPEAKER_25]: I encourage you not to let systemic parochialism sway you

1250
01:40:47,495 --> 01:40:53,379
[SPEAKER_25]: is an inspiring Medford person who demanded an historical wrong to be righted.

1251
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,641
[SPEAKER_25]: Great people have lived here.

1252
01:40:55,921 --> 01:40:57,682
[SPEAKER_25]: Great people will continue to live here.

1253
01:40:58,463 --> 01:41:07,869
[SPEAKER_25]: As a teacher of those people, those young kids, I want the name to be truly inspiring and an aspirational name, whatever that may be.

1254
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:11,332
[SPEAKER_25]: I also agree with Kathy Kay about Ms.

1255
01:41:11,352 --> 01:41:11,612
[SPEAKER_25]: Tewick.

1256
01:41:12,842 --> 01:41:22,425
[SPEAKER_25]: Native American name for the river, but really my first choice would be Belinda Sutton, for all the reasons previous speakers have spoken to about.

1257
01:41:23,265 --> 01:41:31,147
[SPEAKER_25]: A strong contender for me also is Lydia Maria Child, who was also a teacher, a writer, and a well-known international person.

1258
01:41:31,948 --> 01:41:32,248
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1259
01:41:35,069 --> 01:41:35,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Matt.

1260
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:39,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Caitlin Shaughnessy, please.

1261
01:41:42,677 --> 01:41:43,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Is Caitlin even here?

1262
01:41:43,898 --> 01:41:45,760
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have her here being here, sorry.

1263
01:41:49,523 --> 01:41:50,323
[SPEAKER_19]: No, Caitlin, right?

1264
01:41:50,644 --> 01:41:51,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Janelle, Carla, Mackenzie?

1265
01:41:54,207 --> 01:41:58,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I thought about my choice, I hoped to be a voice for the teachers at the Columbus.

1266
01:41:59,411 --> 01:42:04,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Being in the building allowed me to be able to have conversations with other teachers and staff at the school.

1267
01:42:05,716 --> 01:42:11,581
[SPEAKER_07]: I took into consideration the opinions of the staff I work with and paid close attention to the submissions by my fellow teachers.

1268
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:21,324
[SPEAKER_07]: From the conversations I had with the other staff at the school and the submissions by the teacher, I found the most support from our community for Jean Barry Sutherland.

1269
01:42:21,865 --> 01:42:25,866
[SPEAKER_07]: While I didn't get to know her personally, she was here prior to me.

1270
01:42:26,246 --> 01:42:31,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew her name early in my career at the school, and I've heard many positive stories about her.

1271
01:42:33,089 --> 01:42:37,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel that she does represent a very positive member of our community as a school.

1272
01:42:38,431 --> 01:42:46,635
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, I was able to have a conversation with some of the teachers who signed the letter that we read at the beginning of the meeting.

1273
01:42:46,655 --> 01:42:53,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do agree with the teachers from the school who expressed that the school should be named after a place rather than a person.

1274
01:42:53,419 --> 01:42:57,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And for this reason, I also support the name being the Missitech.

1275
01:43:02,435 --> 01:43:02,795
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1276
01:43:06,356 --> 01:43:07,296
[SPEAKER_19]: Josie Dufour.

1277
01:43:11,797 --> 01:43:28,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of my main points were actually already spoken by many people, but my top three choices were in this order, Belinda Sutton, Lydia Maria Child, and Missituck.

1278
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:40,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I liked the idea of naming a school after Belinda Sutton because she was one of the highest rated names in our rankings I know those don't really matter that much anymore.

1279
01:43:41,062 --> 01:43:45,186
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, she was also a popular choice within the community.

1280
01:43:47,148 --> 01:43:55,512
[SPEAKER_00]: She's also significant to multiple historically marginalized groups as she was an enslaved black woman.

1281
01:43:55,532 --> 01:44:06,658
[SPEAKER_00]: And she did something that not a lot of people would have thought she would have been able to do at the time as she wasn't educated.

1282
01:44:06,678 --> 01:44:14,602
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, most of my points were said, so I'm gonna go on to Lydia Maria Child.

1283
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:20,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was our highest rated name from our rankings.

1284
01:44:21,393 --> 01:44:32,058
[SPEAKER_00]: And she helped fight for, she was an abolitionist and helped fight for the rights of enslaved people and the Native Americans in the community.

1285
01:44:34,099 --> 01:44:38,442
[SPEAKER_00]: She was born in Medford and wrote the very famous poem, Over the River and Through the Woods.

1286
01:44:40,127 --> 01:44:53,097
[SPEAKER_00]: She even kept fighting for people, even though it was ruining her reputation at the time.

1287
01:44:53,918 --> 01:45:00,743
[SPEAKER_00]: And she eventually became the editor of the National Anti-Slavery Standard, one of the first anti-slavery newspapers.

1288
01:45:02,355 --> 01:45:18,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I also liked the idea of naming the school after the river as, like the teachers said, all humans are flawed and the location and geography of the area is mostly static.

1289
01:45:19,368 --> 01:45:24,912
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be the least polarizing choice and no one group would feel left out.

1290
01:45:25,372 --> 01:45:29,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And it alludes to the original name of the school, which was Mystic.

1291
01:45:32,189 --> 01:45:36,933
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like we should mention that all of the other schools are already named after people.

1292
01:45:37,453 --> 01:45:41,977
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the other two names would be more fitting.

1293
01:45:45,159 --> 01:45:59,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And while no one is perfect, enough time has passed since their deaths that we know that they were important to history and that they did not commit any major atrocities.

1294
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:10,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but as 15 seconds location names go, I think Mr. Tuck is one of the best ones there.

1295
01:46:13,745 --> 01:46:14,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1296
01:46:14,045 --> 01:46:14,425
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1297
01:46:14,445 --> 01:46:17,006
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1298
01:46:18,027 --> 01:46:19,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I'm left.

1299
01:46:21,168 --> 01:46:22,208
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to thank everybody.

1300
01:46:22,469 --> 01:46:26,270
[SPEAKER_19]: It was, uh, everybody made some passion speeches tonight.

1301
01:46:27,211 --> 01:46:27,831
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that, uh,

1302
01:46:28,902 --> 01:46:33,164
[SPEAKER_19]: remind everybody that we're just picking three and the school committee is gonna make their final choice.

1303
01:46:34,545 --> 01:46:41,929
[SPEAKER_19]: So I, myself, I'd like to just read what I had put together here.

1304
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:45,531
[SPEAKER_19]: I had only put one name forward.

1305
01:46:46,632 --> 01:46:50,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody else did a good job with the other names that were mentioned tonight.

1306
01:46:51,034 --> 01:46:53,436
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'd like to read something, Jean Barry Sutherland.

1307
01:46:54,436 --> 01:46:57,178
[SPEAKER_19]: As I read through the hundreds of submissions in her name,

1308
01:46:58,348 --> 01:47:00,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything I read is true over and over.

1309
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:04,893
[SPEAKER_19]: The same message of an outstanding role model of a human being and an educator.

1310
01:47:06,514 --> 01:47:08,035
[SPEAKER_19]: I had the pleasure of knowing Miss Barry.

1311
01:47:08,075 --> 01:47:12,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Both of my children attended the Dame school and had her as a teacher and vice principal.

1312
01:47:13,038 --> 01:47:17,001
[SPEAKER_19]: I would see her and her sister power walk every day after dinner, they go by my house.

1313
01:47:18,522 --> 01:47:21,264
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to read a few of the letters from the submissions we received.

1314
01:47:22,571 --> 01:47:27,233
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a former colleague wrote, Jean has left her footprint on many hearts, including mine.

1315
01:47:27,913 --> 01:47:30,153
[SPEAKER_19]: As the old saying goes, she was one in a million.

1316
01:47:30,874 --> 01:47:32,674
[SPEAKER_19]: Jean had so many outstanding qualities.

1317
01:47:32,754 --> 01:47:33,935
[SPEAKER_19]: I will share a few with you.

1318
01:47:34,815 --> 01:47:38,316
[SPEAKER_19]: At the time I was the assistant director of special education.

1319
01:47:38,376 --> 01:47:41,997
[SPEAKER_19]: I observed Jean to be an exceptionally dedicated, strong leader.

1320
01:47:42,637 --> 01:47:44,738
[SPEAKER_19]: She led by example and always with a smile.

1321
01:47:44,898 --> 01:47:45,979
[SPEAKER_19]: She was a people person.

1322
01:47:46,459 --> 01:47:50,560
[SPEAKER_19]: She inspired her staff to do more and learn more ways to teach all children.

1323
01:47:51,107 --> 01:47:54,149
[SPEAKER_19]: She created an environment where every child was treated with respect.

1324
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:59,974
[SPEAKER_19]: Jean welcomed all children in the citywide special education programs to the Columbus School.

1325
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:03,016
[SPEAKER_19]: She considered all students in the Columbus her students.

1326
01:48:03,557 --> 01:48:04,998
[SPEAKER_19]: She knew the IEP plans.

1327
01:48:05,699 --> 01:48:07,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Often she attended IEP meetings.

1328
01:48:08,121 --> 01:48:11,563
[SPEAKER_19]: She attended the weekly meetings with the consultants, WIDECO.

1329
01:48:12,444 --> 01:48:17,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Jean believed that all students should be fully integrated to the extent possible.

1330
01:48:18,766 --> 01:48:20,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Jean and I worked as a team.

1331
01:48:20,648 --> 01:48:25,111
[SPEAKER_19]: She was determined to create the best possible environment for the special education students as she did.

1332
01:48:25,692 --> 01:48:29,135
[SPEAKER_19]: She demonstrated her commitment to the students in so many positive ways.

1333
01:48:29,695 --> 01:48:34,379
[SPEAKER_19]: She greeted students daily coming into school, in the cafeteria and leaving school.

1334
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:36,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Talk about being a hard worker.

1335
01:48:36,561 --> 01:48:38,163
[SPEAKER_19]: Jean arrived at work 6 a.m.

1336
01:48:38,223 --> 01:48:39,704
[SPEAKER_19]: and usually left at 6 p.m.

1337
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:45,449
[SPEAKER_19]: Before and after school hours were devoted to planning and staff, resolving issues, meeting parents,

1338
01:48:46,004 --> 01:48:48,546
[SPEAKER_19]: meeting with consultants and the special education team.

1339
01:48:49,046 --> 01:48:52,049
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you believe Jean had obtained a license to drive a school bus?

1340
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:58,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Jean's worth ethic emulated a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt.

1341
01:48:58,914 --> 01:49:01,636
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not fair to ask of others what you're not willing to do yourself.

1342
01:49:02,777 --> 01:49:08,882
[SPEAKER_19]: Jean asked every staff member to do what she asked the staff to do what she was willing to do.

1343
01:49:11,175 --> 01:49:13,276
[SPEAKER_19]: She led by example and always with a smile.

1344
01:49:13,356 --> 01:49:16,217
[SPEAKER_19]: She was a role model for hard work, integrity, and leadership.

1345
01:49:18,779 --> 01:49:25,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Another quote from a former principal at the Columbus Road, Jean Barry Sutherland epitomizes all that is wonderful about teaching.

1346
01:49:25,662 --> 01:49:29,044
[SPEAKER_19]: Her passion was always working for the children of Medford Public Schools.

1347
01:49:29,824 --> 01:49:32,425
[SPEAKER_19]: I had the privilege of knowing her in so many capacities.

1348
01:49:32,465 --> 01:49:33,446
[SPEAKER_19]: She taught my children.

1349
01:49:33,486 --> 01:49:35,467
[SPEAKER_19]: She mentored me as a principal at the Columbus.

1350
01:49:36,621 --> 01:49:39,122
[SPEAKER_19]: My most precious relationship was that of a friend.

1351
01:49:39,282 --> 01:49:45,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Her integrity, passion, knowledge, friendship, and sense of humor made Jean a woman to be admired.

1352
01:49:45,526 --> 01:49:50,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Her legacy would be honored by naming a school the Jean Barry Sutherland Elementary School.

1353
01:49:50,609 --> 01:49:52,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for considering my input.

1354
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:54,651
[SPEAKER_19]: A former student and now a teacher wrote,

1355
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:59,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Gene Barry Sutherland set a standard for excellence as a teacher and a principal.

1356
01:49:59,061 --> 01:50:01,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Gene Barry was an excellent leader and a great role model.

1357
01:50:01,982 --> 01:50:11,044
[SPEAKER_19]: She taught us lessons that textbooks would never teach, such as respect, self-worth, being kind to one another, and the importance of coming into the building with a smile each day.

1358
01:50:11,905 --> 01:50:16,666
[SPEAKER_19]: Gene Barry Sutherland left an incredible mark on me as she did with thousands of other students.

1359
01:50:17,438 --> 01:50:19,840
[SPEAKER_19]: and educators who were lucky enough to cross her path.

1360
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:24,804
[SPEAKER_19]: It is not often you come across such a genuine, dedicated, and truly outstanding individual.

1361
01:50:25,384 --> 01:50:29,568
[SPEAKER_19]: However, the students in the Medford's public school system were among those fortunate enough.

1362
01:50:30,528 --> 01:50:37,334
[SPEAKER_19]: I find this quote, leave it better than you found it, to be extremely representative and accurate of Jean Barry Sutherland's career in Medford.

1363
01:50:38,335 --> 01:50:40,036
[SPEAKER_19]: The impact she's had is immeasurable.

1364
01:50:40,076 --> 01:50:46,281
[SPEAKER_19]: However, her legacy will live on within thousands of students that had the honor of learning and growing

1365
01:50:47,315 --> 01:50:51,118
[SPEAKER_19]: from her, the Medford public school system is a better place because of Ms.

1366
01:50:51,138 --> 01:50:51,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Barry Sutherland.

1367
01:50:53,239 --> 01:50:57,662
[SPEAKER_19]: This entire process has brought the vision and anger to many citizens of Medford.

1368
01:50:58,142 --> 01:51:09,530
[SPEAKER_19]: The criteria by which we tried to arrive at the right name, potential to bring the city together, the community together, role model to Medford students and represents Medford community's proud history.

1369
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:11,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Jean Barry Sutherland is all that.

1370
01:51:11,852 --> 01:51:12,892
[SPEAKER_19]: 15 seconds.

1371
01:51:13,253 --> 01:51:16,675
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not just talking about an educator, we're talking about a daughter of Medford.

1372
01:51:17,608 --> 01:51:19,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Respectfully submitted, Jim Lister.

1373
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:22,730
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, thank you.

1374
01:51:24,831 --> 01:51:27,493
[SPEAKER_19]: So next we're gonna vote, I would assume, correct?

1375
01:51:30,754 --> 01:51:31,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1376
01:51:39,438 --> 01:51:43,320
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're voting for, go through and read the name.

1377
01:51:48,956 --> 01:51:49,776
[SPEAKER_19]: of the remaining 14.

1378
01:51:50,877 --> 01:51:57,260
[SPEAKER_19]: And each person gets one vote, Patrick?

1379
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:02,642
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, Jim, is it 14 or is it 13 remaining?

1380
01:52:03,202 --> 01:52:06,383
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we had 18 and we eliminated, you're right, 13, I'm sorry.

1381
01:52:06,403 --> 01:52:07,744
[SPEAKER_19]: We eliminated five.

1382
01:52:16,568 --> 01:52:16,708
[SPEAKER_19]: So,

1383
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:27,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me... I've got it on the list.

1384
01:52:28,264 --> 01:52:32,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Bree Brothers, would you like to tell me your one choice, please?

[SPEAKER_19]: I don't hear you, Laura.

1403
01:53:39,676 --> 01:53:40,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you there?

01:53:43,297 --> 01:53:48,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Laura, you're muted, or I unmuted you, but your sound isn't coming through.

[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to chat, then chat.

[SPEAKER_03]: Type it in the chat.

[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Jim?

1438
01:55:58,947 --> 01:55:59,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1439
01:55:59,767 --> 01:56:01,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Only three names got votes.

1440
01:56:02,547 --> 01:56:02,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1441
01:56:02,988 --> 01:56:04,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean the three names move on?

1442
01:56:08,044 --> 01:56:11,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Not what we voted on, but I would accept that.

1443
01:56:12,326 --> 01:56:14,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we finally make something easy?

1444
01:56:15,967 --> 01:56:17,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Only three names got voted on.

1445
01:56:17,808 --> 01:56:19,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it's common sense.

1446
01:56:20,289 --> 01:56:20,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1447
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not the process.

1448
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:23,611

01:57:44,586 --> 01:57:51,368
[SPEAKER_26]: that we're missing again, Shaughnessy and... I think Shaughnessy, why am I not?

1454
01:57:54,349 --> 01:57:55,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Hendrick would have been your 22.

1455
01:57:56,729 --> 01:58:00,330
[SPEAKER_19]: No, 23, he made 23.

1456
01:58:00,370 --> 01:58:00,330
23.

1457
01:58:01,870 --> 01:58:04,611
[SPEAKER_19]: And now we have one missing, so we're 21.

1458
01:58:06,792 --> 01:58:07,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Isn't this a quorum?

1459
01:58:08,532 --> 01:58:11,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so I'm just trying to count votes here though and add up, we should have 21 votes.

1460
01:58:12,782 --> 01:58:14,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim, did you take Laura's from the chat?

1461
01:58:16,364 --> 01:58:16,745
[SPEAKER_19]: I did.

1462
01:58:16,885 --> 01:58:18,066
[SPEAKER_19]: She was a Belinda Sutton.

1463
01:58:18,826 --> 01:58:19,407
[SPEAKER_19]: We have 21, Jim.

1464
01:58:19,487 --> 01:58:21,568
[SPEAKER_19]: 7, 2, and 12 is 21.

1465
01:58:22,509 --> 01:58:22,789
[SPEAKER_16]: 7, 2, and 12.

1466
01:58:23,809 --> 01:58:24,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1467
01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:25,391
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1468
01:58:26,311 --> 01:58:26,812
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

1469
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:29,133
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1470
01:58:29,593 --> 01:58:35,217
[SPEAKER_19]: So Belinda moves to the school committee, and we vote again now.

1471
01:58:37,159 --> 01:58:37,519
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct?

1472
01:58:38,519 --> 01:58:38,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

1473
01:58:40,435 --> 01:58:44,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Can a motion be made, Mr. Chair, that we just move on with the three names?

1474
01:58:45,138 --> 01:58:45,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Just asking.

1475
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:55,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a revision to a motion and would require two thirds.

1476
01:58:57,847 --> 01:58:59,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we- We want to make a motion.

1477
01:59:00,028 --> 01:59:01,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a possible set so we can move on?

1478
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:03,250
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get this done?

1479
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:04,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Three names?

1480
01:59:05,672 --> 01:59:07,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Zach, we'll look at the floor.

1481
01:59:07,093 --> 01:59:08,394
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll vote two more times.

1482
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:13,411
[SPEAKER_11]: We have 30 minutes left in this meeting.

1483
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:17,072
[SPEAKER_11]: What it took about five minutes to vote the first time.

1484
01:59:17,732 --> 01:59:24,414
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we're all adults here, or if we're not adults, we signed up to be here.

1485
01:59:24,494 --> 01:59:29,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we can take the next 10 minutes, half hour at most two more times.

1486
01:59:32,857 --> 01:59:33,117
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1487
01:59:33,297 --> 01:59:36,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody wanted to second Paul's motion, correct?

1488
01:59:37,278 --> 01:59:37,798
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll second it.

1489
01:59:41,021 --> 01:59:42,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we can discuss it.

1490
01:59:45,643 --> 01:59:46,964
[SPEAKER_02]: May I, Mr. Chairman?

1491
01:59:47,344 --> 01:59:47,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1492
01:59:48,164 --> 01:59:50,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that we've spoken as a group.

1493
01:59:51,226 --> 01:59:53,987
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked three names, 21 votes.

1494
01:59:54,667 --> 01:59:55,868
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on a time restraint.

1495
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,629
[SPEAKER_02]: The school committee is looking for a name.

1496
01:59:59,529 --> 02:00:00,710
[SPEAKER_02]: We just came up with three.

1497
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:03,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have 30 minutes left.

1498
02:00:03,931 --> 02:00:07,053
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe we need an insurance vote to override the other,

1499
02:00:09,667 --> 02:00:10,888
[SPEAKER_19]: that we passed last week.

1500
02:00:10,908 --> 02:00:16,893
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, if we want to vote on this, we need two thirds to override that as a group.

1501
02:00:16,933 --> 02:00:17,453
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

1502
02:00:17,513 --> 02:00:19,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something we can agree on?

1503
02:00:19,595 --> 02:00:20,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, please.

1504
02:00:20,516 --> 02:00:24,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, my personal opinion is you got three excellent names here.

1505
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:28,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, I would be happy with any of these names.

1506
02:00:29,363 --> 02:00:30,083
[SPEAKER_25]: Anybody else?

1507
02:00:39,987 --> 02:00:41,608
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we should follow the process.

1508
02:00:42,488 --> 02:00:52,034
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got a motion on the floor to vote whether we're going to take them as our three or stay with the process.

1509
02:00:52,074 --> 02:00:55,255
[SPEAKER_19]: If we get two thirds, we'll take these as our three.

1510
02:00:55,295 --> 02:00:56,716
[SPEAKER_19]: If not, we continue the process.

1511
02:00:59,318 --> 02:01:06,101
[SPEAKER_19]: So let me go through a roll call in favor of taking these three or following the process.

1512
02:01:06,141 --> 02:01:08,302
[SPEAKER_19]: So a yes would be in favor of taking these three.

1513
02:01:17,077 --> 02:01:19,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate going first all the time on these.

1514
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:20,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1515
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,641
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just the list I have.

1516
02:01:27,344 --> 02:01:27,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1517
02:01:28,485 --> 02:01:28,705

[SPEAKER_19]: Laura.

1531
02:02:02,343 --> 02:02:04,523
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the information, a yes vote does.

1532
02:02:04,743 --> 02:02:08,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Except these three.

1533
02:02:08,224 --> 02:02:11,444
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

1534
02:02:11,464 --> 02:02:12,284
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, thank you.

1535
02:02:13,444 --> 02:02:15,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Laura just put in the chat that her vote is no.

1536
02:02:16,949 --> 02:02:17,269
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1537
02:02:17,289 --> 02:02:17,669
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_16]: I said, yes.

1549
02:02:44,675 --> 02:02:44,915
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1550
02:02:44,955 --> 02:02:45,315

[SPEAKER_16]: Nope.

1553

[SPEAKER_19]: Is that a no?

[SPEAKER_26]: It's a no.

1555
02:02:53,202 --> 02:02:53,962

[SPEAKER_19]: Josie DeFore.

1571
02:03:23,318 --> 02:03:23,578
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1572
02:03:25,519 --> 02:03:26,780
[SPEAKER_19]: And Jim Lister votes yes.

1573
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:37,605
[SPEAKER_19]: 15 to six.

1574
02:03:37,725 --> 02:03:45,929
[SPEAKER_19]: That passes.

1575
02:03:49,957 --> 02:03:54,998
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are our three, that vote passes and we've accepted these three as our list.

1576
02:03:56,899 --> 02:04:07,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, moving on with this, we had already picked volunteers to break out into groups.

1577
02:04:07,482 --> 02:04:14,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any further discussion on that before I do this?

1578
02:04:16,404 --> 02:04:18,045
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Chairman, if I can ask for a request,

1579
02:04:19,517 --> 02:04:19,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1580
02:04:20,997 --> 02:04:31,060
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it possible for me as the principal of the Columbus to get like a synopsis on those three names so that I can share them with the students here and we could hold a voluntary vote?

1581
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:31,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1582
02:04:33,021 --> 02:04:33,361
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1583
02:04:34,401 --> 02:04:35,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we?

1584
02:04:35,722 --> 02:04:39,763
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have to talk about that, how I can get you a synopsis.

1585
02:04:39,843 --> 02:04:40,083
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean,

1586
02:04:41,564 --> 02:04:48,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, Dr. K, I would suggest getting the video of everybody giving your three minutes.

1587
02:04:48,328 --> 02:04:52,250
[SPEAKER_24]: That should compile together to give you a pretty good idea of what you should be including.

1588
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:58,073
[SPEAKER_24]: I just don't know if anybody, I mean, the group that's writing these presentations is going to be busy this week.

1589
02:04:58,133 --> 02:05:00,614
[SPEAKER_24]: So I would suggest that's a good outlet.

1590
02:05:03,256 --> 02:05:07,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably get a synopsis of all three names.

1591
02:05:07,898 --> 02:05:08,719
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great, Josie.

1592
02:05:08,939 --> 02:05:09,379
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll take it.

1593
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:11,240
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1594
02:05:13,891 --> 02:05:16,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Does the rest of this committee have to see the synopsis?

1595
02:05:16,393 --> 02:05:17,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we all happy with that?

1596
02:05:21,477 --> 02:05:29,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Josie is on the committee, so maybe that could be a shared task.

1597
02:05:30,265 --> 02:05:31,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, what did you say?

1598
02:05:32,567 --> 02:05:33,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Shared task, I think she said.

1599
02:05:34,328 --> 02:05:35,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Shared task, OK.

1600
02:05:37,831 --> 02:05:40,754
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, so we could all get a look at it, Josie, right?

1601

[SPEAKER_24]: sure okay thank you and we're presenting june 7th correct so i would need it before that correct we're gonna meet next week june june 4th kind of information mr chairman yes we have another resolution uh on our agenda from laura we were looking at june 3rd i believe to meet

[SPEAKER_19]: So,

1604
02:06:49,315 --> 02:06:55,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, we're going to vote on that last resolution to give the school committee all our records.

1605
02:06:56,698 --> 02:06:57,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I get a motion on that?

1606
02:06:59,759 --> 02:07:02,921
[SPEAKER_19]: Would someone like to make a motion and a second, and then we'll speak on it?

1607
02:07:04,882 --> 02:07:06,502
[SPEAKER_19]: Laura, would you like to make the motion?

1608
02:07:06,522 --> 02:07:15,446
[SPEAKER_08]: She's still having issues with her speaker.

1609
02:07:15,946 --> 02:07:17,587
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, I'll read it then.

1610
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:22,413
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll read it and then we can ask for a second.

1611
02:07:24,916 --> 02:07:40,530
[SPEAKER_19]: So her motion, her resolution, motion that in order to aid the school committee in their deliberations, the school committee shall receive in their June 7th, 2021 documents the following items.

1612
02:07:41,288 --> 02:07:45,090
[SPEAKER_19]: created or received by this committee offered by Laura Rotolo.

1613
02:07:45,631 --> 02:07:51,394
[SPEAKER_19]: All agendas and minutes of the meetings of this committee up until June 7th, 2021.

1614
02:07:52,034 --> 02:08:03,861
[SPEAKER_19]: A document entitled suggestions for new names for the Columbus Elementary School or any other document showing all of the names submitted by the public.

1615
02:08:06,403 --> 02:08:10,585
[SPEAKER_19]: C, a document entitled names for PC randomization

1616
02:08:11,562 --> 02:08:21,084
[SPEAKER_19]: or any other document showing the random assignment of names of two members of the committees for research and scoring.

1617
02:08:22,224 --> 02:08:32,126
[SPEAKER_19]: D, a document entitled final scores renaming Columbus school or any other document showing the committee members scoring of the submissions by the public.

1618
02:08:33,706 --> 02:08:40,588
[SPEAKER_19]: E, the top 18 score sheets created by each member of this committee showing the scores given to each of the top 18 names.

1619
02:08:42,785 --> 02:08:53,172
[SPEAKER_19]: F, a document titled 18 scoring sheets renaming Columbus or any other document showing the total score given to each of the top 18 names by each member of this committee.

1620
02:08:54,353 --> 02:09:05,020
[SPEAKER_19]: G, all of the responses submitted by the public to the survey created by this committee and made available to the public from May 13th, 2021 to May 20, 2021.

1621
02:09:07,302 --> 02:09:12,105
[SPEAKER_19]: H, all letters of communications to this committee by the members of the public

1622
02:09:12,506 --> 02:09:14,648
[SPEAKER_19]: relating to the committee's jurisdiction.

1623
02:09:15,969 --> 02:09:23,495
[SPEAKER_19]: I, a presentation created by the subcommittee of this committee relating to the final names presented for consideration to the school committee.

1624
02:09:24,276 --> 02:09:30,581
[SPEAKER_19]: And J, any other record created or received by this committee that the school committee may request.

1625
02:09:30,681 --> 02:09:36,686
[SPEAKER_19]: So the motion is to give everything we have to the school committee upon our completion.

1626
02:09:36,706 --> 02:09:39,608
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say it's arrived, correct?

1627
02:09:39,928 --> 02:09:40,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me?

1628
02:09:40,939 --> 02:09:42,680
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say anything that's in the drive.

1629
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:43,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1630
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:44,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, okay.

1631
02:09:46,081 --> 02:09:46,842
[SPEAKER_19]: I second the motion.

1632
02:09:47,962 --> 02:09:49,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Second the motion, thank you, Ron.

1633
02:09:49,263 --> 02:09:50,323
[SPEAKER_19]: Any discussion on that?

1634
02:09:51,944 --> 02:09:57,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to ask if our statements from this meeting would be part of this.

1635
02:09:58,947 --> 02:10:00,947
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is recorded, I would assume so.

1636
02:10:01,788 --> 02:10:03,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Plus the notes, Maria, that I'm taking now.

1637
02:10:04,449 --> 02:10:05,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1638
02:10:05,329 --> 02:10:06,830
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll be in the drive as well.

1639
02:10:08,015 --> 02:10:09,017
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the emails?

1640
02:10:09,057 --> 02:10:10,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we say the emails?

1641
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:12,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It's listed in here.

1642
02:10:12,884 --> 02:10:17,292
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1643
02:10:17,793 --> 02:10:18,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me now, Mr. Chair?

1644
02:10:20,216 --> 02:10:20,496
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1645
02:10:21,137 --> 02:10:21,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, great.

1646
02:10:22,357 --> 02:10:22,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

1647
02:10:23,218 --> 02:10:23,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1648
02:10:23,558 --> 02:10:28,121
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to make sure that the committee had everything it needed to, in case it needed anything in the background.

1649
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:31,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I think if we want to send the entire drive, that's fine.

1650
02:10:31,903 --> 02:10:41,308
[SPEAKER_15]: I just made sure to pick out the ones that seemed to me to tell the story, but I would also be, I would accept a friendly amendment to move the entire drive over.

1651
02:10:41,328 --> 02:10:47,512
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how difficult that is to do and how accessible that will be to the school committee and the public.

1652
02:10:48,424 --> 02:10:50,886
[SPEAKER_17]: The school committee has a drive, that's why I suggested it.

1653
02:10:51,867 --> 02:10:58,954
[SPEAKER_17]: And when it's on the, anything that's on the agenda, we send to a drive so they can read it.

1654
02:10:59,414 --> 02:11:10,504
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would probably just be easier in the interest of time, because next week is just a crazy week for both Susie and I. So I think that would be the easiest, but you guys are the committee, so just let me know.

1655
02:11:11,986 --> 02:11:14,188
[SPEAKER_17]: And would the public have access to that entire drive?

1656
02:11:17,665 --> 02:11:21,892
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, eventually I'd have to post it, but I don't know if the public would have it.

1657
02:11:22,673 --> 02:11:23,935
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd have to post just the website.

1658
02:11:23,955 --> 02:11:29,744
[SPEAKER_17]: I would think after it's all accepted by the school committee, I think that's the process link.

1659
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:39,094
[SPEAKER_17]: And not that it's not public record, it's just that I know nothing, but the notes have been posted so far, to my knowledge anyway, I don't know.

1660
02:11:39,594 --> 02:11:46,518
[SPEAKER_17]: And anything that happened within the school committee regarding the establishment of this committee is already on the drive.

1661
02:11:46,998 --> 02:11:48,859
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's already on the website.

1662
02:11:51,007 --> 02:11:55,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I just need to make sure that, yeah, that the public is able to access it.

1663
02:11:56,170 --> 02:12:01,233
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, well, I guess for the June 7th meeting would be the most- Well, yes, they'll be able to access it.

1664
02:12:01,293 --> 02:12:08,857
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll be on the website the day of the meeting, because that's what we do with articles that are in the agenda folder, if that makes sense.

1665
02:12:09,457 --> 02:12:09,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1666
02:12:09,797 --> 02:12:10,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1667
02:12:10,718 --> 02:12:12,019
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a process, I'm sorry.

1668
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:14,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1669
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:14,920
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine with me.

1670
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:15,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Lisa.

1671
02:12:15,441 --> 02:12:17,121
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1672
02:12:17,141 --> 02:12:17,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Lisa.

1673
02:12:18,922 --> 02:12:19,143
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1674
02:12:22,202 --> 02:12:28,544
[SPEAKER_19]: Lisa, what day next week did you say was good for us?

1675
02:12:29,184 --> 02:12:34,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Monday, I mean, I'm sorry, Tuesday, we have budget at seven, so I could meet from four to six.

1676
02:12:37,346 --> 02:12:39,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Wednesday's out because it's graduation.

1677
02:12:39,107 --> 02:12:46,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Thursday, although it's the prom, I can do either five to seven or four to six.

1678
02:12:46,669 --> 02:12:48,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Just an extra to assist the prom.

1679
02:12:50,945 --> 02:12:52,707
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have to be there right when it starts.

1680
02:12:54,369 --> 02:12:54,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1681
02:12:56,611 --> 02:12:58,192
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why it's just a crazy week folks.

1682
02:12:58,232 --> 02:12:58,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1683
02:12:59,314 --> 02:13:01,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Got to help those seniors leave on a happy note.

1684
02:13:03,738 --> 02:13:04,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1685
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:05,600
[SPEAKER_22]: What time is the prom start?

1686
02:13:08,305 --> 02:13:09,346
[SPEAKER_17]: You had to ask me, Lou.

1687
02:13:09,506 --> 02:13:10,926
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if it's six or seven.

1688
02:13:10,987 --> 02:13:12,527
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to be there helping too, that's why.

1689
02:13:12,587 --> 02:13:13,448
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's six.

1690
02:13:13,488 --> 02:13:13,828
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1691
02:13:13,868 --> 02:13:14,549
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's six.

1692
02:13:15,149 --> 02:13:15,649
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it six?

1693
02:13:15,749 --> 02:13:16,029
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1694
02:13:16,350 --> 02:13:18,631
[SPEAKER_17]: And what about, what time does graduation start?

1695
02:13:18,651 --> 02:13:19,771
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I'm helping at graduation.

1696
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:20,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Six.

1697
02:13:20,612 --> 02:13:22,733
[SPEAKER_17]: But we'd probably need you there earlier than that, Cass.

1698
02:13:24,914 --> 02:13:25,855
[SPEAKER_22]: Lou, do you have a date?

1699
02:13:27,656 --> 02:13:29,017
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm in charge of sound, so.

1700
02:13:31,958 --> 02:13:33,199
[SPEAKER_22]: Unless you're offering, Danny.

1701
02:13:34,807 --> 02:13:35,608
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1702
02:13:35,928 --> 02:13:38,531
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like Tuesday four to six would be the best day for us.

1703
02:13:39,272 --> 02:13:39,592
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

1704
02:13:39,612 --> 02:13:42,755
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1705
02:13:44,197 --> 02:13:45,778
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr Chairman, on the motion.

1706
02:13:46,239 --> 02:13:47,821
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I just have one.

1707
02:13:47,841 --> 02:13:54,507
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, I hope it's a friendly amendment, but article I where we give them our presentation.

1708
02:13:55,128 --> 02:13:55,869
[SPEAKER_24]: That means that

1709
02:13:56,368 --> 02:14:04,557
[SPEAKER_24]: The short time we have to create a presentation, now we have to put it in their packet, I assume on June 4th, which takes another two days off the timeframe.

1710
02:14:04,777 --> 02:14:07,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Plus, you know, I've been in sales most of my life.

1711
02:14:07,821 --> 02:14:13,867
[SPEAKER_24]: I never had a situation where I gave a presentation, delivered it three days before I was actually doing the presentation.

1712
02:14:14,648 --> 02:14:21,750
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, you know, Ron, you can just have it so that when the because the school committee will ask for a copy of it.

1713
02:14:21,770 --> 02:14:23,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, no, I have no problem.

1714
02:14:23,491 --> 02:14:24,151
[SPEAKER_17]: No, absolutely.

1715
02:14:24,171 --> 02:14:26,331
[SPEAKER_24]: I would want to hand it to them that that night.

1716
02:14:26,471 --> 02:14:35,674
[SPEAKER_24]: But my point is, if we can just send it to them in an email, it's probably the easiest way to resolute the resolution states in their package, which I assume is June 4.

1717
02:14:35,814 --> 02:14:41,976
[SPEAKER_24]: So I would like to hold the presentation and all the work that's going to be done on that presentation until

1718
02:14:43,835 --> 02:14:44,075
[SPEAKER_24]: June 7.

1719
02:14:44,115 --> 02:14:49,897
[SPEAKER_24]: So everything else is fine with me, just the Article I. I just am having a problem with both those factors.

1720
02:14:53,238 --> 02:14:58,060
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I may, Mr. Chair, I accept that friendly amendment.

1721
02:14:58,080 --> 02:14:59,400
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hear two friendly amendments.

1722
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:04,942
[SPEAKER_15]: One is to, instead of enumerate A through H for the entire drive being moved over for the June 4th,

1723
02:15:06,148 --> 02:15:11,969
[SPEAKER_15]: and that we provide the presentation at the June 7th meeting, not before.

1724
02:15:12,009 --> 02:15:13,770
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that we probably don't want to rush ourselves.

1725
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:18,691
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, all I'm saying is that that presentation is going to be on the shared drive.

1726
02:15:18,751 --> 02:15:22,892
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't send that to them, is what I'm asking to do, because it won't be ready.

1727
02:15:22,912 --> 02:15:24,052
[SPEAKER_24]: It just won't be ready.

1728
02:15:24,372 --> 02:15:25,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, right.

1729
02:15:26,973 --> 02:15:28,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, anything else on that?

1730
02:15:29,923 --> 02:15:31,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody in favor of that?

1731
02:15:32,164 --> 02:15:33,585
[SPEAKER_20]: I do have a question, point of information.

1732
02:15:33,946 --> 02:15:34,686
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

1733
02:15:34,786 --> 02:15:43,972
[SPEAKER_20]: I do believe, I thought the last time we met, we said that we would, perhaps we would have a copy of the presentation so we could look it over and we could discuss it at our next meeting, but not actually post it.

1734
02:15:44,692 --> 02:15:45,773
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that still what we're considering?

1735
02:15:45,793 --> 02:15:47,434
[SPEAKER_19]: I think so.

1736
02:15:47,714 --> 02:15:49,776
[SPEAKER_19]: We have, I was going to get into the groups next.

1737
02:15:51,517 --> 02:15:55,879
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we have 10 people that volunteered to work on the three names.

1738
02:15:56,260 --> 02:15:56,800
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of order.

1739
02:15:57,560 --> 02:16:02,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that we can actually do that under open meeting law.

1740
02:16:03,164 --> 02:16:11,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that we can actually distribute that presentation on an email list for us to review.

1741
02:16:12,972 --> 02:16:18,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it theoretically could be as part of our agenda, et cetera.

1742
02:16:19,197 --> 02:16:19,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1743
02:16:19,958 --> 02:16:22,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone may be more familiar with OML.

1744
02:16:24,056 --> 02:16:25,317
[SPEAKER_04]: time in.

1745
02:16:25,537 --> 02:16:26,097
[SPEAKER_24]: I would agree.

1746
02:16:26,157 --> 02:16:38,164
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the only way to do this, and I've mentioned this before, is if individuals write up a presentation based on the guidelines the committee has, we can open them all up on Tuesday and look at them.

1747
02:16:38,444 --> 02:16:42,146
[SPEAKER_24]: I think open meeting law says we can send them, just not talk about them.

1748
02:16:42,206 --> 02:16:49,010
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe we can have presentations ready for individuals to look at and then come together.

1749
02:16:49,150 --> 02:16:52,172
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's really nothing more to do other than the presentation.

1750
02:16:52,212 --> 02:16:52,332
[SPEAKER_24]: So

1751
02:16:53,110 --> 02:17:02,877
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, hopefully our committee can at least provide a, um, base for us to get to everybody prior to Tuesday night's meeting.

1752
02:17:02,977 --> 02:17:04,218
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we can just edit away.

1753
02:17:05,219 --> 02:17:06,339
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1754
02:17:06,399 --> 02:17:08,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we vote the motion first?

1755
02:17:08,341 --> 02:17:08,561
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1756
02:17:08,701 --> 02:17:13,705
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we're going to break off into figure out what group is going to handle which presentation.

1757
02:17:13,985 --> 02:17:14,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1758
02:17:15,446 --> 02:17:17,087
[SPEAKER_19]: So on the motion.

1759
02:17:19,312 --> 02:17:23,375
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I, I think we can do this with a yes or no.

1760
02:17:23,395 --> 02:17:25,077
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't need to go through the roll call.

1761
02:17:26,138 --> 02:17:37,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Is everyone in favor of the resolution to turn over all the information to the school committee and hold off and give the presentation at the meeting and turn that over?

1762
02:17:37,888 --> 02:17:39,429
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe that's what the motion is, right?

1763
02:17:39,969 --> 02:17:40,810
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

1764
02:17:41,431 --> 02:17:41,751
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1765
02:17:42,331 --> 02:17:42,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1766
02:17:42,572 --> 02:17:42,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1767
02:17:43,372 --> 02:17:43,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1768
02:17:43,813 --> 02:17:44,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1769
02:17:44,553 --> 02:17:44,934
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1770
02:17:45,214 --> 02:17:45,934
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone opposed?

1771
02:17:47,456 --> 02:17:47,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1772
02:17:48,092 --> 02:17:49,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Unanimous, all the ayes, thank you.

1773
02:17:50,894 --> 02:18:01,922
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so we have 10 volunteers and I'd like to just figure out who's gonna be with, write up something on who here.

1774
02:18:02,562 --> 02:18:05,604
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, on our three names that we've chosen.

1775
02:18:05,684 --> 02:18:11,228
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll get on the list and you tell me which one you're interested in.

1776
02:18:11,248 --> 02:18:16,552
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that'll be best to put the person that that was their choice.

1777
02:18:18,677 --> 02:18:20,298
[SPEAKER_19]: They already have something written probably.

1778
02:18:21,359 --> 02:18:22,179
[SPEAKER_19]: Maria Rosha?

1779
02:18:22,199 --> 02:18:24,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question.

1780
02:18:25,281 --> 02:18:27,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we splitting into groups per name?

1781
02:18:28,122 --> 02:18:32,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Could we not simply all edit the names right up?

1782
02:18:32,185 --> 02:18:39,589
[SPEAKER_19]: For the presentation, we had talked about separating into a group for each name and doing the presentation.

1783
02:18:39,789 --> 02:18:41,310
[SPEAKER_19]: That group could work on that name.

1784
02:18:41,810 --> 02:18:42,891
[SPEAKER_19]: I may be wrong.

1785
02:18:42,911 --> 02:18:47,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you mean as in at the actual school committee meeting or simply

1786
02:18:50,549 --> 02:18:58,624
[SPEAKER_19]: So at the school committee meeting at the school committee meeting, each group was going to do the board.

1787
02:18:58,664 --> 02:18:58,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1788
02:19:01,823 --> 02:19:08,668
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually, if I'm recalling correctly, we decided that we wouldn't be splitting up into individual teams.

1789
02:19:09,368 --> 02:19:20,916
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a job for, that was delegated to the committee itself as part of their job.

1790
02:19:21,416 --> 02:19:28,301
[SPEAKER_04]: They can determine how they want to assign the,

1791
02:19:30,439 --> 02:19:32,559
[SPEAKER_04]: the names in the committee.

1792
02:19:33,460 --> 02:19:36,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a part of the committee as a whole.

1793
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:39,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It is part of the responsibility of the subcommittee.

1794
02:19:40,521 --> 02:19:43,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to confirm what Seth has said.

1795
02:19:43,681 --> 02:19:54,283
[SPEAKER_08]: The subcommittee can now, since it was my motion, the subcommittee can now go back and we can decide how we want to split up the names and make sure the information provided is set.

1796
02:19:59,423 --> 02:20:12,413
[SPEAKER_08]: That is something the subcommittee can do, and it'll be ready for us to then come together at our next meeting for all of us to talk about it.

1797
02:20:12,433 --> 02:20:15,896
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're talking about having a subcommittee meeting here.

1798
02:20:17,297 --> 02:20:18,057
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that what you're saying?

1799
02:20:18,117 --> 02:20:22,280
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought we can't have a meeting unless it's an open meeting.

1800
02:20:22,681 --> 02:20:24,122
[SPEAKER_19]: We have 10 people that volunteered.

1801
02:20:24,182 --> 02:20:27,925
[SPEAKER_19]: That would violate our open meeting laws.

1802
02:20:30,211 --> 02:20:31,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that a quorum 10?

1803
02:20:36,032 --> 02:20:37,413
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1804
02:20:37,853 --> 02:20:38,653
[SPEAKER_17]: So can't they meet?

1805
02:20:38,993 --> 02:20:39,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Can't you meet?

1806
02:20:40,013 --> 02:20:40,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1807
02:20:41,294 --> 02:20:43,594
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought that was the purpose of keeping it under 12.

1808
02:20:45,015 --> 02:20:45,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1809
02:20:45,995 --> 02:20:57,158
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the purpose of keeping it under 12 was to make sure that we didn't have a quorum so that the subcommittee can do the work without the quorum and having it be a violation of open meeting.

1810
02:20:57,598 --> 02:20:57,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1811
02:20:59,939 --> 02:21:07,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, though, Jim, I think part of what I hear you saying is the subcommittee is really for drafting the presentation.

1812
02:21:08,105 --> 02:21:11,188
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear you talking about the delivery of the presentation, too.

1813
02:21:11,748 --> 02:21:18,433
[SPEAKER_21]: And so, you know, that that might be that obviously is related, but it might also be a different thing.

1814
02:21:20,077 --> 02:21:29,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just a point of clarification, the motion we passed last week did not state anything about who is giving the presentation.

1815
02:21:29,466 --> 02:21:36,091
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is something that our committee or our entire committee needs to decide on.

1816
02:21:36,532 --> 02:21:45,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, well, does everyone I've already sent out emails with this committee, you've all gotten in touch with each other through email.

1817
02:21:48,339 --> 02:21:50,341
[SPEAKER_19]: The 10 volunteers that are on that subcommittee.

1818
02:21:51,922 --> 02:21:52,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1819
02:21:53,863 --> 02:22:02,290
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody's in contact with each other and you have the three names now that we three final finalist names that we can work on.

1820
02:22:03,791 --> 02:22:03,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

1821
02:22:05,172 --> 02:22:05,453
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1822
02:22:06,333 --> 02:22:15,901
[SPEAKER_19]: And I am going to write up the process of how we arrived at this, you know, each meeting, our elimination, how we got to where we are.

1823
02:22:16,946 --> 02:22:24,289
[SPEAKER_19]: and I'll give that to the school committee, and then we'll do a presentation, I guess, on our three names.

1824
02:22:24,969 --> 02:22:28,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Sort of information, Jim, I'm sure you're part of the shared drive.

1825
02:22:29,691 --> 02:22:36,353
[SPEAKER_24]: We've already started building on that, your piece, for you to at least have a base for editing.

1826
02:22:36,813 --> 02:22:37,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1827
02:22:39,594 --> 02:22:39,955
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1828
02:22:41,955 --> 02:22:43,536
[SPEAKER_19]: We're ready to adjourn, Mr. Chairman.

1829
02:22:44,730 --> 02:22:46,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody got anything else before we adjourn?

1830
02:22:47,931 --> 02:22:52,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say thank you to Lisa Evangelista for all your help through this.

1831
02:22:53,612 --> 02:23:03,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I speak on behalf of most of the people here, but I know this was kind of like an extra for you to have thrown in and you've been really awesome and really patient with all of us.

1832
02:23:04,214 --> 02:23:08,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So I truly hope that you enjoy your weekend away with your family.

1833
02:23:09,356 --> 02:23:11,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, thank you so much.

1834
02:23:12,875 --> 02:23:17,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I'm not so sure I've been patient after working all day, all week, but you know, thank you anyway, honey.

1835
02:23:18,936 --> 02:23:19,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Lisa.

1836
02:23:20,797 --> 02:23:21,897
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, motion to adjourn.

1837
02:23:21,917 --> 02:23:23,717
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

1838
02:23:23,757 --> 02:23:24,577
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor.

1839
02:23:25,998 --> 02:23:26,178
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1840
02:23:26,758 --> 02:23:26,918
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1841
02:23:27,318 --> 02:23:27,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1842
02:23:27,578 --> 02:23:27,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1843
02:23:28,498 --> 02:23:29,618
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, thank you, everybody.

1844
02:23:29,638 --> 02:23:30,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a great weekend.

1845
02:23:31,339 --> 02:23:33,319
[SPEAKER_10]: You too, have a nice weekend.

1846
02:23:33,519 --> 02:23:33,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1847
02:23:34,539 --> 02:23:34,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, everybody.

1848
02:23:34,999 --> 02:23:35,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Be safe.

1849
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:36,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
