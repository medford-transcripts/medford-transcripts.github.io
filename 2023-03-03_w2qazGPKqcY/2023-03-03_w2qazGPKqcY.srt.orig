1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:01,653
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's kind of getting to know him.

2
00:00:01,673 --> 00:00:10,463
[SPEAKER_09]: But her son came to her one day and said, I don't know if she's going to be able to teach him in school, treat him properly.

3
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,740
[SPEAKER_09]: She didn't look differently than you.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,800
[SPEAKER_09]: She was kind of skeptical.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what is she doing?

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,883
[SPEAKER_09]: She just reacts differently with me than she does with all the rest of the kids.

7
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Many came out with necrosis.

8
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:40,886
[SPEAKER_09]: To make a long story short, the boy had a conversation with Chief Booker.

9
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:49,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the end, I saw Chief Booker giving the boy his card, saying to the boy and his mother, come and see me.

10
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Just call first to make sure I'm in the right office.

11
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was a positive moment.

12
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,669
[SPEAKER_07]: They're definitely working at it.

13
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:02,890
[SPEAKER_07]: They're definitely taking more of the people first approach, which is

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,771
[SPEAKER_07]: what I'd like to see.

15
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:12,473
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we have all the resources available to promote social, where they have a, you know, community engagement.

16
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:19,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, part of what I push is, use these opportunities where the city has events to get to our community.

17
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:23,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So that your first interaction is not a result of receiving a award.

18
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:28,239
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you don't have to remember everybody's names, but at least,

19
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:40,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really, really happy to see that because we have to start working through the traumas that have been left, and that's through the validation and acknowledgement that there is trauma, and then the willingness to change that.

20
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:41,598
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ongoing trauma.

21
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:09,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And every time we hear or see something terrible in the media, we have to work even harder to replace those memories.

22
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:11,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Because those memories, they take up a lot of time.

23
00:02:12,294 --> 00:02:13,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And they accumulate.

24
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:26,955
[SPEAKER_07]: But I am happy that Black History Month is over for now, because that was a... You know, for me, every day is Black History Month.

25
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:32,617
[SPEAKER_07]: My gosh, I never worked out so much carrying so many cases of water from the grocery store to the back of the event.

26
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:39,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I ended up with, like, 15 extra tablecloths, because every time I went somewhere, I would buy a tablecloth.

27
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't keep track.

28
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:48,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I started with a very organized list of what I needed for each event, and by the end, it was...

29
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:59,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the only thing that stayed on the list was the food, because I had already ordered it.

30
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:07,042
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I've got cases of water just sitting in the office, and cases of seltzer, but that stuff never goes away.

31
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:11,584
[SPEAKER_05]: So the singer said, drop off some water here any time, any time.

32
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:15,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And because I left some at China, so I should have actually done that.

33
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:20,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always, always looking for water, because I think it's going to expire.

34
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:26,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to, I'll have to figure out how to, yeah, when I come back.

35
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:26,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

36
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:28,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye all the time.

37
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:28,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, hello.

38
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:29,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Lisa.

39
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:31,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, nice to meet you.

40
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you.

41
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:33,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for coming.

42
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Lisa.

44
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:39,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to see you again.

45
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So did you have bad COVID?

46
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have long COVID?

47
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

48
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was not great.

49
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:46,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't

50
00:03:49,838 --> 00:04:01,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm getting sinus infections, I get them often, but yeah, just when the weather's good, when it gets really damp, it's just there.

51
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, my brain, it's now.

52
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:11,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I just take stop and send it, you know why.

53
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:15,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi ladies, that's my door.

54
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm exhausted, so it doesn't matter.

55
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:25,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope people aren't staying away because of the winter because nothing's supposed to happen in the world.

56
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep an eye on it.

57
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and Rachel's right.

58
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:29,651
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, but still.

59
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Greg.

60
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:36,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

61
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,175
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

62
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:39,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm well, thank you.

63
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:40,137
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

64
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:40,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

65
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:41,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, how are you?

66
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:42,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

67
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, we're going to go at 710.

68
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:43,840
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

69
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what Facebook are you on?

70
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:51,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys logged into Facebook?

71
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:51,486
OK.

72
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you think it's yours again?

73
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:07,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to check because then I would have to shift it over the center.

74
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of why I'm here tonight.

75
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:22,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously, well, maybe not obviously, but you're not from this area.

76
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:22,641
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

77
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:23,422
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

78
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:24,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Framingham.

79
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:24,882
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

80
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:25,282
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

81
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:25,603
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

82
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:27,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born and raised in Framingham.

83
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:29,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I work for the town of Arlington.

84
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:31,505
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started there at the end of 2019.

85
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And January 2020, I joined the Mystic Valley branch.

86
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:38,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, chaos kind of happened.

87
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:40,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's where I'm from.

88
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:50,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so then what made you first decide to get involved with DEI work in general, and particularly in the town of Arlington?

89
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:53,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so DEI work in general.

90
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:57,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of fell into it, I'll say.

91
00:05:57,704 --> 00:06:02,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So my passions started in undergrad at UMass.

92
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I led our black student union there.

93
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in student government doing diversity work.

94
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:16,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I ever really defined that as my passion, but everything I did afterwards started to weave that in.

95
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:22,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And then actually in grad school, I had not a great first day.

96
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Our diversity workshop was not good.

97
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:30,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I took that to our program director and I was like,

98
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want other students to feel this way next time around.

99
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:40,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And that kind of really kick-started me doing more research and more work in the DEI area.

100
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:56,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up in my last semester working for my program on their practices and then from there I was looking at policy analyst jobs and DEI positions because I had seen a few and I was familiar with Arlington so I applied and it's been great.

101
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a brand new role and I got to build it up to now a division.

102
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:02,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic, fantastic.

103
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:11,061
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you don't mind me asking, can you talk a little bit about your family and how your family life has shaped the person that you are today?

104
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:15,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love my family.

105
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see, where do we start?

106
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:23,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an only child, but I don't act like one.

107
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:30,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So my parents, I'm biracial, so my mom is Irish-Italian-American and my dad is African-American.

108
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,264
[SPEAKER_03]: They met here.

109
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:36,607
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad's family is from Lynchburg, Virginia, so they moved up here.

110
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,950
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom's family, well primarily, she was born in Framingham.

111
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:45,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, they got together.

112
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I happened.

113
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:52,837
[SPEAKER_03]: But they both are one of six and five siblings, so I have lots of cousins.

114
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:59,959
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, I grew up living with a couple of my cousins and aunts, all one big, like, you know that show, Full House?

115
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:00,599
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like that.

116
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, everyone in one house.

117
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:13,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great, and so I don't consider myself an only child in that sense, that I grew up sharing a room, sharing toys, being bullied.

118
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:15,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was the runt.

119
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But my family's always there.

120
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:30,649
[SPEAKER_03]: They've always been supportive and understanding and just allowing me and my cousins to just be ourselves and be curious, which I think is needed, you know.

121
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:36,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they've just been there and always encouraged me to do whatever I wanted to do.

122
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:40,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when I set out for school, I wanted to be an archaeologist.

123
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:43,213
[SPEAKER_03]: look at me now, I'm not digging.

124
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:47,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so hence the major in cultural anthropology.

125
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:47,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

126
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:50,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all right, because I kind of wondered where that came from.

127
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:54,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was on the archaeology track and my field school got canceled.

128
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:57,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took that as a sign that I shouldn't go down that career path.

129
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:01,036
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what they say, when God closes a door, he opens a window.

130
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:02,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So very good, very good.

131
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:10,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you talk about the role of your role models in mentors?

132
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:24,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd say right now my role models have been a couple of professors, both in undergrad and grad school, but also my supervisors that I've had.

133
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:32,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really lucky in all of the jobs I've held out of school that they've been inaugural roles.

134
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:35,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I worked at the Children's Hospital,

135
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:47,458
[SPEAKER_03]: The Autism Center was brand new and I really had the opportunity to build something with my boss and she gave me kind of autonomy to be creative, which I am.

136
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:52,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I also do art on the side, so all of those pieces of my brain are like, let's figure this out in a different way.

137
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And just being there, seeing me for being human.

138
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:04,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And same with my supervisor now, folks that I, she's amazing and it's just,

139
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:08,505
[SPEAKER_03]: They trust me to they hired me they trust me.

140
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:20,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of just build something and keep it moving But yeah, really just seeing people for who they are accepting their flaws encouraging them to You know better themselves.

141
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I constantly Am attending

142
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:30,366
[SPEAKER_03]: conferences and workshops and reading and just doing everything to continue to learn.

143
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:34,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I feel like the work I do especially is, it's a lifelong journey.

144
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,110
[SPEAKER_03]: You're always learning.

145
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just having that encouragement and support has been key from those folks.

146
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:42,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

147
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very good.

148
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:44,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

149
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:51,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you've been doing this work close to two and a half years now, okay, in Arlington.

150
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I just passed three years.

151
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:53,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, three?

152
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:54,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all right.

153
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,579
[SPEAKER_05]: My timeline's a little bit off, okay.

154
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:58,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's even better.

155
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Three years now.

156
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So how goes the battle, so to speak?

157
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:17,943
[SPEAKER_03]: the battles up and down um yeah it's i this is a big question um no it's actually it's great like i'm really lucky that

158
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:37,354
[SPEAKER_03]: The town that I work for I have the support of leadership I say it again and again and again With 2020 if I didn't have the town manager the police chief my supervisor that I had I absolutely would have quit like no doubt But the fact that I was hired before

159
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,595
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that happened.

160
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, like with the murder of George Floyd, you know that racial reawakening.

161
00:11:43,616 --> 00:12:01,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sure that happened They already had the ideas and the initiatives Starting and so I knew that I wasn't being hired to be a fixer or a solution to an incident or a problem And that's made that I know I'm valued.

162
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:01,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and

163
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:11,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So 2020 was rough, but again, I had a great team to be there and take some of the load.

164
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:29,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say the first two years were pretty reactionary, just with the climate in general, you know, dealing with things, providing, so my role has been internal and external, so working with community members, but also employees, which is a lot, and they've recognized that.

165
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:50,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So making sure you know, they're securing funding resources again other DER roles don't necessarily have that in other places But just in this last year, I really I was able to hire two full-time employees and Conduct a community equity audit and start working with our employees as well.

166
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,394
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a really good

167
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:57,326
[SPEAKER_03]: long road, but I think we're at a really good place.

168
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:00,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the workshops were a lot for everyone.

169
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:06,233
[SPEAKER_03]: They ran from October to January and every single employee had to participate.

170
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:08,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't an option.

171
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,755
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just for managers.

172
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:19,002
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, we're all going to do this together because if we're doing this audit, you know, at the minimum, you're going to need the language to understand what

173
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:41,114
[SPEAKER_03]: This is even about I'm really focusing on like how to have discussion like equity work is not easy and it's not quick Oh, yeah, we had that I mean there were sessions where people finally spoke up about not being sure why we're doing this and People were

174
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:46,718
[SPEAKER_03]: shooketh, like, but that's the reality.

175
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:59,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had the opportunity to share with folks, you know, some people were really floored by the things they were hearing, not understanding how someone could have that different view and they work in the same place.

176
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:02,448
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what needs to happen.

177
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:11,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you work in your little silos, and you think everyone's on the same page, when in fact, you're part of a much larger institution that's built upon racist policies and systems.

178
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:13,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, you still have that.

179
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,010
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was good.

180
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,991
[SPEAKER_03]: We shook it up a little bit.

181
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Got people nervous.

182
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:30,562
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting because one of the things that, you know, that, you know, we're finding in Medford is, you know, kind of this whole notion of having the appropriate vocabulary to have the conversation.

183
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:34,745
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a lot of instances, the reasons why we're having so much difficulty

184
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:41,559
[SPEAKER_05]: having a conversation, and we are having difficulty having a conversation, is because people have not developed a vocabulary.

185
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:58,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And so at the city level, there's a great onus of responsibility that's on the city to help the citizenry develop the language and the vocabulary, and then to usher in, in a gentle way,

186
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:02,924
[SPEAKER_05]: having these conversations.

187
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:15,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, hopefully, you know, based on what you just described, as the old song says, her ears are attendant to their cry.

188
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:16,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

189
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:17,888
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

190
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:25,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what is serving in the town of Arlington taught you about the people that live there?

191
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,022
[SPEAKER_03]: They're special.

192
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,924
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Arlington is a great place.

193
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:35,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't live in Arlington.

194
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:36,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Somerville.

195
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:52,131
[SPEAKER_03]: But that community really has the best of intentions and really wants to be welcoming and accepting and doing what they can to make sure everyone feels like they belong there.

196
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:56,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes that alignment is off with the actions.

197
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:56,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, like,

198
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,481
[SPEAKER_03]: taking space to reflect and listen to those who are trying to guide.

199
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:04,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really is a special place.

200
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:09,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I saw, so my division, the DEI division is within Health and Human Services.

201
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:18,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, I mean, at the beginning of COVID, and so I had, I started in December and then I had just two months and it was chaos.

202
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:23,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but in that moment, I was doing COVID response, like,

203
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:29,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just saw the outpouring of wanting to give and help and it's there.

204
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean this morning I was at a community breakfast at Arlington Eats, the food pantry.

205
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:43,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the different, the number of volunteers and all of the folks who want to give and make sure the community is getting what it needs.

206
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:44,343
[SPEAKER_03]: is there.

207
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:48,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people, I mean, everyone's on their own journey.

208
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got folks who are never going to change.

209
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:51,470
[SPEAKER_03]: People are people.

210
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, I'd say everyone is, you know, trying to do their best.

211
00:16:56,535 --> 00:16:57,416
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all doing our best.

212
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:01,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, it's funny because, you know, the nature of COVID

213
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:22,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of the negative things obviously are fairly obvious, but one of the positive things that is revealed here in Medford is that there are so many people with really, really good hearts that really want to help and really want to do things to kind of change the context of the conversation now.

214
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:29,084
[SPEAKER_05]: the challenge, and I'm sure you've seen some of this in Arlington as well, is to get through to the knuckleheads.

215
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:35,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And I probably use that term advisedly, but we all know what we know.

216
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:46,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are clearly a lot of people who are being really stony about all of this and not allowing the goodness and the humanness to come through

217
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,933
[SPEAKER_05]: and aid and assist in getting us to that place where everybody feels like they're serving everybody else.

218
00:17:53,334 --> 00:18:07,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would just say to that, I felt that somewhat and then really worked to redirect my focus because you hear from the loudest voices.

219
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:07,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

220
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:16,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And often it's those people who don't want change, who are set in their ways, but they really aren't the biggest group of people.

221
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:24,853
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get those little reminders that the work I'm doing actually does matter and is making a difference from people I've never heard from.

222
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:28,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I literally just got an email yesterday, I cried a little.

223
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:33,981
[SPEAKER_03]: But from a community member who like went back and watched some recordings that we had done

224
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:44,098
[SPEAKER_03]: in what year is it 2021 um and just showed appreciation that they watched it with their family and they had recently moved here and

225
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:49,170
[SPEAKER_03]: we're looking for something and found that, and we're really impressed that the town was doing these things.

226
00:18:49,210 --> 00:19:06,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, you've got that group of folks that is gonna be there, they're not going anywhere, but don't waste your energy because you've got folks on this end who are just gonna drain you, the people in the middle that you can sway, and then you've got your supporters over here.

227
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,418
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a small bunch, they might be loud and rowdy, but

228
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:15,520
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not worth your just headache.

229
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:18,923
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really a good perspective to take.

230
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:39,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the things that we found here at the community center is that, you know, we invite a lot of people to a lot of different things, and the people that come almost invariably are the people who are in favor of positive change happening in the community, and the people that don't come in a lot of ways are not necessarily.

231
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:50,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we're going to keep extending the invitation and having an open door for anybody who wants to come, but we also understand that there may be some folks who never dock in our doorstep.

232
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:55,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we keep the lights on, so we don't need all of that.

233
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:10,130
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I know this is subject to change in a shifting landscape, but what's your current vision for your department, for DE&I, your division in Arlington?

234
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:12,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Great question.

235
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:17,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've achieved a little bit of that, the fact that it's not a division of one anymore.

236
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:18,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love it.

237
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:24,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we just finished our equity audit, and I'm actually right now very much in the stage of

238
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:36,085
[SPEAKER_03]: absorbing all of those recommendations, those results, and partnering it with the report that we had with our employee workshops, I'm not in a rush.

239
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:44,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, everyone's like, not everyone, a handful of folks are very anxious to get started on like, okay, how do we fix, what do we do now?

240
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, nope, slow down.

241
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:47,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we need to be strategic.

242
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, right now, I mean, the plan is hopefully

243
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:58,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Budget for a few more employees Community engagement is key.

244
00:20:58,576 --> 00:21:03,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hired a community engagement and Outreach coordinator in June.

245
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:03,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

246
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:09,347
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first recommendation we have is establish a community engagement team because we know that

247
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we don't know what we don't know.

248
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,069
[SPEAKER_03]: We know we're not reaching certain people.

249
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:19,592
[SPEAKER_03]: We need people out there meeting, going, meeting people where they are, not expecting them to come to us.

250
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:28,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, step one is like get that team a little bit up, whether it's like part time, if it's community ambassadors, exploring different options.

251
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:35,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And then yeah, really the stage I'm kind of in right now is strategic planning, just looking at what we can do.

252
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,442
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a part of a language access program as well.

253
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:46,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So what that looks like long-term we've got some short-term solutions, but really looking at the budget How are we gonna actually fund all of these things?

254
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:51,427
[SPEAKER_03]: We know we have to do But being realistic that it's going to take time.

255
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:55,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be Years down the road.

256
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:56,709
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, nothing without ambition.

257
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm Okay

258
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,228
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I'm going to shift gears a little bit.

259
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:07,271
[SPEAKER_05]: How did your new presidency at the Mystic Valley branch of the NAACP come about?

260
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:11,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it something that you knew you wanted to do, or?

261
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:12,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Or.

262
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:15,575
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an or.

263
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:21,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we needed a new president.

264
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:23,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Zane was tired.

265
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:27,729
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was asked a couple of times.

266
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:30,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually said no, because I had a lot going on.

267
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

268
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:35,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I finally said, OK, you can put me down as the last option.

269
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:38,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the only option.

270
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:41,597
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some people in this room who know what that's about.

271
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:41,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

272
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:59,127
[SPEAKER_03]: but When it came down to I'm the only option I was like, okay, then we're gonna do it I actually stepped back from a few other things That I was doing so that I could redirect more of my time because I knew that this would be a big Big shoes to fill.

273
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:04,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes But also just for me, it's brand new and this really I

274
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:16,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on a couple of committees, I was doing a lot, but to take on this type of leadership role, I knew I had to make some more time, and yeah, I'm excited.

275
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:18,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been good, I have a great executive board.

276
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:20,054
[SPEAKER_03]: They're super supportive.

277
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:23,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, looking for new members.

278
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:26,335
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want one, find me after.

279
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:29,316
[SPEAKER_05]: You're ready to holler at your girl, as they say.

280
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:34,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so what are your early impressions of being in this role?

281
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:48,346
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard It's hard there's a lot of history I literally have fallen asleep every time I start reading through the bylaws Which I need to learn and know them.

282
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:56,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and I Time management and boundaries is key and I don't have those But yeah, just I I think

283
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:10,564
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm, a couple of the community members that I spoke with, you know, said they wanted to see my vision, you know, come to light.

284
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:14,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my vision really is like really building up our membership.

285
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:22,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've got some generational gaps and that's, we're trying to reestablish our youth council.

286
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:26,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's just a lot of pieces and I think I wanna get more in touch with the communities.

287
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:44,655
[SPEAKER_03]: joined and we were on zoom for Years, so part of what I want to do as well is start to bring our meetings not every meeting But back to some of the different communities They really just make our presence more out there

288
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:47,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And do more collaboration.

289
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:57,385
[SPEAKER_03]: With the convention coming, the national convention coming to Boston this summer, July, end of July, everybody register when it opens up in May.

290
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:11,237
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a lot of work with the Boston branch and just, I'm excited because it's gonna be a great opportunity to showcase what we have, what we can do, and just let people know we're here.

291
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:25,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, and we're an organization that is probably more necessary now than it was when Walter White and several others charted it at the very outset.

292
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:30,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It's critical right now that we have that particular voice.

293
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:40,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so what new initiatives are you excited about as you begin to get around in your service cities and towns?

294
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:58,981
[SPEAKER_03]: new initiatives um well kind of everything's kind of new for me okay okay all right that's fair that's fair so i really i was a part of our education and reparations committee um and i think for me i with the work that i do and that i have done in the past

295
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:09,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do more I'd say partnered programs like around educational programs Coming out of the work of the committees that we have.

296
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:24,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a really active our reparations group our environmental justice And I want to kind of really be able to uplift the work they're doing but make sure it's also not just Within one city or town that's within the branch.

297
00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:24,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I

298
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:52,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of what I've seen that I would like to work on is mixing that up There are specific issues that yes are relative to you know, Medford or Malden, but it doesn't mean it's not happening in the other Municipalities and so what we do in Malden I'd love to be able to get folks from the other towns and cities on board so that there is a real stronger support between the area

299
00:26:52,837 --> 00:27:00,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you may have already answered that question just just now But I I want to ask it because maybe you'll spin it a different way.

300
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:03,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Is is there a particular city or town?

301
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:08,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Within the catchment that that kind of intrigues you and if so, why?

302
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:14,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no Okay, I think all of them.

303
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:16,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I they're all kind of new to me.

304
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know Arlington I think I

305
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:24,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky in the sense that because of my day job, but it's also a night job.

306
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:27,020
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the time job.

307
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:37,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I Do have some of the government connections and so I have that Ability to be like, okay.

308
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:40,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what's going on Things aren't good here.

309
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:46,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Like let's figure this out But using the branch versus me and my other role.

310
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:47,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, um, and

311
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:58,869
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'm just really kind of looking forward to learning more I spend most of my time in Arlington, but I've been dabbling in Medford and I want to just make the rounds

312
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:11,964
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the most fascinating, the most intriguing, the most historical, the most effervescent, the most bubbly community of all of them.

313
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:15,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I mean, don't get me wrong.

314
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:21,707
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some warts, you know, we got some warts, no real frog doesn't.

315
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:32,211
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, should you be looking for, beside Arlington, excuse me, for a place to hang your hat, you know, at any point in time, feel free to come on through.

316
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:32,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.

317
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:33,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be good to you.

318
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise we'll be good to you.

319
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:36,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

320
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:36,792
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

321
00:28:38,694 --> 00:28:51,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you think about collaborations, commitment, membership, community building, and again, you may have touched on some of these things already, what burns in you?

322
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:53,116
[SPEAKER_05]: What burning desire do you have?

323
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:57,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know if it's a burning desire.

324
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,263
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want, I really want more youth involvement.

325
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:05,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to hear what they want to do.

326
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:07,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you don't know what you don't know.

327
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,516
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm putting on a program, and I don't have that perspective,

328
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:15,388
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're not gonna come.

329
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really want that piece.

330
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:37,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I want more youth involvement from all of the communities Because I think it's vital and I know what I noticed as well is with The different branches across the country there's a trend some of them have super active youth councils and

331
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:55,816
[SPEAKER_03]: some don't and there's a difference in the type of programming that's going on and I think it's a great way to encourage our youth to become leaders and just know that they have a voice and they can use it and be heard and listened to and

332
00:29:56,384 --> 00:29:56,985
[SPEAKER_03]: and have power.

333
00:29:58,427 --> 00:30:02,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So burning desire, youth involvement.

334
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:03,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of flaming.

335
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:08,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not be, you know, all consuming, but it's got a flick of a flame.

336
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a soft spot for youth.

337
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:12,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at a youth center for seven years and I just

338
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:18,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Well see, you and Lisa, our executive director, have a lot in common, so y'all should be having big conversations.

339
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa, we're going to have tea time.

340
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:27,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And the truth of the matter is, it's something that we struggle with.

341
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:36,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in terms of, you know, having advocacy out there at, you know, kind of a global level, that would be really, really helpful.

342
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you crack the algorithm, we want to look at your notes.

343
00:30:39,263 --> 00:30:42,844
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to peek over your shoulder and see what it is you do that's successful.

344
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:59,939
[SPEAKER_05]: how will what you've learned during your, not so brief, but your abbreviated tenure in Arlington DE&I inform how you move the dials forward in terms of the work that you're doing with the NAACP?

345
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

346
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:04,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say... I got trapped in my shoe.

347
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:07,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that

348
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:10,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a listener.

349
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:15,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Which again is like why I want more folks so we can hear and absorb.

350
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:29,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what I've learned with Arlington and just previous work is that you need to listen to the voices before you make decisions, before you figure out what your path is gonna be.

351
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:33,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you just go based off of what's in your little bubble,

352
00:31:34,523 --> 00:31:47,219
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna be missing things but hmm what else I feel like it's all just kind of up there well it's gonna trickle down absolutely absolutely

353
00:31:48,520 --> 00:32:03,448
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of, you may not know all of them, I know I certainly don't, but in terms of the national priorities of the mother organization, NAACP, what particular initiatives are you most passionate about?

354
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:08,191
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want to really see happen or see the dials move on?

355
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:28,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I, for me, and I know, I think in other places around the country, it's more very much a need, but here as well, just voter registration, getting back to the advocacy piece, making sure people know that they do have power and giving them that empowerment, like awareness.

356
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Setting up different maybe an idea I have that I haven't told anyone.

357
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:56,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a sneaky okay like any programs that we may do in person like I'd love to have just an opportunity to yes, like sign up become a member, but also here are instructions how to Register if you're not registered to vote just simple things that you can start to integrate To remind folks so that is one of the things that I definitely want to do

358
00:32:56,582 --> 00:33:11,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's absolutely imperative that we kind of get back to kind of a level of intensity and a level of understanding of the real, real burning necessity.

359
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if there ever was something that is a burning desire, it should be voter registration right now.

360
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so will you play a little bit of word association with me?

361
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:41,442
[SPEAKER_05]: sure okay all right so um here's here's here's how i do it's a little bit off the beaten path it's it's not it's not word to word okay it's kind of word to impression word to phrase word to you know kind of what you're thinking when you say something yeah so i'll say i respond yeah whatever's in my head exactly okay okay all right well you know

362
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:43,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Legacy.

363
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:44,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, is it one word?

364
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:48,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be one word for me, but it can be multiple words for you.

365
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:53,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But it can be like a thousand or one for me?

366
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like maybe a hundred, maybe not a thousand.

367
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:57,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's a test.

368
00:33:57,147 --> 00:33:57,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

369
00:33:57,867 --> 00:33:59,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Without a test, there's no testimony.

370
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:02,728
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm trying to help you develop your testimony.

371
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:04,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Legacy.

372
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I keep it short?

373
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:14,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Legacy.

374
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:24,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I have so many thoughts.

375
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:29,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to put them in a way.

376
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:31,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe thing number one and thing number two.

377
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:32,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Thing number one.

378
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:41,433
[SPEAKER_03]: knowing your history so that it can inform your present and your future.

379
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:44,354
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great answer.

380
00:34:44,854 --> 00:34:45,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

381
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:47,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, authenticity.

382
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:48,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Me.

383
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:51,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Authentic.

384
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:52,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

385
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:53,036
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

386
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:53,796
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

387
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:58,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that you seized on that and you personify.

388
00:35:00,202 --> 00:35:04,444
[SPEAKER_03]: kept it real, like at work, that I show up as I am.

389
00:35:05,944 --> 00:35:10,626
[SPEAKER_03]: There are days I show up in joggers and sneakers and I don't care because that's who I am that day.

390
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:14,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you're gonna get Jill, just Jill.

391
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:19,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine my tracksuits are legendary.

392
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:21,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Leadership.

393
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:25,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Leadership.

394
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:35,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing how to balance using your power and

395
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:43,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Responsibility for other people.

396
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:43,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

397
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:59,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely The cowardly lion courage Courage I feel like I want to answer with the word courage Courage

398
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just I think it's to me.

399
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:13,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tied to being authentic like You just need to be yourself and not be afraid of failing Because you only learn from failures.

400
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

401
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:14,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

402
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:15,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

403
00:36:15,662 --> 00:36:18,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that whole speak truth to power thing.

404
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:23,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely Okay, and then last but not least allyship

405
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a love-hate relationship with this word.

406
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it often gets misused.

407
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:35,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it right.

408
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:36,259
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

409
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:37,399
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

410
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:37,900
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

411
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it is, do it the right way.

412
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:40,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Do your research.

413
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:41,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it right.

414
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:43,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask questions.

415
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:44,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make it about you.

416
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:51,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it about the person or the group or the people that you are trying to be in allyship with.

417
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:51,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

418
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:52,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

419
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:52,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

420
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:57,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And that common vocabulary becomes really, really important.

421
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:04,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if one group is speaking one language and the other group is speaking another language, not much is going to get done.

422
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:06,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good, very good.

423
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:09,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I'm going to flip the script, okay?

424
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:12,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna give yeah, yeah, we're done with the game.

425
00:37:12,473 --> 00:37:16,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna give you give you your power It's women's history month.

426
00:37:16,415 --> 00:37:23,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm gonna take a backseat brother brothers gonna take a backseat What question would you want to pose to me tonight?

427
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,001
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you love most about

428
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:41,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford and this center.

429
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:42,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

430
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:42,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

431
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's a couple things.

432
00:37:47,101 --> 00:38:03,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I love most about Medford the fact that through all of the changes that we're going through right now, and we're going through a lot of changes, the one thing that I know is still important to the people that live here is family.

433
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:12,055
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I deal primarily with, you know, with the older population as I direct elder services.

434
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:24,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And, I mean, you know, the ladies talk about a lot of things, the men as well, but one of the things that is a common thread amongst them in conversation is family.

435
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:26,708
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they talk about their family, they talk about their

436
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:40,056
[SPEAKER_05]: sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters and aunts and uncles and folks that have passed, folks that they've taken care of, that they've raised.

437
00:38:40,356 --> 00:38:47,921
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the thread that continues to keep this as at least a somewhat nuclear community.

438
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:51,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's pockets of different stuff happening all over the place.

439
00:38:52,023 --> 00:38:57,308
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one thing that's common to everybody, and I write a lot about it in my poetry, is family.

440
00:38:57,789 --> 00:38:59,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really important.

441
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:05,936
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a two-part question, the second part was... What do you love about this?

442
00:39:05,956 --> 00:39:06,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Enter.

443
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:08,659
[SPEAKER_05]: On the days that I love it...

444
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And truth be told, that's most days.

445
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:19,924
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the days that I love it, it feels like I belong here.

446
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:24,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know I'm not going to feel that way forever.

447
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:32,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the second building on the site, and it's under 20 years old.

448
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:40,413
[SPEAKER_05]: The first building on the site, the old army barracks, the Quonset hut, as they call it, I grew up in that building.

449
00:39:41,194 --> 00:39:56,515
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm kind of, you know, in some ways, because they say, you know, once an adult, twice a child, I'm kind of getting close to that place where I'll start to live, have my second childhood, as many of my seniors are having right now.

450
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:13,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And from the first childhood to now getting close to the second childhood, the one thing that stayed the same is that this is still, when I walk in here, it's still my place.

451
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:20,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not yet come in on any given day and felt like I didn't belong here.

452
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think,

453
00:40:24,063 --> 00:40:31,945
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, for any job, that's pretty cool, you know, to walk in every day and feel like you belong there.

454
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:46,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Now again, I may not always feel that way, and there are days when, you know, it challenges the notion, but for the most part, you know, it's, and I know, and I may not do it well every day, but I know that it's important work and I try.

455
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:48,448
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I try.

456
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:49,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

457
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one more question.

458
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

459
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:51,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

460
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if I'm in Medford.

461
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

462
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:56,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hungry.

463
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:57,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

464
00:40:58,312 --> 00:41:05,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you gonna tell me to go to get the most delicious meal?

465
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:08,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Any cuisine.

466
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

467
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:10,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's got a slap.

468
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:13,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

469
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:14,237
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

470
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:22,535
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I'll tell you a place that I've eaten recently that I really, I thought the food was good.

471
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:24,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Italian food.

472
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:25,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

473
00:41:26,097 --> 00:41:29,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, Salvatore's down in Medford Square.

474
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:31,979
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're pretty good.

475
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:32,799
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty good.

476
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:42,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have been invited and gone on a couple of occasions to the Kiwanis meetings, and they used to meet at a little spot on Main Street called Bichelli's.

477
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:46,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And they put out a spread.

478
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:50,577
[SPEAKER_05]: They put out a spread, and the food was banging.

479
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:52,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I will take my mother there.

480
00:41:52,478 --> 00:41:53,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

481
00:41:53,979 --> 00:42:03,105
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was taking my mom, I probably would take her to Salvatore's, because I think the atmosphere and ambiance, as the French say, it's pretty nice.

482
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:04,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty nice place.

483
00:42:05,186 --> 00:42:05,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

484
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:06,507
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, you're welcome.

485
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:09,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

486
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:12,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that one was going to get me.

487
00:42:12,774 --> 00:42:17,099
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to give you the last word, kind of what are your parting thoughts?

488
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:19,598
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

489
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you I'd be nice to you.

490
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:22,880
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pleasant.

491
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:31,684
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but this is just really wonderful just to be able to be in a community space.

492
00:42:31,804 --> 00:42:39,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, a lot of what I've been doing for the last few years has been virtual and successful, meaningful, but

493
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get that like the laughter the commentary.

494
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:48,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's It's nice to be in this space and I'll be back.

495
00:42:48,073 --> 00:42:48,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

496
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:48,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

497
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:52,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Well come for the commentary because If you come to the lunch from 12 to 1 yeah

498
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:05,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, right?

499
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:14,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can pigeonhole the ladies and get them to talking about the stuff that they talk about that they don't think I hear when I'm sitting in my office, I'm not going there, right?

500
00:43:14,812 --> 00:43:17,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'll get my hands slapped.

501
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:18,115
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're funny.

502
00:43:18,415 --> 00:43:19,236
[SPEAKER_05]: They're funny.

503
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:20,537
[SPEAKER_05]: They got mad comedy.

504
00:43:20,617 --> 00:43:21,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come through.

505
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:22,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I fit in?

506
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:23,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I blend in?

507
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,682
[SPEAKER_05]: We talking high-level hilarity, all right?

508
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:27,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

509
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:29,144
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a hilarious bunch.

510
00:43:32,448 --> 00:43:48,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So listen, thank you so much for bringing new leadership, new energy, and a spirit of personal engagement to this community, to our friends in Arlington, and to the constituencies of the NAACP and the Mystic Valley.

511
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:54,034
[SPEAKER_05]: We're happy that you've recovered, you know, your good health, although I know you got some fits and starts.

512
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:58,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, it's a sine wave, you know, it's not a straight line.

513
00:43:58,658 --> 00:44:02,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for your attentiveness and your interest in the discussion.

514
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:05,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all just as well for that.

515
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:16,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to take a little bit of break so that we can get things set for the second part of this evening.

516
00:44:17,536 --> 00:44:30,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Get ready for something special and something very different on the musical side of the coin right after we take a break to reset the stage and share some WMCC announcements.

517
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:31,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jillian.

518

[SPEAKER_05]: Like I got some of it.

522

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

524
00:46:19,415 --> 00:46:19,816
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

525
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:20,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't mad at her.

526
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:22,238
[SPEAKER_06]: She ain't mad at me.

527
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:23,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm chapped up.

528
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:24,120

Oh my goodness.

536

[SPEAKER_09]: Keep the rug, right?

537
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,051
[SPEAKER_08]: We have lost the internet for a little bit, but we came back a lot faster.

538
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:52,692
Yeah, it's harder.

539
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:53,552

00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:18,605
It's harder to

568
00:49:18,745 --> 00:49:24,507
Right now, we really want to go out and make sure that we're making some money here.

569
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:27,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Because most people think of us like this.

570
00:49:27,908 --> 00:49:29,048
[SPEAKER_08]: We work for money.

571
00:49:29,108 --> 00:49:30,028
[SPEAKER_08]: We cover those bills.

572
00:49:48,554 --> 00:49:49,575
Oh, yeah.

573
00:50:03,124 --> 00:50:04,105
Thank you.

574
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:20,858
Yeah.

575
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:21,038
Yeah.

576
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:54,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Check, check, one, two, three, one, two, three.

577
00:51:24,158 --> 00:51:24,580
Yeah.

578
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:33,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I have this.

579
00:51:58,244 --> 00:51:58,504
Okay.

580
00:51:58,544 --> 00:51:58,805
Yeah.

581
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:23,132
Thank you.

582
00:52:37,778 --> 00:52:38,118
Okay.

583
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:05,910
Thank you.

584
00:53:30,762 --> 00:53:31,643
Thank you.

585
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,996
th th th

586
00:54:33,143 --> 00:54:33,623
Okay.

587
00:54:59,547 --> 00:54:59,807
th th

588
00:55:36,335 --> 00:55:37,236
Okay.

589
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:37,876
Right.

590
00:56:05,235 --> 00:56:15,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna do a little intro and then I'll let you guys take over, okay?

591
00:56:15,198 --> 00:56:15,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

592
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:16,279
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

593
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:17,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that all right?

594
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:17,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

595
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,740
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

596
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm failing you and I hate it.

597
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:22,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

598
00:56:24,402 --> 00:56:25,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see the anguish in my face?

599
00:56:27,403 --> 00:56:27,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

600
00:56:27,963 --> 00:56:28,523
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

601
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:28,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

602
00:56:31,227 --> 00:56:35,996
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, if I can have everybody take their seats, we're gonna try and get going again.

603
00:56:55,003 --> 00:56:55,383
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

604
00:56:56,984 --> 00:57:01,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So folks, if you're here and you can take your seats, that would be greatly appreciated.

605
00:57:01,606 --> 00:57:01,646
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

606
00:57:04,727 --> 00:57:10,269
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

607
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:11,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me make sure I got what I need.

608
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:14,831
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

609
00:57:18,492 --> 00:57:22,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's time to turn our attention

610
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:33,915
[SPEAKER_05]: human and canine, to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this evening's musical, in quotes, side of the ledger.

611
00:57:34,195 --> 00:57:39,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight we're going to take the second half of our program in a slightly different direction.

612
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:41,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Beats, check.

613
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhymes, check.

614
00:57:44,101 --> 00:57:45,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Stories, check.

615
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:49,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Orchestration and instrumentation, not so much.

616
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:56,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight it's about the spoken word and the mind, soul, and spirit connection to the world we're living in.

617
00:57:57,041 --> 00:58:01,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And because it's Women's History Month, it's about the sisterhood.

618
00:58:01,765 --> 00:58:07,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me tell you just a bit about the performance you'll be experiencing over the next 45 minutes or so.

619
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:13,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Now familiar to some of you, new to many, is Michelle La Poetica.

620
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,523
[SPEAKER_05]: carries the last name Richardson around as well.

621
00:58:21,004 --> 00:58:41,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Michelle is a dynamic spoken word artist who travels throughout Massachusetts and the Northeast with multiple musical performers, including rappers, singers, poets, and other creatives breathing new life into the spaces of hip hop, social justice, cultural diversity, and inclusiveness of all stripes.

622
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,284
[SPEAKER_05]: She and her Soul Cipher group took the center by storm a few years back

623
00:58:46,604 --> 00:58:49,385
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was a totally new experience for everyone.

624
00:58:50,145 --> 00:59:05,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Her musical and producing credits are legendary in the area, and she's a legitimate queen of the spoken word scene, having won numerous awards for the art form, and she has taught a new generation of poets and performers how to do the daggone thing.

625
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:14,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining La Poetica is another spoken word maven of the highest order, Cole Rodriguez,

626
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:24,128
[SPEAKER_05]: is an internationally recognized artist hailing from Boston, but having traveled extensively as a participant in the National Poetry Slam.

627
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:28,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Cole has competed against some of the top-ranked poets in the United States.

628
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:36,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Michelle, La Poética, she has used her poetic work to inspire activism and speak truth to power.

629
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:42,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Cole is passionate about youth development and has used her platform to serve in universities, high schools,

630
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:49,658
[SPEAKER_05]: and therapeutic spaces where poetry can be deconstructed, reconstructed, created, and celebrated.

631
00:59:49,718 --> 00:59:50,759
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I'm a poet, too.

632
00:59:50,859 --> 00:59:51,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do this stuff.

633
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,402
[SPEAKER_05]: She loves music.

634
00:59:53,822 --> 00:59:54,783
[SPEAKER_05]: She loves cooking.

635
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:58,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to know about that a little bit better.

636
00:59:58,907 --> 01:00:02,991
[SPEAKER_05]: In the Boston Celtics, among other things, her performance credits

637
01:00:03,871 --> 01:00:14,137
[SPEAKER_05]: really a truly prodigious and really too numerous to mention and Baby girl over here is Dexter tell me your last name darling Dexter Garcia

638
01:00:16,407 --> 01:00:20,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, she's one of Michelle's Chargers, one of her newbies.

639
01:00:21,191 --> 01:00:34,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know as much about her, but I do know that she's the published author of many books, actually, and that she's brought several of them with her, so if you like what she does, support her art form on your way out.

640
01:00:35,503 --> 01:00:41,088
[SPEAKER_05]: As the young folks are fond of saying, y'all need to get out the way, we got stuff to do.

641
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:47,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am going to let the ladies give you the goods.

642
01:00:47,871 --> 01:00:56,355
[SPEAKER_05]: West Medford and World, give a warm welcome to Michelle La Poetica Richardson, Cole Rodriguez, and Dexter Garcia.

643
01:00:57,035 --> 01:00:57,435
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty?

644
01:00:57,956 --> 01:00:58,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies, take the stage.

645
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Allow me the opportunity to reintroduce myself.

646
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:10,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother, mujer, mover of souls, motivator.

647
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Mean maneras of managing, mean fingers, mean fingers.

648
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:15,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Manipulan cuando señalan lenguas torcidas.

649
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:19,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Malintencionadas, mencionan a Michelle, de manera equivocada.

650
01:01:20,184 --> 01:01:26,206
[SPEAKER_06]: El menosprecio, minimizations, attempted and dumb, succeeded in the relations of goals, dreams, and expectations.

651
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:28,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Ocurren, pero milagros tambien.

652
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:33,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Aparece un lapiz, un papel, and from that moment yo pude entender cual era mi deber exclusivo.

653
01:01:34,048 --> 01:01:35,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Nací para ser poeta.

654
01:01:35,632 --> 01:01:39,995
[SPEAKER_06]: oradora del arma, creative interpreter for emociones manifestadas, manos armadas.

655
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Con la pluma y su espada, because toda palabra is a double-edged sword.

656
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:45,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Una espada de doble filo.

657
01:01:46,078 --> 01:02:01,507
[SPEAKER_06]: In each verse, una estrategia, cada poema is a battle cry for you to wake up, levántate, obten esperanza y entiende que desde lo más superficial hasta lo más profundo, you are the only ones in control of your mundo and how the actions of others or lack of them te afectan.

658
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:06,787
[SPEAKER_06]: My mission is to change the world with my defects, my talent, my pencil, and my notebook.

659
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:11,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether you love me or you hate me, you either fear me or respect me.

660
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:18,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether my energy repels you, or if to you I'm magnetic, you will always remember how I made you feel.

661
01:02:18,855 --> 01:02:20,636
[SPEAKER_06]: But also remember who I am.

662
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:23,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I am Michelle, La Poética.

663
01:02:30,903 --> 01:02:31,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Now,

664
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna introduce two amazing poets.

665
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:40,752
[SPEAKER_06]: These poets are women by their own rights extraordinary in many, many ways.

666
01:02:41,012 --> 01:02:44,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I encourage you to look them up, both Cole Rodriguez and Dexter Garcia.

667
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:46,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let the youth fool you.

668
01:02:46,494 --> 01:02:47,674
[SPEAKER_06]: This baby is powerful.

669
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:49,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Powerful.

670
01:02:49,455 --> 01:02:52,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna step back, now that you know who I am.

671
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:55,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm gonna let Cole introduce herself.

672
01:02:56,498 --> 01:03:00,319
[SPEAKER_01]: He had four aunts, three sisters, and six girl cousins.

673
01:03:00,996 --> 01:03:04,578
[SPEAKER_01]: He watched their trials and their tribulations as they searched for good loving.

674
01:03:04,598 --> 01:03:11,162
[SPEAKER_01]: There were bathroom preps and whispered conversations that left little room for the imagination's creations.

675
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:17,526
[SPEAKER_01]: He was trying to make sense of the role that men played, trying to understand why these women always stayed.

676
01:03:17,606 --> 01:03:21,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, security, stability, it remained elusive.

677
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:29,594
[SPEAKER_01]: As mom's relationships explored new directions of abuse and licks, they were loose because you need excuses to explain how you could accept mental and physical

678
01:03:29,953 --> 01:03:30,473
[SPEAKER_01]: bruises.

679
01:03:30,513 --> 01:03:31,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So he watched these losers.

680
01:03:31,694 --> 01:03:33,236
[SPEAKER_01]: He envied their charms.

681
01:03:33,316 --> 01:03:39,481
[SPEAKER_01]: He forgave them as Mama returned to their undeserving arms, never considering the effects of such spiritual.

682
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:43,004
[SPEAKER_01]: His silence, his withdrawal.

683
01:03:43,704 --> 01:03:45,386
[SPEAKER_01]: It set off no one's alarms.

684
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:51,311
[SPEAKER_01]: It took two weeks, three days, and 18 stitches after Mama couldn't fulfill stepdad number six's wishes.

685
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't get it twisted, this was no weak chick.

686
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:56,895
[SPEAKER_01]: She retorted his punches, hands clenched and dumb fists.

687
01:03:57,916 --> 01:03:58,977
[SPEAKER_01]: But his energy was missed.

688
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:03,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Confusion persisted as Walter witnessed his mother's self-love becoming listless.

689
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:10,456
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like every instance she just couldn't resist this and was weakened by the pressure of her suitor's insistence.

690
01:04:11,297 --> 01:04:12,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So he questioned his existence.

691
01:04:13,198 --> 01:04:14,459
[SPEAKER_01]: He stayed out later on the block.

692
01:04:14,499 --> 01:04:24,688
[SPEAKER_01]: He tried to hang with older guys to listen to them talk to their bragging contests of their sexual conquests, creating context for Walter's repressed respect.

693
01:04:25,438 --> 01:04:28,159
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence, constantly tested and questioned.

694
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:30,479
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to discern the valuable lessons.

695
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those young ladies, they came to beckon, Walter's sisters stepped in.

696
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:43,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the guise of protection, they told him, toughen up, buck up, walk with your chin up to them girls, your feelings, don't just give up, don't be weak.

697
01:04:43,882 --> 01:04:49,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely don't cry, because the world is unforgiving to boys with wet eyes.

698
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:52,524
[SPEAKER_01]: He believed these lies, he held it all in.

699
01:04:52,985 --> 01:04:55,647
[SPEAKER_01]: He used their expectations to justify his sins.

700
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:59,809
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, they judged men by their dreams and not their deeds.

701
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:04,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Subconsciously, they believed Walter didn't deserve what he needs.

702
01:05:06,213 --> 01:05:13,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It took two wives, three sons, and one daughter for Walter to consider his history's offering.

703
01:05:13,837 --> 01:05:16,879
[SPEAKER_01]: He watched his offspring repeating the patterns he taught them.

704
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:18,200
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked his demons in the eyes.

705
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,360
[SPEAKER_01]: He finally fought them.

706
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,082
[SPEAKER_01]: He dug deep into the caverns that we keep.

707
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,500
[SPEAKER_01]: nestled inside.

708
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,561
[SPEAKER_01]: He freed his mind.

709
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:26,462
[SPEAKER_01]: He finally relinquished his pride.

710
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:30,966
[SPEAKER_01]: He was ready to break patterns and leave legacies behind.

711
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:35,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Walter freed himself finally when he let himself cry.

712
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,742
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that was beautiful.

713
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:54,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I'm going to follow it, but here we go.

714
01:05:56,545 --> 01:05:57,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a reader.

715
01:05:57,546 --> 01:06:01,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm terrible with memorizing things, so I'm going to read from my book.

716
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,451
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of my books.

717
01:06:05,573 --> 01:06:11,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And this poem, like many of my poems, is I think all of my poems are love poems to some degree.

718
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:14,720
[SPEAKER_02]: They just present themselves in different ways.

719
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:23,016
[SPEAKER_02]: In this one, God is universe and she has my face constructed of stardust.

720
01:06:23,957 --> 01:06:32,905
[SPEAKER_02]: She is all nebula, all galaxies upon galaxies of woman and black and black and black and every color that has ever been and beauty.

721
01:06:33,746 --> 01:06:36,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Her eyes are sun, all fire and scorch.

722
01:06:37,729 --> 01:06:40,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine falling into them and feel nothing but warmth.

723
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:46,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I learned there is no hell, just the eyes of a woman who has been overlooked one too many times.

724
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:56,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I learned the embrace can be a comfort when you are also burning from the inside out, when the world is cold and you nothing but flame.

725
01:06:56,898 --> 01:07:02,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in the eye of universe, in the eye of God, I find myself for the first time.

726
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:03,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

727
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:18,888
[SPEAKER_06]: If my ancestors still talk and still walk, what would they say about the cruel world we now live in?

728
01:07:19,428 --> 01:07:29,414
[SPEAKER_06]: To see all of their sacrifices sacrificed to a world of sin, futures looking grim, lives now trimmed from the exercise of dodging bullets of evil while trying to maintain a peaceful existence.

729
01:07:30,194 --> 01:07:34,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple things taken for granted, many a seed planted in soils poisoned by deception.

730
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,438
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no light to bring fruit to conception, much less birth.

731
01:07:38,379 --> 01:07:42,001
[SPEAKER_06]: If your souls could be measured at this point, what would be its worth?

732
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:49,604
[SPEAKER_06]: For day after day, we seem to take for granted all of the gifts and seeds by life planted, opportunities falling like autumn leaves in the wind.

733
01:07:50,045 --> 01:07:53,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Close your eyes, extend your shirt, create a basket with your skirt.

734
01:07:54,288 --> 01:07:56,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream something, want something, do something.

735
01:07:56,849 --> 01:07:58,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't continue to let life pass you by.

736
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:06,556
[SPEAKER_06]: For since birth, you've seen seconds turn to minutes, minutes to hours, those hours to days that fly by, waiting for you to embrace that epiphany.

737
01:08:06,876 --> 01:08:10,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Drop blindly, constantly, finally, see you have and will have until your last dying breath.

738
01:08:11,999 --> 01:08:12,780
[SPEAKER_06]: The opportunity.

739
01:08:13,237 --> 01:08:29,624
[SPEAKER_06]: to be a fruit-bearing tree, willing and able to nurture all those in its proximity, but instead, we consciously turn our deaf ear, turn our backs out of fear, knowingly choosing not to be, and unknowingly choosing to become Jesus's tears.

740
01:08:30,783 --> 01:08:34,584
[SPEAKER_06]: What if you knew that your time was near, that someone else's clock was winding down?

741
01:08:34,824 --> 01:08:37,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you choose to be an adjective, a verb, or a stagnant noun?

742
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:46,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Smile or frown, be a prince or a pauper, and would you, could you, should you not just wear, but even be allowed to look upon a jewel-bearing crown with the intent to wear it?

743
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:53,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me now how you see fit that we've lost our belief in love, truth, and loyalty, respect, honor, and affection given genuinely.

744
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:59,250
[SPEAKER_06]: How easy it is for them to stand and expect from me, when they can't even look in the mirror and see what Jesus would see.

745
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:04,332
[SPEAKER_06]: The great and good spiritual robbing hoods, robbing hoods of the dream robbing capabilities.

746
01:09:04,652 --> 01:09:07,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's a spoken word that's done for me.

747
01:09:08,116 --> 01:09:09,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Mad random, I know.

748
01:09:09,857 --> 01:09:19,988
[SPEAKER_06]: But as my thoughts wander to and fro, I ask you, each and every one of you, if you truly knew that the sky was your limit, how tall would you be willing to go?

749
01:09:30,336 --> 01:09:38,602
[SPEAKER_01]: for a little known fact about me that I've never shared in any performance space, because it has had no relevance.

750
01:09:39,463 --> 01:09:41,644
[SPEAKER_01]: But tonight has relevance.

751
01:09:41,984 --> 01:09:45,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the Brooks Hobbs School for elementary school.

752
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:51,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out actually at the Furby for kindergarten.

753
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:55,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first time I ever saw anybody break dance live,

754
01:09:55,851 --> 01:09:58,393
[SPEAKER_01]: was at the old West Medford Community Center.

755
01:09:58,453 --> 01:10:00,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So come on here to my dressing table.

756
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find myself, as usual, I am admonishing my daughter.

757
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:14,485
[SPEAKER_01]: This time it's from the kitchen.

758
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:17,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl, you need to stop wasting the water.

759
01:10:18,568 --> 01:10:21,350
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got to understand, y'all, things are getting drastic.

760
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:24,813
[SPEAKER_01]: All your consumable liquids come encased in some plastic.

761
01:10:25,491 --> 01:10:29,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get her to conserve our most precious resource.

762
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:33,398
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the imprudence of humans that has created our discourse.

763
01:10:33,878 --> 01:10:41,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Over one million people are without adequate drinking water worldwide, and California's supply is probably gonna go dry before she's old enough to drive.

764
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:45,367
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in Colorado, your faucet may just be producing gas.

765
01:10:45,828 --> 01:10:53,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine drinking a glass of water and having a flame shoot out your... Look around at your environment.

766
01:10:53,803 --> 01:10:59,247
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's history that reminds us that it should not surprise us, where the earth, she survives us.

767
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:03,049
[SPEAKER_01]: You think that we are a match for the planet?

768
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:07,752
[SPEAKER_01]: She survived billions of years of destruction and you think we're gonna do real damage.

769
01:11:08,573 --> 01:11:19,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Ozone layers, global warming, that's all a warning that the world will be burning, but she will keep on turning because the earth is discerning and eliminates any force refusing its natural learning.

770
01:11:20,501 --> 01:11:23,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans, we're the ones on the way out.

771
01:11:23,823 --> 01:11:26,264
[SPEAKER_01]: The planet's going to survive us of this, I have no doubt.

772
01:11:26,504 --> 01:11:34,207
[SPEAKER_01]: From us, she surely will recover from the apocalyptic thoughts that seem to hover because I know what happens when you disrespect your mother.

773
01:11:35,147 --> 01:11:41,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Our planet's adversity is being neglected.

774
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our wetlands remain unprotected.

775
01:11:43,631 --> 01:11:46,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Our fish are full of mercury and continue to be rejected.

776
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia's watching the city dry up.

777
01:11:49,673 --> 01:11:51,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I call being naturally selected.

778
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:56,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Policies are ineffective and if left unchecked, well shoot, Medford could be affected.

779
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to teach us some respect.

780
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:05,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of showing our children how to raise healthy crops, we satiate their ADD with Kool-Aid and Xbox.

781
01:12:06,348 --> 01:12:13,754
[SPEAKER_01]: The Gaza Strip, Ethiopia, Egypt are all engaged in warfare as they feel the scarcity of water and try to hoard their own share.

782
01:12:13,774 --> 01:12:16,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And here in America, it's already affecting the masses.

783
01:12:17,135 --> 01:12:19,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have clean water while others are denied access.

784
01:12:19,997 --> 01:12:26,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And we watch with apathy as our communities become fractions as our leaders continue to not get held accountable for their actions.

785
01:12:26,081 --> 01:12:33,165
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering how thirsty one has to get before you show a little passion.

786
01:12:34,486 --> 01:12:39,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we are withering, y'all, in the new world order.

787
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:43,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Withering like the flowers.

788
01:12:44,172 --> 01:12:45,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl, you forgot to water.

789
01:13:00,465 --> 01:13:07,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to introduce this poem by saying that it is after one of my favorite poets of all time.

790
01:13:07,671 --> 01:13:10,833
[SPEAKER_02]: She's one of the first people I ever heard do spoken word.

791
01:13:10,873 --> 01:13:12,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name is Jean Ann Verley.

792
01:13:12,614 --> 01:13:15,656
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've never heard of her or heard her work, look her up.

793
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:20,080
[SPEAKER_02]: She writes in a way that I cannot possibly explain.

794
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely look into her.

795
01:13:23,742 --> 01:13:25,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's called And, Or, After Jean Ann Verley.

796
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:28,770
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no safe space here.

797
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is target practice.

798
01:13:32,892 --> 01:13:35,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love her so much, I just watch her fire.

799
01:13:36,435 --> 01:13:40,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And stand at the end of this range and watch her pull the trigger with no warning.

800
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:42,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so easy for her.

801
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:45,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And she never knows how much damage is done.

802
01:13:46,181 --> 01:13:49,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm never the last one standing because I have ammo I don't use.

803
01:13:50,924 --> 01:13:51,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And she watches me fall.

804
01:13:53,085 --> 01:13:54,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And says I'm just being dramatic.

805
01:13:56,267 --> 01:14:15,940
[SPEAKER_02]: she watches me bleed and says I'll be okay and I feel as if I may die this time around and days later I unwrap my wounds and they are still open and I brace myself for it to happen again or love myself or build myself or understand that this is toxic and

806
01:14:17,256 --> 01:14:42,639
[SPEAKER_02]: or know that I can still love her while telling her this is wrong, or scream, or scream, or scream, or cry, or kick, or shield myself, or protect my mind, or heal my heart, or know that love and pain are not the same things, or ask her to do better, or tell her I deserve better, or know that she doesn't know how sometimes, or teach her,

807
01:14:43,419 --> 01:14:55,585
[SPEAKER_02]: or tell her I'm trying, or love her harder, or love her from afar, or let myself smile, or dodge the bullet, or watch her pull her weapon, and this time, run.

808
01:14:56,145 --> 01:14:56,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

809
01:14:56,485 --> 01:15:05,709
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready for the last round?

810
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:11,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

811
01:15:15,133 --> 01:15:15,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

812
01:15:17,874 --> 01:15:18,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

813
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:19,475
[SPEAKER_06]: They are.

814
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of you may be.

815
01:15:21,836 --> 01:15:26,958
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am an endangered species.

816
01:15:28,339 --> 01:15:32,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And I sing no victim song.

817
01:15:34,141 --> 01:15:35,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a woman.

818
01:15:35,102 --> 01:15:38,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I am an artist.

819
01:15:39,824 --> 01:15:41,524
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know

820
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:50,259
[SPEAKER_06]: where my voice belongs.

821
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:57,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are people in your life that have earned your truth, beams.

822
01:15:58,343 --> 01:16:01,904
[SPEAKER_06]: They support you and hold you up, even when you're earthquakes, they remain steady.

823
01:16:02,284 --> 01:16:08,525
[SPEAKER_06]: They see past the muck, past the field of debris left after your last crash landing or your last collision with a meteor.

824
01:16:09,225 --> 01:16:14,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Some heights, hits, hats, hates, gates, be out of this world, and they're keepers, wielders, and teachers too.

825
01:16:15,466 --> 01:16:16,746
[SPEAKER_06]: What to do, what to do.

826
01:16:17,266 --> 01:16:21,487
[SPEAKER_06]: If hate begets hate and monkeys see monkey do, do as I say, not as I do.

827
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:25,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Some not knowing, some fully aware that they do as they see and repeat as they hear.

828
01:16:27,048 --> 01:16:30,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Some knots and bruises showing from the inside is a sign of compartment syndrome.

829
01:16:30,911 --> 01:16:32,212
[SPEAKER_06]: You're bleeding out on the inside.

830
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:40,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Pressure builds and the only way to survive it without suffering permanent loss of function, life, or existence is by releasing the pressure.

831
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:47,323
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we, this is how I release and relieve the pressure that robs me of my ability to breathe.

832
01:16:48,824 --> 01:16:49,445
[SPEAKER_06]: The irony.

833
01:16:50,365 --> 01:16:52,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I reclaim my breath when I take yours away.

834
01:16:53,874 --> 01:17:05,261
[SPEAKER_06]: We, I, lose myself in a poem and a performance so that you can feel me, see me, so that you can find you and free me from the darkness that forever tries to consume me.

835
01:17:06,302 --> 01:17:10,844
[SPEAKER_06]: If I took you on a ride upon my roller coaster, would you even survive the high highs and the low lows?

836
01:17:11,945 --> 01:17:15,047
[SPEAKER_06]: The air is thinner up there, and it's thicker down here.

837
01:17:15,707 --> 01:17:18,349
[SPEAKER_06]: In both cases, you still can't breathe, and the middle don't want you.

838
01:17:18,389 --> 01:17:22,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do you survive the roller coaster?

839
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:25,535
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I?

840
01:17:27,136 --> 01:17:27,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Balance.

841
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:30,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the relentless pursuit of it.

842
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:35,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Not happiness because I now understand that true happiness comes from genuine balance.

843
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:39,643
[SPEAKER_06]: The more aspects of you that are balanced, the more genuine and enduring the happiness will be.

844
01:17:40,644 --> 01:17:43,145
[SPEAKER_06]: A shift of the scales could be devastating for someone like me.

845
01:17:44,006 --> 01:17:48,268
[SPEAKER_06]: My scales for far too long have been balanced by air propelled from the wind beneath my own wings.

846
01:17:49,128 --> 01:17:51,350
[SPEAKER_06]: No care, no love, just fire and steam.

847
01:17:52,210 --> 01:18:02,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Ream after ream of thoughts, dreams, wishes, and emotions accumulate and become beams in their own right, able to withstand the hardest shakes and darkest, murkiest floodwater.

848
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:08,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So much soul on those pages that once the atmosphere settles and the waters reside, there's no rust here.

849
01:18:10,433 --> 01:18:25,767
[SPEAKER_06]: No mold, nothing foul that here is because this type of magic, this type of being, is undeniably and incredibly resilient and resistant to the point that where even the most microscopic remnants of me can fill a room like this with resonance.

850
01:18:27,289 --> 01:18:27,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see?

851
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:29,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel?

852
01:18:29,891 --> 01:18:31,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you hear me?

853
01:18:32,994 --> 01:18:34,676
[SPEAKER_06]: That's who I am, that's who I be.

854
01:18:35,965 --> 01:18:41,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the soul that made you see what you felt when you heard how I feel, learned how I deal, and remember how I told it.

855
01:18:42,408 --> 01:18:47,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Italicized, highlighted, and boldly engraved in the most profound depths of your being.

856
01:18:48,011 --> 01:18:55,135
[SPEAKER_06]: What you being, be in real life looking like an apology to the universe for not having found this version of yourself sooner.

857
01:18:56,563 --> 01:19:00,367
[SPEAKER_06]: The universe looks at you and says, shh, child, don't apologize.

858
01:19:01,368 --> 01:19:02,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember who you are.

859
01:19:02,489 --> 01:19:04,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Recuerda quien tu eres.

860
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:07,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Aun cuando aparenta o se siente estar sin luz, sigue siendo ella.

861
01:19:07,874 --> 01:19:12,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Radiante en su existencia, nueva medias, sigue siendo ella.

862
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,102
[SPEAKER_06]: The moon does not apologize when she is not full.

863
01:19:16,427 --> 01:19:24,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither should you, neither do I. And you, you should be thankful that we as artists shine brightest most times when we are most empty.

864
01:19:25,495 --> 01:19:31,940
[SPEAKER_06]: That though your accolades and praises and even love can ring loud and plenty, at the end of it all, most times, I feel most empty.

865
01:19:32,741 --> 01:19:33,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's not enough.

866
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:35,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've given you all that I got.

867
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,121
[SPEAKER_06]: and I still have nothing.

868
01:19:39,002 --> 01:19:50,533
[SPEAKER_06]: My light fills you, the process drains me, and at the end of it all, I have to devise ways and means to refuel my own soul, because the type of love that I need never finds its way into my receivables.

869
01:19:52,605 --> 01:20:00,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the love that I get at the end of the night has yet to evolve into having the ability to afford me and mine enough stability to not have to struggle or worry.

870
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:07,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, even when eclipsed by the shadow of the earth and sun being in perfect alignment, you still shine.

871
01:20:08,474 --> 01:20:16,039
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still you in all of your phases, moon, because true moons overcome oppressive negativity.

872
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:34,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I began my descent onto a brazen path where the love I have for myself is the only love that seems to last.

873
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:39,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Sight sounds and the people I see are a reminder that y'all are a reflection of me.

874
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:41,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I met this student one day.

875
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:48,314
[SPEAKER_01]: In school, she was trying to stay worried about maintaining that GPA and struggling to understand the things the professors would say.

876
01:20:48,894 --> 01:20:49,755
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't get to play.

877
01:20:49,775 --> 01:20:52,197
[SPEAKER_01]: She was studying all day, but it was all good to her.

878
01:20:52,677 --> 01:20:54,099
[SPEAKER_01]: She was determined to make her way.

879
01:20:54,759 --> 01:20:55,800
[SPEAKER_01]: No camaraderie found.

880
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,500
[SPEAKER_01]: with the other women in her class.

881
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,741
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't seem to fit in.

882
01:20:58,781 --> 01:21:03,205
[SPEAKER_01]: They always seemed to have more cash, but she was on her path, trying to stay focused.

883
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:08,629
[SPEAKER_01]: What she saw back at home is what challenged her the most because no one really cared that she was going to school.

884
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:11,091
[SPEAKER_01]: No one else thought Michelle Foucault was cool.

885
01:21:11,571 --> 01:21:13,873
[SPEAKER_01]: No one else to share in the lessons of her day.

886
01:21:13,893 --> 01:21:17,376
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like no one that was around her had anything of value left to say.

887
01:21:17,896 --> 01:21:25,302
[SPEAKER_01]: She was alone and lonely, and it seemed to me like she was always being phony, either faking for her classmates or faking for her homies.

888
01:21:26,413 --> 01:21:29,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I grabbed her and I reminded her, it's okay to just be you.

889
01:21:29,355 --> 01:21:30,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to impress these people.

890
01:21:31,015 --> 01:21:32,916
[SPEAKER_01]: To thy own self we must be true.

891
01:21:33,457 --> 01:21:36,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I be you, you be me, we be she.

892
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:38,159
[SPEAKER_01]: She is beautiful.

893
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:40,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Kept it moving in the bus stop.

894
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Saw Jeannie with the sunlight gleaming into her eyes.

895
01:21:43,602 --> 01:21:47,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Her silver bangles were jingling as they bumped against her thighs.

896
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:50,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Her hair was done up, her makeup was tight.

897
01:21:51,426 --> 01:21:53,847
[SPEAKER_01]: All to mask the pain of what she goes through every night.

898
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:55,608
[SPEAKER_01]: This car pulls up.

899
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look at some legs on Shorty.

900
01:21:59,115 --> 01:22:00,536
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't even know to get offended.

901
01:22:00,856 --> 01:22:02,577
[SPEAKER_01]: She's gotten so used to feeling dirty.

902
01:22:03,978 --> 01:22:06,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, little mama, come on, show me what you got.

903
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And this attention, it's got her thinking that she's hot.

904
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:14,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Two hours later, exchanging sex for some pot and the diseases she's got.

905
01:22:14,565 --> 01:22:15,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It don't make her stop.

906
01:22:15,505 --> 01:22:19,228
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not trying to make, see, they could have bought a clinic when she's trying to make it pop.

907
01:22:19,928 --> 01:22:25,352
[SPEAKER_01]: She carries a fake coach bag and it's loaded with Rough Riders and the list is long of men that have been inside her though no one

908
01:22:25,695 --> 01:22:28,337
[SPEAKER_01]: provides for her or stands by her side for her.

909
01:22:29,677 --> 01:22:32,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So she uses sex to try to fill the hole that resides in her.

910
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Wish that they missed her, they all just really just a guess or a pester or I totally dismiss her.

911
01:22:37,802 --> 01:22:40,043
[SPEAKER_01]: No one was around when she was in need.

912
01:22:41,244 --> 01:22:47,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet she still let them be inside of her in hopes of producing a seed, a baby, a dependent.

913
01:22:47,408 --> 01:22:51,430
[SPEAKER_01]: She wanted to be a mother so she could be the creator of something that would truly love her.

914
01:22:52,191 --> 01:22:54,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though the most lovable parts of herself,

915
01:22:54,872 --> 01:22:56,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Youngster had yet to discover.

916
01:22:57,213 --> 01:23:02,416
[SPEAKER_01]: She'd find herself getting wistful when she'd feel him slipping off the rubber.

917
01:23:03,756 --> 01:23:10,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's good for your soul to love something you can't control, security from stability is something she has yet to know.

918
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,461
[SPEAKER_01]: She has found a place to rest, but she has never found a home.

919
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:17,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Been chewed on and spewed on, it seems she roams this earth alone.

920
01:23:18,363 --> 01:23:21,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt her pain as I caught her winking back.

921
01:23:22,313 --> 01:23:26,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Never considering the suitors or the chivalry they lacked, she puttered up her lips.

922
01:23:27,277 --> 01:23:30,419
[SPEAKER_01]: She turned and revealed how her jeans hug her hips.

923
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:36,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to try to save her before she jumped in the scar and dipped, because I knew they'd have her giddy off with just a few quick sips.

924
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:38,325
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grabbed her by the hands.

925
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:42,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked her in the eye and told her, you are far more valuable than anything they could buy.

926
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:46,111
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that they're speaking, nah, girl, it's just not suitable.

927
01:23:46,131 --> 01:23:47,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I be you.

928
01:23:47,392 --> 01:23:48,153
[SPEAKER_01]: You be me.

929
01:23:48,413 --> 01:23:49,274
[SPEAKER_01]: We be she.

930
01:23:49,614 --> 01:23:50,575
[SPEAKER_01]: She is beautiful.

931
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if she believed me.

932
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:54,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I continued on my way.

933
01:23:55,031 --> 01:24:06,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I prayed for her enlightenment, that maybe she'd understand one day, that maybe she'd be like Marsha, who saw the brightness of the light that shone from deep inside of her when she started treating herself right.

934
01:24:07,177 --> 01:24:20,783
[SPEAKER_01]: She quit smoking, learned to do Taibo, found herself with idle time until the library she would go, filled her mind with as much information as it could take, observed all people, and without judgment, learned from their mistakes.

935
01:24:21,545 --> 01:24:27,686
[SPEAKER_01]: She prayed every day, mostly to herself, that she would continue to find the strength to consider her mind her greatest wealth.

936
01:24:28,086 --> 01:24:31,067
[SPEAKER_01]: She found friends and people like-minded.

937
01:24:31,327 --> 01:24:34,767
[SPEAKER_01]: She understood most stories, they get told one-sided.

938
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:36,888
[SPEAKER_01]: She created change through discussion.

939
01:24:37,188 --> 01:24:38,508
[SPEAKER_01]: She appreciated her blessings.

940
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:42,108
[SPEAKER_01]: She tried to take all her mistakes as opportunities for lessons.

941
01:24:42,429 --> 01:24:43,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So I called her one day.

942
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her something unusual.

943
01:24:45,769 --> 01:24:46,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her, I be you.

944
01:24:47,489 --> 01:24:48,209
[SPEAKER_01]: You be me.

945
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:49,490
[SPEAKER_01]: We be she.

946
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:51,190
[SPEAKER_01]: She is beautiful.

947
01:24:52,453 --> 01:24:58,998
[SPEAKER_01]: They walk with me as I continue on my journey, weathered and war-torn and sometimes a little weary.

948
01:24:59,538 --> 01:25:00,699
[SPEAKER_01]: The world can get scary.

949
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything isn't always clear.

950
01:25:03,742 --> 01:25:17,292
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm learning to face my path with a brave absence of fear, constantly contradicting myself, forever reinventing myself, testing myself, condensing myself, but consistently striving to find the best in myself.

951
01:25:17,617 --> 01:25:27,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Things change and they seem to be getting harder, but really, it's getting easier, because baby, I'm just getting smarter, realizing that I am a part of a blanket that keeps me wrapped in karma.

952
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:29,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I look in the mirror now.

953
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I smile at my reflection.

954
01:25:31,981 --> 01:25:36,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thankful every day for another resurrection, because I am my sister's keeper.

955
01:25:36,803 --> 01:25:38,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I reap the benefits of her protection.

956
01:25:39,123 --> 01:25:45,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Together, we fight to challenge society's perception of women that only relate to each other with lies and deception.

957
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:51,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So when my sisters wish to gossip, they are met with my refusal.

958
01:25:53,046 --> 01:25:54,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them I be you.

959
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:55,929
[SPEAKER_01]: You be me.

960
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:57,571
[SPEAKER_01]: We be she.

961
01:25:58,392 --> 01:25:59,353
[SPEAKER_07]: She's too beautiful.

962
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,242
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my latest book.

963
01:26:15,722 --> 01:26:31,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called love poems to my not lover It's supposed to be a little funny, but also very real And this poem is called written universe I've written all my love poems to you

964
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:34,391
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the songs and one liners.

965
01:26:35,132 --> 01:26:37,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I filled the sky with ink one pen stroke at a time.

966
01:26:38,955 --> 01:26:41,077
[SPEAKER_02]: The glow is always so strong here.

967
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:43,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Never a weary moment.

968
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:49,304
[SPEAKER_02]: That is to say I never tire when it comes to loving you on paper or in life.

969
01:26:50,585 --> 01:26:56,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Every star is a dedication and the moon sits idly by waiting to become canvas.

970
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting to light up the sky with its reflection of you.

971
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never penned anything as beautiful as the sun.

972
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:07,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's why I haven't captured your heart yet.

973
01:27:08,244 --> 01:27:08,964
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll keep trying.

974
01:27:10,965 --> 01:27:12,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll create galaxies if need be.

975
01:27:13,787 --> 01:27:15,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Call it a written universe.

976
01:27:15,628 --> 01:27:15,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

977
01:27:25,393 --> 01:27:27,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So who said one more round?

978
01:27:30,724 --> 01:27:43,613
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have this poem that I wrote years ago, and I'm trying to see if I can find a way to have... It worked.

979
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:46,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, honey, it's about to get real.

980
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:48,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm gonna do.

981
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:53,619
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me introduce you to Lone Soul, ladies and gentlemen, please give him a round of applause.

982
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Lone Soul is an extraordinary saxophone player.

983
01:27:57,682 --> 01:27:58,583
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't bring his sax.

984
01:28:17,063 --> 01:28:19,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So before I play this, I'm going to tell you the story.

985
01:28:20,245 --> 01:28:26,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's important and it's relevant in all of the stories.

986
01:28:28,232 --> 01:28:29,793
[SPEAKER_06]: All because it feeds into the system.

987
01:28:30,774 --> 01:28:31,054
Oops.

988
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:32,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

989
01:28:32,936 --> 01:28:35,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the system done missed some fire today.

990
01:28:37,179 --> 01:28:40,061
[SPEAKER_06]: But some things are meant to be a certain type of way, right?

991
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:45,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So years ago, I used to work at a storefront spot in Lawrence, Mass.

992
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:50,581
[SPEAKER_06]: This spot used to happen to be on what I call a hot block.

993
01:28:51,341 --> 01:28:56,685
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where the crack was, this is where the prostitutes was, this is where it happened, you know?

994
01:28:56,705 --> 01:29:02,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And this particular guy would walk back and forth all day long, every day, every day, every day.

995
01:29:02,169 --> 01:29:03,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd see him walking back and forth.

996
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:05,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I'd growl at him.

997
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:10,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not like this man much.

998
01:29:11,034 --> 01:29:12,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of loathed him a bit.

999
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And one day, he was on the phone.

1000
01:29:16,355 --> 01:29:17,395
[SPEAKER_06]: He was walking down the street.

1001
01:29:17,415 --> 01:29:18,776
[SPEAKER_06]: He was cussing something awful.

1002
01:29:19,916 --> 01:29:27,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And as he was walking, he saw my son, who was seven at the time, sitting outside the car.

1003
01:29:27,878 --> 01:29:29,538
[SPEAKER_06]: And he put his phone to his chest.

1004
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:31,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, my bad, little man.

1005
01:29:32,179 --> 01:29:33,539
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't need to hear all that.

1006
01:29:34,299 --> 01:29:35,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

1007
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I was coming out the office in that very moment when I saw that go down.

1008
01:29:39,482 --> 01:29:41,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, this monster has a soul.

1009
01:29:46,868 --> 01:29:47,929
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said to myself,

1010
01:29:49,963 --> 01:29:52,866
[SPEAKER_06]: And myself said, have a conversation with him.

1011
01:29:54,127 --> 01:29:55,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Find out what happened.

1012
01:29:55,809 --> 01:29:57,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did just that the following day.

1013
01:29:58,072 --> 01:30:00,454
[SPEAKER_06]: He was walking down the street having a similar conversation.

1014
01:30:00,494 --> 01:30:03,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, excuse me, when you have a moment, I'd like to have a word with you.

1015
01:30:04,258 --> 01:30:06,761
[SPEAKER_06]: He put his phone to his chest and said, I have a moment for you right now.

1016
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:07,642
[SPEAKER_06]: How can I help you, miss?

1017
01:30:08,322 --> 01:30:16,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, well, it seemed like yesterday you were having some issue, and you were, you know, cussing up a storm, and my son was there.

1018
01:30:16,987 --> 01:30:18,168
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, oh, that was your little man.

1019
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:18,828
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies.

1020
01:30:18,868 --> 01:30:19,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize, little man.

1021
01:30:20,009 --> 01:30:21,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I stopped him, and I said, no, no, no.

1022
01:30:21,629 --> 01:30:27,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw all of that go down, which is why I'm asking you for a moment today, because I didn't really like you.

1023
01:30:29,294 --> 01:30:30,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was honest, right?

1024
01:30:30,556 --> 01:30:31,617
[SPEAKER_06]: He looked at me kind of weird.

1025
01:30:31,637 --> 01:30:33,259
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, but you don't even know me.

1026
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, no, but I kind of know what you do because I watch you all day, every day.

1027
01:30:38,486 --> 01:30:42,571
[SPEAKER_06]: But after what you did yesterday to my little boy, I feel like there's something more to you.

1028
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:44,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm asking, how did you get here?

1029
01:30:45,433 --> 01:30:47,474
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it was the classic story.

1030
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:51,156
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he had trouble at home, so he went to the streets.

1031
01:30:51,176 --> 01:30:52,197
[SPEAKER_06]: The streets welcomed him.

1032
01:30:52,257 --> 01:30:53,397
[SPEAKER_06]: The streets got him locked up.

1033
01:30:53,457 --> 01:31:02,222
[SPEAKER_06]: He got locked up, then got released, and then he couldn't go back home, so he went back to the streets, and the streets welcomed him and got him locked up again, and so the cycle continued.

1034
01:31:03,182 --> 01:31:09,345
[SPEAKER_06]: While he was locked up, I don't know, many of the times that he was locked up, he got to writing, so he wrote poetry.

1035
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:17,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the end of our conversation, you know, he got a little frisky and he was like, so what's a brother gotta do to ask a girl out on a date?

1036
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:21,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, you know, I know what you do for a living, right?

1037
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:25,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, yeah, but a brother can dream though.

1038
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:32,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, tell you what, you write me a poem and I'll write you a poem and then maybe I'll let you take me to McDonald's.

1039
01:31:35,981 --> 01:31:38,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know whatever came of him.

1040
01:31:38,745 --> 01:31:40,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope he's still breathing.

1041
01:31:41,108 --> 01:31:42,530
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I hope he's doing better.

1042
01:31:43,772 --> 01:31:47,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I never got his poem, but I did write him mine.

1043
01:31:48,198 --> 01:31:51,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Years later, fast forward 13 years later, right?

1044
01:31:52,343 --> 01:31:53,245
[SPEAKER_06]: My eldest son,

1045
01:31:54,588 --> 01:31:57,451
[SPEAKER_06]: He's showing me some songs in a playlist, Spotify.

1046
01:31:57,851 --> 01:31:58,792
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Spotify playlist.

1047
01:31:58,812 --> 01:31:59,813
[SPEAKER_06]: He's showing me his music.

1048
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:02,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And this song comes out by this artist named George Lovett.

1049
01:32:03,357 --> 01:32:04,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Look him up, please.

1050
01:32:04,678 --> 01:32:05,399
[SPEAKER_06]: George Lovett.

1051
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:13,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And the instant the song began, I felt like the same feelings that I felt when I sat down to pen that poem.

1052
01:32:15,309 --> 01:32:16,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So music does that.

1053
01:32:16,729 --> 01:32:17,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Music takes you places.

1054
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:19,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes you back.

1055
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,090
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes you forward.

1056
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:20,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps you dream.

1057
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:21,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you dream.

1058
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:26,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So this song, go ahead, baby.

1059
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:34,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Took me back to that moment as I wrote this poem for this man.

1060
01:32:34,893 --> 01:32:36,914
[SPEAKER_06]: So this poem is called Ode to a Husband.

1061
01:32:37,734 --> 01:32:43,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And it goes a little something like this.

1062
01:32:49,063 --> 01:33:09,730
[SPEAKER_06]: As I stood before you, humbled by the possibilities of what could have been, had we met at another time or place, life and wildness steps retraced, perhaps, to a time in your life before society forced you to take one wrong turn after another, and another, and another.

1063
01:33:11,331 --> 01:33:17,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I see loneliness and sadness in your eyes, and I tell you this with no fear or disguise, but for all the things for which you're wise,

1064
01:33:18,248 --> 01:33:30,371
[SPEAKER_06]: You still choose to handle the knife by which the soul dies Promoting a pipe dream sold in highs, perhaps Conforming to the pleasures that lie within cheap thighs When in your heart, you yearn for the whispers of a true woman's sighs

1065
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:44,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You sling rocks to the tick-tock and you don't stop to listen to a potential lover's rock that sings to your clock, waiting for the right time to approach you with the idea of what and if.

1066
01:33:44,248 --> 01:33:44,709
[SPEAKER_06]: What if?

1067
01:33:44,809 --> 01:33:56,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Two words that transcend through time like sand and then sift through a bottomless filter into a bottomless bag, into a bottomless pipe that pleasures a bottomless soul, a soul that spends its life chasing a high like a dog chases its tail.

1068
01:33:59,196 --> 01:34:26,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And their intention is doomed to fail Because you and I both know They ain't ever gonna catch it But they sure gonna keep stepping To fetch what you got Making you forever the one that life forgot A perpetual number 11 stuck right in the middle of a catch 22 You're damned if you don't And you're damned if you do And you're damned if you don't And you're damned if you do

1069
01:34:27,725 --> 01:34:35,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I see beyond what lies within your pockets and delve into the curiosities that lie within your minds, because I believe you to be so much more than what you've chosen to become.

1070
01:34:37,032 --> 01:34:41,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though you've always got some, I could never see in you the sum of what I'm looking for.

1071
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:44,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm forced to look not onto you, but at you.

1072
01:34:44,557 --> 01:34:48,961
[SPEAKER_06]: At times in anger and aggravation, and at times in shame, knowing you are not to blame.

1073
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:51,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you've been forced to play this game by their rules.

1074
01:34:56,815 --> 01:34:59,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Two rights don't make a left and two wrongs don't make a right.

1075
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:03,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Lack of moon does not make day and lack of sun does not make night.

1076
01:35:03,243 --> 01:35:04,805
[SPEAKER_06]: The clock ain't wrong, baby.

1077
01:35:05,286 --> 01:35:06,287
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just wound too tight.

1078
01:35:07,329 --> 01:35:09,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Causing you to run late and let life pass you by.

1079
01:35:09,492 --> 01:35:14,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now it may seem like you're the big fish, but baby, even big sharks can get caught on hooks.

1080
01:35:15,518 --> 01:35:20,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that in your day, you've read enough books enough to know that failure is not an option.

1081
01:35:20,761 --> 01:35:21,462
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a choice.

1082
01:35:22,022 --> 01:35:27,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And many choices you still do have, because even though you think you're running late, it's never too late if you're still breathing.

1083
01:35:27,866 --> 01:35:29,026
[SPEAKER_06]: What more can I say?

1084
01:35:30,107 --> 01:35:31,068
[SPEAKER_06]: What more can you do?

1085
01:35:32,048 --> 01:35:37,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only hope and pray that someday you'll figure out the sum of what's true.

1086
01:35:37,912 --> 01:35:39,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And make your choice to find your way, baby.

1087
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, let your gray skies turn blue.

1088
01:35:58,303 --> 01:35:59,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could whistle.

1089
01:36:02,286 --> 01:36:04,368
[SPEAKER_01]: This poem will not rhyme.

1090
01:36:05,748 --> 01:36:09,691
[SPEAKER_01]: This poem is officially a protest of saying sounds that sound the same.

1091
01:36:10,352 --> 01:36:11,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where it started.

1092
01:36:12,073 --> 01:36:13,274
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been Dr. Seuss.

1093
01:36:14,382 --> 01:36:15,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe rock him.

1094
01:36:15,723 --> 01:36:18,004
[SPEAKER_01]: They were amongst the first to really sing to me.

1095
01:36:18,324 --> 01:36:23,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And then came Shakespeare, George Carlin, Jay-Z, unraveling a pentameter mystery.

1096
01:36:24,007 --> 01:36:26,168
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brought bliss to me throughout my history.

1097
01:36:26,248 --> 01:36:29,349
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a habit I have trouble resisting, you see.

1098
01:36:30,209 --> 01:36:30,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Not this poem.

1099
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:33,371
[SPEAKER_01]: This poem will not rhyme.

1100
01:36:33,651 --> 01:36:39,774
[SPEAKER_01]: This poem is about creating a whole new rhythm.

1101
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:46,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Going in a direction you haven't gone before, doing something brave and different that might feel a little uncomfortable.

1102
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,517
[SPEAKER_01]: This poem is about lizards.

1103
01:36:50,378 --> 01:36:52,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Lizards are an amazing creature.

1104
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,523
[SPEAKER_01]: There are almost 1,800 different types of lizards within the lizard species.

1105
01:36:56,803 --> 01:36:59,406
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be found on all but one continent of the earth.

1106
01:36:59,986 --> 01:37:01,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Lizards get around.

1107
01:37:02,588 --> 01:37:09,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Another interesting fact about the lizard is that many of them have the ability to release their tail from their body when being held captive by a predator.

1108
01:37:10,012 --> 01:37:14,195
[SPEAKER_01]: They can actually separate from this appendage and escape, be free.

1109
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:17,056
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not regenerate this tail.

1110
01:37:17,917 --> 01:37:29,043
[SPEAKER_01]: You may actually see some lizards stumbling around, trying to find their balance, trying to learn to walk without this part of themselves that they thought that they were going to have forever.

1111
01:37:30,222 --> 01:37:33,524
[SPEAKER_01]: but they do find their balance, they do go on to live.

1112
01:37:34,825 --> 01:37:59,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if each of us could find our tail, that part of ourself that's holding us captive, that part of ourself that's trying to kill us, that idea, that belief, that voice inside our head, self-talk, that behavior, that habit, that peace that if we too learned how to release it, we too could go on and be free.

1113
01:38:00,691 --> 01:38:10,436
[SPEAKER_01]: We, too, may find ourself stumbling around, trying to find our balance, trying to find a way to be without this thing that's part of ourself that we thought that we were going to have forever.

1114
01:38:10,876 --> 01:38:13,997
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, too, would work through the uncomfortableness.

1115
01:38:14,458 --> 01:38:16,799
[SPEAKER_01]: We, too, would go on to live.

1116
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:21,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, my friends, is why this poem could not rhyme.

1117
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:27,103
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because sometimes you get caught in a pattern of doing stuff just because that's how you always do it.

1118
01:38:27,304 --> 01:38:29,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have no good reason to explain it other than that.

1119
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:39,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if you take that voice that's going on inside of your head and took it out and sat it down on the couch and let it start talking, you would tell it to shut up.

1120
01:38:42,546 --> 01:38:45,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we've got to stop ourself.

1121
01:38:46,456 --> 01:38:53,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Give ourself a little bit of grace, forgive ourself, and give ourself permission to try again in a new direction.

1122
01:38:54,780 --> 01:39:05,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there isn't roadmaps, and sometimes you will find yourself stumbling down a path, and you find yourself, you got no roadmap, and habits are sort of like that, where it's easy to start to revert back.

1123
01:39:06,985 --> 01:39:08,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to pull yourself out.

1124
01:39:10,767 --> 01:39:11,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Forgive yourself.

1125
01:39:12,228 --> 01:39:12,788
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

1126
01:39:13,248 --> 01:39:13,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I can start again.

1127
01:39:14,289 --> 01:39:15,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to run.

1128
01:39:17,138 --> 01:39:29,443
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with following in other people's footsteps, the problem with following in other people's footsteps is that it doesn't leave any room for the parts of yourself you have yet to discover.

1129
01:39:30,484 --> 01:39:31,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time tonight.

1130
01:39:47,755 --> 01:39:50,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was beautiful, again.

1131
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:53,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the lizard part.

1132
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:57,804
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a lizard reference in my next poem, so I know I chose the right one.

1133
01:39:57,904 --> 01:39:59,205
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called Brujeria.

1134
01:40:00,726 --> 01:40:03,028
[SPEAKER_02]: You thought you stole my magic.

1135
01:40:03,989 --> 01:40:08,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't realize you only took with you parts of me I didn't need.

1136
01:40:08,853 --> 01:40:10,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lizard with its tail cut off.

1137
01:40:11,998 --> 01:40:14,300
[SPEAKER_02]: The severed bit, well it just dies.

1138
01:40:15,361 --> 01:40:19,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is to say the things you stole from me lose their meaning without me.

1139
01:40:19,944 --> 01:40:22,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is to say they are beautiful but useless now.

1140
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:29,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Like leaves in the fall, they are gorgeous and dead and rotting in your hands.

1141
01:40:30,465 --> 01:40:34,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But this magic in me, well, it never dissipates.

1142
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:38,774
[SPEAKER_02]: This witchcraft finds its roots in generations before me.

1143
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:42,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It is growing and you, well, you make me sad.

1144
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:49,386
[SPEAKER_02]: You seem to have had magic of your own once, but cut away pieces of yourself you can't get back.

1145
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Tried to prune yourself but made too many mistakes.

1146
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:59,872
[SPEAKER_02]: You're withering now, and I must admit it's more fun to watch you realize you have nothing of me than I expected.

1147
01:41:01,327 --> 01:41:04,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Never thought I'd watch you lose yourself while I grew more alive.

1148
01:41:04,668 --> 01:41:06,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I always believed we would grow together.

1149
01:41:07,328 --> 01:41:09,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But this brujería is overpowering.

1150
01:41:10,369 --> 01:41:12,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you still feel it, don't you?

1151
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:13,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a phantom limb.

1152
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:15,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Soy un fantasma.

1153
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,731
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a disappearing act, darling.

1154
01:41:19,251 --> 01:41:19,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not there.

1155
01:41:20,572 --> 01:41:22,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Esta magia es real y yo soy bruja.

1156
01:41:23,452 --> 01:41:25,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it more clearly now than ever.

1157
01:41:25,893 --> 01:41:26,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen you.

1158
01:41:27,513 --> 01:41:30,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a magician, and that is no match for my hechizo.

1159
01:41:31,874 --> 01:41:35,756
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happens when you try to fool a witch with stage magic.

1160
01:41:36,836 --> 01:41:47,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't think the world won't notice that you are nothing but a parlor trick and who could care for something so ingenuine, so unreal, it could fool itself.

1161
01:41:47,841 --> 01:41:48,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1162
01:41:55,897 --> 01:42:04,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot thank you enough for your time and for allowing us the canvas of silence to paint masterpieces on with our spoken word.

1163
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:07,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much for allowing us this space.

1164
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:09,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Terry, thank you for inviting us.

1165
01:42:09,572 --> 01:42:16,420
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to contribute to our magic and to our craft, Dexter has some books for sale at a very affordable price.

1166
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:20,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a scan code here that you can scan to find out more about me as an artist.

1167
01:42:20,582 --> 01:42:22,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also donate to me there.

1168
01:42:22,783 --> 01:42:24,444
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also donate to Cole here.

1169
01:42:24,524 --> 01:42:28,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put her name in the donation, like whatever you want to do.

1170
01:42:28,707 --> 01:42:30,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can come talk to us.

1171
01:42:31,248 --> 01:42:31,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1172
01:42:32,209 --> 01:42:39,333
[SPEAKER_06]: The important thing is that we kind of come out of that whole pandemic mentality and remember what it's like to connect.

1173
01:42:40,834 --> 01:42:41,994
[SPEAKER_06]: So do me a favor.

1174
01:42:42,034 --> 01:42:44,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to somebody that you don't know real quick.

1175
01:42:45,036 --> 01:42:46,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Say just hello.

1176
01:42:58,819 --> 01:43:00,822
[SPEAKER_06]: You see how beautiful y'all look right now?

1177
01:43:02,364 --> 01:43:09,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that when you turned to say hello to somebody that you didn't know you realized the beautiful rainbow we have in this room right now.

1178
01:43:11,076 --> 01:43:15,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a whole machine out there trying to convince us that this is not possible, that this shouldn't happen.

1179
01:43:15,838 --> 01:43:17,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've been working for years, honey.

1180
01:43:17,719 --> 01:43:19,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And they got salaries and whatnot.

1181
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:32,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So we come as humble artists before you to help you open your minds and hearts and spirits, understanding that love is the only way we're going to survive this war.

1182
01:43:33,045 --> 01:43:33,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Love is the only way.

1183
01:43:33,985 --> 01:43:36,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not about black or white, high yellow or dark chocolate.

1184
01:43:37,227 --> 01:43:40,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about good and bad, period.

1185
01:43:40,928 --> 01:43:42,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care what color your skin is.

1186
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:43,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care where you come from.

1187
01:43:43,771 --> 01:43:49,696
[SPEAKER_06]: If your parents jotted their name down on Ellis Island or jotted it on a rock in Plymouth Rock, it doesn't matter to me.

1188
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:53,739
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter to me because at the end of the day, we all bleed red.

1189
01:43:53,759 --> 01:44:01,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I ask you where you came from, what your favorite color is, what your favorite food is, what your favorite music is, hands are going to go up and down.

1190
01:44:01,246 --> 01:44:02,467
[SPEAKER_06]: All the answers are going to be different.

1191
01:44:02,507 --> 01:44:06,350
[SPEAKER_06]: If I ask you who in this room has felt pain, raise your hand.

1192
01:44:08,153 --> 01:44:10,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And that right there is the common denominator.

1193
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:17,899
[SPEAKER_06]: And that should be the unifying factor because hurt people hurt people is not a thing.

1194
01:44:18,619 --> 01:44:22,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Because once you know what it feels like to be hurt, you shouldn't wish that upon nobody.

1195
01:44:23,502 --> 01:44:27,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So from here moving forward, may every step you take be blessed.

1196
01:44:28,165 --> 01:44:31,907
[SPEAKER_06]: May every time you find yourself in darkness, you remember that you are light.

1197
01:44:32,467 --> 01:44:36,450
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a creative gift, I don't care how old you are, embrace that.

1198
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:39,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Your ancestors turn from you when you deny who you are.

1199
01:44:40,272 --> 01:44:44,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to find connection with your ancestors, embrace who you are.

1200
01:44:44,655 --> 01:44:50,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Embrace that magic inside of that little girl inside of you, that little boy inside of you, that always wanted to be something, be that.

1201
01:44:50,418 --> 01:44:51,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never too late.

1202
01:44:52,299 --> 01:44:58,608
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the pieces that fall off, like they do on lizards, listen, be thankful for that.

1203
01:44:59,530 --> 01:45:02,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Be thankful for the bad things more than you're thankful for the good.

1204
01:45:02,233 --> 01:45:02,754
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why?

1205
01:45:03,035 --> 01:45:04,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the bad is what shapes you.

1206
01:45:05,904 --> 01:45:08,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine yourself being a rock in a tumbler.

1207
01:45:08,646 --> 01:45:15,252
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get shiny and round unless you go through it and lose bits and pieces and chunks of yourself.

1208
01:45:15,993 --> 01:45:24,680
[SPEAKER_06]: But once you get to that spherical form, you are the most powerful manifestation of yourself because the energy reverberates within.

1209
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:26,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Think of the atom.

1210
01:45:29,268 --> 01:45:37,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So come see me, come talk to me, connect with me, connect with my beautiful sister Cole Rodriguez, connect with my beautiful young sister Dexter Garcia.

1211
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:40,140
[SPEAKER_06]: We exist to take your breath away.

1212
01:45:41,081 --> 01:45:46,547
[SPEAKER_06]: So our whole purpose is to move you so that we can create change in this world.

1213
01:45:46,607 --> 01:45:48,829
[SPEAKER_06]: So go out there and run and tell that.

1214
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:50,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell them what you experienced here.

1215
01:45:51,632 --> 01:45:59,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, tell them what you experience here in the West Medford Community Center and may this place fill up every month more and more Because this is what we need.

1216
01:45:59,563 --> 01:46:04,189
[SPEAKER_06]: We need that village Again, and again, so thank you again for your time.

1217
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:05,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Come talk to us

1218
01:46:17,967 --> 01:46:22,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you think you're a poet and you meet poets, you don't think you're as big a poet as you thought you were.

1219
01:46:23,772 --> 01:46:25,914
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's all good, it's all good, you know.

1220
01:46:25,934 --> 01:46:31,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I said I've been around the block, this thing, Black Girls Rock, I know that is true.

1221
01:46:36,543 --> 01:46:40,346
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as the young folks are so fond of saying, I can't even.

1222
01:46:41,527 --> 01:46:42,988
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all they say, I can't even.

1223
01:46:44,887 --> 01:46:47,911
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an awesome, awesome set.

1224
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:52,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're so blessed to have you all grace this stage.

1225
01:46:54,199 --> 01:47:00,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really, for me, the poet in me is inspired and challenged on a whole nother level.

1226
01:47:02,453 --> 01:47:05,015
[SPEAKER_05]: just wow, just wow.

1227
01:47:06,576 --> 01:47:13,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a wrap for this new live edition of WMCC's monthly words and music program.

1228
01:47:14,401 --> 01:47:21,585
[SPEAKER_05]: We're so happy to be kicking off Women's History Month by visiting with you in your living rooms and other household places.

1229
01:47:22,365 --> 01:47:22,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to

1230
01:47:23,566 --> 01:47:42,957
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, give another kudos to Jillian for sitting down and having a really thoughtful and important conversation and really bringing back to relevance, as several have done in succession.

1231
01:47:43,517 --> 01:47:50,460
[SPEAKER_05]: the importance of the NAACP as a seminal institution in American life.

1232
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:59,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really important in the Mystic Valley, and in listening to Jillian, I hear her passion for doing that, so we're blessed.

1233
01:47:59,743 --> 01:48:03,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a virtual high five to Kevin Harrington,

[SPEAKER_05]: If heck doesn't freeze over, and it just might, we'll be back in mid-April.

1238

[SPEAKER_05]: It will actually be the second Friday in April because

1239
01:48:35,007 --> 01:48:41,309
[SPEAKER_05]: First Friday is Good Friday, and we want to give everybody the chance to observe it as they might.

1240
01:48:43,189 --> 01:48:49,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we fade to black, here's one more reminder about what's happening next at your WMCC.

1258
01:50:22,633 --> 01:50:28,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We're blessed once again by having them give to us again a significant donation so that we can do what we do.

1259
01:50:30,579 --> 01:50:32,460
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all for now, folks.

1260
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Join the Center in April.

1261
01:50:34,342 --> 01:50:35,903

[SPEAKER_05]: A new edition of First Friday's Words and Music being developed even as we think.

1263
01:50:42,448 --> 01:50:51,235
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to be included in our regular constant contact connection, sign up for membership or give us a call at 781-483-3042.

1264
01:50:52,717 --> 01:50:56,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the weather's going to get inclement a little bit later on, hopefully not yet.

1265
01:50:57,061 --> 01:51:01,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night, be safe, keep warm, we hope to see you again soon.
