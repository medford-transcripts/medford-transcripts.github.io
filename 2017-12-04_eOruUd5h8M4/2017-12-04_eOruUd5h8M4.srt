00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:21,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Vanderpool.

72
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it your wish that I should present them?

73
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,128
[SPEAKER_17]: If you wanted to summarize it.

74
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:26,448
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

75
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:30,072
[SPEAKER_17]: So this was the Committee of the Whole of November 13th.

76
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:31,433
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, do we need to?

77
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:32,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?

78
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:34,255
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

79
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:34,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold tight.

80
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:45,637
[SPEAKER_17]: And present at the meeting were Mayor Burke, Vice Chair Anne Marie Cuno, Arenda Benedetto, Kathy Kreatz, Mia Mastone, Robert Scurry, and myself.

81
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:49,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Also attending was Michael Ruggiero and Paul Rousseau, school committee members elect.

82

[SPEAKER_17]: Also present were the following, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Director of Pupil Services Kathleen Medaglio, Director of Curriculum Bernadette Scurry,

[SPEAKER_17]: uh, Marie Petrides, Angela Moore, David Lu, Melanie McLaughlin, Tanya Sullivan, and Jameel Webb Davis.

85
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Transcript recorder Miranda Wilson was also in attendance.

86
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:50,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, the mayor, uh, the, the meeting was called, uh, to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus.

87
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,896
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.

88
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:54,937
[SPEAKER_17]: I just added that.

89
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:58,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Superintendent Dawson made the following remarks.

90
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,299
[SPEAKER_17]: The evenings, and by the way, sorry, there was a mistake.

91
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,040
[SPEAKER_17]: It should be Bernadette Riccadeli.

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,121
[SPEAKER_17]: So we addressed the four different issues.

93
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:13,402
[SPEAKER_17]: And the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership.

94
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:18,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Director of administration and finance, Christine Patterson, gave this report, and it's attached.

95
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:23,487
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, Tucci verified the report.

96
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:32,656
[SPEAKER_17]: There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning, um, and in the afternoon there are between 45 to 50 riders daily with each, which is within its capacity.

97
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:35,279
[SPEAKER_17]: At this time there's no need to add another bus.

98
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:36,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Administration will

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep the committee informed as demand increases.

100
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:41,884
[SPEAKER_17]: The next item was student concussions.

101
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,727
[SPEAKER_17]: We talked about this at length.

102
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:51,873
[SPEAKER_17]: As part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.

103
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:59,100
[SPEAKER_17]: She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.

104
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,764
[SPEAKER_17]: She believes that the Beverly Schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.

105
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth, and nosebleeds.

106
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:08,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Her concern focused upon safety at away games.

107
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:19,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.

108
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:27,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.

109
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:34,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.

110
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:40,395
[SPEAKER_17]: The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIAA regarding this matter.

111
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:50,681
[SPEAKER_17]: The next item under discussion was the field trip policy and administrators Paul DeLiva, Tony Vento, and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.

112
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:59,707
[SPEAKER_17]: CPAC chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.

113
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:07,592
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.

114
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:21,898
[SPEAKER_17]: Among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.

115
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:29,100
[SPEAKER_17]: If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately $7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.

116
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:30,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

117
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:37,769
[SPEAKER_17]: McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.

118
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,730
[SPEAKER_17]: The issue raised several points.

119
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:44,933
[SPEAKER_17]: Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?

120
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?

121
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:53,737
[SPEAKER_17]: And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?

122
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:56,699
[SPEAKER_17]: After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.

123
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:59,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.

124
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:02,665
[SPEAKER_17]: The final issue of the evening was school brains.

125
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:08,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Headmaster Perrella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.

126
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:15,797
[SPEAKER_17]: The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.

127
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:20,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.

128
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,902
[SPEAKER_17]: More will be done going forward.

129
00:07:22,202 --> 00:07:24,344
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.

130
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:28,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.

131
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,290
[SPEAKER_17]: He revisited his concerns from last spring.

132
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Administrators asserted that the changes would work.

133
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:36,794
[SPEAKER_17]: The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.

134
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,834
[SPEAKER_17]: The meeting was adjourned at 10.05.

135
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:41,315
[SPEAKER_17]: Respectfully submitted, Paulette Vander Kloot, secretary.

136
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:42,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

137
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:42,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

138
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:43,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Vander Kloot.

139
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:44,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

140
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:44,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

141
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:45,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

142
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:48,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Superintendent Belson, I just wanted to follow up with you.

143
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:49,899
[SPEAKER_11]: I was in touch with Ms.

144
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:58,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Simonides, and I just wanted to know if something was filed with the MIAA regarding the incident, if you had a chance to file that yet.

145
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:03,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.

146
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:08,609
[SPEAKER_12]: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.

147
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:09,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Simonides.

148
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.

149
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,494
[SPEAKER_12]: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer, who was on the field at that time.

150
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:26,356
[SPEAKER_12]: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.

151
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:33,520
[SPEAKER_12]: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.

152
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,400
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have a lot more to do.

153
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:42,583
[SPEAKER_12]: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.

154
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:44,244
[SPEAKER_12]: But there is a distinct

155
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:50,567
[SPEAKER_12]: difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.

156
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:56,211
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.

157
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:02,174
[SPEAKER_12]: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that

158
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:09,237
[SPEAKER_12]: the play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.

159
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:20,801
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.

160
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:23,042
[SPEAKER_12]: They gave me the name and showed me the licensure.

161
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:26,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you communicate that information to the parent?

162
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:28,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Not yet.

163
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,333
[SPEAKER_12]: This is still going back.

164
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:33,135
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today from Stephen Hershey.

165
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:36,056
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've got a lot more work to do.

166
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:39,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.

167
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:43,919
[SPEAKER_11]: So you got the name, and the person is not certified?

168
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,499
[SPEAKER_11]: They are.

169
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually have it on my phone, and I can give it to you afterwards.

170
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:49,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Brewer.

171
00:09:50,867 --> 00:10:01,837
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing, um, and a student got hurt, why wasn't our, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?

172
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:02,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean.

173
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:14,149
[SPEAKER_12]: According to Beverly, uh, the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, um, you know,

174
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,408
[SPEAKER_12]: that the assistance was done on the sidelines.

175
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:23,069
[SPEAKER_12]: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.

176
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,950
[SPEAKER_12]: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?

177
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,991
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.

178
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:38,574
[SPEAKER_17]: And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game.

179
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:43,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.

180
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:49,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And secondly, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.

181
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:56,632
[SPEAKER_12]: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.

182
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:06,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if... Well, that's an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.

183
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:12,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the, again, superintendent of Beverly,

184
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:23,266
[SPEAKER_12]: because Mississippi was contacting the Beverly School Committee and others up in Beverly and they are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now.

185
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:27,028
[SPEAKER_12]: So I need a lot more feeling as to what really took place.

186
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of information, Mayor?

187
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:28,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information.

188
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:34,470
[SPEAKER_20]: Through you to the Superintendent, has the Game Officials Committee been contacted to find out who the referee was?

189
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,311
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.

190
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, have you spoke to the coach?

191
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,739
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.

192
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Maloney.

193
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,241
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm going to get a follow-up on that.

194
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:53,427
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.

195
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:56,389
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.

196
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:56,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

197
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,793
[SPEAKER_17]: But we do have the student who this happened to.

198
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:01,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

199
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:03,475
[SPEAKER_17]: And we could have a follow-up with the student.

200
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:03,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

201
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:08,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.

202
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:10,020
[SPEAKER_12]: I have two very different reports.

203
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:11,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

204
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:12,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Coño?

205
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:28,032
[SPEAKER_08]: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...

206
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:31,856
[SPEAKER_12]: I doubt they were filming the JV game.

207
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,499
[SPEAKER_12]: They may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.

208
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sometimes it depends on the schools.

209
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:43,308
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be someone out there that just had their cell phone and were filming, too.

210
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:45,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to see what type of play.

211
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,414
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is something out there, at least we could see what happened.

212
00:12:53,017 --> 00:13:04,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially when you're up there, I know the first thing is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the player is asked to step off the field.

213
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:17,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me, if I can, Mayor, let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey, because I'm going to put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of, you know, the strength of his comment.

214
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:20,082
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't like, I don't think anything happened.

215
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,623
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very, very, you know, direct.

216
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,804
[SPEAKER_12]: So let me read it to you.

217
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:29,205
[SPEAKER_09]: While you're getting that up, Mr. Tringali, our student representative.

218
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:40,167
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the danger behind concussions is the lack of education that goes with it, and especially on the part of the coaches.

219
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:53,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the student does not know to take themselves out of the game, they'll put themselves at risk for a second damage to the brain, which is far worse than the first.

220
00:13:54,791 --> 00:14:00,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So possibly, if we're thinking about our own education policy in the future and keeping our own kids safe,

221
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:09,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a great example to show that we should push for Medford coaches to be

222
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:13,234
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of concussions in the game.

223
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:14,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Points of information?

224
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:14,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

225
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:15,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Perry?

226
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:15,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

227
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:16,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Bonilla?

228
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:21,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to address Mr. Trincali's question or discussion.

229
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:23,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, you did.

230
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:36,121
[SPEAKER_08]: The MIA came out with a concussion rule, a concussion policy mandate probably about, it's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it.

231
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,482
[SPEAKER_08]: The ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee

232
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:53,727
[SPEAKER_08]: themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it, the parents have to go through it.

233
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:59,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses.

234
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:07,873
[SPEAKER_08]: The only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic, because they were the ones that called the game.

235
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:14,016
[SPEAKER_08]: fought long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also have to go through it.

236
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:30,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have.

237
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:48,456
[SPEAKER_08]: If by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor, will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.

238
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:55,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer

239
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:56,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not blaming the coach.

240
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:57,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not blaming our team.

241
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:59,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not blaming anybody.

242
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:02,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon.

243
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:27,247
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the superintendent is working with them.

244
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:37,290
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.

245
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Good afternoon.

246
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.

247
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:42,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.

248
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:45,952
[SPEAKER_12]: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.

249
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:50,234
[SPEAKER_12]: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.

250
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,796
[SPEAKER_12]: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.

251
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:59,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.

252
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:04,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.

253
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:08,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.

254
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:13,031
[SPEAKER_12]: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own

255
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,051
[SPEAKER_12]: our players from other teams.

256
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:16,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to find out what happened.

257
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:18,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Please forward me any information you have.

258
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,993
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have an ongoing investigation.

259
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:26,494
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.

260
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:36,556
[SPEAKER_12]: This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.

261
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:40,437
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll mark it for a report, follow-up report on our agenda?

262
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:40,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

263
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:46,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there a motion to accept this committee of the whole report from November 13th?

264
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:47,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, actually amended.

265
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not present at this meeting.

266
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,381
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

267
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:49,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

268
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can add me to the meeting.

269
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Chair Cugno.

270
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:55,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Add you to it?

271
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was present.

272
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:56,665
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

273
00:17:56,725 --> 00:18:02,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion for acceptance of the report as amended?

274
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:04,030
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

275
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:05,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

276
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:06,832
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

277
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

278
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:08,213
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

279
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:09,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

280
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:12,965
[SPEAKER_09]: The Committee of the Whole from November 15th.

281
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:14,926
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not have that report yet.

282
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:19,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd ask that one of my colleagues table this Committee of the Whole report.

283
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:21,169
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved by Mr. Benedetto.

284
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:22,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

285
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:23,310
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

286
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:23,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

287
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,710
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

288
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,851
[SPEAKER_09]: That paper is tabled.

289
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:28,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Committee of the Whole, Minutes from November 27th, 2017.

290
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:39,422
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a meeting that we held last week in order to discuss the succession plan for our superintendent of schools.

291
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,163
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the Mass.

292
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:44,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Association of School Committees present.

293
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:50,726
[SPEAKER_09]: He presented quite a brochure to us on strategies that we should use in our deliberations.

294
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:56,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately, the Medford School Committee voted on the following matters in Committee of the Whole.

295
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:02,230
[SPEAKER_09]: that the MASC, Mass Associated School Committee, will provide a sample brochure to us.

296
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,971
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee will also explore other search consultants before making a selection.

297
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:10,192
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee voted to review internal candidates first.

298
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,512
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a seven to zero vote.

299
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:17,634
[SPEAKER_09]: And the school committee voted to meet again on December 11, 2017 to continue its work.

300
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:23,595
[SPEAKER_09]: We also had quite a bit of discussion around a search committee if we ultimately do go outside.

301
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:26,636
[SPEAKER_09]: What was explained to us is if we do internal candidates,

302
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,541
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be school committee interviewing in a public session.

303
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:37,522
[SPEAKER_09]: If from there we go to a full search, a nationwide search, let's say, we would form a committee.

304
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:52,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And the complement of that committee would be set up of three teachers from the different levels of schooling, one administrator, one student, school committee members, suggested was three,

305
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:56,027
[SPEAKER_09]: and also community members being parents.

306
00:19:56,588 --> 00:20:03,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also wanted to make sure that we included all subgroups such as special ed and ELL in those check boxes.

307
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:05,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're working on an actual application.

308
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:11,895
[SPEAKER_09]: For those out there, we're working on a formal application that people can fill out and submit back to us if they have an interest.

309
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I ask that our diversity director be a member of this committee.

310
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,741
[SPEAKER_09]: It was voted on in seven to zero, so thank you all for that.

311
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:23,564
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will be meeting next week to discuss this further on December 11th.

312
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent, is that up here?

313
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:26,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

314
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,607
[SPEAKER_09]: That is in the high school.

315
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:28,688
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be in the conference room.

316
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:32,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

317
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

318
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to accept by Mr. Cuno, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

319
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:37,455
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

320
00:20:37,815 --> 00:20:37,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

321
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:39,036
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

322
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:39,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

323
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Community participation.

324
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:42,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

325
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:45,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Retta Smith regarding the school breakfast program.

326
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Mia, did you want to say a few words or no?

327
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:48,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Retta.

328
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Retta.

329
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it.

330
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:56,280
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.

331
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,963
[SPEAKER_09]: So on our desk is a report on the 2017 breakfast participation rates as well as some literature.

332
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening everyone.

333
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:10,745
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was asked to present some information on the school breakfast program.

334
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:15,707
[SPEAKER_13]: So I am a registered dietitian and I am the nutritionist for the food services department.

335
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:17,768
[SPEAKER_13]: for Medford Public Schools.

336
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:22,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Just some general information, we offer breakfast at all of our schools.

337
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:28,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of them, it's traditional style offered before school begins in the cafeteria.

338
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:33,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Three of them offer breakfast free of charge for any student interested.

339
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:42,447
[SPEAKER_13]: One of those three has breakfast not in the cafeteria before school, but in the classroom after the bell, and it counts as learning time.

340
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:55,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you look at the sheet that has the breakfast participation rates, if you look at the last column, the percent ADP, so the percentage of average daily participation, it ranges from 0% to 86 almost percent.

341
00:21:55,976 --> 00:21:57,598
[SPEAKER_13]: So this really shows the

342
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:04,344
[SPEAKER_13]: drastic variance in participation rates.

343
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:11,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So the Columbus, the McGlynn Elementary, and Middle School all are offering universally free breakfasts.

344
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:26,833
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you take a look at just those three using the October 2017 data, the McGlynn Elementary School had almost 29% participation, the Middle School was almost 21, and the Columbus was at about 86.

345
00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:35,720
[SPEAKER_13]: So the Columbus is the school that offers breakfast in the classroom for everyone, so you can see the difference that that really makes in the participation rates.

346
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,123
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is not something that is unique to our district.

347
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:48,489
[SPEAKER_13]: The EOS Foundation, which is a non-profit organization that really promotes school breakfast being offered after the bell, they have seen this

348
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:59,448
[SPEAKER_13]: statewide that schools offering free breakfasts in a traditional setting before the bell experience participation rates far lower than those who offer it in the classroom.

349
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you explain why the Columbus offers it after the Valley versus the others before?

350
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a good question.

351
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:14,406
[SPEAKER_13]: The McGlynn Middle School, this is its first year instituting the universal, so I don't know what the decision was there.

352
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:21,529
[SPEAKER_13]: The elementary school, from what I'm told a few years ago, I think this was before I started working here, there was a rodent issue.

353
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,931
[SPEAKER_13]: They originally started off doing a breakfast in the class model.

354
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,574
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was a Ronan issue that was attributed to the breakfast program, so they stopped.

355
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:34,500
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mr. Superintendent, are the principals deciding whether it's before or after the bell?

356
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty much, yeah.

357
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:35,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much?

358
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:36,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

359
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we ask them to all re-evaluate?

360
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:39,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

361
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:44,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that be a recommendation you'd make?

362
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:44,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

363
00:23:44,478 --> 00:23:50,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to have you consider this information and questions of universal breakfast going forward.

364
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:52,707
[SPEAKER_12]: There's probably another factor, too, in terms of busing.

365
00:23:52,727 --> 00:24:00,115
[SPEAKER_12]: The more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive and take it before the actual school starts.

366
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:01,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, right.

367
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:01,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

368
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:01,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

369
00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:03,619
[SPEAKER_13]: That has a big impact in participation as well.

370
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:04,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto?

371
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:06,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

372
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:10,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building?

373
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:11,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know that?

374
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:12,991
[SPEAKER_05]: So the free and reduced eligibility?

375
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:20,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form.

376
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:24,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Does every student sign have a form returned?

377
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,079
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

378
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do we get, like, two parents that

379
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:38,550
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need.

380
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that would change a lot.

381
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:49,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications.

382
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:54,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Their free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis.

383
00:24:55,175 --> 00:25:10,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any kids with learning forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here.

384
00:25:11,182 --> 00:25:11,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

385
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:22,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost a hundred percent return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year.

386
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:29,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative

387
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:45,417
[SPEAKER_05]: processes, so I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family.

388
00:25:45,497 --> 00:25:47,959
[SPEAKER_05]: They either sign off yes or they sign off no.

389
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people

390
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,254
[SPEAKER_05]: especially non-English families.

391
00:25:58,534 --> 00:25:59,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

392
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing that there are other things that this qualifies them for is so important to make sure they get food.

393
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:06,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

394
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:06,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Patterson.

395
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:15,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'd like to comment on that, that we have engaged and made sure that we have the free and reduced applications in multiple languages.

396
00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:16,375
[SPEAKER_04]: They are returned.

397
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,618
[SPEAKER_04]: There is not a requirement for them to be returned.

398
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,399
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a forced item.

399
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:28,885
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we are capturing more free and reduced qualifications because they are incorporated within the portal.

400
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:30,987
[SPEAKER_04]: So we automatically draw those down.

401
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:35,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not necessary that we receive an actual form back from every household.

402
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:41,328
[SPEAKER_04]: We are gathering those and getting those counts regardless through the portals that have.

403
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:47,630
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we've encouraged additional services and we've had outreach with our parent information center.

404
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:59,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are providing much more detailed information and encouraging families to participate in these other systems that will provide them additional resources and then also

405
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:02,886
[SPEAKER_04]: automatically qualify them for free or reduced.

406
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:09,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes.

407
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:18,494
[SPEAKER_05]: They get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form.

408
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:20,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so important to feed our children.

409
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:27,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications.

410
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:28,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not applying.

411
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:43,461
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper, and like, it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates.

412
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:46,152
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a suggestion.

413
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I made it maybe last year as well.

414
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:51,114
[SPEAKER_12]: So let me just make one clarification.

415
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:52,474
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the breakfast program.

416
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,195
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.

417
00:27:56,655 --> 00:27:56,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

418
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,997
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.

419
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:09,599
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the

420
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:15,242
[SPEAKER_12]: breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.

421
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:20,886
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.

422
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:27,270
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.

423
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:33,794
[SPEAKER_12]: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this.

424
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:34,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

425
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:36,956
[SPEAKER_12]: So, we'll give you that report.

426
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,015
[SPEAKER_05]: motion.

427
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:42,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to have that report presented to the school committee.

428
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:42,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

429
00:28:43,157 --> 00:28:43,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

430
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:44,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

431
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:45,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Vandevoort.

432
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:50,381
[SPEAKER_17]: I noticed that the Tufts Alternative School has a very low participation.

433
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:50,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

434
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:57,685
[SPEAKER_17]: And this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.

435
00:28:57,705 --> 00:28:59,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any insight into that number?

436
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was really surprised by that also.

437
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:08,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So we contacted Mr. Toomey over there and he said that because they're allowed to come in so much later

438
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,332
[SPEAKER_13]: that most of them just eat before they come in.

439
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:15,695
[SPEAKER_13]: And they can ask for breakfast, but they don't.

440
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:24,180
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do think that that's definitely an area of opportunity, especially if you could offer a breakfast that might be an incentive for students to come in.

441
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:26,142
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, get them there a little earlier.

442
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:26,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

443
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:32,766
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools, we see an increase between September and October.

444
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:35,708
[SPEAKER_17]: There was only one school where there was a slight decline.

445
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:46,589
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to make sure that we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to kids going in for breakfast.

446
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:50,253
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I think the classroom environment really is ideal.

447
00:29:52,023 --> 00:30:05,250
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, sort of if it works at the Columbus, you know, maybe if we could talk with some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.

448
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:05,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

449
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:17,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I know for the past two years in a row, the Eos Foundation has awarded the Columbus a Healthy Start award, and they give those to schools that see breakfast participation rates.

450
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,513
[SPEAKER_13]: at 80% and higher for so many consecutive months over the course of a year.

451
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,615
[SPEAKER_13]: So their average is over 80% year long.

452
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:28,237
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.

453
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:28,957
OK.

454
00:30:29,738 --> 00:30:38,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Mr. Benedetto, and also I ask that the superintendent reach out to the various principals to determine if they could do after the bell breakfast.

455
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:40,084
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all those in favor?

456
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:40,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

457
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,565
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

458
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:42,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

459
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:43,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Ms.

460
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:44,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Smith.

461
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:52,624
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.

462
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:54,806
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion for suspension of the rules.

463
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:55,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

464
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Ms.

465
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:56,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno.

466
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:57,829
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

467
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

468
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,451
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

469
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:00,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

470
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:04,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Burke, we'll report on student survey before our nutritionist leaves.

471
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:15,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I, I saw on, um, some social media that, um, the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that, that, that they just look into that.

472
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw on some social media about it at the McGlen and, and definitely at the Columbus.

473
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:25,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw some, uh, posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.

474
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:26,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes.

475
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:33,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, we are aware of that and I guess what I can say in response to that is we handled the milks appropriately.

476
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:42,429
[SPEAKER_13]: We use a first in, first out rotation system, so the oldest milks, you know, are the first ones that are in the coolers and leaving.

477
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:43,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn the cooler up?

478
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:44,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Make them colder?

479
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:55,716
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, all of the refrigerators are keeping at temp, so I think this might potentially be a supplier issue, so we'll have to... Be a monitoring.

480
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:56,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

481
00:31:57,117 --> 00:32:02,360
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I can say is from our handling of everything, we're doing everything that we

482
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:09,556
[SPEAKER_13]: can to ensure that the milks are at a safe temperature, and they are within the best by date.

483
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:11,097
[SPEAKER_13]: So they should be good.

484
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:15,760
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have to figure out why they're not.

485
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to?

486
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,983
[SPEAKER_09]: School committee elect, would you like to step up to the mic, please?

487
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:20,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

488
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:23,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I just had a question about, thank you.

489
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:23,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Through the chair.

490
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:36,427
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day?

491
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:41,731
[SPEAKER_16]: How do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row?

492
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:45,974
[SPEAKER_16]: And is it actually kept cold while it's sitting in the class for an hour or two?

493
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:47,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

494
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:49,717
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is for the breakfast in the classroom?

495
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:49,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

496
00:32:50,237 --> 00:32:54,160
[SPEAKER_13]: So the breakfast items are transported in coolers.

497
00:32:54,901 --> 00:33:04,770
[SPEAKER_13]: And they leave that morning and go, and I don't know what the exact time frame is, but they're kept in coolers, and so they are used probably I would say within an hour.

498
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:07,993
[SPEAKER_13]: And any of the milks that come back are discarded.

499
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:12,298
[SPEAKER_13]: So that should not be contributing to the issue.

500
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:14,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

501
00:33:16,684 --> 00:33:22,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, item four, based on suspension of the rules, report on student survey on substance abuse.

502
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:23,969
[SPEAKER_09]: We have with us Ms.

503
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:29,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Penny Funny-Elite from Medford City Hall Team Medford to do a presentation.

504
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you need us to move at all?

505
00:33:32,215 --> 00:33:32,795
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe.

506
00:33:33,216 --> 00:33:35,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me just turn on this projector and we shall see.

507
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:46,824
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going on.

508
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:47,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

509
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:48,348
[SPEAKER_20]: Light's coming on.

510
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:49,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's kicking in.

511
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so thank you for having me today.

512
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:18,822
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here to present the data, but I do not do my work alone, and Tony Bento and Rachel Perry are here to talk about the work that they do in the schools that really support youth substance use and prevention of youth substance use in the city.

513
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:24,627
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to say this is a report on a survey called the Community Care Survey.

514
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,869
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been doing this survey since 2005.

515
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:36,575
[SPEAKER_19]: It's done every two years, so we have a long amount of years to see trends that have changed throughout the time of the city.

516
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:46,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the things to note are that what it looks at is it looks at risk and protective factors, as well as frequency of reported use.

517
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:56,020
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is, the youth take this survey, it's an anonymous survey, it comes back to us, we send it to, excuse me, it goes from the school directly to the school.

518
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,160
[SPEAKER_19]: the researcher who cleans the data.

519
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:08,183
[SPEAKER_19]: By cleaning the data, what I mean is that they eliminate any surveys that exaggerate drug use or any other antisocial behavior.

520
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:14,624
[SPEAKER_19]: They eliminate surveys where students report a fictitious drug that's on there.

521
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:19,786
[SPEAKER_19]: And then anything that's logically inconsistent patterns of drug use, they will eliminate those surveys.

522
00:35:20,126 --> 00:35:25,127
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's say they had 100 that were not valid, they will eliminate them.

523
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:28,128
[SPEAKER_19]: That will not be included in the total count for the survey itself.

524
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:44,437
[SPEAKER_19]: But what it's doing is it's looking at—we don't ask questions about sexuality, but what risk and protective factors do is that really show what drives young people to do things that are risky for them.

525
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:48,380
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why we're looking at this larger picture snapshot.

526
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:54,104
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of communities use a youth risk behavior survey, and it really looks at the frequency.

527
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,207
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't look at some of the community conditions.

528
00:35:57,627 --> 00:36:00,209
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a large report.

529
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:01,671
[SPEAKER_19]: We've broken it up for you.

530
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight we're going to talk just about substance abuse.

531
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:15,242
[SPEAKER_19]: rates, and then I will come back, if I'm correct, Superintendent Belson, we discussed that I would come back, talk about risk and protective factors, and then come back again and talk about more data that we saw in the survey.

532
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:26,171
[SPEAKER_19]: What I'm doing here by showing you this presentation is that I think that we need to remember that this is not a school problem.

533
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:32,435
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a societal, family, peer-level, individual-level issue.

534
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:40,459
[SPEAKER_19]: And to solve anything that we want to see change on these numbers, we really need to be working as a whole, as a team, to be able to do this.

535
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:50,127
[SPEAKER_19]: The school over the years, I've been here since 2008, I began in September 2008 doing this work, and the schools have had tremendous involvement.

536
00:36:50,387 --> 00:36:54,991
[SPEAKER_19]: The police department has had tremendous involvement in the work that we've done through the Board of Health.

537
00:36:56,493 --> 00:37:00,997
[SPEAKER_19]: And we put out many, many, many instances of putting information out to parents.

538
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:04,899
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have not had public forums where parents come out in droves.

539
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:10,621
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's not, um, that, that, we wish they could get the information that we're putting out there.

540
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:14,923
[SPEAKER_19]: So, one of our urges here tonight is to say to parents, please pay attention.

541
00:37:14,963 --> 00:37:18,485
[SPEAKER_19]: We are doing prevention education for you.

542
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:20,326
[SPEAKER_19]: We have resources for you.

543
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:25,468
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to be thinking about substance use prevention long before someone uses substances.

544
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:38,970
[SPEAKER_19]: We're fortunate now in the city of Medford at the Board of Health to have an outreach worker or recovery coach who will, you know, between the two of us, we sit and come up with a plan and work with individuals at the police department.

545
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:54,373
[SPEAKER_19]: We do an early intervention program where if youth are found drinking or using drugs, we will bring them in for a three-hour education course, give them a screening to see if they themselves have any issues, and then we will speak directly to their families about getting them help.

546
00:37:54,753 --> 00:38:01,821
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we're really pushing that, you know, this is about getting help and getting this solved before it becomes a chronic issue for you and your family.

547
00:38:02,502 --> 00:38:05,625
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have these resources available.

548
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:08,889
[SPEAKER_19]: We are begging you to come out to our presentations.

549
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,991
[SPEAKER_19]: access this information online.

550
00:38:13,152 --> 00:38:19,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Many programs for parents are going to be going up on the Mystic Valley Public Health website coming up soon.

551
00:38:20,016 --> 00:38:25,418
[SPEAKER_19]: That will be linked to the City of Medford's website and hopefully to the school's website and to the police's website.

552
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:35,144
[SPEAKER_19]: But today, if you have an issue, and this is a televised so I'm talking to the public, please go to drugfree.org and look for information there.

553
00:38:35,284 --> 00:38:37,305
[SPEAKER_19]: They can steer you in the right direction.

554
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:43,447
[SPEAKER_19]: So the survey itself, we're looking at three different measures of use rates.

555
00:38:43,547 --> 00:38:45,708
[SPEAKER_19]: We have lifetime use, so have you ever tried a substance?

556
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:59,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Experimentation is something that happens, but use where it becomes a problem or can lead to a problem, we're looking at that at the 30-day prevalence use rate, so whether or not a student has used a substance within the last month, the last 30 days.

557
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,973
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what we measure as current use.

558
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:09,723
[SPEAKER_19]: And historically, we've always done this survey prior to the February vacation.

559
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:16,006
[SPEAKER_19]: And this year, I believe in last year as well, the way that the schedule worked out, the survey was done after that time.

560
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:21,009
[SPEAKER_19]: So that might be something to think about, but I don't see that reflected in the data at this point.

561
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:28,114
[SPEAKER_19]: Binge drinking behavior is reported if five or more drinks in one sitting in the last two weeks.

562
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,516
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what we are measuring binge drinking behavior.

563
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:37,337
[SPEAKER_19]: So the purpose of prevention is to delay use.

564
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:41,278
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to drive those youth numbers back.

565
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:49,139
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to do our best to get the people who need help, help, and to reduce the amount of people that are trying, experimenting, and using frequently.

566
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:55,921
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I have here to show you is I have multiple charts that will show you what's happened over time.

567
00:39:56,301 --> 00:39:58,321
[SPEAKER_19]: But this one here, I think, is really important.

568
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:06,291
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you look at the youth substance use as a bell curve, you're going to have 5% to 10% of the students, they're never going to use substances.

569
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:13,421
[SPEAKER_19]: They may have family history that causes them, they may have, you know, some school commitments or some religious commitments that prevent them from using.

570
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:15,324
[SPEAKER_19]: And on the other end, you might have 5% to 10%

571
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:28,831
[SPEAKER_19]: percent of students who were going to use no matter what prevention measures were put into place because they have family history, they have trauma, they have other leading factors that could drive them towards something of that nature.

572
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:40,077
[SPEAKER_19]: So what our goal is is really to drive the numbers back from, you know, we want as many people getting help and more towards that 5 to 10 percent of use as opposed to never using.

573
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,779
[SPEAKER_19]: So in 2005, you can see here 71 percent of high school students

574
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:51,968
[SPEAKER_19]: 71.2 percent of high school students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime, ninth through twelfth graders.

575
00:40:51,988 --> 00:40:53,970
[SPEAKER_19]: This is both the high school and the vocational school.

576
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:57,494
[SPEAKER_19]: In all of this case, those two schools are combined with the data.

577
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:04,901
[SPEAKER_19]: In 2017, 45.8% of the students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime.

578
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:09,506
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a significant change in the rates.

579
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:14,130
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is as a result of the teamwork that I talked about when I first started speaking.

580
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,234
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we're doing is working, and we need to continue doing it.

581
00:41:18,634 --> 00:41:22,358
[SPEAKER_19]: And we need to continue to bring in more people into the fold and have this conversation.

582
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:38,631
[SPEAKER_19]: This is 6th grade, and again, when we report out the data, I have both in your packet, lifetime and 30-day use, but current trends are really where you would see that there's sort of an issue that we would want to be addressing in the community.

583
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:41,793
[SPEAKER_19]: That is where we would put more of our weight in the data.

584
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:49,457
[SPEAKER_19]: So 6th to 8th grade, as you can see, over time, we've really brought these numbers down.

585
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and you can, and these numbers are extremely low.

586
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:59,565
[SPEAKER_19]: What you're looking at is, um, and all of you have, should have a chart provided with the actual percentages.

587
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:02,928
[SPEAKER_19]: I like to do that because it's hard to read charts sometimes.

588
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:05,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, it would be on page, uh,

589
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,262
[SPEAKER_19]: So for middle school students, you know, 30-day use is 3.4%.

590
00:42:09,382 --> 00:42:11,823
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a lot lower than the national average.

591
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:12,184
[SPEAKER_19]: For U.S.

592
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:13,945
[SPEAKER_19]: norm, for 8th grade, it was 7.3%.

593
00:42:14,005 --> 00:42:15,906
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can tell you that our 8th graders were reporting

594
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:42,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Our eighth grade is reporting 7.9 percent, so we do want to be paying attention to that.

595
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:44,348
[SPEAKER_19]: It's close to the national average.

596
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:48,489
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a low number, thank goodness, but we should be talking about this.

597
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:51,850
[SPEAKER_19]: This is why I'm saying we need to talk early and often.

598
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,411
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to be prepared and we need to be ready to respond.

599
00:42:56,131 --> 00:42:57,732
[SPEAKER_19]: to have those conversations.

600
00:42:57,752 --> 00:43:09,421
[SPEAKER_19]: We all should be talking to our friends' parents so they know what our personal preferences are and plans when they go to their houses, when they go to parties, they go out to, you know, football games or whatever it is, that everyone's well aware.

601
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:12,103
[SPEAKER_19]: So, we do see the numbers declining.

602
00:43:12,143 --> 00:43:13,764
[SPEAKER_19]: We always want to be monitoring the numbers.

603
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:23,491
[SPEAKER_19]: In the high school, sorry, at the 9th through 12th grade level, we see the decline as well over time, and we're very pleased to see that.

604
00:43:26,366 --> 00:43:30,150
[SPEAKER_19]: One thing that we're monitoring this year that we've never monitored before is vaping.

605
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,754
[SPEAKER_19]: So we don't have numbers to compare to the previous years.

606
00:43:35,515 --> 00:43:40,600
[SPEAKER_19]: But what we can tell you is on page four,

607
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:52,138
[SPEAKER_19]: What we know right now is that this is what the students reported in February of 2017.

608
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:58,941
[SPEAKER_19]: Also remember, all 12th grade data, those students do not go to these school systems any longer.

609
00:43:58,981 --> 00:43:59,661
[SPEAKER_19]: They have moved on.

610
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:02,042
[SPEAKER_19]: So that is something to be thinking about.

611
00:44:04,531 --> 00:44:08,355
[SPEAKER_19]: We believe that this number is going up exponentially as we speak.

612
00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:15,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Based on conversations amongst students and staff, there's a lot more concern for vaping.

613
00:44:15,782 --> 00:44:18,124
[SPEAKER_19]: And we need to be thinking about it overall.

614
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:20,066
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is what vaping is.

615
00:44:20,847 --> 00:44:26,272
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the most popular vaping product that we're hearing about all over the state, really.

616
00:44:26,312 --> 00:44:27,072
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called Juul.

617
00:44:27,713 --> 00:44:28,854
[SPEAKER_19]: And it looks like a USB.

618
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,939
[SPEAKER_19]: You can actually charge it by using it as a USB in your computer or wherever.

619
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,883
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of those is equivalent to one pack of cigarettes.

620
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:43,466
[SPEAKER_19]: The most popular product is a mango flavor.

621
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:49,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Call me crazy, but I think they're marketing to a very specific population.

622
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:58,002
[SPEAKER_19]: They have a very catchy name, and very catchy products, and anything flavored is gonna be really attractive to young people, right?

623
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:07,244
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, the thing is about this, the other day we were talking about it, and I said, oh, don't worry, this is a patented product, you really, you know, they're not gonna be making marijuana products with this, right?

624
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:07,864
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not true.

625
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:12,505
[SPEAKER_19]: You can actually inject marijuana oil into this product once the,

626
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:19,729
[SPEAKER_19]: stuff is out, so you can get any, go on YouTube and you can learn anything you want to learn about how to hack this.

627
00:45:20,169 --> 00:45:27,214
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's discreet, so you could, somebody could be vaping in here right now and you may not notice.

628
00:45:27,994 --> 00:45:29,735
[SPEAKER_19]: It can be very discreet in that way.

629
00:45:30,515 --> 00:45:33,777
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's something that we really need to be paying attention to.

630
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:34,778
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very covert.

631
00:45:35,578 --> 00:45:36,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you have something you want to say?

632
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:42,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB.

633
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:49,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And they also can even exhale right into their hoodies, and you don't even see anything.

634
00:45:49,552 --> 00:45:52,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So kids in class are actually, they call it dueling.

635
00:45:56,433 --> 00:46:05,859
[SPEAKER_19]: So the reality is that there's a lot of information and misinformation out there about vaping.

636
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:11,603
[SPEAKER_19]: The main thing that you need to take away from this is that it contains nicotine and nicotine is one of the most

637
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,884
[SPEAKER_19]: highly addicted drugs in the entire world, right?

638
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:22,308
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, you know, there may be speculation that, you know, the, their vape, you know, that they're gonna get hooked on vaping and then they're gonna get hooked on cigarettes.

639
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:27,550
[SPEAKER_19]: I argue that they're probably gonna be hooked on vaping for a very long time is really what the issue's gonna be.

640
00:46:28,131 --> 00:46:32,913
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and we don't know because there isn't long-term data to show what the effect of this will be.

641
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:38,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Just like with cigarettes, we didn't know what cigarettes were gonna do to us, and now look at what we're, where we're at.

642
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:38,856
[SPEAKER_19]: So,

643
00:46:39,936 --> 00:46:41,516
[SPEAKER_19]: So, we need to be cautious about that.

644
00:46:41,856 --> 00:46:47,398
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I want to show you this because this is a product that is also a vaping product.

645
00:46:47,758 --> 00:46:51,359
[SPEAKER_19]: They sell these inserts at dispensaries.

646
00:46:51,579 --> 00:47:02,001
[SPEAKER_19]: So, if you see something like this, looks like an old-timey cigarette holder, that can also be filled with a THC oil of some kind or some sort of marijuana derivative product.

647
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:12,204
[SPEAKER_19]: So marijuana has become legalized in Massachusetts, and it's still dangerous for kids to use marijuana.

648
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:19,767
[SPEAKER_19]: It can create long-term changes in the way that their brain responds to addictions.

649
00:47:19,948 --> 00:47:22,028
[SPEAKER_19]: It can do a number of different things.

650
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:28,231
[SPEAKER_19]: What I want to show you in this slide is a very, very busy slide, but I put everything in one slide so that I didn't forget about a single thing.

651
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:37,939
[SPEAKER_19]: Perception of harm, so great risk of harm, this is how our students said on the survey, that if you tried marijuana, you would be at great risk of harm.

652
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:43,404
[SPEAKER_19]: There were other things, moderate risk, no risk, but this is specifically looking at the term great risk of harm.

653
00:47:43,824 --> 00:47:49,129
[SPEAKER_19]: So the good news is, is that there are a number of people who do think that you'd be at great risk of harm if you tried marijuana just once.

654
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:58,024
[SPEAKER_19]: In some cases, oddly, that smoking it regularly is somehow OK.

655
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:10,008
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, great risk harm is a measure that if you look at, this is what the data shows nationally, that if you believe it's harmful, you will use it less.

656
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:18,010
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we want to do is make sure that people are well informed of what these drugs and alcohol and everything can do to you.

657
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,391
[SPEAKER_19]: But I feel like these numbers are pretty low.

658
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:25,992
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that this is going to be an ongoing problem for a long time, and I'm going to tell you why.

659
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:31,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it's very difficult to convey honest facts to young people about marijuana.

660
00:48:32,695 --> 00:48:39,497
[SPEAKER_19]: And we as a community really need to hunker down and think about how to present this information.

661
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:41,138
[SPEAKER_19]: If we provide false facts,

662
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:45,739
[SPEAKER_19]: of scare tactics to young people, it will not change that number.

663
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:56,202
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll probably make other things worse, because then they'll know for a fact that you were lying to them about marijuana, maybe you're lying about cocaine, maybe you're lying about heroin or other opioids, right?

664
00:48:56,262 --> 00:49:01,824
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we want to do is figure out what is our game plan and to really work on that.

665
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:08,386
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that there is some education in the curriculum, but I think that we can be doing more, and we need to be thinking about this.

666
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:17,044
[SPEAKER_19]: a little bit more, I think that we as a state should have been thinking about this a little bit more all along the way and be prepared because this was going to happen.

667
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:32,377
[SPEAKER_19]: So the other thing to be very aware of, which is startling to me even, even though I've seen it all, no I haven't really seen it all, is that driving with someone under the influence of marijuana is pretty high in high school students.

668
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:43,039
[SPEAKER_19]: So we know one thing for sure, that Mothers Against Drunk Driving did a hell of a job of changing drinking and driving rates amongst young people.

669
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:46,522
[SPEAKER_19]: But we also need to be thinking about this with marijuana as well.

670
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:53,449
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks to me like almost 30% of high school seniors last year had driven in a car with someone under the influence of marijuana.

671
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,063
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, and I think that classically, people who smoke marijuana will go for a joy ride, right?

672
00:49:59,103 --> 00:49:59,804
[SPEAKER_19]: They hop in their car.

673
00:49:59,824 --> 00:50:10,191
[SPEAKER_19]: It's sort of a part of the culture is, you know, getting in your car and getting isolated, getting away from, you know, wherever, especially when you're a teenager because you don't have the freedom to smoke weed in your house or marijuana in your house.

674
00:50:10,231 --> 00:50:12,893
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, we need to be paying attention to that.

675
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:15,294
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to be paying very close attention to that, I think.

676
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:19,157
[SPEAKER_19]: All in all, if you were to, um,

677
00:50:21,004 --> 00:50:27,550
[SPEAKER_19]: take a look at these marijuana rates, we are low in use rates.

678
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,172
[SPEAKER_19]: We're lower than most of the country.

679
00:50:30,252 --> 00:50:36,397
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that, you know, it's really interesting.

680
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,840
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me just go back real quick.

681
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:39,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Especially with high school.

682
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:45,057
[SPEAKER_19]: So marijuana is the gray line.

683
00:50:45,477 --> 00:50:49,959
[SPEAKER_19]: The third line down here, starting on the left, and then it goes up.

684
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:53,900
[SPEAKER_19]: 2009, 2013, which makes perfect sense because it's decriminalization.

685
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Medical marijuana becomes legal, right?

686
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,921
[SPEAKER_19]: So the perception of harm has definitely changed at that point.

687
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:03,882
[SPEAKER_19]: But for some reason, from 2013 into 2017, we're still seeing a decline.

688
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,564
[SPEAKER_19]: in that use, in that regular use of marijuana.

689
00:51:09,004 --> 00:51:18,428
[SPEAKER_19]: But what typically happens with marijuana use rates is there may be less people who start using marijuana, but the people who use marijuana use it far more chronically.

690
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:20,469
[SPEAKER_19]: So they may use it more.

691
00:51:20,609 --> 00:51:22,690
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's something to also be thinking about.

692
00:51:27,403 --> 00:51:34,906
[SPEAKER_19]: And then finally, we get to the end of the presentation here, where we're doing a lot of things as a community.

693
00:51:35,046 --> 00:51:37,287
[SPEAKER_19]: I mentioned the youth diversion program.

694
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:45,750
[SPEAKER_19]: I mentioned all the work that we've done over the years working with the school and the police, working on research, finding evidence-based practices.

695
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,711
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what the city has done.

696
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:51,492
[SPEAKER_19]: But we also have a grant called Partnerships for Success.

697
00:51:51,972 --> 00:51:55,214
[SPEAKER_19]: That's specifically focusing on prescription drug prevention.

698
00:51:56,135 --> 00:51:57,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Our numbers are very low.

699
00:51:57,976 --> 00:52:13,705
[SPEAKER_19]: If you go back to your charts and you look at 30-day use rates, and even, well, I would say look at your lifetime rates of prescription drugs, you'll see that in 2005, for high school students,

700
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:23,480
[SPEAKER_19]: We had 11.4% of students reporting that they used prescription drugs without a doctor's prescription.

701
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:28,313
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're looking at now, of all students ever having tried, 3.8%.

702
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:38,642
[SPEAKER_19]: So regardless of the situation that's happening in our community with overdoses, we're seeing youth rates decline with opioid use.

703
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:48,250
[SPEAKER_19]: I still see, you know, numbers declining with tranquilizers and then also stimulants are sort of leveled off from the previous year.

704
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:55,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, our urge with our grant is to really say we need to be paying attention to all of these prescription drugs.

705
00:52:55,775 --> 00:53:00,738
[SPEAKER_19]: They all, um, cause, you know, can create an effect and cause a problem.

706
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:03,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, opioids are clearly our biggest concern.

707
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,443
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all over the news, and that's a good thing because people are talking about it to their kids.

708
00:53:09,944 --> 00:53:11,946
[SPEAKER_19]: what's going on with other family members maybe.

709
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:14,067
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, my aunt lives in Indiana.

710
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:18,271
[SPEAKER_19]: She had crazy surgery and they were all over her prescription pain meds.

711
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:22,594
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was very pleased to hear that, not just in Massachusetts but other parts of the country.

712
00:53:22,994 --> 00:53:25,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Doctors are paying attention to those pain medications.

713
00:53:25,756 --> 00:53:30,180
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but one thing is I went to Tufts last week and I did a training on, um,

714
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:37,746
[SPEAKER_19]: how to use naloxone with Armstrong Ambulance, and I stated that cocaine is being cut with fentanyl on the street.

715
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:39,528
[SPEAKER_19]: And I had a kid look up at me like, oh.

716
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:42,731
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have—and I'm not saying that kid uses cocaine.

717
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:50,078
[SPEAKER_19]: My point, though, being that people are unaware of this, and it's very important to know that we have to pay attention to all drug use.

718
00:53:50,218 --> 00:53:53,621
[SPEAKER_19]: It should not be about this drug is bad, this one isn't as bad.

719
00:53:54,161 --> 00:53:56,744
[SPEAKER_19]: All drugs are bad because—and alcohol, too.

720
00:53:57,444 --> 00:54:02,088
[SPEAKER_19]: because it creates addiction and pathways to addiction then lead to further addiction problems.

721
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:05,231
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is something that we just want to be aware of.

722
00:54:06,012 --> 00:54:11,176
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyhow, the Partnerships for Success grant, we have multiple projects that we're working with the school on.

723
00:54:11,677 --> 00:54:22,046
[SPEAKER_19]: One thing is a health and safety guide went out to all families from, I believe, 8th grade to 11th grade at the end of last year.

724
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:33,734
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was a 24-page guide, multiple, multiple things to think about, where to dispose of drugs, what is vaping, you know, understanding stress in your students, prescription drugs.

725
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:39,539
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a very well-organized litany of resources as well as information.

726
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:43,782
[SPEAKER_19]: That's one way that we're trying to get information out to parents is direct mailing.

727
00:54:44,742 --> 00:54:50,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Another thing that we're doing that I think is really important is that we've helped through working with Rachel.

728
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:57,327
[SPEAKER_19]: We've implemented a module on prescription drugs into the 10th grade curriculum for the Michigan model.

729
00:54:58,188 --> 00:55:04,270
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have a risk to resiliency professional development series where we're talking about trauma-informed care.

730
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:06,891
[SPEAKER_19]: We're talking about absenteeism.

731
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:12,754
[SPEAKER_19]: And really what we're trying to communicate is that we want to build these kids up.

732
00:55:13,234 --> 00:55:13,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Right?

733
00:55:14,094 --> 00:55:19,137
[SPEAKER_19]: If we just say that you're going to do drugs, you're going to do drugs, they might do drugs if you've told them that's who they are.

734
00:55:19,597 --> 00:55:28,761
[SPEAKER_19]: We're trying to really do the opposite of that and try to identify those sparks, those things that make individuals who they are and things that they can find sense of purpose.

735
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:33,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Not our sense of purpose on these kids, but what is their sense of purpose so that they can have that.

736
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:40,489
[SPEAKER_19]: driven internal guiding thing that keeps them in that 5% to 10% away from substances.

737
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,012
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're working with faculty to get them that information.

738
00:55:44,313 --> 00:55:53,260
[SPEAKER_19]: So through the lens of asset building, the lens of looking at kids as though they have positive things to bring to this world, but understanding those risk factors.

739
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,125
[SPEAKER_19]: And then finally, we're working with two identified faculty members.

740
00:55:58,225 --> 00:56:00,407
[SPEAKER_19]: One's a coach, and one's also one's

741
00:56:02,188 --> 00:56:03,508
[SPEAKER_19]: after school club advisor.

742
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:07,890
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're working with them to do training to all of the school clubs and advisors.

743
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:11,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Because in the city of Medford, that's where kids go after school in the high school.

744
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:12,171
[SPEAKER_19]: They go to the clubs.

745
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:13,031
[SPEAKER_19]: They go to sports.

746
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:17,753
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're doing a integrated training with them around developmental relationships.

747
00:56:18,093 --> 00:56:21,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Just what I was saying, how do you identify those sparks in that kid?

748
00:56:21,394 --> 00:56:24,175
[SPEAKER_19]: You have these high, high achievers who are overstressed out.

749
00:56:24,475 --> 00:56:28,056
[SPEAKER_19]: And you have people who don't participate because the high, high achievers might be taken over.

750
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:31,117
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're trying to talk about how do you balance that, how you facilitate your clubs.

751
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:34,958
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you operate as a club advisor as opposed to a teacher in a classroom?

752
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:43,442
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are our main programs that we're doing at the city, and then I'm going to step back and let Rachel and Tony talk about the projects that they've done in the school.

753
00:56:44,682 --> 00:56:46,203
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I'll answer questions.

754
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:47,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Penny.

755
00:56:47,323 --> 00:56:47,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

756
00:56:49,524 --> 00:56:49,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

757
00:56:50,685 --> 00:56:52,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to talk a little bit about vaping.

758
00:56:53,346 --> 00:56:58,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Penny had talked about our numbers going down, but we have noticed we're seeing more and more of it here at the high school.

759
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:00,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have addressed it.

760
00:57:01,254 --> 00:57:18,270
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing we have done is on November 21, there was a meeting, a staff meeting that Nick Tucci actually presented information on vaping to our teachers, to our staff, presented what to look for, what the dangers are, and what they can do if they see a student actually vaping in class, what the steps are from there.

761
00:57:19,111 --> 00:57:23,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony has actually done some information out on our blog, out to parents.

762
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:26,079
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was out, I believe, was that October?

763
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:26,360
[SPEAKER_03]: October.

764
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,180
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in October.

765
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:32,024
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're working on right now is another message that goes out to all parents.

766
00:57:32,084 --> 00:57:33,665
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be going out in December.

767
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:41,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Dempsey and Lisa Dunphy are also working on a video that students will be making.

768
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:45,102
[SPEAKER_03]: and that will actually be presented as a homeroom activity in January.

769
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:47,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will go out to all the students at the high school.

770
00:57:48,663 --> 00:57:58,607
[SPEAKER_03]: We have set up a presentation for February 8th for all parents, where it will be a vaping presentation along with In Plain Sight, which will be here again at the high school.

771
00:57:58,627 --> 00:58:04,189
[SPEAKER_03]: We had that at City Hall last year, but we thought it would be something that in light of everything that we could bring back.

772
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:13,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of our Michigan model curriculum, we've added vaping to any lesson that included tobacco.

773
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:17,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is in the second year at the high school and the first year at the middle schools.

774
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:26,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I did reach out to the principals at the middle schools and they really haven't seen much going on with vaping there, but we have seen the uptick here at the high school.

775
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:28,296
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what to look for in the middle schools?

776
00:58:28,656 --> 00:58:29,617
[SPEAKER_03]: The teachers and?

777
00:58:29,857 --> 00:58:31,878
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that we can actually present.

778
00:58:31,938 --> 00:58:33,859
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the next step to bring it down to the middle school.

779
00:58:34,943 --> 00:58:35,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

780
00:58:36,765 --> 00:58:37,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

781
00:58:37,565 --> 00:58:46,173
[SPEAKER_18]: I think some of the health services department activities we've talked about in the past, first being the SBIRT screening that we do in grade 9.

782
00:58:46,754 --> 00:58:48,775
[SPEAKER_18]: This year we're extending that to grade 7.

783
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:58,764
[SPEAKER_18]: We're in the process of finishing all the training for the middle school staff so that we can start that after the turn of the year.

784
00:58:59,165 --> 00:59:01,447
[SPEAKER_18]: And our high school screening will start in January.

785
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:08,805
[SPEAKER_18]: The other project the School Health Advisory Council has been involved in is we're reaching out to the community physicians.

786
00:59:09,665 --> 00:59:21,996
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've met with the chief of pediatrics at Winchester Hospital, and we're looking to get onto the agenda for one of their Grand Rounds meetings, and we're going to be discussing ways that

787
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:36,211
[SPEAKER_18]: We as school support staff can work and collaborate with the community physicians so we have better communication and we're, we each understand each other's models and we can be working on the same agendas.

788
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:40,232
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're very pleased to be reaching out into the community for that.

789
00:59:43,553 --> 00:59:46,033
[SPEAKER_18]: I think everything else has been mentioned.

790
00:59:46,873 --> 00:59:51,274
[SPEAKER_18]: But our real goal is to get out education to parents and to faculty.

791
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:53,586
[SPEAKER_18]: this year about all these changes.

792
00:59:54,847 --> 01:00:00,974
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.

793
01:00:01,034 --> 01:00:05,739
[SPEAKER_08]: The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.

794
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,361
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to say thank you for that.

795
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:13,227
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,

796
01:00:14,508 --> 01:00:18,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?

797
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:19,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it weekends?

798
01:00:19,732 --> 01:00:22,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?

799
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are they doing it?

800
01:00:24,695 --> 01:00:28,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing?

801
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:29,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing it because they're bored?

802
01:00:29,779 --> 01:00:31,600
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?

803
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:35,402
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, different questions like that.

804
01:00:35,462 --> 01:00:36,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything like that in the survey?

805
01:00:37,144 --> 01:00:43,468
[SPEAKER_19]: No, there's no questions like that, but there are questions about where they get their alcohol, or their, I believe it's just alcohol.

806
01:00:43,968 --> 01:00:50,954
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.

807
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,257
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.

808
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:56,458
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happening after school.

809
01:00:56,538 --> 01:01:00,901
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happening for our students that are busy.

810
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:04,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing it more when it's not their season?

811
01:01:04,504 --> 01:01:09,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season?

812
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:29,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.

813
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:41,274
[SPEAKER_08]: For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, OK, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.

814
01:01:41,374 --> 01:01:44,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it around final exams?

815
01:01:44,536 --> 01:01:45,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it around MCAS?

816
01:01:46,156 --> 01:01:47,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it around the parks?

817
01:01:47,777 --> 01:01:50,818
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many variables, and I think that

818
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,716
[SPEAKER_08]: You have done this survey now for the last few years.

819
01:01:54,736 --> 01:02:00,278
[SPEAKER_08]: As a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expanded.

820
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:08,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students and why they're doing it.

821
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:12,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.

822
01:02:13,607 --> 01:02:26,040
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.

823
01:02:27,362 --> 01:02:30,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.

824
01:02:31,787 --> 01:02:33,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Have we found those numbers to go up?

825
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:36,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Those numbers are very low, actually.

826
01:02:36,973 --> 01:02:45,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Our police officer, we've been doing this project since 2012, and it's been rolled out for about three years now.

827
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:48,908
[SPEAKER_19]: The numbers are very low.

828
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:53,430
[SPEAKER_19]: We just are not seeing very many kids in the park.

829
01:02:53,931 --> 01:02:57,993
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not a patrol officer, but the patrol officers are not seeing people out in the park very often.

830
01:02:58,433 --> 01:03:08,039
[SPEAKER_19]: We've sent out youth cars specifically for that on high incident times, and they're just not having as many of those calls coming in as they did in the years past.

831
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:14,323
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that it's very interesting.

832
01:03:14,383 --> 01:03:16,865
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I would say to you is this about those questions.

833
01:03:16,885 --> 01:03:18,225
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to answer that.

834
01:03:18,686 --> 01:03:21,628
[SPEAKER_19]: This survey is a national survey.

835
01:03:22,248 --> 01:03:28,312
[SPEAKER_19]: And the questions that are on there are vetted through research.

836
01:03:28,752 --> 01:03:40,503
[SPEAKER_19]: So to add more questions on, this is already 200 questions for the students to sit and get through, which is far more extensive than the YRBS that others ask.

837
01:03:40,523 --> 01:03:42,104
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're already asking a lot from these kids.

838
01:03:42,464 --> 01:03:46,988
[SPEAKER_19]: But the other thing is that we can get some of that information just through a different method.

839
01:03:47,008 --> 01:03:50,171
[SPEAKER_19]: We could use focus groups, key informant interviews.

840
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:54,135
[SPEAKER_19]: We would just need to find a way to get a third party to come in

841
01:03:54,551 --> 01:03:56,733
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, and to do that and to set those up.

842
01:03:56,793 --> 01:03:59,496
[SPEAKER_19]: So, for instance, I'm calling out to all the parents.

843
01:03:59,556 --> 01:04:15,113
[SPEAKER_19]: If parents know that, you know, they want to know this information and they're willing to sign a permission slip, we have already have the means to start asking questions like this and getting qualitative data for us to find more out about when and where and how this is happening in the city.

844
01:04:15,441 --> 01:04:16,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it's really important.

845
01:04:16,962 --> 01:04:21,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.

846
01:04:21,844 --> 01:04:26,306
[SPEAKER_08]: The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.

847
01:04:26,786 --> 01:04:33,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when

848
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:35,890
[SPEAKER_08]: and certain things are happening.

849
01:04:36,591 --> 01:04:43,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.

850
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:45,073
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.

851
01:04:45,453 --> 01:04:48,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.

852
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:49,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Nowadays, they don't.

853
01:04:50,114 --> 01:04:53,535
[SPEAKER_08]: But that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening.

854
01:04:54,195 --> 01:05:17,971
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement?

855
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:22,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, gee, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them here?

856
01:05:23,174 --> 01:05:30,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So just because they're not in a so-called park, I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open.

857
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:38,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I was saying if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on.

858
01:05:39,105 --> 01:05:44,390
[SPEAKER_08]: or anything like that, you know, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time.

859
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:47,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.

860
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:53,038
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.

861
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:53,759
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.

862
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:58,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,

863
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:12,129
[SPEAKER_08]: My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it.

864
01:06:12,149 --> 01:06:15,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.

865
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:16,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've seen it.

866
01:06:16,794 --> 01:06:18,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it this summer especially.

867
01:06:18,296 --> 01:06:20,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it, like, you know, people just,

868
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:28,185
[SPEAKER_08]: smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.

869
01:06:28,645 --> 01:06:33,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we were years ago saying, well, gee, do you know what secondhand smoking does?

870
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:38,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we have to explain to our kids, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.

871
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:43,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a very, very concerning situation.

872
01:06:43,198 --> 01:06:46,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say,

873
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:49,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.

874
01:06:49,903 --> 01:06:51,464
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not allowed to do that.

875
01:06:51,965 --> 01:07:01,072
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.

876
01:07:01,132 --> 01:07:02,053
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a big deal.

877
01:07:02,113 --> 01:07:06,836
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.

878
01:07:07,677 --> 01:07:09,959
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.

879
01:07:12,354 --> 01:07:22,762
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I mean, I have a very extensive conversation with one of the classes here a couple months ago about vaping, about marijuana.

880
01:07:22,982 --> 01:07:28,666
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, they were really practical.

881
01:07:29,607 --> 01:07:30,768
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to know where the research is.

882
01:07:31,963 --> 01:07:33,723
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to see the data.

883
01:07:33,863 --> 01:07:40,645
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a good thing in many ways, because these are well-educated young people who are researching information on their own.

884
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:44,846
[SPEAKER_19]: On the same hand, they want to see it.

885
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:46,046
[SPEAKER_19]: And then fortunately, it's not there.

886
01:07:46,106 --> 01:07:46,786
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not provided.

887
01:07:46,806 --> 01:07:50,147
[SPEAKER_19]: But I pushed them.

888
01:07:50,187 --> 01:07:54,047
[SPEAKER_19]: I pushed them far and hard to think about this in a broader context.

889
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:56,288
[SPEAKER_19]: And we had a really rich discussion.

890
01:07:57,008 --> 01:08:01,629
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that there's tons of opportunity for us to have youth-led.

891
01:08:02,373 --> 01:08:05,621
[SPEAKER_19]: initiatives that talk about vaping, that talk about marijuana use.

892
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:08,467
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that we can definitely be looking at that in the future.

893
01:08:08,487 --> 01:08:10,933
[SPEAKER_19]: These are really brilliant kids in the school.

894
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be very interested to start doing that.

895
01:08:15,332 --> 01:08:16,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Just two more questions real quick.

896
01:08:16,953 --> 01:08:19,034
[SPEAKER_08]: One is to both Tony and Rachel.

897
01:08:19,355 --> 01:08:25,639
[SPEAKER_08]: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping, to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.

898
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:29,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know?

899
01:08:29,261 --> 01:08:30,662
[SPEAKER_08]: What are their next steps?

900
01:08:30,722 --> 01:08:32,444
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're caught with it, what happens?

901
01:08:34,171 --> 01:08:38,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, the administration would follow the, the dis, discipline codes that are in the handbook.

902
01:08:38,434 --> 01:08:42,116
[SPEAKER_18]: So, it's similar to using, God bless you, tobacco products.

903
01:08:42,436 --> 01:08:46,199
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, they, they would follow those, those discipline codes.

904
01:08:47,529 --> 01:09:03,693
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?

905
01:09:04,413 --> 01:09:10,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out, because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's,

906
01:09:11,215 --> 01:09:27,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute discussion with the audience?

907
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:35,442
[SPEAKER_19]: So over the years, there's been a myriad of ways that I've been included in these types of events.

908
01:09:35,902 --> 01:09:37,983
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had opportunities to speak before.

909
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:44,335
[SPEAKER_19]: The parent-teacher night presentation begins at that table there.

910
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:55,025
[SPEAKER_19]: The best part about the City of Medford and the work that we've done here is that this community really takes on the work themselves.

911
01:09:55,546 --> 01:10:00,090
[SPEAKER_19]: And so when high-quality information is being put out, I don't need to be there.

912
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:03,431
[SPEAKER_19]: just to be a steward over it, it's being done.

913
01:10:03,831 --> 01:10:14,595
[SPEAKER_19]: So all the stuff that happens for when DA Ryan comes and talks about social host liability, that's a tremendous program and that's happening on a regular yearly basis.

914
01:10:14,615 --> 01:10:18,256
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are the kinds of things that we really, really shows how

915
01:10:19,156 --> 01:10:21,317
[SPEAKER_19]: much effort is being put in by the school system.

916
01:10:22,997 --> 01:10:27,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Last year, we had Dr. Ruth Pote come and do a presentation as a partnership.

917
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:35,980
[SPEAKER_19]: And there were 75 people there, but the majority were faculty and other people that work in school systems throughout the region.

918
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:44,822
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, the first time we ever had a presentation here, it was be a parent, not a pal, social host liability, just like the DAs.

919
01:10:45,182 --> 01:10:46,603
[SPEAKER_19]: There were three people that showed up.

920
01:10:48,223 --> 01:10:52,325
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was 2,400 mail outs that went out advertising this program.

921
01:10:52,626 --> 01:11:01,930
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's just like, it's nice to see when people do come and we get to talk to them and they see that, you know, we're not, but really what happens is when we do a community table.

922
01:11:03,832 --> 01:11:14,621
[SPEAKER_19]: This is very scary to people to talk about substance abuse when you're talking about, you know, a 7th grade kid or even a 7-year-old or even a high school kid who you've never seen have an issue with it.

923
01:11:15,722 --> 01:11:16,923
[SPEAKER_19]: They do not want to talk to it.

924
01:11:16,983 --> 01:11:21,467
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why we're called Team Medford, not the Substance Abuse People, because you just don't want to talk about it.

925
01:11:21,807 --> 01:11:30,550
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's very rare that you get a good showing out at your table at the community tabling events, but it is worth it.

926
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:33,891
[SPEAKER_19]: We do often have a really good conversation with at least one person.

927
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:38,733
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, I mean, we go to as many as we can, and we'll continue to do that.

928
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:44,135
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'd like to see where it's actually an institutionalized conversation.

929
01:11:44,531 --> 01:11:48,557
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just like, oh, the substance abuse people are coming and walking in and they're going to tell you some information.

930
01:11:48,897 --> 01:11:56,248
[SPEAKER_19]: It's nice when we're coming and we're asked to be experts, but it's really a part of the growth of an individual to be talking about this.

931
01:11:56,308 --> 01:11:58,631
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that it should be sort of embedded in everything.

932
01:12:00,173 --> 01:12:10,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.

933
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:15,369
[SPEAKER_08]: So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.

934
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:19,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that you've had it.

935
01:12:19,993 --> 01:12:37,871
[SPEAKER_08]: For people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee, they don't have to.

936
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:39,912
[SPEAKER_08]: necessarily call you directly.

937
01:12:39,932 --> 01:12:43,033
[SPEAKER_08]: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.

938
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:43,673
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

939
01:12:43,713 --> 01:12:44,633
[SPEAKER_19]: That's absolutely true.

940
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:50,795
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the biggest things for their buck in the college setting is how to help a friend.

941
01:12:51,536 --> 01:12:56,677
[SPEAKER_19]: And we worked with a student last year to put up posters that were about how to help a friend.

942
01:12:56,737 --> 01:13:01,479
[SPEAKER_19]: And so they're advertised to the kids about how do you get resources for your friends.

943
01:13:01,559 --> 01:13:02,079
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're up.

944
01:13:02,139 --> 01:13:03,460
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, do they see them?

945
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,943
[SPEAKER_19]: It's I mean, unless he's paid, you know, a million dollars to have a Snapchat story commercial.

946
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:11,584
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if anyone's ever going to see it.

947
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:12,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's be honest.

948
01:13:12,165 --> 01:13:12,645
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto.

949
01:13:12,685 --> 01:13:14,666
[SPEAKER_19]: So the vape, do we have a vaping policy on the books?

950
01:13:14,746 --> 01:13:16,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we using the tobacco policy?

951
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:30,681
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative.

952
01:13:30,701 --> 01:13:34,823
[SPEAKER_12]: But as we move forward, we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.

953
01:13:35,023 --> 01:13:41,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, with the growth I see throughout not just our community, but socially, in adults as well as

954
01:13:42,726 --> 01:13:57,083
[SPEAKER_05]: high school age students, I would like for this committee to start working on that so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping, as juuling, as the correct terminology so students are very clear how we as adults feel.

955
01:13:57,623 --> 01:14:02,387
[SPEAKER_05]: in this community about this, because students just do not believe.

956
01:14:02,767 --> 01:14:05,790
[SPEAKER_05]: They think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now.

957
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what you hear.

958
01:14:07,731 --> 01:14:14,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't realize when it gets in their lungs, it's like popcorn and it blows up their lungs and it does all these health implications.

959
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:19,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having

960
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:25,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Two people at my house who read this report before I got here, almost 27 and almost 25.

961
01:14:26,063 --> 01:14:33,271
[SPEAKER_05]: One's a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs.

962
01:14:33,751 --> 01:14:35,733
[SPEAKER_05]: They were happy to see our numbers.

963
01:14:36,474 --> 01:14:38,496
[SPEAKER_05]: that we're doing a great job in MedFed.

964
01:14:39,097 --> 01:14:48,025
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one so that way the wording is correct.

965
01:14:48,045 --> 01:14:51,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Because once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore.

966
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:57,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a motion on the floor, and I need a second from one of my colleagues.

967
01:14:58,892 --> 01:15:13,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see this in place and in every handbook at our junior high and high school level by next year so that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not going to continue.

968
01:15:14,619 --> 01:15:15,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

969
01:15:15,499 --> 01:15:15,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

970
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:16,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloot.

971
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:22,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Honey, last spring I was able to attend, and I don't remember the title of it, but the Night of Remembrance.

972
01:15:23,703 --> 01:15:29,167
[SPEAKER_17]: for those who had died of opiate-related deaths.

973
01:15:29,747 --> 01:15:35,050
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.

974
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:38,832
[SPEAKER_17]: They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.

975
01:15:40,033 --> 01:15:45,216
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things that they said was they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.

976
01:15:46,897 --> 01:15:48,839
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, were popular.

977
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:56,204
[SPEAKER_17]: They were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.

978
01:15:57,745 --> 01:16:03,389
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive

979
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:05,071
[SPEAKER_17]: foundation here.

980
01:16:05,491 --> 01:16:09,215
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm totally worried about that transition off topology.

981
01:16:09,575 --> 01:16:13,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not sure, you just mentioned some posters, how to help a friend.

982
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:21,245
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, we see these incredible stories of, you know, the Fratt brothers who, you know, are drinking too much and then let their Fratt brother die.

983
01:16:22,266 --> 01:16:24,888
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and that's where I'm wondering, our last

984
01:16:26,429 --> 01:16:28,170
[SPEAKER_17]: We're touching the kids at 10th grade.

985
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:35,933
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect, you know.

986
01:16:36,293 --> 01:16:40,515
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness, too.

987
01:16:41,115 --> 01:16:46,297
[SPEAKER_17]: For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college, and then all of a sudden they get there, and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.

988
01:16:47,142 --> 01:16:48,983
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do touch upon that in 10th grade.

989
01:16:49,183 --> 01:16:55,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, we actually had Armstrong Ambulance come in, and they did a training for all of our seniors going off to college.

990
01:16:55,805 --> 01:16:59,327
[SPEAKER_03]: They talked about drugs, drug use, overdoses.

991
01:16:59,827 --> 01:17:02,168
[SPEAKER_03]: They learned how to do CPR, first aid.

992
01:17:03,568 --> 01:17:09,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was actually something that we started last year to help those students transitioning from senior year into college.

993
01:17:11,012 --> 01:17:16,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, I just wondered, those two speakers who were there that night, have they come and spoken?

994
01:17:16,254 --> 01:17:24,497
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that they both expressed willingness to me or to others to come and talk directly to students, and I've wondered if you might.

995
01:17:24,677 --> 01:17:27,578
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't gotten anything.

996
01:17:27,618 --> 01:17:34,020
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure you have the names, and they certainly expressed their willingness to me, and I think that we might, it might be valuable.

997
01:17:35,681 --> 01:17:37,542
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize for not including the,

998
01:17:39,185 --> 01:17:42,508
[SPEAKER_19]: naloxone training to seniors and also to our vocational students.

999
01:17:44,309 --> 01:17:47,311
[SPEAKER_19]: We do a lot of stuff.

1000
01:17:47,351 --> 01:17:48,172
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

1001
01:17:48,212 --> 01:17:55,437
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a big one, though, because it does start to talk about this missing population, 18 to 28-year-olds, I would say.

1002
01:17:55,457 --> 01:17:57,939
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things that we're doing that's

1003
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Really a big cornerstone in our offices.

1004
01:18:01,481 --> 01:18:14,505
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing a lot of work working with trying to address overdose rates in the trades and so we've worked with Heidi had a last year did a great job of getting us in and we had that in

1005
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:15,586
[SPEAKER_19]: that conversation.

1006
01:18:15,606 --> 01:18:19,049
[SPEAKER_19]: So we talked about, you know, dangers on the job.

1007
01:18:19,089 --> 01:18:29,037
[SPEAKER_19]: We met with all the vocational students that were in co-op and we talked about, you know, injuries on the job, what to do if there's an injury from a tourniquet to how to use naloxone.

1008
01:18:29,678 --> 01:18:34,322
[SPEAKER_19]: And we had some really great conversations, super bright nursing, you know, CNA students.

1009
01:18:34,946 --> 01:18:36,809
[SPEAKER_19]: just really, really good conversations there.

1010
01:18:36,869 --> 01:18:48,025
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's one way that we should be thinking about and continuing to partner about, you know, working with those employers who are taking on our students and what are they doing, what are their practices.

1011
01:18:48,065 --> 01:18:49,968
[SPEAKER_19]: We've created a toolkit for workers on

1012
01:18:50,368 --> 01:18:54,692
[SPEAKER_19]: how to understand the laws that pertain to them as well as to their employees.

1013
01:18:54,972 --> 01:18:56,533
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've done a lot of work around that.

1014
01:18:57,054 --> 01:18:59,455
[SPEAKER_19]: That gets at the population that's not going off to college.

1015
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:07,702
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think that one thing that Danielle from Armstrong Ambulance would say is that the majority of the students were staying in Massachusetts.

1016
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:17,750
[SPEAKER_19]: And so it's really about all of us thinking, all of our school systems thinking as a whole about how to teach kids the same information across the board.

1017
01:19:17,995 --> 01:19:21,318
[SPEAKER_19]: So when they do go to school, they're still taking care of each other and helping each other out.

1018
01:19:21,918 --> 01:19:22,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto?

1019
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,484
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're doing that training this year for CPI or First Aid, can we add a back-end training?

1020
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:30,725
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already in it.

1021
01:19:30,886 --> 01:19:31,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already there.

1022
01:19:32,787 --> 01:19:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that for both the high school and the vocational school?

1023
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:36,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is seniors.

1024
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:37,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's great.

1025
01:19:38,031 --> 01:19:38,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's wonderful.

1026
01:19:39,553 --> 01:19:42,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's wonderful.

1027
01:19:43,336 --> 01:19:44,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Ternagli?

1028
01:19:44,437 --> 01:19:44,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1029
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:47,119
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the school, I think that the reason that

1030
01:19:47,597 --> 01:19:58,920
[SPEAKER_00]: as you stated many times, the reason that people do dueling so much is just because they think it's not bad, and also that it seems clean, and they don't think that's hurtful.

1031
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:04,501
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I think would be really effective, similar to the 74% of

1032
01:20:07,571 --> 01:20:09,433
[SPEAKER_00]: students are marijuana free.

1033
01:20:10,454 --> 01:20:14,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was really effective, just having the facts up there.

1034
01:20:14,497 --> 01:20:18,020
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think something that could be really effective in the school

1035
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:39,108
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like maybe picking three or four facts, um, from, you know, like one Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes, um, you'd be surprised how many people, uh, pay attention to that, and especially, as you mentioned, um, that, you know, the, the facts are not out there, and people would be really, um,

1036
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:48,705
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would change the perception of the problem at hand before it really takes root over time.

1037
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,267
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.

1038
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:53,751
[SPEAKER_19]: That's called social norming, and you just identified a scientific...

1039
01:20:55,129 --> 01:20:57,170
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, research, study, evidence-based, but it works.

1040
01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:05,652
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have done posters in the past that we believe could have driven those numbers continually down, talking about how many students actually don't use marijuana.

1041
01:21:06,072 --> 01:21:11,673
[SPEAKER_19]: It's interesting when you are someone who's using substances, your peer group's probably using substances.

1042
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:14,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Thus, the whole entire world is using substances.

1043
01:21:14,754 --> 01:21:16,495
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's something to be thinking about.

1044
01:21:16,535 --> 01:21:22,016
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really important to get the facts out there and to really show that there's a lot of kids who just don't do this stuff, a lot of students.

1045
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:24,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you yield to Ms.

1046
01:21:24,766 --> 01:21:25,186
[SPEAKER_14]: O'Brien?

1047
01:21:25,226 --> 01:21:25,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1048
01:21:25,806 --> 01:21:25,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1049
01:21:26,007 --> 01:21:26,487
[SPEAKER_14]: O'Brien.

1050
01:21:26,547 --> 01:21:30,970
[SPEAKER_14]: So back when I was in high school, I was part of the Above the Influence Club for a while with Ms.

1051
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:32,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Perry as my advisor.

1052
01:21:32,311 --> 01:21:35,674
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had Chris Heron come and speak to all the athletes in high school.

1053
01:21:35,994 --> 01:21:36,735
[SPEAKER_14]: It was mandatory.

1054
01:21:36,775 --> 01:21:40,658
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't even play the spring sport unless you went and saw Chris Heron.

1055
01:21:40,798 --> 01:21:50,826
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that was such a positive thing for us as high schoolers to see someone who's young and who overcame something and made something of his life, who

1056
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:54,047
[SPEAKER_14]: was rich at one point, and then totally went somewhere else.

1057
01:21:54,107 --> 01:21:57,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like that would be so beneficial to have a motivational speaker come in.

1058
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:02,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even just the athletes, but to everyone in the school should have the opportunity to come see someone.

1059
01:22:03,212 --> 01:22:05,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's not just the athletes that fall out of track, you know?

1060
01:22:05,993 --> 01:22:06,533
[SPEAKER_14]: It's everyone.

1061
01:22:06,673 --> 01:22:09,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think a motivational speaker would be totally helpful.

1062
01:22:09,235 --> 01:22:13,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Chris Herron, I know, like my friends, when we left, we were like, oh my gosh.

1063
01:22:13,477 --> 01:22:13,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, wow.

1064
01:22:14,717 --> 01:22:18,818
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Mary Burke's daughter was on the lacrosse team with me and she, it was just amazing.

1065
01:22:18,878 --> 01:22:26,421
[SPEAKER_14]: It was an amazing experience and I think the children would really benefit from that and I think we should not even open it to just the high school, it should be the middle school too.

1066
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:26,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

1067
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:36,004
[SPEAKER_14]: And me being a young teacher and wanting to teach in Medford, I think we have such a strong community and we're so tight bonded and I'm so tight bonded with everyone in the community.

1068
01:22:36,024 --> 01:22:38,305
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I can talk to anyone here and I want to be able to

1069
01:22:39,859 --> 01:22:45,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how to put it, but have people be able to come and talk to the teachers and be comfortable with everyone.

1070
01:22:45,982 --> 01:22:49,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think a motivational speaker coming in would be just a great aspect.

1071
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:50,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how Ms.

1072
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:51,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Carey got Chris Hirons.

1073
01:22:51,684 --> 01:22:54,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe she could come about that again.

1074
01:22:54,825 --> 01:22:56,446
[SPEAKER_14]: But I know he does motivational speaking all the time.

1075
01:22:56,486 --> 01:22:57,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I follow him on Twitter.

1076
01:22:57,266 --> 01:22:58,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's amazing.

1077
01:22:58,847 --> 01:22:59,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah.

1078
01:23:00,148 --> 01:23:01,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Great recommendation, Hannah.

1079
01:23:02,929 --> 01:23:03,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skerry.

1080
01:23:04,074 --> 01:23:09,064
[SPEAKER_20]: May I throw you to Sebastian, this is your next great story, next great lead in the Mustang News.

1081
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:14,153
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead of posters, get it in print and shoot for our Pulitzer.

1082
01:23:15,353 --> 01:23:16,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Betty can give you more stats.

1083
01:23:17,134 --> 01:23:19,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I follow up on that?

1084
01:23:19,234 --> 01:23:30,457
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I wondered, I think that one in our report, that one stat about one jewel couldn't have, whatever it was, contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.

1085
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:34,157
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just so striking that it is time for us.

1086
01:23:34,197 --> 01:23:35,478
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a graphics arts department.

1087
01:23:35,498 --> 01:23:37,038
[SPEAKER_17]: We can get some posters made up.

1088
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:40,739
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.

1089
01:23:40,959 --> 01:23:46,603
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you should also know that one of those pods is like $4, like four or five bucks.

1090
01:23:47,544 --> 01:23:50,166
[SPEAKER_19]: So a lot cheaper than a pack.

1091
01:23:50,186 --> 01:23:52,367
[SPEAKER_09]: No taxes, or is it a tax on that?

1092
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:53,468
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's online.

1093
01:23:53,688 --> 01:23:55,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's taxed.

1094
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:57,110
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a sales tax.

1095
01:23:57,451 --> 01:24:00,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So our community, the Board of Health passed that you cannot sell to minors.

1096
01:24:01,173 --> 01:24:01,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1097
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:01,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless you.

1098
01:24:01,774 --> 01:24:02,314
[SPEAKER_09]: God bless you.

1099
01:24:02,374 --> 01:24:02,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless you.

1100
01:24:03,735 --> 01:24:06,356
[SPEAKER_20]: And just one last point for Sebastian.

1101
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:14,821
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a great article a couple of weeks ago on the Globe regarding dueling and its effects and what they know so far.

1102
01:24:15,161 --> 01:24:20,964
[SPEAKER_20]: So you might want to research that and come up with your own conclusions and get a story out there for us.

1103
01:24:20,984 --> 01:24:21,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds good.

1104
01:24:21,564 --> 01:24:22,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1105
01:24:22,204 --> 01:24:22,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1106
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:22,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloof.

1107
01:24:23,025 --> 01:24:23,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1108
01:24:23,285 --> 01:24:31,129
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I just wondered if we can also, I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could talk to the Graphic Arts Department and get some posters made.

1109
01:24:32,921 --> 01:24:34,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion on the floor, I second.

1110
01:24:35,483 --> 01:24:38,785
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motions that have been offered thus far, all those in favor?

1111
01:24:38,945 --> 01:24:39,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1112
01:24:39,565 --> 01:24:40,326
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1113
01:24:40,766 --> 01:24:43,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes, including a motivational speaker.

1114
01:24:47,093 --> 01:24:47,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1115
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:48,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, through the chair.

1116
01:24:49,155 --> 01:24:50,215
[SPEAKER_09]: School committee man-elect.

1117
01:24:51,556 --> 01:24:52,357
[SPEAKER_15]: I have two questions.

1118
01:24:53,298 --> 01:25:00,423
[SPEAKER_15]: The first is, so the alcohol use from the 6th to 8th grade dropped pretty precipitously from 2011 to 2013.

1119
01:25:01,224 --> 01:25:04,206
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was wondering what accounts for that drop.

1120
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:08,189
[SPEAKER_15]: And the second thing I had is maybe just helping us understand the analytics.

1121
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:10,631
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have children completing a survey.

1122
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:21,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey with this information it will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in?

1123
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:24,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have like a sense of like heroin use?

1124
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:27,133
[SPEAKER_15]: I know overdose is a serious issue in Medford.

1125
01:25:27,353 --> 01:25:32,157
[SPEAKER_15]: So do we have a sense of underage heroin overdoses in Medford right now?

1126
01:25:32,177 --> 01:25:34,499
[SPEAKER_19]: There are no underage heroin overdoses in Medford.

1127
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,163
[SPEAKER_19]: There was an individual who was 19 that overdosed and

1128
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:41,562
[SPEAKER_19]: died in Medford, they were from another community.

1129
01:25:41,682 --> 01:25:42,603
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's something to know.

1130
01:25:46,426 --> 01:25:48,327
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have it here at the bottom.

1131
01:25:48,407 --> 01:26:00,476
[SPEAKER_19]: But these numbers are so small that it's very, you have to really think about that, that this is like .1% of the entire population that took it reported.

1132
01:26:00,496 --> 01:26:01,537
[SPEAKER_19]: That could be one student.

1133
01:26:02,117 --> 01:26:04,299
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's something to think about when you're looking at that data.

1134
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:05,359
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's there.

1135
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,482
[SPEAKER_19]: But your question is about,

1136
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:12,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, what was the drop?

1137
01:26:12,665 --> 01:26:14,066
[SPEAKER_15]: The drop was pretty significant.

1138
01:26:14,106 --> 01:26:16,708
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have 10%, that's a significant selection.

1139
01:26:16,728 --> 01:26:17,349
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a significant drop.

1140
01:26:17,389 --> 01:26:22,312
[SPEAKER_19]: And what we saw at that time was we saw an increase in parental monitoring.

1141
01:26:23,273 --> 01:26:32,380
[SPEAKER_19]: If you were to look at the risk and protective factors, we talked about in 2011, there were some protective factors that were very low in the middle schools.

1142
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:37,286
[SPEAKER_19]: And by the next year, they were exactly even with their sister scores.

1143
01:26:38,027 --> 01:26:48,760
[SPEAKER_19]: So the deal was that there were many opportunities for rewards if you do something in the school, but there weren't very many opportunities.

1144
01:26:49,321 --> 01:26:53,963
[SPEAKER_19]: So when those two came together and they were evened out, we talked about it at the school committee meeting.

1145
01:26:54,263 --> 01:26:55,884
[SPEAKER_19]: We talked about it with the principals.

1146
01:26:56,204 --> 01:27:01,447
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a whole influx of new activities after school, activities that started to happen.

1147
01:27:02,027 --> 01:27:04,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Those numbers became aligned and we saw that number drop.

1148
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:08,450
[SPEAKER_19]: So parents were monitoring their kids more closely.

1149
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:13,413
[SPEAKER_19]: The schools addressed some of the pro-social things that needed to be addressed in the community.

1150
01:27:14,453 --> 01:27:17,695
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a real sort of like chasm of everybody working together, I think.

1151
01:27:18,055 --> 01:27:19,617
[SPEAKER_19]: And that really helped drive those numbers down.

1152
01:27:20,918 --> 01:27:25,162
[SPEAKER_15]: And do you have a sense of how many kids are using but don't report on the survey?

1153
01:27:25,763 --> 01:27:29,347
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's just sort of a given with these surveys, right?

1154
01:27:31,297 --> 01:27:40,602
[SPEAKER_19]: To be honest with you, a lot of people who are using substances know very well that they don't want to be using substances, and so they do self-report pretty accurately on these surveys.

1155
01:27:40,902 --> 01:27:50,427
[SPEAKER_19]: They may not want to be forthcoming with someone that knows them and may feel shame if they were to report, but when it's anonymous, it's secretive.

1156
01:27:50,527 --> 01:27:53,108
[SPEAKER_19]: They actually do fill them out pretty accurately, at least that's what

1157
01:27:53,949 --> 01:27:56,852
[SPEAKER_19]: nationally, that's what the story has been.

1158
01:27:56,933 --> 01:28:01,318
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have the exact scientific facts for you, but that's what I do know.

1159
01:28:02,742 --> 01:28:03,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1160
01:28:03,343 --> 01:28:05,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

1161
01:28:05,264 --> 01:28:05,785
[SPEAKER_08]: One more question.

1162
01:28:05,805 --> 01:28:05,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1163
01:28:05,945 --> 01:28:06,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

1164
01:28:06,405 --> 01:28:14,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into a vehicle.

1165
01:28:15,172 --> 01:28:15,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1166
01:28:15,673 --> 01:28:17,034
[SPEAKER_08]: With someone who's been vaping.

1167
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:18,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1168
01:28:18,115 --> 01:28:22,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is very important and it's very serious.

1169
01:28:22,058 --> 01:28:26,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think

1170
01:28:27,442 --> 01:28:38,775
[SPEAKER_08]: People are aware of how serious that could be because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind and as kids we've been trained in our minds too is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.

1171
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:39,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1172
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:40,577
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's been talking about this.

1173
01:28:40,637 --> 01:28:41,739
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, you know, newer.

1174
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:44,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.

1175
01:28:45,002 --> 01:28:45,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1176
01:28:45,463 --> 01:28:47,605
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a really important one to talk about for sure.

1177
01:28:48,695 --> 01:28:49,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1178
01:28:49,096 --> 01:28:52,564
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, this report being received and placed on file, all those in favor?

1179
01:28:52,664 --> 01:28:53,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1180
01:28:53,446 --> 01:28:54,068
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1181
01:28:54,088 --> 01:28:55,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

1182
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:55,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1183
01:28:55,751 --> 01:28:56,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1184
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:04,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1185
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:05,758
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1186
01:29:05,818 --> 01:29:06,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1187
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:07,099
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1188
01:29:07,599 --> 01:29:08,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1189
01:29:08,859 --> 01:29:14,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Report one, recommendation to approve Medford High School, Medford Vogue Tech High School graduation date and location.

1190
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:14,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Move approval.

1191
01:29:14,841 --> 01:29:15,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve.

1192
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:18,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Superintendent, well, you want me just to announce the date?

1193
01:29:18,422 --> 01:29:29,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,

1194
01:29:30,086 --> 01:29:31,367
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, we've locked in the date.

1195
01:29:31,987 --> 01:29:35,769
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.

1196
01:29:35,869 --> 01:29:38,030
[SPEAKER_12]: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.

1197
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:48,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing, the other thing that I just will let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.

1198
01:29:48,754 --> 01:29:49,255
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exciting.

1199
01:29:50,015 --> 01:29:50,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

1200
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:53,977
[SPEAKER_09]: So June 6th, all those parents out there, at 6 p.m.

1201
01:29:54,037 --> 01:29:56,298
[SPEAKER_09]: at the Gantcher Center at Tufts University.

1202
01:29:57,617 --> 01:30:00,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1203
01:30:00,099 --> 01:30:00,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz.

1204
01:30:00,419 --> 01:30:01,380
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1205
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:01,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1206
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:02,801
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1207
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:03,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1208
01:30:05,703 --> 01:30:06,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Financial report.

1209
01:30:06,863 --> 01:30:07,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1210
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:07,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson.

1211
01:30:11,604 --> 01:30:18,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is our first quarterly or close to one-third of the year report on our financials.

1212
01:30:18,948 --> 01:30:23,271
[SPEAKER_04]: The general fund operating budget for FY18 is $56,431,000, of which year-to-date we have spent 42%, 42.9%, which is a total of $24,215,786.

1213
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:27,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And that includes both our expenditures and our encumbrances, which is reserving funds for

1214
01:30:41,309 --> 01:30:43,231
[SPEAKER_04]: anticipated and projected expenses.

1215
01:30:44,252 --> 01:30:57,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So of the amount spent to date, our 10-month biweekly employees have received nine of their checks since August 28th, with an additional special run in October to accommodate the anticipated number of checks per calendar year.

1216
01:30:58,447 --> 01:31:04,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And all 12-month employees have received 11 of their paychecks since July 1, the first start of the new fiscal year.

1217
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:11,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have many staff members out on maternity leave with some additional expected in the spring.

1218
01:31:11,595 --> 01:31:12,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently we have nine.

1219
01:31:13,238 --> 01:31:20,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are some significant coverages that we're maintaining that is also long-term sub-capacities.

1220
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:34,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And while there has been significant transition for teaching and other staff members during this school year, we have been able to fill the positions based on the program needs and will continue to do so as those arise.

1221
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:38,338
[SPEAKER_04]: The business office is fully staffed.

1222
01:31:38,718 --> 01:31:43,980
[SPEAKER_04]: We transitioned from some various leaves and had significant turnover over the summer.

1223
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:52,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are in the process of reclassifying our payroll codes to reflect correct budget items and be in line with that.

1224
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,569
[SPEAKER_04]: where they were reflected for the departmental charges.

1225
01:31:56,430 --> 01:32:12,482
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also excited and encouraged to be rolling out and implementing a new automated onboarding process that's for the hiring and tracking that will greatly improve our laborious process for new hires and streamlining documentation.

1226
01:32:12,843 --> 01:32:14,424
[SPEAKER_04]: This will also be rolled out to

1227
01:32:14,964 --> 01:32:25,117
[SPEAKER_04]: current employees for data changes and updates, and it is a subsequent system for the current attendance ASOP system that we use with Frontline.

1228
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:30,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will also include a mobile app, so that will greatly improve utilization.

1229
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:58,799
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we continue to respond to the DESE, Department of Ed chart of account change structures, as well as additional reporting components that they have for us, we have to report and track expenses by a number of different areas, which include by school, by function code, by category, district wide, and expanding out to individual grants, the higher level grants, such as Title I and special education.

1230
01:32:59,932 --> 01:33:13,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So within the operating budget where some budget columns may be zero, the planned cost projections are included in those breakout items and the balances within each function remain to be positive.

1231
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:25,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So we please also note that the encumbrance column, it does include amounts that we have included our best projections for year-end expenditures.

1232
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:34,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So those will continue to be monitored, liquidated, and updated as costs are trued up as the invoices come in and actual payments are relieved.

1233
01:33:35,539 --> 01:33:40,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So included with the summary are some of the key program areas within our general fund.

1234
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:44,654
[SPEAKER_04]: The first of which is the largest component of our budget is salaries.

1235
01:33:45,775 --> 01:33:53,502
[SPEAKER_04]: In fiscal year 2018, we have two salary increments that were awarded for the collective bargaining units.

1236
01:33:53,622 --> 01:33:57,846
[SPEAKER_04]: The first was in July and or the start of their contract.

1237
01:33:58,386 --> 01:34:05,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second increase will be in January for the appropriate CBA groups.

1238
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:06,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will be another 1%.

1239
01:34:07,734 --> 01:34:15,020
[SPEAKER_04]: So the undistributed allocation will be dispersed among the budget adjustments for different program areas.

1240
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:26,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we identify the increases in certain areas, we'll be reallocating some of those amounts for personnel changes, retirement buybacks, and the such.

1241
01:34:28,211 --> 01:34:30,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Another area of interest is security.

1242
01:34:31,052 --> 01:34:36,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Large investments have been made to replace and repair the security cameras throughout the district at all buildings.

1243
01:34:37,835 --> 01:34:44,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So the amount of $194,949 within the budget is earmarked for the security program reporting area.

1244
01:34:45,498 --> 01:34:49,320
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it will most likely be shifted to a capital account once appropriated.

1245
01:34:51,008 --> 01:34:57,475
[SPEAKER_04]: We expect that the projects will be completed at all schools by mid-December, and we will follow up with a detailed report.

1246
01:34:58,456 --> 01:35:05,844
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been many schools that have finalized the completion of those repairs, and we will be updating as they

1247
01:35:06,773 --> 01:35:07,653
[SPEAKER_04]: finalized as well.

1248
01:35:08,254 --> 01:35:28,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So security in the buildings is a priority, and the district continues to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring safety in the multiple areas, and that includes our staffing, training our staff members, cameras, security cameras, and identification stops at entrance locations, which include the Raptor license scanning and name tag system.

1249
01:35:29,822 --> 01:35:33,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Our technology is another significant area where the

1250
01:35:34,434 --> 01:35:41,496
[SPEAKER_04]: committee decided to infuse the system with significant funding at each of the school systems, at each school building.

1251
01:35:42,217 --> 01:35:52,760
[SPEAKER_04]: There was $15,000 earmarked for the high school level, $5,000 for Curtis Tufts, $15,000 for the middle schools, and $13,000 for each elementary school, which was significant.

1252
01:35:53,520 --> 01:36:08,444
[SPEAKER_04]: We utilized those funds and used some high volume discounts along with state bid pricing to maximize the investment within those technology area and rolled out over the summer to have the carts and units available for the start of school.

1253
01:36:09,044 --> 01:36:16,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So in total we had 455 devices, new devices for this school year that were rolled out for use in each of the buildings.

1254
01:36:17,975 --> 01:36:24,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And additionally, within technology, we just received the E-rate approval that will further improve connectivity district-wide.

1255
01:36:25,558 --> 01:36:35,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're hoping the matching dollars that were requested from the city will be approved and we'll be able to continue the technology investment throughout school year 2018.

1256
01:36:37,813 --> 01:36:40,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Transportation continues to be a large item.

1257
01:36:41,935 --> 01:36:50,761
[SPEAKER_04]: We are currently in year three of the original three-year contract with Eastern Bus, and we have an additional two years locked in at specified rates for that contract.

1258
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:54,843
[SPEAKER_04]: The budget reflects an anticipated reduction of one bus.

1259
01:36:55,443 --> 01:37:07,110
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we did have to bring bus number 18 back into the cycle due to the shift in newcomers programs, and so we've had to utilize the additional bus for that.

1260
01:37:07,799 --> 01:37:14,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So it shows a negative amount within that category based on the need for additional transportation.

1261
01:37:15,743 --> 01:37:21,146
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have absorbed the cost for students that attend the Minuteman Vocational School.

1262
01:37:21,886 --> 01:37:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And the amount we expect will be covered by the reduced enrollment in the tuition.

1263
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:37,254
[SPEAKER_04]: So where we had projected additional students going out, and the offset coming in for the transportation will net itself out.

1264
01:37:38,408 --> 01:37:50,415
[SPEAKER_04]: We currently provide after school buses to the middle schools, and that's per contract that was identified in the original contract, three buses per day, and that's for 70 days throughout the school year.

1265
01:37:50,996 --> 01:38:06,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also indicated that should the elementary schools be considering additional after school programs, there would be some additional costs realized with that, and we would need to work with the provider for the levels of

1266
01:38:08,072 --> 01:38:15,238
[SPEAKER_04]: trips and participation and timing of those trips because the routes are all intertwined and combined.

1267
01:38:15,298 --> 01:38:26,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So there may be possibility for an additional contractor at that point if it was decided and determined to go forward with that additional expense in the transportation area.

1268
01:38:28,171 --> 01:38:41,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Our utilities, which covers natural gas, electricity, water, we encumber the utilities based on historical years of usage, and we budget conservatively for unexpected occurrences.

1269
01:38:42,967 --> 01:38:45,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So our natural gas rates have been very favorable.

1270
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:49,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Utilization has been lower due to milder winters.

1271
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:57,018
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we still have not experienced the cold months for this fiscal year, so we're not quite sure how that will land.

1272
01:38:57,878 --> 01:39:11,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Electricity continues to be volatile in the marketplace, and we will be expecting a slightly higher rate beginning next fiscal year, which we have locked in with City Hall working with the Power Options Company.

1273
01:39:12,509 --> 01:39:21,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So our current rate is slightly lower, which is for the supply cost at 0.0882 per kilowatt hour.

1274
01:39:21,711 --> 01:39:25,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving into next fiscal year, we'll have 0.0931.

1275
01:39:26,092 --> 01:39:33,194
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely moving forward as we budget and plan for that, we will need to budget some increases in that area.

1276
01:39:34,395 --> 01:39:38,456
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have encumbered the entire line item for that account.

1277
01:39:40,819 --> 01:39:43,660
[SPEAKER_04]: gone to the very end of that particular expense.

1278
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:48,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to maintain a conservative estimate and show that fully expended.

1279
01:39:49,563 --> 01:39:57,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So in summary, the first financial report shows that the expenditures are in line with our budget projections.

1280
01:39:57,527 --> 01:39:59,708
[SPEAKER_04]: We will continue to monitor and review them.

1281
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:07,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And we constantly look at consolidating purchases, utilizing state bids when we can.

1282
01:40:07,984 --> 01:40:10,847
[SPEAKER_04]: and the like and identifying savings wherever possible.

1283
01:40:11,328 --> 01:40:22,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to, again, thank City Hall, my counterparts at the hall, that communication, cooperation has been very effective in helping us accomplish what we need to get done.

1284
01:40:24,276 --> 01:40:25,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1285
01:40:26,397 --> 01:40:27,638
[SPEAKER_17]: Christina, I had one question.

1286
01:40:27,738 --> 01:40:33,181
[SPEAKER_17]: Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?

1287
01:40:33,662 --> 01:40:33,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1288
01:40:34,042 --> 01:40:38,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So our payroll system is not linked with our financial system.

1289
01:40:38,224 --> 01:40:40,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So we outsource payroll.

1290
01:40:40,385 --> 01:40:43,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to identify a payroll code that is

1291
01:40:43,993 --> 01:40:47,076
[SPEAKER_04]: crosswalk to our general ledger code, a financial software code.

1292
01:40:47,696 --> 01:40:59,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So those codes, which was a much smaller code number, may not necessarily be aligned with what our either newly identified budget financial account code is, general ledger account.

1293
01:41:00,066 --> 01:41:12,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going through now and really scouring those areas to look at some anomalies that might be occurring and to make sure that where we budgeted individuals based on department, school-wide, that they are

1294
01:41:12,921 --> 01:41:15,122
[SPEAKER_04]: correctly classified in the payroll code.

1295
01:41:15,262 --> 01:41:15,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1296
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:23,085
[SPEAKER_17]: So it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office or transferred in the role was given different classification?

1297
01:41:23,525 --> 01:41:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1298
01:41:23,985 --> 01:41:24,285
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1299
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:26,766
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is strictly an accounting function.

1300
01:41:26,926 --> 01:41:27,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1301
01:41:27,086 --> 01:41:31,808
[SPEAKER_04]: So identifying the crosswalk from our payroll system to our general fund accounting system.

1302
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:38,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the reports.

1303
01:41:38,832 --> 01:41:39,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

1304
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:40,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have one question.

1305
01:41:41,254 --> 01:41:43,376
[SPEAKER_11]: It does mention, I was going to ask about the cameras.

1306
01:41:43,796 --> 01:41:48,120
[SPEAKER_11]: So it mentions that a large investment was made to replace and repair security cameras.

1307
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:58,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know a lot of us were getting emails throughout the fall where a lot of parents were very concerned because a lot of cameras were out and they weren't operating.

1308
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:08,996
[SPEAKER_11]: So are there any cameras that are still in need of repair, or were all the cameras that were malfunctioning and not operating, were they all repaired?

1309
01:42:09,356 --> 01:42:17,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've addressed all of the inoperable cameras that were the critical areas for observation.

1310
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:22,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of those have been addressed with the investment that we have provided.

1311
01:42:22,744 --> 01:42:26,786
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not all currently complete, as the contractor is still working on them.

1312
01:42:27,365 --> 01:42:35,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have several teams at several locations, and they anticipate being complete in the next couple of weeks.

1313
01:42:36,949 --> 01:42:39,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask a point of clarification?

1314
01:42:39,491 --> 01:42:39,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1315
01:42:41,673 --> 01:42:44,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So you said the key point cameras.

1316
01:42:44,076 --> 01:42:49,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key point?

1317
01:42:49,681 --> 01:42:50,321
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1318
01:42:50,441 --> 01:42:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned, repairs and replacements have not all been done to this date, to date right now for reporting back to you.

1319
01:43:00,462 --> 01:43:03,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the schools have been, and they are in process right now.

1320
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:09,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we will be finalizing the update in a couple of weeks when they are complete.

1321
01:43:09,508 --> 01:43:11,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did, I believe, the Roberts is complete.

1322
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:22,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the other highly critical areas, but the larger projects that were greater in scale are still ongoing.

1323
01:43:22,497 --> 01:43:24,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're in the process of being

1324
01:43:24,767 --> 01:43:25,748
[SPEAKER_04]: repaired and replaced.

1325
01:43:25,969 --> 01:43:28,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a completion hopeful date?

1326
01:43:29,313 --> 01:43:29,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Two weeks.

1327
01:43:30,294 --> 01:43:38,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?

1328
01:43:39,605 --> 01:43:43,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.

1329
01:43:44,464 --> 01:43:56,818
[SPEAKER_12]: and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need

1330
01:43:57,856 --> 01:44:00,117
[SPEAKER_12]: cameras have to be replaced going into the school year.

1331
01:44:00,157 --> 01:44:08,659
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?

1332
01:44:08,879 --> 01:44:09,600
[SPEAKER_12]: The answer is yes.

1333
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:16,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.

1334
01:44:16,482 --> 01:44:21,623
[SPEAKER_12]: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.

1335
01:44:21,683 --> 01:44:26,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.

1336
01:44:28,021 --> 01:44:31,983
[SPEAKER_12]: For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.

1337
01:44:33,704 --> 01:44:47,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them.

1338
01:44:47,951 --> 01:44:50,232
[SPEAKER_05]: He has in the past, and he has more to donate.

1339
01:44:50,292 --> 01:44:52,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm making a motion now.

1340
01:44:53,754 --> 01:45:01,219
[SPEAKER_05]: that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now and if it's appropriate to have them as backup cameras.

1341
01:45:01,239 --> 01:45:04,141
[SPEAKER_12]: So let me answer that before we go too far down the road.

1342
01:45:05,142 --> 01:45:09,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.

1343
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.

1344
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:14,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them can be used for limited purposes.

1345
01:45:14,327 --> 01:45:17,810
[SPEAKER_12]: But given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,

1346
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:27,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.

1347
01:45:27,393 --> 01:45:32,054
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.

1348
01:45:32,534 --> 01:45:46,979
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did, so.

1349
01:45:48,379 --> 01:45:52,902
[SPEAKER_12]: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.

1350
01:45:53,042 --> 01:45:53,482
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1351
01:45:53,542 --> 01:45:56,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I also make a motion to send him a thank you note.

1352
01:45:56,504 --> 01:45:58,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.

1353
01:45:58,425 --> 01:46:04,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Consistently over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his gifts.

1354
01:46:05,632 --> 01:46:34,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the security issue I was I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed What types of movement will happen were there any positions added like I'm just curious I know we talked about HR person at one point the superintendent mentioned something like that I just was wondering what what that looks like now, or maybe we could even get like you know a workshop plan.

1355
01:46:34,812 --> 01:46:35,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you

1356
01:46:36,473 --> 01:46:40,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a maternity leave that was not covered.

1357
01:46:41,655 --> 01:46:42,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were understaffed.

1358
01:46:43,376 --> 01:46:49,600
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had transition from one of our team members who went to another department within the school.

1359
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:53,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to fill another payroll position.

1360
01:46:54,042 --> 01:46:55,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been nothing added.

1361
01:46:55,883 --> 01:47:02,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been back-filling and trying to maintain and keep the level of service with less people.

1362
01:47:02,867 --> 01:47:05,088
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was nobody added, except for one person.

1363
01:47:05,464 --> 01:47:09,666
[SPEAKER_04]: a replacement for an open position that had transferred.

1364
01:47:10,247 --> 01:47:18,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we see that chart anyway, just so the committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in those roles.

1365
01:47:19,012 --> 01:47:26,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go to the superintendent, but you know, it's just to know.

1366
01:47:26,496 --> 01:47:27,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Names and job titles.

1367
01:47:27,657 --> 01:47:28,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would be great.

1368
01:47:29,198 --> 01:47:29,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1369
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:38,006
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.

1370
01:47:38,486 --> 01:47:47,192
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.

1371
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:50,495
[SPEAKER_12]: So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.

1372
01:47:53,201 --> 01:47:58,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I just also want to speak about the community schools budget.

1373
01:47:59,202 --> 01:48:04,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly.

1374
01:48:04,564 --> 01:48:07,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon.

1375
01:48:08,024 --> 01:48:08,825
[SPEAKER_05]: We will.

1376
01:48:08,985 --> 01:48:09,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1377
01:48:09,865 --> 01:48:15,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget.

1378
01:48:15,066 --> 01:48:17,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I might forget if it's not written.

1379
01:48:17,286 --> 01:48:17,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1380
01:48:17,667 --> 01:48:19,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I doubt you're going to forget.

1381
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:24,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know, it could happen.

1382
01:48:24,372 --> 01:48:25,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1383
01:48:25,573 --> 01:48:27,796
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

1384
01:48:27,836 --> 01:48:30,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1385
01:48:30,378 --> 01:48:31,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Ms.

1386
01:48:31,159 --> 01:48:33,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot along with a thank you vote to Mr. O'Keefe.

1387
01:48:33,641 --> 01:48:34,422
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1388
01:48:34,442 --> 01:48:35,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1389
01:48:35,263 --> 01:48:36,104
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1390
01:48:36,904 --> 01:48:37,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion granted.

1391
01:48:37,665 --> 01:48:39,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Kirsten.

1392
01:48:39,307 --> 01:48:40,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you, Kirsten.

1393
01:48:42,029 --> 01:48:45,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Item number three, report on bilingual education legislation.

1394
01:48:45,633 --> 01:48:46,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

1395
01:48:47,265 --> 01:48:58,827
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.

1396
01:48:59,607 --> 01:49:13,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.

1397
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:20,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, it was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.

1398
01:49:21,657 --> 01:49:24,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.

1399
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:39,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we, we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that have required deep cognitive knowledge.

1400
01:49:39,771 --> 01:49:42,593
[SPEAKER_12]: cognitive language is not so easily done.

1401
01:49:43,794 --> 01:49:47,637
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.

1402
01:49:49,538 --> 01:49:51,400
[SPEAKER_12]: We obviously are looking at that.

1403
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:59,205
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.

1404
01:49:59,265 --> 01:50:00,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And we haven't seen them yet.

1405
01:50:00,346 --> 01:50:04,469
[SPEAKER_12]: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.

1406
01:50:05,089 --> 01:50:07,972
[SPEAKER_12]: So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next

1407
01:50:08,832 --> 01:50:09,613
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, fiscal year.

1408
01:50:09,773 --> 01:50:26,222
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we are going to look at the blend of programs, and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that, and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate, while at the same time not lose track of, uh, situations which are best served by the current SEI.

1409
01:50:26,362 --> 01:50:30,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, also, as you probably know, uh, our teachers have

1410
01:50:31,305 --> 01:50:44,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been working to get SEI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.

1411
01:50:44,395 --> 01:50:53,742
[SPEAKER_12]: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people receive students who have this English language need.

1412
01:50:54,643 --> 01:50:57,186
[SPEAKER_12]: to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.

1413
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:05,494
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL, and we're going to look at that.

1414
01:51:05,595 --> 01:51:07,136
[SPEAKER_12]: We did some distribution this year.

1415
01:51:07,777 --> 01:51:09,138
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have some comment about that.

1416
01:51:09,639 --> 01:51:15,065
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not an easy subject, because as you move people around, you create, you solve one problem, you create another.

1417
01:51:15,525 --> 01:51:27,596
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to provide some options for you in the, um, beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what, what options are available to you and, uh, what it means financially and what it means programmatically.

1418
01:51:28,276 --> 01:51:34,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, but tonight, uh, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and, uh, some of the other things that, uh, Paul has put together.

1419
01:51:34,982 --> 01:51:41,708
[SPEAKER_12]: So with permission, Paul, if you come on up and, uh, give us a, uh, a discussion on, on this topic.

1420
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:44,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening everyone.

1421
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:52,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So this bill allows districts to choose what type of programming works best for their communities.

1422
01:51:53,302 --> 01:52:03,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike the old TBE, they had it set up where it was mandatory if you had 20 or more students who spoke in a language group.

1423
01:52:04,746 --> 01:52:13,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, during that time, students in their first year, it was 20% of instruction was in English, 80% was in the target language.

1424
01:52:13,332 --> 01:52:15,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Year two, it was a 50-50 split.

1425
01:52:15,653 --> 01:52:22,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And then year three, it was 20% in, uh, the target language and 80%, I'm sorry, 20% in the native language and 80% in the target language.

1426
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:31,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we don't know what guidance the state's going to come out with, um, regarding this.

1427
01:52:31,765 --> 01:52:39,592
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to look at licensure because all of the bilingual licenses were put on hold by DESE 15 years ago when that ended.

1428
01:52:40,753 --> 01:52:43,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we don't know what their requirements will be.

1429
01:52:43,856 --> 01:52:44,637
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know, um,

1430
01:52:46,358 --> 01:52:48,860
[SPEAKER_01]: really what their guidance will be with programming.

1431
01:52:49,821 --> 01:52:56,146
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, my understanding of it as the bill is written, is it doesn't have to be a full-on program as it was in the past.

1432
01:52:56,606 --> 01:53:04,672
[SPEAKER_01]: We can now have just individual classes that can support our students who speak other languages.

1433
01:53:04,792 --> 01:53:12,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Mr. Belson and I were talking about this initially, we're thinking, you know, start out when we look at our language groups, Portuguese is our highest

1434
01:53:14,199 --> 01:53:17,062
[SPEAKER_01]: highest number of speakers, uh, at the high school.

1435
01:53:17,082 --> 01:53:25,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, our high school students are at a disadvantage because they have a finite period of time in which to learn language, pass all of their MCAS tests.

1436
01:53:25,089 --> 01:53:40,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if we were to introduce something here in Medford, we would look at those protocol, you know, the protocol set out by the Department of Ed, look at our student population, which again, changes on a regular basis, um, and, and make those decisions at that time.

1437
01:53:43,939 --> 01:53:44,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1438
01:53:44,119 --> 01:53:44,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

1439
01:53:46,441 --> 01:53:50,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because we won't have the answers to them.

1440
01:53:50,966 --> 01:53:56,351
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I'm going to ask you a question.

1441
01:53:56,411 --> 01:53:59,734
[SPEAKER_08]: When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,

1442
01:54:01,435 --> 01:54:15,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?

1443
01:54:15,963 --> 01:54:26,450
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy and I remember my teacher actually asking me,

1444
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:33,338
[SPEAKER_08]: to see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.

1445
01:54:33,999 --> 01:54:42,329
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here.

1446
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:46,071
[SPEAKER_08]: and in English, and I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.

1447
01:54:46,131 --> 01:54:46,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know why.

1448
01:54:47,331 --> 01:55:05,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when the students come here who don't speak English, they're set up with special, with their classes that are with an ESL teacher or a duly certified teacher who is certified in the content as well as ESL, and those are our newcomer classrooms even here at the high school.

1449
01:55:06,097 --> 01:55:11,219
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers, in collaboration with the building, with the assistant principals and guidance,

1450
01:55:11,579 --> 01:55:20,953
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of have an informal protocol to set up students with other students, but it's not formalized, it's not a specific program.

1451
01:55:21,374 --> 01:55:27,103
[SPEAKER_01]: But the actual classes, the students are with all newcomers in these newcomer classrooms.

1452
01:55:27,483 --> 01:55:28,584
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I understood that.

1453
01:55:28,624 --> 01:55:42,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they just come into a new building.

1454
01:55:42,059 --> 01:55:47,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.

1455
01:55:47,765 --> 01:55:51,066
[SPEAKER_08]: to come in and not know the language is even worse.

1456
01:55:51,466 --> 01:55:58,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.

1457
01:55:58,587 --> 01:56:04,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day.

1458
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:14,391
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?

1459
01:56:14,711 --> 01:56:16,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, that's done informally.

1460
01:56:16,552 --> 01:56:23,357
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a formal protocol or process for that, but the teachers work in collaboration with the guidance department on that.

1461
01:56:23,377 --> 01:56:25,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1462
01:56:25,239 --> 01:56:25,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1463
01:56:25,419 --> 01:56:25,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloot.

1464
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:33,084
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Mr. Teixeira, are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?

1465
01:56:34,128 --> 01:56:36,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I would wait until guidance comes out.

1466
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:47,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to a state meeting, uh, this Friday, uh, that will give me some additional information, um, and maybe I'll have a timeline on when the state will, you know, come out with their guidance.

1467
01:56:48,384 --> 01:56:52,348
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't move forward with anything until the guidance came forth.

1468
01:56:52,668 --> 01:57:02,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and at Medford High School, say for the Portuguese students, level one and level two, would be those students who were, certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us.

1469
01:57:03,216 --> 01:57:06,178
[SPEAKER_17]: And level two, they might have been with us for?

1470
01:57:06,759 --> 01:57:11,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those levels are based on what we do as a screener test.

1471
01:57:11,202 --> 01:57:12,983
[SPEAKER_01]: When the students arrive, it's based on

1472
01:57:14,404 --> 01:57:20,391
[SPEAKER_01]: WIDA testing, we're using the WIDA screener, and that gives us the level.

1473
01:57:20,792 --> 01:57:29,042
[SPEAKER_01]: So students may have had English in their native country, which is why they would test as a level 2, but they're still a newcomer, you know, just arrival.

1474
01:57:29,182 --> 01:57:34,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Other students, you know, that are level 1 most likely didn't have English in their native country.

1475
01:57:35,226 --> 01:57:48,200
[SPEAKER_17]: The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.

1476
01:57:48,841 --> 01:57:49,722
[SPEAKER_17]: How is that working out?

1477
01:57:53,365 --> 01:57:57,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to, I mean, are you looking for something specific or?

1478
01:57:57,409 --> 01:58:06,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and ability of siblings to receive their, you know, sisters and brothers.

1479
01:58:07,057 --> 01:58:16,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the Parent Information Center has been struggling with trying to do the placement that best meets both children and in some cases that hasn't actually happened.

1480
01:58:17,546 --> 01:58:23,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.

1481
01:58:23,469 --> 01:58:26,350
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.

1482
01:58:26,630 --> 01:58:27,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sounds great.

1483
01:58:27,931 --> 01:58:35,014
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.

1484
01:58:35,495 --> 01:58:42,158
[SPEAKER_12]: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.

1485
01:58:42,938 --> 01:58:47,543
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.

1486
01:58:47,563 --> 01:58:56,891
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.

1487
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1488
01:58:58,733 --> 01:58:58,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1489
01:58:58,873 --> 01:59:02,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Mastone, thank you for your report, both of you for your report.

1490
01:59:02,737 --> 01:59:13,143
[SPEAKER_06]: The last paragraph on the report is, if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement.

1491
01:59:14,063 --> 01:59:19,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Organizations such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district.

1492
01:59:19,526 --> 01:59:25,169
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants.

1493
01:59:25,529 --> 01:59:26,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's new to me.

1494
01:59:26,330 --> 01:59:28,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that there was a separate training.

1495
01:59:28,471 --> 01:59:30,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it, how long is the training?

1496
01:59:31,254 --> 01:59:32,897
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intense, it's a 40 hour course.

1497
01:59:34,488 --> 01:59:41,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And so these companies, they'll all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?

1498
01:59:41,473 --> 01:59:41,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1499
01:59:42,414 --> 01:59:48,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only certain providers can give it because this was governed under the Department of Justice.

1500
01:59:49,418 --> 01:59:55,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Medford can't just offer their own training and say, okay, you're retail endorsed.

1501
01:59:55,663 --> 02:00:01,027
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be through one of the state providers because the Department of Justice is still overseeing it.

1502
02:00:01,787 --> 02:00:02,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1503
02:00:02,527 --> 02:00:08,930
[SPEAKER_12]: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.

1504
02:00:09,431 --> 02:00:09,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1505
02:00:09,671 --> 02:00:17,574
[SPEAKER_12]: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL enforcement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.

1506
02:00:17,994 --> 02:00:18,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1507
02:00:33,894 --> 02:00:38,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Item five, recommendation to approve Rick revised field trip policy, Mr. Superintendent.

1508
02:00:38,918 --> 02:00:44,562
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.

1509
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:54,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

1510
02:00:55,900 --> 02:01:06,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the Committee of the Whole meeting on November 13th, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson gave an overview of the draft of the field trip policy.

1511
02:01:08,588 --> 02:01:22,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It is important to note, I want to give credit where credit is due, that the substantive part of this policy really was developed by Tony Vento, Director of Health Services, and Gail Trainor, Assistant Principal at the high school.

1512
02:01:23,376 --> 02:01:35,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So Beverly, Tony, Gail, and I reviewed this in light of the comments that the committee had on the 13th, and we made the following revisions.

1513
02:01:35,346 --> 02:01:38,969
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are five revisions that I will go over.

1514
02:01:39,509 --> 02:01:44,253
[SPEAKER_07]: The first revision is that we added an accessibility statement.

1515
02:01:44,873 --> 02:01:52,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look on page one of the document, the bottom of page one, in bold print, we added the following.

1516
02:01:53,297 --> 02:01:59,560
[SPEAKER_07]: The Met for Public Schools is committed to ensuring that district field trips are accessible to all students.

1517
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:10,824
[SPEAKER_07]: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth in both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, also known as ADA, of 1990.

1518
02:02:12,465 --> 02:02:14,966
[SPEAKER_07]: So we addressed that concern with that statement.

1519
02:02:17,047 --> 02:02:24,810
[SPEAKER_07]: The second concern that we addressed has to do with the definition of a chaperone.

1520
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:32,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And a chaperone includes any adult who is vested or non-vested with monitoring student safety.

1521
02:02:32,473 --> 02:02:34,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look on page two of your document,

1522
02:02:37,407 --> 02:02:41,192
[SPEAKER_07]: The second half of the page, next to where it says chaperones, I will read that.

1523
02:02:41,772 --> 02:02:43,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So the wording now is the following.

1524
02:02:44,015 --> 02:02:57,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Chaperone is any employee of the Medford Public Schools or parent slash guardian or any adult that attends a trip and is vested or non-vested with the responsibility of monitoring student safety.

1525
02:02:58,737 --> 02:03:07,573
[SPEAKER_07]: does not say a criminal offender record information or a quarry check of all chaperones must be on file in the superintendent's office at least seven days prior to the date of the trip.

1526
02:03:13,106 --> 02:03:23,075
[SPEAKER_07]: The third concern has to do with in emergency situations, the school committee will be added to the list of entities that will be notified.

1527
02:03:23,476 --> 02:03:33,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look on page 3 of the document, under letter J, Roman numeral 3, lowercase Roman numeral 3,

1528
02:03:34,659 --> 02:03:37,240
[SPEAKER_07]: you will see that members of the school committee have added.

1529
02:03:37,601 --> 02:04:00,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll read all of J. Should an emergency situation occur, the sponsoring faculty member is responsible for notifying to the best of their ability by telephone, text, or email as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the emergency situation occurs, the following individuals, the superintendent, headmaster, and principal.

1530
02:04:01,873 --> 02:04:07,357
[SPEAKER_07]: the parent slash guardian of record, and again, number three, members of the school committee.

1531
02:04:08,898 --> 02:04:12,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So we believe that addresses that third concern.

1532
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:15,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Going on to the fourth concern.

1533
02:04:16,702 --> 02:04:19,624
[SPEAKER_07]: So the fourth concern has to do with the term counseling services.

1534
02:04:20,024 --> 02:04:22,506
[SPEAKER_07]: We've broadened that to support services.

1535
02:04:22,926 --> 02:04:25,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look in the document on page five,

1536
02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:30,891
[SPEAKER_07]: On page 5, you have section 4 approval documentation.

1537
02:04:31,012 --> 02:04:44,677
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go down to letter D, again on page 5, letter D, it says the cost per student, if applicable, including the provision for nursing or support services.

1538
02:04:44,697 --> 02:04:49,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, we change counseling to support services if necessary, as well as travel insurance.

1539
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So we believe that addresses that concern.

1540
02:04:54,557 --> 02:05:09,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lastly, the fifth concern that was expressed on the night of the 13th has to do with creating an affirmation statement that all field trip related forms will be posted to the school's website.

1541
02:05:10,244 --> 02:05:13,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look on page 9 of the document, it's the very last item.

1542
02:05:14,406 --> 02:05:21,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a letter D. And it now says all field trip related forms will be posted to the district website.

1543
02:05:23,377 --> 02:05:25,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I am happy to take any questions.

1544
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:26,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1545
02:05:26,318 --> 02:05:26,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

1546
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:28,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Bernadette.

1547
02:05:29,019 --> 02:05:29,519
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

1548
02:05:29,539 --> 02:05:36,422
[SPEAKER_17]: So of the corrections and changes that you've made, I've noted that all the ones that I particularly had brought up, you've taken care of.

1549
02:05:36,942 --> 02:05:45,965
[SPEAKER_17]: That, of course, now being said, is my eyes lit on another line here, which I think we need to amend.

1550
02:05:46,305 --> 02:05:47,966
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you give me a second to find it.

1551
02:05:47,986 --> 02:05:48,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

1552
02:05:49,486 --> 02:05:59,350
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to do with the notification for approval or disapproval of the field trip and it is on page 4, section 3B.

1553
02:06:00,051 --> 02:06:10,795
[SPEAKER_17]: It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford School Committee six months prior to the trip.

1554
02:06:12,062 --> 02:06:14,605
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.

1555
02:06:15,125 --> 02:06:22,993
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.

1556
02:06:23,413 --> 02:06:33,383
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.

1557
02:06:34,434 --> 02:06:44,103
[SPEAKER_17]: But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.

1558
02:06:44,764 --> 02:06:47,726
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had kids go to the Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.

1559
02:06:48,187 --> 02:06:50,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Those things, there was no time to give six months.

1560
02:06:51,049 --> 02:06:54,973
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.

1561
02:06:55,313 --> 02:06:57,115
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we need a sentence which say,

1562
02:06:59,677 --> 02:07:11,685
[SPEAKER_17]: For other field trips, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.

1563
02:07:13,166 --> 02:07:13,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Using discretion.

1564
02:07:14,687 --> 02:07:17,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Using as timely, I mean, it depends on the time frame.

1565
02:07:17,809 --> 02:07:20,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Prior discretion to the trip.

1566
02:07:20,651 --> 02:07:22,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, prior to the trip.

1567
02:07:22,192 --> 02:07:23,733
[SPEAKER_17]: But I mean, it has to be reasonable.

1568
02:07:23,753 --> 02:07:25,434
[SPEAKER_17]: We really don't like the last minute ones.

1569
02:07:25,815 --> 02:07:29,037
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.

1570
02:07:29,697 --> 02:07:32,460
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.

1571
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,382
[SPEAKER_09]: About prior payment for the trip.

1572
02:07:35,042 --> 02:07:35,783
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have to.

1573
02:07:35,803 --> 02:07:39,487
[SPEAKER_12]: That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.

1574
02:07:40,047 --> 02:07:42,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but you'd come before you do the deposit.

1575
02:07:47,342 --> 02:08:03,230
[SPEAKER_08]: The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet

1576
02:08:04,676 --> 02:08:06,477
[SPEAKER_17]: until after the deadline.

1577
02:08:06,597 --> 02:08:12,680
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting.

1578
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:13,060
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1579
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:14,740
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's covered in that.

1580
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:19,282
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.

1581
02:08:19,903 --> 02:08:20,223
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1582
02:08:20,243 --> 02:08:20,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Out of country.

1583
02:08:21,283 --> 02:08:21,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Travel.

1584
02:08:21,944 --> 02:08:23,824
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the second sentence need to say,

1585
02:08:26,606 --> 02:08:35,552
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just trying to think, other trips involving overnight travel must be approved by the school committee.

1586
02:08:38,163 --> 02:08:39,564
[SPEAKER_17]: within an appropriate time frame.

1587
02:08:39,764 --> 02:08:47,026
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're going to need to leave it a little bit unclear, unless someone else has a better wording.

1588
02:08:47,426 --> 02:08:50,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I had a question.

1589
02:08:50,327 --> 02:08:58,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the wording is already in here, it seems like, under E. I wouldn't distinguish between out of country or in.

1590
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:03,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Just pride of payment means, well, they book it, they have to get approval from us.

1591
02:09:05,219 --> 02:09:13,569
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if there's an extreme emergency, or it comes up really short notice, like the bulls came up very short notice, then that's different.

1592
02:09:14,089 --> 02:09:15,811
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's addressed, like, at a need.

1593
02:09:16,072 --> 02:09:18,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So prior to payment.

1594
02:09:18,975 --> 02:09:19,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior to payment.

1595
02:09:19,776 --> 02:09:21,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Drop at six months.

1596
02:09:27,462 --> 02:09:35,732
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're saying all school-sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford school committee prior to payment.

1597
02:09:35,812 --> 02:09:37,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Prior to payment.

1598
02:09:37,475 --> 02:09:37,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1599
02:09:39,235 --> 02:09:40,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I will add that, change that.

1600
02:09:41,437 --> 02:09:46,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other suggestions at this point, Paulette?

1601
02:09:47,043 --> 02:09:47,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope, that's good.

1602
02:09:47,844 --> 02:09:48,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to approve.

1603
02:09:48,565 --> 02:09:49,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

1604
02:09:49,326 --> 02:09:50,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had one note too.

1605
02:09:50,968 --> 02:09:52,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1606
02:09:52,489 --> 02:09:56,173
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting.

1607
02:09:59,219 --> 02:10:09,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students.

1608
02:10:09,745 --> 02:10:22,013
[SPEAKER_05]: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both Section 504, Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting.

1609
02:10:23,313 --> 02:10:24,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it does.

1610
02:10:24,074 --> 02:10:26,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's very appropriate.

1611
02:10:26,754 --> 02:10:29,335
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I will say is that I did do research.

1612
02:10:29,515 --> 02:10:34,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at a lot of other district policy statements.

1613
02:10:34,516 --> 02:10:38,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at a lot of federal law.

1614
02:10:39,298 --> 02:10:43,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought this encompassed it in a broad way, in a succinct way.

1615
02:10:44,299 --> 02:10:46,880
[SPEAKER_07]: There are volumes and volumes of information.

1616
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:48,500
[SPEAKER_07]: There's obviously lots of case law.

1617
02:10:49,121 --> 02:10:50,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to be succinct.

1618
02:10:50,821 --> 02:10:59,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm certainly, you know, willing to, you know, be open, but I did research on it.

1619
02:10:59,864 --> 02:11:09,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to comment that I hope that that does meet that need, and thank you for adding that in, as well as making the changes I brought forward.

1620
02:11:09,706 --> 02:11:18,509
[SPEAKER_05]: The only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet, and I wanted to, you know,

1621
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:31,359
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that it's on the online, so it goes from one person, gets signed off by the nurses, then goes to the administration, and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic format.

1622
02:11:31,639 --> 02:11:34,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to see and approve that form.

1623
02:11:34,922 --> 02:11:43,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses, I'd like to see that as well.

1624
02:11:43,469 --> 02:11:45,170
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's here all in one shot.

1625
02:11:45,571 --> 02:11:48,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So if parents ever want to see what's the policy,

1626
02:11:48,613 --> 02:11:50,115
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the sample forms.

1627
02:11:50,155 --> 02:11:52,497
[SPEAKER_05]: They have everything right here part of this packet.

1628
02:11:53,018 --> 02:12:02,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those intact because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.

1629
02:12:02,708 --> 02:12:03,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask a question?

1630
02:12:04,369 --> 02:12:06,711
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have forms.

1631
02:12:07,772 --> 02:12:09,513
[SPEAKER_07]: There's probably 12, maybe.

1632
02:12:09,533 --> 02:12:10,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are about 12 forms.

1633
02:12:11,254 --> 02:12:13,216
[SPEAKER_07]: They are still in development.

1634
02:12:13,336 --> 02:12:16,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that, again, Tony Ventum and Gail Trainor have been working on them.

1635
02:12:17,059 --> 02:12:18,960
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very close to being finalized.

1636
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:20,661
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not just one or two.

1637
02:12:20,962 --> 02:12:29,268
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of forms, and we're trying to make them so that they're visually easy to understand, yet substantive at the same time.

1638
02:12:29,656 --> 02:12:32,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm asking to table this until we have the complete amendment.

1639
02:12:32,718 --> 02:12:34,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've asked for an amendment as well.

1640
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:35,861
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you bring back the amendment.

1641
02:12:37,242 --> 02:12:37,902
[SPEAKER_17]: May I ask one question?

1642
02:12:37,922 --> 02:12:39,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have the samples ready?

1643
02:12:39,403 --> 02:12:44,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?

1644
02:12:44,747 --> 02:12:46,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it going to hold anything up in terms of?

1645
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:48,670
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an amendment.

1646
02:12:48,851 --> 02:12:49,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1647
02:12:50,753 --> 02:12:52,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's going to hold anything up.

1648
02:12:52,074 --> 02:12:54,576
[SPEAKER_12]: You know the basic premise of the report.

1649
02:12:54,596 --> 02:12:55,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, okay.

1650
02:12:55,296 --> 02:13:00,259
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we come back.

1651
02:13:00,279 --> 02:13:00,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1652
02:13:00,419 --> 02:13:04,742
[SPEAKER_09]: So you want a motion to approve subject to the amendment that we just drafted?

1653
02:13:05,602 --> 02:13:07,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Erin, yes.

1654
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:08,664
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd second.

1655
02:13:08,704 --> 02:13:16,929
[SPEAKER_17]: No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification, because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.

1656
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:19,311
[SPEAKER_17]: I just asked whether there was any problem with that.

1657
02:13:19,625 --> 02:13:24,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.

1658
02:13:24,588 --> 02:13:29,451
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.

1659
02:13:29,511 --> 02:13:34,274
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.

1660
02:13:35,234 --> 02:13:41,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, and that we provide the forms at the earliest possible time in January.

1661
02:13:41,518 --> 02:13:45,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor, I would second the field trip policy.

1662
02:13:46,147 --> 02:13:51,171
[SPEAKER_20]: We accept it tonight with inclusion of amendments and earlier at the latest date.

1663
02:13:52,112 --> 02:13:52,492
[SPEAKER_20]: Forms.

1664
02:13:52,832 --> 02:13:53,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Forms, yes.

1665
02:13:54,654 --> 02:13:57,235
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.

1666
02:13:57,256 --> 02:13:58,677
[SPEAKER_05]: At least we have a policy in place.

1667
02:13:59,477 --> 02:13:59,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1668
02:13:59,717 --> 02:14:01,319
[SPEAKER_05]: The forms need to be approved.

1669
02:14:01,399 --> 02:14:02,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I want them district wide.

1670
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:09,285
[SPEAKER_05]: There's specific things, so it's hard to approve something based on without having everything at one point.

1671
02:14:10,045 --> 02:14:13,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like everything is in here that we need in here, but I

1672
02:14:16,688 --> 02:14:20,210
[SPEAKER_05]: How long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented?

1673
02:14:20,230 --> 02:14:21,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have a lot of meetings coming up.

1674
02:14:22,291 --> 02:14:27,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they have to be K-12 forms.

1675
02:14:27,894 --> 02:14:28,954
[SPEAKER_07]: They are created.

1676
02:14:29,194 --> 02:14:31,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they might need a little bit more tweaking.

1677
02:14:31,335 --> 02:14:32,616
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been working on that.

1678
02:14:32,736 --> 02:14:35,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps Beverly has something to add to that.

1679
02:14:36,398 --> 02:14:37,579
[SPEAKER_02]: The forms were done.

1680
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:38,899
[SPEAKER_02]: They just aren't organized.

1681
02:14:38,959 --> 02:14:44,562
[SPEAKER_02]: When we got the forms, they were so voluminous that they were just very hard for people to deal with.

1682
02:14:44,983 --> 02:14:46,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know, Tony, we've been working at it.

1683
02:14:47,224 --> 02:14:49,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It will take more time to get it.

1684
02:14:49,926 --> 02:14:52,367
[SPEAKER_02]: The form should not change anything in the policy.

1685
02:14:53,468 --> 02:15:00,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm a little concerned about dragging this out because people are looking for guidance, the administration, the principals.

1686
02:15:00,292 --> 02:15:02,073
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a meeting tomorrow with principals.

1687
02:15:02,093 --> 02:15:06,695
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to be able to say we have a policy guide so that we don't keep going on.

1688
02:15:07,356 --> 02:15:10,077
[SPEAKER_02]: The forms, again, it's an organizational piece.

1689
02:15:12,108 --> 02:15:16,211
[SPEAKER_02]: make them customer friendly, and it should not really be anything.

1690
02:15:16,231 --> 02:15:17,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information.

1691
02:15:17,231 --> 02:15:18,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, point of information.

1692
02:15:18,132 --> 02:15:18,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Over time as well.

1693
02:15:19,193 --> 02:15:21,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is scary, point of information.

1694
02:15:21,974 --> 02:15:22,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1695
02:15:22,174 --> 02:15:25,777
[SPEAKER_20]: Nelson, can we have those forms by the 18th to satisfy the needs of this board?

1696
02:15:27,018 --> 02:15:27,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

1697
02:15:27,718 --> 02:15:34,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony, you said we've been revising, we've been working on it, we just don't have it perfect, okay?

1698
02:15:35,063 --> 02:15:38,125
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of, there are medical forms, okay, it's kind of,

1699
02:15:39,116 --> 02:15:40,176
[SPEAKER_02]: a cascading effect.

1700
02:15:40,196 --> 02:15:43,077
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the preliminary forms that everybody's going to have to do.

1701
02:15:43,577 --> 02:15:48,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what comes into play is another set of forms for children that have medical issues.

1702
02:15:49,238 --> 02:15:55,599
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to make it so that people understand they don't have to fill out 20 forms when it doesn't apply.

1703
02:15:56,079 --> 02:16:03,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we're struggling with now, trying to make this concise, make it applicable to the particular trip.

1704
02:16:03,860 --> 02:16:07,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want, because we know what happens when you put a whole bunch of papers out

1705
02:16:07,779 --> 02:16:09,461
[SPEAKER_02]: People just look at it and say, I can't do this.

1706
02:16:09,702 --> 02:16:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too much.

1707
02:16:10,783 --> 02:16:12,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to make it customer-friendly.

1708
02:16:13,306 --> 02:16:17,372
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, the policy, the form should really not

1709
02:16:17,898 --> 02:16:21,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can get them to you, but I'd like to move forward with this if we could.

1710
02:16:22,382 --> 02:16:23,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto, follow up on this?

1711
02:16:23,863 --> 02:16:24,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

1712
02:16:25,424 --> 02:16:30,228
[SPEAKER_05]: So the form I'm looking at is the application to go on the field trip.

1713
02:16:30,508 --> 02:16:43,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do, but even the application form, like, OK, I want to take my second grade class to apple picking at, you know,

1714
02:16:44,147 --> 02:16:45,528
[SPEAKER_05]: small like farms.

1715
02:16:46,109 --> 02:16:47,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm going to go online.

1716
02:16:47,891 --> 02:16:49,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to fill this out.

1717
02:16:49,572 --> 02:16:56,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to go to the nurse and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval.

1718
02:16:57,990 --> 02:16:59,270
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the type of form I want.

1719
02:16:59,290 --> 02:16:59,971
[SPEAKER_05]: From the teacher.

1720
02:17:00,271 --> 02:17:00,971
[SPEAKER_05]: From everyone.

1721
02:17:01,031 --> 02:17:01,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want it tracked.

1722
02:17:02,111 --> 02:17:06,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went.

1723
02:17:07,112 --> 02:17:12,874
[SPEAKER_05]: This grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't.

1724
02:17:12,994 --> 02:17:16,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe as a district, we might want to help them.

1725
02:17:16,695 --> 02:17:18,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I want that data.

1726
02:17:18,656 --> 02:17:23,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point.

1727
02:17:23,117 --> 02:17:26,138
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want, when you roll this out, hey, here's our new thing.

1728
02:17:26,398 --> 02:17:27,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is how you apply.

1729
02:17:28,258 --> 02:17:29,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to go with it.

1730
02:17:29,899 --> 02:17:31,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the form that starts the process.

1731
02:17:32,481 --> 02:17:37,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, too, Erin, you may have mentioned last time at the meeting a checklist of things.

1732
02:17:37,643 --> 02:17:40,465
[SPEAKER_02]: The checklist, I think we added one thing to the checklist.

1733
02:17:40,505 --> 02:17:41,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the checklist.

1734
02:17:42,226 --> 02:17:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the preliminary form.

1735
02:17:44,167 --> 02:17:51,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that we really want to make everything else, and it can be a lot of forms, depending upon the youngsters who are going on the trip.

1736
02:17:52,495 --> 02:17:56,418
[SPEAKER_02]: something that people aren't going to look at and say, I'm not going to go on the trip because I don't want to fill out the forms.

1737
02:17:56,878 --> 02:17:59,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the last thing we want to do on that.

1738
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:05,665
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do the checklist and we can do the preliminary application.

1739
02:18:06,229 --> 02:18:28,178
[SPEAKER_08]: a clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily

1740
02:18:29,298 --> 02:18:33,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?

1741
02:18:33,441 --> 02:18:37,684
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just for teachers to fill out an application to take the class.

1742
02:18:37,784 --> 02:18:39,305
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, that's where the clarification is.

1743
02:18:39,466 --> 02:18:41,627
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not talking about the parent filling it out.

1744
02:18:41,707 --> 02:18:45,250
[SPEAKER_08]: You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.

1745
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:49,473
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a parent permission form that will be part of the package.

1746
02:18:49,873 --> 02:18:54,537
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think at this point, we're talking about what's the checklist.

1747
02:18:54,557 --> 02:18:57,059
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this has stemmed from the fact

1748
02:18:57,819 --> 02:19:06,163
[SPEAKER_02]: that teachers would begin to plan trips, begin to fundraise, begin to get kids excited without the principal knowing.

1749
02:19:06,423 --> 02:19:09,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there were all kinds of repercussions after the fact.

1750
02:19:09,325 --> 02:19:16,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was really initially an attempt to make sure that before people start the process, they know what the process has to be.

1751
02:19:16,848 --> 02:19:19,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was where this was originated from.

1752
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:24,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's two separate ones.

1753
02:19:24,241 --> 02:19:29,728
[SPEAKER_09]: One's a motion to accept the policy with the one amendment that was made a little earlier.

1754
02:19:30,269 --> 02:19:34,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Erin asked that the whole policy not be accepted until we have the forms.

1755
02:19:35,435 --> 02:19:38,199
[SPEAKER_09]: She's now specified it's the start form.

1756
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:40,321
[SPEAKER_09]: But to me, the policy...

1757
02:19:41,345 --> 02:19:46,626
[SPEAKER_09]: dictates and the forms can come and they can be changed as things change in life.

1758
02:19:47,247 --> 02:19:56,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that we approve the policy so that we can get it out to the principals, especially at your meeting tomorrow, and then we can get the forms at our next meeting.

1759
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:03,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get those two forms to you next time, but we won't have the opportunity to meet with the principals again until January.

1760
02:20:03,931 --> 02:20:05,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we had this to them tomorrow, it would be helpful.

1761
02:20:06,721 --> 02:20:06,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1762
02:20:06,881 --> 02:20:07,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz?

1763
02:20:08,022 --> 02:20:11,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I had a similar question about the forms.

1764
02:20:11,323 --> 02:20:22,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to know, are the forms going to be available to the teachers with the Google Doc documents, where they can go in and add their information directly on Google and then move it along?

1765
02:20:22,489 --> 02:20:24,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think that was discussed at the last meeting.

1766
02:20:25,591 --> 02:20:32,816
[SPEAKER_06]: At the committee of the whole about the field trip, there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization.

1767
02:20:33,316 --> 02:20:41,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was... I don't... They spoke about the language they were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable.

1768
02:20:41,963 --> 02:20:42,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that possible?

1769
02:20:43,003 --> 02:20:46,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the chairperson said, could you reach out to me with language?

1770
02:20:46,146 --> 02:20:47,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I could help you with language.

1771
02:20:47,987 --> 02:20:48,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1772
02:20:48,248 --> 02:20:58,621
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically, as Bernadette said, she did the research, but we also worked with Kathy Medaglia, who looked at this for me and thought that this would be something that would cover all of those instances.

1773
02:20:58,681 --> 02:21:00,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we feel that it does.

1774
02:21:02,295 --> 02:21:03,195
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor.

1775
02:21:03,235 --> 02:21:03,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1776
02:21:03,416 --> 02:21:03,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloot.

1777
02:21:04,096 --> 02:21:09,659
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're going to kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.

1778
02:21:10,459 --> 02:21:11,920
[SPEAKER_17]: And you just said something.

1779
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:22,826
[SPEAKER_17]: You said that what happened in the past is that teachers started advertising to the kids that they were going to go on this, and they got everybody all excited, and they might even start raising money.

1780
02:21:23,686 --> 02:21:26,088
[SPEAKER_17]: And that has nothing to do with payment.

1781
02:21:27,268 --> 02:21:40,894
[SPEAKER_17]: So, if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.

1782
02:21:41,094 --> 02:21:44,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Payment is not the word that you want there.

1783
02:21:44,515 --> 02:21:46,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're dealing with which, come on back.

1784
02:21:46,716 --> 02:21:50,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is page four, number three.

1785
02:21:54,039 --> 02:21:56,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's, yes, right here.

1786
02:21:57,655 --> 02:22:04,679
[SPEAKER_02]: All school-sponsored trips that involve overnight, out-of-state travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent.

1787
02:22:04,699 --> 02:22:07,220
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to figure out if people are even interested in going.

1788
02:22:09,155 --> 02:22:10,736
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to pull their students.

1789
02:22:10,836 --> 02:22:13,818
[SPEAKER_09]: If no one wants to go, they're not going to come to us and ask for approval.

1790
02:22:13,898 --> 02:22:16,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what they are.

1791
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:17,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

1792
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:24,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you're saying is that it should not be prior to payment, that we need to take that out.

1793
02:22:24,404 --> 02:22:27,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Moments ago, you suggested that we add that in prior to payment.

1794
02:22:27,906 --> 02:22:28,747
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't suggest payment.

1795
02:22:28,767 --> 02:22:29,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone else did.

1796
02:22:29,347 --> 02:22:29,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

1797
02:22:29,988 --> 02:22:30,268
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1798
02:22:30,328 --> 02:22:34,530
[SPEAKER_17]: And I suggested that what we were doing was saying that a teacher was going

1799
02:22:36,352 --> 02:22:39,117
[SPEAKER_17]: out of the country, the school committee wanted six months notice.

1800
02:22:39,657 --> 02:22:49,794
[SPEAKER_17]: I think if there's an overnight trip within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.

1801
02:22:50,498 --> 02:23:06,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this time frame, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.

1802
02:23:07,845 --> 02:23:09,826
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's how I would line it out.

1803
02:23:09,886 --> 02:23:13,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, because payment I think is, I think payment is arbitrary.

1804
02:23:13,467 --> 02:23:15,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some trips that we're not going to require payment.

1805
02:23:15,708 --> 02:23:17,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the out of overnight trips.

1806
02:23:20,651 --> 02:23:23,392
[SPEAKER_17]: come with this opportunity to go to New York.

1807
02:23:23,672 --> 02:23:25,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was being funded by someone else.

1808
02:23:25,733 --> 02:23:26,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, exactly.

1809
02:23:26,753 --> 02:23:37,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe in a timely way, overnight trips, other overnight trips must be approved in a timely way because we do have things that happen very quickly like that New York trip.

1810
02:23:37,677 --> 02:23:39,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Others we have several months doing.

1811
02:23:39,618 --> 02:23:43,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we just put it in a timely way and we leave it kind of discretionary.

1812
02:23:45,134 --> 02:23:51,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.

1813
02:23:51,718 --> 02:24:02,044
[SPEAKER_12]: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.

1814
02:24:02,064 --> 02:24:04,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.

1815
02:24:04,305 --> 02:24:09,909
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.

1816
02:24:10,589 --> 02:24:17,713
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip and the kids had already gone?

1817
02:24:17,853 --> 02:24:19,414
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a new administrator.

1818
02:24:19,434 --> 02:24:22,255
[SPEAKER_12]: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.

1819
02:24:22,896 --> 02:24:27,458
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's eight years ago.

1820
02:24:27,498 --> 02:24:28,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me just ask the committee.

1821
02:24:29,179 --> 02:24:38,404
[SPEAKER_17]: If we're talking about foreign trips out of the country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?

1822
02:24:38,685 --> 02:24:39,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Ninety days.

1823
02:24:41,042 --> 02:24:41,402
[SPEAKER_17]: 90 days.

1824
02:24:41,722 --> 02:24:42,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Here it said six months.

1825
02:24:43,783 --> 02:24:45,824
[SPEAKER_17]: We usually bring those to you pretty early.

1826
02:24:45,844 --> 02:24:50,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something.

1827
02:24:58,630 --> 02:25:10,179
[SPEAKER_08]: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or two months or seven months, they don't even bring it to you.

1828
02:25:10,239 --> 02:25:14,802
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we kept it six months unless there are extenuating circumstances?

1829
02:25:14,962 --> 02:25:15,663
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

1830
02:25:15,683 --> 02:25:17,064
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1831
02:25:17,084 --> 02:25:20,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Discretionary circumstances.

1832
02:25:20,166 --> 02:25:22,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Six months unless there are extenuating circumstances.

1833
02:25:24,369 --> 02:25:26,391
[SPEAKER_02]: That leaves some flexibility.

1834
02:25:26,431 --> 02:25:33,877
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think you should do three months because I think... Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, okay?

1835
02:25:34,078 --> 02:25:41,664
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're saying just a general blanket and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months' time.

1836
02:25:42,405 --> 02:25:50,352
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the overnight in domestic trips, I thought we said would be in a timely way because those are going to...

1837
02:25:50,947 --> 02:25:51,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's reasonable.

1838
02:25:51,467 --> 02:25:53,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's reasonable for the trips to pop up quickly or they may be longer.

1839
02:25:54,248 --> 02:25:55,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those would be in a timely way.

1840
02:25:55,909 --> 02:25:59,670
[SPEAKER_02]: The six months is the international.

1841
02:25:59,690 --> 02:26:00,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's reasonable.

1842
02:26:00,610 --> 02:26:04,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of those trips are planned a year in advance for the most part.

1843
02:26:04,332 --> 02:26:04,732
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1844
02:26:04,752 --> 02:26:05,532
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

1845
02:26:05,792 --> 02:26:07,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So as amended now.

1846
02:26:07,433 --> 02:26:11,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval of the policy as amended on the floor.

1847
02:26:12,014 --> 02:26:13,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1848
02:26:13,515 --> 02:26:14,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

1849
02:26:21,452 --> 02:26:22,612
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Mrs. Chris?

1850
02:26:22,893 --> 02:26:23,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1851
02:26:23,393 --> 02:26:24,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Mrs. Stone?

1852
02:26:24,993 --> 02:26:25,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1853
02:26:25,113 --> 02:26:25,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Scurry?

1854
02:26:25,713 --> 02:26:25,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1855
02:26:26,614 --> 02:26:27,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Mrs. Vander Kloot?

1856
02:26:27,274 --> 02:26:27,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1857
02:26:27,674 --> 02:26:28,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Burke?

1858
02:26:28,274 --> 02:26:28,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1859
02:26:28,614 --> 02:26:30,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1860
02:26:30,415 --> 02:26:32,916
[SPEAKER_09]: The policy is approved as amended.

1861
02:26:33,016 --> 02:26:33,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1862
02:26:33,936 --> 02:26:36,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1863
02:26:36,257 --> 02:26:38,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Negotiation of legal matters, there are none.

1864
02:26:38,237 --> 02:26:40,438
[SPEAKER_09]: New business?

1865
02:26:41,894 --> 02:26:47,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee extend condolences to the family of Sandra Toomey, who passed away Tuesday.

1866
02:26:47,338 --> 02:26:51,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. Toomey was a dedicated community activist and active in Medford public education.

1867
02:26:51,981 --> 02:26:56,024
[SPEAKER_09]: She is survived by husband, Bill, and son, Thomas, and daughter-in-law, Kathleen.

1868
02:26:56,905 --> 02:27:03,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Also be it further resolved that the Medford School Committee send condolences to the family of Margaret Regan, a long-time teacher at the Swan School.

1869
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:07,032
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could all rise for a moment of silence, please, on the passing of these two.

1870
02:27:09,264 --> 02:27:12,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Citizens.

1871
02:27:18,779 --> 02:27:19,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1872
02:27:23,467 --> 02:27:25,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the motion that this meeting be adjourned?

1873
02:27:25,928 --> 02:27:29,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one very quick announcement.

1874
02:27:29,688 --> 02:27:32,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make one quick announcement.

1875
02:27:33,509 --> 02:27:38,871
[SPEAKER_11]: There are several Medford High School students who created a new educational series.

1876
02:27:39,451 --> 02:27:44,532
[SPEAKER_11]: The name of the series is The Chronicles of Modern Military History.

1877
02:27:46,032 --> 02:27:51,834
[SPEAKER_11]: The shows are being created right here at the Medford Community Media Station.

1878
02:27:53,675 --> 02:28:02,370
[SPEAKER_11]: And the replay of the first episode will be taking place this Wednesday at 7 p.m.

1879
02:28:02,390 --> 02:28:05,915
[SPEAKER_11]: and Saturday, December 9th at 7 p.m.

1880
02:28:07,675 --> 02:28:12,097
[SPEAKER_11]: on Channel 47 Verizon and Channel 3 Comcast.

1881
02:28:12,878 --> 02:28:16,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Next week on December 14th will be episode number two.

1882
02:28:18,781 --> 02:28:33,908
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the students that are involved in this program are writing, editing, they're doing the music, the narrating, and they're coming in after school hours and just working on this on their own.

1883
02:28:35,589 --> 02:28:37,550
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a wonderful episode.

1884
02:28:37,570 --> 02:28:39,050
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been sharing it on Facebook.

1885
02:28:39,491 --> 02:28:52,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna get a message over to Lisa Evangelista to ask her to share the link on the blog if anybody gets a chance to tune in and it's just a great new show that's been created by

1886
02:28:53,035 --> 02:28:57,718
[SPEAKER_11]: several students, a combination of high school and vocational students.

1887
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:00,200
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to give a couple of mentions.

1888
02:29:01,261 --> 02:29:14,929
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been Flood, Matt Adaletto, Justin Garland, Angel Barozo, Ian Agudo, Gavin Bibbins, and Trip Hill, and narrated by Noah Kreatz.

1889
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:21,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So if everybody gets a chance, if they want to tune into the station, it's just a great educational episode.

1890
02:29:22,386 --> 02:29:23,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1891
02:29:25,839 --> 02:29:27,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn.

1892
02:29:28,690 --> 02:29:29,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
