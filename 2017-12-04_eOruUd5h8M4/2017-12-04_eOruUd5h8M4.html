this was the Committee of the Whole of November 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=150.472s">I</a>  don't know, do we need to? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=151.453s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=153.935s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=154.535s">Hold</a>  tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=158.895s">And</a>  present at the meeting were Mayor Burke, Vice Chair Anne Marie Cuno, Arenda Benedetto, Kathy Kreatz, Mia Mastone, Robert Scurry, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=166.097s">Also</a>  attending was Michael Ruggiero and Paul Rousseau, school committee members elect. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=170.398s">Also</a>  present were the following, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Director of Pupil Services Kathleen Medaglio, Director of Curriculum Bernadette Scurry, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=184.142s">uh,</a>

href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=216.409s">Transcript</a>  recorder Miranda Wilson was also in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=220.271s">Um,</a>  the mayor, uh, the, the meeting was called, uh, to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=230.595s">It</a>  was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=234.216s">I</a>  just added that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=235.457s">Superintendent</a>  Dawson made the following remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=238.878s">The</a>  evenings, and by the way, sorry, there was a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=243.379s">It</a>  should be Bernadette Riccadeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=246.32s">So</a>  we addressed the four different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=249.021s">And</a>  the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=254.003s">Director</a>  of administration and finance, Christine Patterson, gave this report, and it's attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=261.825s">uh,</a>  Tucci verified the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=263.867s">There</a>  are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning, um, and in the afternoon there are between 45 to 50 riders daily with each, which is within its capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=273.196s">At</a>  this time there's no need to add another bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=275.699s">Administration</a>  will <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=277.12s">Keep</a>  the committee informed as demand increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=279.643s">The</a>  next item was student concussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=282.865s">We</a>  talked about this at length. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=286.148s">As</a>  part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=291.993s">She</a>  asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=299.66s">She</a>  believes that the Beverly Schools did not have a certified trainer at the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=303.245s">Her</a>  son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth, and nosebleeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=306.249s">Her</a>  concern focused upon safety at away games. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=312.429s">Members</a>  of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=321.491s">Mrs.</a>  Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=329.733s">Concern</a>  was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=335.814s">The</a>  superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIAA regarding this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=341.255s">The</a>  next item under discussion was the field trip policy and administrators Paul DeLiva, Tony Vento, and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=351.962s">CPAC</a>  chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=361.568s">There</a>  was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=371.014s">Among</a>  the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=383.798s">If</a>  we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately $7,500 and would not have made the trip doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=390.106s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=390.266s">McLaughlin</a>  asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=398.37s">The</a>  issue raised several points. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=400.171s">Can</a>  field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=405.573s">Should</a>  field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=409.095s">And</a>  should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=414.577s">After</a>  continued discussion, the policy was tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=416.779s">Administrators</a>  will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=420.623s">The</a>  final issue of the evening was school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=423.285s">Headmaster</a>  Perrella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=430.031s">The</a>  headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=436.237s">Mr.</a>  Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=440.541s">More</a>  will be done going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=442.202s">This</a>  is a work in progress, but it is moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=444.965s">Mr.</a>  Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=448.567s">He</a>  revisited his concerns from last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=451.69s">Administrators</a>  asserted that the changes would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=454.172s">The</a>  school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=457.233s">The</a>  meeting was adjourned at 10.05. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=459.034s">Respectfully</a>  submitted, Paulette Van der Kloot, secretary.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=461.835s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=462.215s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=462.716s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=464.356s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=464.516s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=464.997s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=465.877s">Superintendent</a>  Belson, I just wanted to follow up with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=468.898s">I</a>  was in touch with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=469.919s">Simonides,</a>  and I just wanted to know if something was filed with the MIAA regarding the incident, if you had a chance to file that yet.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=479.765s">Okay,</a>  so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=484.727s">They</a>  strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=489.089s">Simonides.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=490.59s">I've</a>  gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=494.591s">He</a>  claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer, who was on the field at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=501.634s">He</a>  said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=509.398s">As</a>  a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=514.18s">So</a>  I have a lot more to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=515.42s">I</a>  did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=523.243s">But</a>  there is a distinct <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=525.524s">difference</a>  of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=531.188s">So</a>  there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=536.671s">The</a>  feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=543.855s">the</a>  play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=549.557s">So</a>  there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=561.141s">They</a>  gave me the name and showed me the licensure.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=563.851s">Did</a>  you communicate that information to the parent?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=566.972s">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=568.393s">This</a>  is still going back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=569.373s">In</a>  fact, the latest communication was as late as today from Stephen Hershey. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=573.775s">So</a>  I've got a lot more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=576.116s">I</a>  mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=579.877s">So</a>  you got the name, and the person is not certified? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=584.039s">They</a>  are.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=585.759s">I</a>  actually have it on my phone, and I can give it to you afterwards.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=588.741s">Mayor</a>  Brewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=590.867s">I</a>  guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing, um, and a student got hurt, why wasn't our, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=602.017s">I</a>  mean.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=602.518s">According</a>  to Beverly, uh, the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, um, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=615.367s">that</a>  the assistance was done on the sidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=617.688s">They</a>  suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=623.649s">The</a>  question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=626.97s">There</a>  are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=629.371s">And</a>  if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=639.194s">Yeah,</a>  well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=643.779s">And</a>  secondly, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=650.245s">And</a>  so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=657.028s">Yes,</a>  but certainly blood is blood and if... Well, that's an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=666.096s">I</a>  mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the, again, superintendent of Beverly, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=673.843s">because</a>  Mississippi was contacting the Beverly School Committee and others up in Beverly and they are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=683.326s">So</a>  I need a lot more feeling as to what really took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=687.048s">Point</a>  of information, Mayor?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=688.208s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=688.948s">Through</a>  you to the Superintendent, has the Game Officials Committee been contacted to find out who the referee was?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=694.95s">I</a>  asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=698.631s">Also,</a>  have you spoke to the coach?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=701.098s">I</a>  didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=702.759s">Mr.</a>  Maloney.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=703.66s">And</a>  so I'm going to get a follow-up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=705.261s">But</a>  again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=714.068s">And</a>  so I really need to ask a lot of questions.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=716.57s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=716.85s">But</a>  we do have the student who this happened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=721.313s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=721.493s">And</a>  we could have a follow-up with the student.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=723.495s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=723.895s">I</a>  just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=728.338s">I</a>  have two very different reports.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=731.789s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=731.969s">Coño?</a> </p>

    <p>[Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=734.233s">When</a>  you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=749.193s">I</a>  doubt they were filming the JV game. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=751.876s">They</a>  may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.</p>

    <p>[Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=754.679s">Well,</a>  sometimes it depends on the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=757.081s">It</a>  could be someone out there that just had their cell phone and were filming, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=764.068s">Just</a>  to see what type of play. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=765.51s">If</a>  there is something out there, at least we could see what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=773.017s">Especially</a>  when you're up there, I know the first thing is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the player is asked to step off the field.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=785.979s">Let</a>  me, if I can, Mayor, let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey, because I'm going to put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of, you know, the strength of his comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=798.402s">It</a>  wasn't like, I don't think anything happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=800.403s">It</a>  was very, very, you know, direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=803.443s">So</a>  let me read it to you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=805.344s">While</a>  you're getting that up, Mr. Tringali, our student representative.</p>

    <p>[Sebastian Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=812.405s">A</a>  lot of the danger behind concussions is the lack of education that goes with it, and especially on the part of the coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=821.768s">And</a>  if the student does not know to take themselves out of the game, they'll put themselves at risk for a second damage to the brain, which is far worse than the first. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=834.791s">So</a>  possibly, if we're thinking about our own education policy in the future and keeping our own kids safe, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=841.274s">I</a>  think this is a great example to show that we should push for Medford coaches to be <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=851.753s">aware</a>  of concussions in the game.</p>

    <p>[Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=853.494s">Points</a>  of information?</p>

    <p>[Sebastian Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=854.314s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=854.874s">Perry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.794s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.934s">Bonilla?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=856.515s">Just</a>  to address Mr. Trincali's question or discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=861.856s">Actually,</a>  you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=864.137s">The</a>  MIA came out with a concussion rule, a concussion policy mandate probably about, it's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=876.141s">The</a>  ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=880.722s">themselves,</a>  their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it, the parents have to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=894.087s">And</a>  at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=900.57s">The</a>  only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic, because they were the ones that called the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=908.973s">fought</a>  long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also have to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=914.576s">And</a>  just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=931.103s">If</a>  by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor, will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=948.776s">And</a>  let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.181s">I'm</a>  not blaming the coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.821s">I'm</a>  not blaming our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=957.801s">I'm</a>  not blaming anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=959.182s">I'm</a>  just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=985.746s">No,</a>  the superintendent is working with them.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=988.087s">So</a>  I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=998.31s">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=998.77s">I'm</a>  sending you copies of what I have in addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1000.571s">Your</a>  athletic director sent a letter to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1002.491s">I</a>  spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1006.073s">While</a>  some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1010.794s">They</a>  note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1014.337s">Our</a>  trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1019.801s">Beverly</a>  has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1024.665s">Our</a>  coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1028.828s">We</a>  perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1033.951s">our</a>  players from other teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1035.431s">I</a>  would like to find out what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1036.612s">Please</a>  forward me any information you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1039.012s">So</a>  we have an ongoing investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1041.673s">You</a>  know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1046.794s">This</a>  came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1057.536s">We'll</a>  mark it for a report, follow-up report on our agenda?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1060.637s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1062.176s">And</a>  is there a motion to accept this committee of the whole report from November 13th? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1066.139s">Oh,</a>  actually amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1067.299s">I</a>  was not present at this meeting.</p>

    <p>[Announcer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1103.45s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1104.09s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1104.75s">That</a>  paper is tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1106.531s">Committee</a>  of the Whole, Minutes from November 27th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1112.239s">This</a>  was a meeting that we held last week in order to discuss the succession plan for our superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1120.902s">We</a>  had the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1122.183s">Association</a>  of School Committees present. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1124.164s">He</a>  presented quite a brochure to us on strategies that we should use in our deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1131.867s">Ultimately,</a>  the Medford School Committee voted on the following matters in Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1137.569s">that</a>  the MASC, Mass Associated School Committee, will provide a sample brochure to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1143.01s">The</a>  school committee will also explore other search consultants before making a selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1147.671s">The</a>  school committee voted to review internal candidates first. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1150.232s">That</a>  was a seven to zero vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1152.172s">And</a>  the school committee voted to meet again on December 11, 2017 to continue its work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1158.334s">We</a>  also had quite a bit of discussion around a search committee if we ultimately do go outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1163.655s">What</a>  was explained to us is if we do internal candidates, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1167.62s">It</a>  would be school committee interviewing in a public session. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1171.341s">If</a>  from there we go to a full search, a nationwide search, let's say, we would form a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1177.822s">And</a>  the complement of that committee would be set up of three teachers from the different levels of schooling, one administrator, one student, school committee members, suggested was three, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1193.546s">and</a>  also community members being parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1196.588s">And</a>  we also wanted to make sure that we included all subgroups such as special ed and ELL in those check boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1204.011s">So</a>  we're working on an actual application. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1206.372s">For</a>  those out there, we're working on a formal application that people can fill out and submit back to us if they have an interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1212.495s">Also,</a>  I ask that our diversity director be a member of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1216.298s">It</a>  was voted on in seven to zero, so thank you all for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1220.361s">And</a>  we will be meeting next week to discuss this further on December 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1223.924s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, is that up here?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1225.986s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1226.466s">That</a>  is in the high school.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1227.627s">It</a>  will be in the conference room.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1229.749s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept this report and place it on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1232.371s">Motion</a>  to accept the report and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1233.551s">Motion</a>  to accept by Mr. Cuno, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1236.654s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1237.815s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1238.315s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1239.196s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1241.075s">Community</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1242.536s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1242.796s">Retta</a>  Smith regarding the school breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1245.958s">Mia,</a>  did you want to say a few words or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1248.139s">Go</a>  Retta. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1249.06s">Go</a>  Retta. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1249.68s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1252.339s">You've</a>  been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1256.32s">So</a>  on our desk is a report on the 2017 breakfast participation rates as well as some literature.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1264.763s">Good</a>  evening everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1266.524s">So</a>  I was asked to present some information on the school breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1271.125s">So</a>  I am a registered dietitian and I am the nutritionist for the food services department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1276.607s">for</a>  Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1278.509s">Just</a>  some general information, we offer breakfast at all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1282.852s">Most</a>  of them, it's traditional style offered before school begins in the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1289.317s">Three</a>  of them offer breakfast free of charge for any student interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1294.381s">One</a>  of those three has breakfast not in the cafeteria before school, but in the classroom after the bell, and it counts as learning time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1303.52s">So</a>  if you look at the sheet that has the breakfast participation rates, if you look at the last column, the percent ADP, so the percentage of average daily participation, it ranges from 0% to 86 almost percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1315.976s">So</a>  this really shows the <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1321.443s">drastic</a>  variance in participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1324.864s">So</a>  the Columbus, the McGlynn Elementary, and Middle School all are offering universally free breakfasts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1332.228s">So</a>  if you take a look at just those three using the October 2017 data, the McGlynn Elementary School had almost 29% participation, the Middle School was almost 21, and the Columbus was at about 86. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1348.274s">So</a>  the Columbus is the school that offers breakfast in the classroom for everyone, so you can see the difference that that really makes in the participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1356.48s">And</a>  this is not something that is unique to our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1360.583s">The</a>  EOS Foundation, which is a non-profit organization that really promotes school breakfast being offered after the bell, they have seen this <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1369.073s">statewide</a>  that schools offering free breakfasts in a traditional setting before the bell experience participation rates far lower than those who offer it in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1380.72s">Could</a>  you explain why the Columbus offers it after the Valley versus the others before? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1386.303s">So</a>  that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1387.303s">The</a>  McGlynn Middle School, this is its first year instituting the universal, so I don't know what the decision was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1394.466s">The</a>  elementary school, from what I'm told a few years ago, I think this was before I started working here, there was a rodent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1401.67s">They</a>  originally started off doing a breakfast in the class model. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1405.39s">And</a>  there was a Ronan issue that was attributed to the breakfast program, so they stopped.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1409.935s">So</a>  Mr. Superintendent, are the principals deciding whether it's before or after the bell?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1414.68s">Pretty</a>  much, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1415.401s">Pretty</a>  much? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1416.041s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1417.183s">Can</a>  we ask them to all re-evaluate?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1419.185s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1421.715s">Would</a>  that be a recommendation you'd make? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1424.198s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1424.478s">I</a>  just wanted to have you consider this information and questions of universal breakfast going forward.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1430.024s">There's</a>  probably another factor, too, in terms of busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1432.727s">The</a>  more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive and take it before the actual school starts.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1440.715s">Oh,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1441.176s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1441.516s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1441.837s">That</a>  has a big impact in participation as well.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1444.104s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1445.185s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1446.246s">Could</a>  you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1450.609s">Do</a>  you know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1451.269s">So</a>  the free and reduced eligibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1453.011s">Yeah,</a>  whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1460.516s">Does</a>  every student sign have a form returned? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1464.839s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1465.6s">And</a>  how do we get, like, two parents that <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1471.348s">don't</a>  know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1478.61s">Because</a>  that would change a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1481.631s">And</a>  do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1489.593s">Their</a>  free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1495.175s">And</a>  I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any kids with learning forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1511.182s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1512.142s">So</a>  that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost a hundred percent return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1523.366s">So</a>  that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1531.547s">processes,</a>  so I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1545.497s">They</a>  either sign off yes or they sign off no. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1549.1s">I</a>  know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1555.35s">especially</a>  non-English families. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1558.534s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1559.856s">Knowing</a>  that there are other things that this qualifies them for is so important to make sure they get food.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1565.885s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1566.145s">Patterson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1567.188s">Yes,</a>  I'd like to comment on that, that we have engaged and made sure that we have the free and reduced applications in multiple languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1575.415s">They</a>  are returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1576.876s">There</a>  is not a requirement for them to be returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1579.678s">That's</a>  not a forced item. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1581.459s">However,</a>  we are capturing more free and reduced qualifications because they are incorporated within the portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1589.206s">So</a>  we automatically draw those down. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1591.325s">So</a>  it's not necessary that we receive an actual form back from every household. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1595.706s">We</a>  are gathering those and getting those counts regardless through the portals that have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1601.868s">That's</a>  why we've encouraged additional services and we've had outreach with our parent information center. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1608.01s">So</a>  we are providing much more detailed information and encouraging families to participate in these other systems that will provide them additional resources and then also <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1620.225s">automatically</a>  qualify them for free or reduced.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1624.147s">And</a>  my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1629.75s">They</a>  get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1638.974s">And</a>  it's so important to feed our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1641.235s">And</a>  it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1647.378s">I'm</a>  not applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1649.431s">you</a>  know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper, and like, it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1664.952s">That's</a>  just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1666.232s">I</a>  think I made it maybe last year as well.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1669.213s">So</a>  let me just make one clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1671.154s">This</a>  is the breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1672.754s">This</a>  is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1676.655s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1677.175s">You</a>  know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1682.097s">So</a>  we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1690.379s">breakfast</a>  program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1695.983s">It's</a>  one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1702.607s">But</a>  I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1707.33s">If</a>  just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1714.594s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1715.114s">So,</a>  we'll give you that report.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1718.675s">motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1719.335s">Motion</a>  to have that report presented to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1722.417s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1723.157s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1724.058s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1724.338s">Vandevoort.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1726.039s">I</a>  noticed that the Tufts Alternative School has a very low participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1730.621s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1730.761s">And</a>  this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1737.705s">Do</a>  you have any insight into that number?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1739.505s">Yeah,</a>  I was really surprised by that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1741.887s">So</a>  we contacted Mr. Toomey over there and he said that because they're allowed to come in so much later <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1748.85s">that</a>  most of them just eat before they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1751.872s">And</a>  they can ask for breakfast, but they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1756.215s">But</a>  I do think that that's definitely an area of opportunity, especially if you could offer a breakfast that might be an incentive for students to come in.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1764.621s">Yeah,</a>  get them there a little earlier.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1766.602s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1767.162s">And</a>  the other thing I noticed is most of the schools, we see an increase between September and October. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1773.186s">There</a>  was only one school where there was a slight decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1776.939s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to kids going in for breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1786.849s">That's</a>  why I think the classroom environment really is ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1792.023s">And,</a>  you know, sort of if it works at the Columbus, you know, maybe if we could talk with some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1805.45s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1806.231s">I</a>  know for the past two years in a row, the Eos Foundation has awarded the Columbus a Healthy Start award, and they give those to schools that see breakfast participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1817.87s">at</a>  80% and higher for so many consecutive months over the course of a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1822.573s">So</a>  their average is over 80% year long. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1825.635s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1829.738s">So</a>  on the motion by Mr. Benedetto, and also I ask that the superintendent reach out to the various principals to determine if they could do after the bell breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1838.763s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1840.104s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1840.805s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1841.865s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1842.986s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1843.826s">Smith.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1845.256s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1852.704s">There's</a>  a motion for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1854.946s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1855.667s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1856.568s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1856.988s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1858.23s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1858.75s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1859.511s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1860.572s">Mayor</a>  Burke, we'll report on student survey before our nutritionist leaves.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1865.257s">Um,</a>  I, I saw on, um, some social media that, um, the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that, that, that they just look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1876.16s">I</a>  saw on some social media about it at the McGlen and, and definitely at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1880.921s">I</a>  saw some, uh, posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1886.163s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1887.083s">Uh,</a>  we are aware of that and I guess what I can say in response to that is we handled the milks appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1894.205s">We</a>  use a first in, first out rotation system, so the oldest milks, you know, are the first ones that are in the coolers and leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1902.449s">Turn</a>  the cooler up? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1904.13s">Make</a>  them colder? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1905.011s">I</a>  mean, all of the refrigerators are keeping at temp, so I think this might potentially be a supplier issue, so we'll have to... Be a monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1916.377s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1917.117s">But</a>  what I can say is from our handling of everything, we're doing everything that we <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1923.052s">can</a>  to ensure that the milks are at a safe temperature, and they are within the best by date. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1929.576s">So</a>  they should be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1931.137s">But</a>  we have to figure out why they're not.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1936.001s">Would</a>  you like to? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1937.101s">School</a>  committee elect, would you like to step up to the mic, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1940.023s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1940.303s">I</a>  just had a question about, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1943.425s">Through</a>  the chair.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1946.52s">I</a>  had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1956.988s">How</a>  do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1962.351s">And</a>  is it actually kept cold while it's sitting in the class for an hour or two?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1966.414s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1967.255s">So</a>  this is for the breakfast in the classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1969.817s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1970.237s">So</a>  the breakfast items are transported in coolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1974.901s">And</a>  they leave that morning and go, and I don't know what the exact time frame is, but they're kept in coolers, and so they are used probably I would say within an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1985.271s">And</a>  any of the milks that come back are discarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1989.535s">So</a>  that should not be contributing to the issue.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1994.299s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1996.684s">Okay,</a>  item four, based on suspension of the rules, report on student survey on substance abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2003.089s">We</a>  have with us Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2004.029s">Penny</a>  Funny-Elite from Medford City Hall Team Medford to do a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2010.013s">Do</a>  you need us to move at all?</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2012.215s">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2013.216s">Let</a>  me just turn on this projector and we shall see.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2026.083s">It's</a>  going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2027.185s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2027.566s">Light's</a>  coming on.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2028.809s">Yeah,</a>  it's kicking in.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2042.073s">Okay,</a>  so thank you for having me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2044.434s">I'm</a>  here to present the data, but I do not do my work alone, and Tony Bento and Rachel Perry are here to talk about the work that they do in the schools that really support youth substance use and prevention of youth substance use in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2061.585s">I</a>  just want to say this is a report on a survey called the Community Care Survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2064.647s">We've</a>  been doing this survey since 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2067.929s">It's</a>  done every two years, so we have a long amount of years to see trends that have changed throughout the time of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2078.536s">Some</a>  of the things to note are that what it looks at is it looks at risk and protective factors, as well as frequency of reported use. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2086.186s">So</a>  this is, the youth take this survey, it's an anonymous survey, it comes back to us, we send it to, excuse me, it goes from the school directly to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2096.44s">the</a>  researcher who cleans the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2099.221s">By</a>  cleaning the data, what I mean is that they eliminate any surveys that exaggerate drug use or any other antisocial behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2108.823s">They</a>  eliminate surveys where students report a fictitious drug that's on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2114.744s">And</a>  then anything that's logically inconsistent patterns of drug use, they will eliminate those surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2120.126s">So</a>  let's say they had 100 that were not valid, they will eliminate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2125.327s">That</a>  will not be included in the total count for the survey itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2130.25s">But</a>  what it's doing is it's looking at—we don't ask questions about sexuality, but what risk and protective factors do is that really show what drives young people to do things that are risky for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2145.097s">So</a>  that's why we're looking at this larger picture snapshot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2148.74s">A</a>  lot of communities use a youth risk behavior survey, and it really looks at the frequency. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2154.385s">It</a>  doesn't look at some of the community conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2157.627s">So</a>  it's a large report. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2160.289s">We've</a>  broken it up for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2162.371s">Tonight</a>  we're going to talk just about substance abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2165.454s">rates,</a>  and then I will come back, if I'm correct, Superintendent Belson, we discussed that I would come back, talk about risk and protective factors, and then come back again and talk about more data that we saw in the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2178.007s">What</a>  I'm doing here by showing you this presentation is that I think that we need to remember that this is not a school problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2186.331s">This</a>  is a societal, family, peer-level, individual-level issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2193.055s">And</a>  to solve anything that we want to see change on these numbers, we really need to be working as a whole, as a team, to be able to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2201.5s">The</a>  school over the years, I've been here since 2008, I began in September 2008 doing this work, and the schools have had tremendous involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2210.387s">The</a>  police department has had tremendous involvement in the work that we've done through the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2216.493s">And</a>  we put out many, many, many instances of putting information out to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2221.417s">And</a>  we have not had public forums where parents come out in droves. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2224.959s">And</a>  that's not, um, that, that, we wish they could get the information that we're putting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2230.661s">So,</a>  one of our urges here tonight is to say to parents, please pay attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2234.963s">We</a>  are doing prevention education for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2238.585s">We</a>  have resources for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2240.726s">We</a>  want to be thinking about substance use prevention long before someone uses substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2245.948s">We're</a>  fortunate now in the city of Medford at the Board of Health to have an outreach worker or recovery coach who will, you know, between the two of us, we sit and come up with a plan and work with individuals at the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2259.31s">We</a>  do an early intervention program where if youth are found drinking or using drugs, we will bring them in for a three-hour education course, give them a screening to see if they themselves have any issues, and then we will speak directly to their families about getting them help. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2274.753s">Because</a>  we're really pushing that, you know, this is about getting help and getting this solved before it becomes a chronic issue for you and your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2282.502s">So</a>  we have these resources available. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2285.665s">We</a>  are begging you to come out to our presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2289.87s">access</a>  this information online. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2293.152s">Many</a>  programs for parents are going to be going up on the Mystic Valley Public Health website coming up soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2300.016s">That</a>  will be linked to the City of Medford's website and hopefully to the school's website and to the police's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2306.119s">But</a>  today, if you have an issue, and this is a televised so I'm talking to the public, please go to drugfree.org and look for information there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2315.284s">They</a>  can steer you in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2317.865s">So</a>  the survey itself, we're looking at three different measures of use rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2323.547s">We</a>  have lifetime use, so have you ever tried a substance? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2326.168s">Experimentation</a>  is something that happens, but use where it becomes a problem or can lead to a problem, we're looking at that at the 30-day prevalence use rate, so whether or not a student has used a substance within the last month, the last 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2340.292s">That's</a>  what we measure as current use. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2343.559s">And</a>  historically, we've always done this survey prior to the February vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2350.323s">And</a>  this year, I believe in last year as well, the way that the schedule worked out, the survey was done after that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2356.087s">So</a>  that might be something to think about, but I don't see that reflected in the data at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2362.19s">Binge</a>  drinking behavior is reported if five or more drinks in one sitting in the last two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2368.714s">So</a>  that's what we are measuring binge drinking behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2372.316s">So</a>  the purpose of prevention is to delay use. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2378.117s">We</a>  want to drive those youth numbers back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2381.438s">We</a>  want to do our best to get the people who need help, help, and to reduce the amount of people that are trying, experimenting, and using frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2389.679s">So</a>  what I have here to show you is I have multiple charts that will show you what's happened over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2396.301s">But</a>  this one here, I think, is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2398.741s">So</a>  if you look at the youth substance use as a bell curve, you're going to have 5% to 10% of the students, they're never going to use substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2406.612s">They</a>  may have family history that causes them, they may have, you know, some school commitments or some religious commitments that prevent them from using. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2413.842s">And</a>  on the other end, you might have 5% to 10% <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2416.465s">percent</a>  of students who were going to use no matter what prevention measures were put into place because they have family history, they have trauma, they have other leading factors that could drive them towards something of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2429.092s">So</a>  what our goal is is really to drive the numbers back from, you know, we want as many people getting help and more towards that 5 to 10 percent of use as opposed to never using. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2440.137s">So</a>  in 2005, you can see here 71 percent of high school students <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2446.361s">71.2</a>  percent of high school students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime, ninth through twelfth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2451.988s">This</a>  is both the high school and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2454.451s">In</a>  all of this case, those two schools are combined with the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2458.695s">In</a>  2017, 45.8% of the students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2465.762s">This</a>  is a significant change in the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2470.026s">And</a>  this is as a result of the teamwork that I talked about when I first started speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2474.53s">So</a>  what we're doing is working, and we need to continue doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2478.634s">And</a>  we need to continue to bring in more people into the fold and have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2484.204s">This</a>  is 6th grade, and again, when we report out the data, I have both in your packet, lifetime and 30-day use, but current trends are really where you would see that there's sort of an issue that we would want to be addressing in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2498.991s">That</a>  is where we would put more of our weight in the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2502.213s">So</a>  6th to 8th grade, as you can see, over time, we've really brought these numbers down. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2510.217s">Um,</a>  and you can, and these numbers are extremely low. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2512.719s">What</a>  you're looking at is, um, and all of you have, should have a chart provided with the actual percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2519.585s">I</a>  like to do that because it's hard to read charts sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2523.749s">Um,</a>  it would be on page, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2526.92s">So</a>  for middle school students, you know, 30-day use is 3.4%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2529.382s">That's</a>  a lot lower than the national average. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2531.984s">For</a>  U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2532.204s">norm,</a>  for 8th grade, it was 7.3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2534.005s">And</a>  I can tell you that our 8th graders were reporting <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2558.266s">Our</a>  eighth grade is reporting 7.9 percent, so we do want to be paying attention to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2562.807s">It's</a>  close to the national average. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2565.068s">It</a>  is a low number, thank goodness, but we should be talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2568.529s">This</a>  is why I'm saying we need to talk early and often. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2572.19s">We</a>  need to be prepared and we need to be ready to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2576.131s">to</a>  have those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2577.752s">We</a>  all should be talking to our friends' parents so they know what our personal preferences are and plans when they go to their houses, when they go to parties, they go out to, you know, football games or whatever it is, that everyone's well aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2589.881s">So,</a>  we do see the numbers declining. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2592.143s">We</a>  always want to be monitoring the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2594.344s">In</a>  the high school, sorry, at the 9th through 12th grade level, we see the decline as well over time, and we're very pleased to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2606.366s">One</a>  thing that we're monitoring this year that we've never monitored before is vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2610.83s">So</a>  we don't have numbers to compare to the previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2615.515s">But</a>  what we can tell you is on page four, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2627.276s">What</a>  we know right now is that this is what the students reported in February of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2632.298s">Also</a>  remember, all 12th grade data, those students do not go to these school systems any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2638.981s">They</a>  have moved on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2640.081s">So</a>  that is something to be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2644.531s">We</a>  believe that this number is going up exponentially as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2648.795s">Based</a>  on conversations amongst students and staff, there's a lot more concern for vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2655.782s">And</a>  we need to be thinking about it overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2658.845s">So</a>  this is what vaping is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2660.847s">This</a>  is the most popular vaping product that we're hearing about all over the state, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2666.312s">It's</a>  called Juul. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2667.713s">And</a>  it looks like a USB. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2669.875s">You</a>  can actually charge it by using it as a USB in your computer or wherever. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2676.841s">And</a>  one of those is equivalent to one pack of cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2681.144s">The</a>  most popular product is a mango flavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2685.219s">Call</a>  me crazy, but I think they're marketing to a very specific population. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2690.3s">They</a>  have a very catchy name, and very catchy products, and anything flavored is gonna be really attractive to young people, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2698.462s">Now,</a>  the thing is about this, the other day we were talking about it, and I said, oh, don't worry, this is a patented product, you really, you know, they're not gonna be making marijuana products with this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2707.304s">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2708.204s">You</a>  can actually inject marijuana oil into this product once the, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2712.945s">stuff</a>  is out, so you can get any, go on YouTube and you can learn anything you want to learn about how to hack this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2720.169s">So</a>  it's discreet, so you could, somebody could be vaping in here right now and you may not notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2727.994s">It</a>  can be very discreet in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2730.515s">So</a>  it's something that we really need to be paying attention to. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2733.918s">It's</a>  very covert. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2735.578s">Did</a>  you have something you want to say?</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2737.137s">I</a>  heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2743.525s">And</a>  they also can even exhale right into their hoodies, and you don't even see anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2749.552s">So</a>  kids in class are actually, they call it dueling.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2756.433s">So</a>  the reality is that there's a lot of information and misinformation out there about vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2766.539s">The</a>  main thing that you need to take away from this is that it contains nicotine and nicotine is one of the most <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2772.083s">highly</a>  addicted drugs in the entire world, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2775.285s">So,</a>  um, you know, there may be speculation that, you know, the, their vape, you know, that they're gonna get hooked on vaping and then they're gonna get hooked on cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2782.748s">I</a>  argue that they're probably gonna be hooked on vaping for a very long time is really what the issue's gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2788.131s">Um,</a>  and we don't know because there isn't long-term data to show what the effect of this will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2793.293s">Just</a>  like with cigarettes, we didn't know what cigarettes were gonna do to us, and now look at what we're, where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2798.696s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2799.936s">So,</a>  we need to be cautious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2801.856s">Now,</a>  I want to show you this because this is a product that is also a vaping product. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2807.758s">They</a>  sell these inserts at dispensaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2811.579s">So,</a>  if you see something like this, looks like an old-timey cigarette holder, that can also be filled with a THC oil of some kind or some sort of marijuana derivative product. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2823.32s">So</a>  marijuana has become legalized in Massachusetts, and it's still dangerous for kids to use marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2832.624s">It</a>  can create long-term changes in the way that their brain responds to addictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2839.948s">It</a>  can do a number of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2842.689s">What</a>  I want to show you in this slide is a very, very busy slide, but I put everything in one slide so that I didn't forget about a single thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2849.992s">Perception</a>  of harm, so great risk of harm, this is how our students said on the survey, that if you tried marijuana, you would be at great risk of harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2858.199s">There</a>  were other things, moderate risk, no risk, but this is specifically looking at the term great risk of harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2863.824s">So</a>  the good news is, is that there are a number of people who do think that you'd be at great risk of harm if you tried marijuana just once. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2872.563s">In</a>  some cases, oddly, that smoking it regularly is somehow OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2878.445s">Now,</a>  great risk harm is a measure that if you look at, this is what the data shows nationally, that if you believe it's harmful, you will use it less. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2891.068s">So</a>  what we want to do is make sure that people are well informed of what these drugs and alcohol and everything can do to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2899.85s">But</a>  I feel like these numbers are pretty low. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2901.931s">I</a>  think that this is going to be an ongoing problem for a long time, and I'm going to tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2906.312s">Because</a>  it's very difficult to convey honest facts to young people about marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2912.695s">And</a>  we as a community really need to hunker down and think about how to present this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2919.597s">If</a>  we provide false facts, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2921.878s">of</a>  scare tactics to young people, it will not change that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2926.099s">It'll</a>  probably make other things worse, because then they'll know for a fact that you were lying to them about marijuana, maybe you're lying about cocaine, maybe you're lying about heroin or other opioids, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2936.262s">So</a>  what we want to do is figure out what is our game plan and to really work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2941.844s">I</a>  know that there is some education in the curriculum, but I think that we can be doing more, and we need to be thinking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2949.798s">a</a>  little bit more, I think that we as a state should have been thinking about this a little bit more all along the way and be prepared because this was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2957.625s">So</a>  the other thing to be very aware of, which is startling to me even, even though I've seen it all, no I haven't really seen it all, is that driving with someone under the influence of marijuana is pretty high in high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2974.13s">So</a>  we know one thing for sure, that Mothers Against Drunk Driving did a hell of a job of changing drinking and driving rates amongst young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2983.479s">But</a>  we also need to be thinking about this with marijuana as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2987.003s">It</a>  looks to me like almost 30% of high school seniors last year had driven in a car with someone under the influence of marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2994.52s">You</a>  know, and I think that classically, people who smoke marijuana will go for a joy ride, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2999.103s">They</a>  hop in their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2999.824s">It's</a>  sort of a part of the culture is, you know, getting in your car and getting isolated, getting away from, you know, wherever, especially when you're a teenager because you don't have the freedom to smoke weed in your house or marijuana in your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3010.231s">So,</a>  um, we need to be paying attention to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3013.113s">We</a>  need to be paying very close attention to that, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3017.015s">All</a>  in all, if you were to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3021.004s">take</a>  a look at these marijuana rates, we are low in use rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3027.61s">We're</a>  lower than most of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3030.252s">So</a>  I think that, you know, it's really interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3036.418s">Let</a>  me just go back real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3039.02s">Especially</a>  with high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3040.836s">So</a>  marijuana is the gray line. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3045.477s">The</a>  third line down here, starting on the left, and then it goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3050.379s">2009,</a>  2013, which makes perfect sense because it's decriminalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3054.34s">Medical</a>  marijuana becomes legal, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3056.66s">So</a>  the perception of harm has definitely changed at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3060.281s">But</a>  for some reason, from 2013 into 2017, we're still seeing a decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3066.363s">in</a>  that use, in that regular use of marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3069.004s">But</a>  what typically happens with marijuana use rates is there may be less people who start using marijuana, but the people who use marijuana use it far more chronically. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3079.189s">So</a>  they may use it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3080.609s">So</a>  that's something to also be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3087.403s">And</a>  then finally, we get to the end of the presentation here, where we're doing a lot of things as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3095.046s">I</a>  mentioned the youth diversion program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3098.167s">I</a>  mentioned all the work that we've done over the years working with the school and the police, working on research, finding evidence-based practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3106.37s">That's</a>  what the city has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3107.731s">But</a>  we also have a grant called Partnerships for Success. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3111.972s">That's</a>  specifically focusing on prescription drug prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3116.135s">Our</a>  numbers are very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3117.976s">If</a>  you go back to your charts and you look at 30-day use rates, and even, well, I would say look at your lifetime rates of prescription drugs, you'll see that in 2005, for high school students, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3137.421s">We</a>  had 11.4% of students reporting that they used prescription drugs without a doctor's prescription. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3144.389s">And</a>  you're looking at now, of all students ever having tried, 3.8%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3150.114s">So</a>  regardless of the situation that's happening in our community with overdoses, we're seeing youth rates decline with opioid use. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3160.003s">I</a>  still see, you know, numbers declining with tranquilizers and then also stimulants are sort of leveled off from the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3169.131s">Um,</a>  our urge with our grant is to really say we need to be paying attention to all of these prescription drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3175.775s">They</a>  all, um, cause, you know, can create an effect and cause a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3181.199s">Um,</a>  opioids are clearly our biggest concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3183.56s">It's</a>  all over the news, and that's a good thing because people are talking about it to their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3189.944s">what's</a>  going on with other family members maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3192.486s">Um,</a>  my aunt lives in Indiana. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3194.107s">She</a>  had crazy surgery and they were all over her prescription pain meds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3198.591s">So</a>  I was very pleased to hear that, not just in Massachusetts but other parts of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3202.994s">Doctors</a>  are paying attention to those pain medications. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3205.756s">Um,</a>  but one thing is I went to Tufts last week and I did a training on, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3210.9s">how</a>  to use naloxone with Armstrong Ambulance, and I stated that cocaine is being cut with fentanyl on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3217.867s">And</a>  I had a kid look up at me like, oh. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3220.209s">So</a>  I have—and I'm not saying that kid uses cocaine. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3222.771s">My</a>  point, though, being that people are unaware of this, and it's very important to know that we have to pay attention to all drug use. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3230.218s">It</a>  should not be about this drug is bad, this one isn't as bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3234.161s">All</a>  drugs are bad because—and alcohol, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3237.444s">because</a>  it creates addiction and pathways to addiction then lead to further addiction problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3242.849s">So</a>  this is something that we just want to be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3246.012s">So</a>  anyhow, the Partnerships for Success grant, we have multiple projects that we're working with the school on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3251.677s">One</a>  thing is a health and safety guide went out to all families from, I believe, 8th grade to 11th grade at the end of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3262.506s">And</a>  it was a 24-page guide, multiple, multiple things to think about, where to dispose of drugs, what is vaping, you know, understanding stress in your students, prescription drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3273.855s">It</a>  was a very well-organized litany of resources as well as information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3280.119s">That's</a>  one way that we're trying to get information out to parents is direct mailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3284.742s">Another</a>  thing that we're doing that I think is really important is that we've helped through working with Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3290.565s">We've</a>  implemented a module on prescription drugs into the 10th grade curriculum for the Michigan model. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3298.188s">And</a>  then we have a risk to resiliency professional development series where we're talking about trauma-informed care. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3304.671s">We're</a>  talking about absenteeism. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3307.432s">And</a>  really what we're trying to communicate is that we want to build these kids up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3313.234s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3314.094s">If</a>  we just say that you're going to do drugs, you're going to do drugs, they might do drugs if you've told them that's who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3319.597s">We're</a>  trying to really do the opposite of that and try to identify those sparks, those things that make individuals who they are and things that they can find sense of purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3328.881s">Not</a>  our sense of purpose on these kids, but what is their sense of purpose so that they can have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3334.344s">driven</a>  internal guiding thing that keeps them in that 5% to 10% away from substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3340.97s">So</a>  we're working with faculty to get them that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3344.313s">So</a>  through the lens of asset building, the lens of looking at kids as though they have positive things to bring to this world, but understanding those risk factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3353.28s">And</a>  then finally, we're working with two identified faculty members. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3358.225s">One's</a>  a coach, and one's also one's <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3362.188s">after</a>  school club advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3363.889s">And</a>  we're working with them to do training to all of the school clubs and advisors. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3367.91s">Because</a>  in the city of Medford, that's where kids go after school in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3371.371s">They</a>  go to the clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3372.211s">They</a>  go to sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3373.351s">So</a>  we're doing a integrated training with them around developmental relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3378.093s">Just</a>  what I was saying, how do you identify those sparks in that kid? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3381.394s">You</a>  have these high, high achievers who are overstressed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3384.475s">And</a>  you have people who don't participate because the high, high achievers might be taken over. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3388.336s">So</a>  we're trying to talk about how do you balance that, how you facilitate your clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3391.457s">How</a>  do you operate as a club advisor as opposed to a teacher in a classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3395.319s">So</a>  those are our main programs that we're doing at the city, and then I'm going to step back and let Rachel and Tony talk about the projects that they've done in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3404.682s">And</a>  then I'll answer questions.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3406.823s">Thank</a>  you, Penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3407.323s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3409.524s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3410.685s">I</a>  wanted to talk a little bit about vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3413.346s">Penny</a>  had talked about our numbers going down, but we have noticed we're seeing more and more of it here at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3419.212s">So</a>  we have addressed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3421.254s">One</a>  thing we have done is on November 21, there was a meeting, a staff meeting that Nick Tucci actually presented information on vaping to our teachers, to our staff, presented what to look for, what the dangers are, and what they can do if they see a student actually vaping in class, what the steps are from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3439.111s">Tony</a>  has actually done some information out on our blog, out to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3444.318s">So</a>  that was out, I believe, was that October? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3446.099s">October.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3446.4s">That</a>  was in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3448.721s">What</a>  we're working on right now is another message that goes out to all parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3452.084s">That</a>  will be going out in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3455.727s">Mr.</a>  Dempsey and Lisa Dunphy are also working on a video that students will be making. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3461.621s">and</a>  that will actually be presented as a homeroom activity in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3465.162s">So</a>  that will go out to all the students at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3468.663s">We</a>  have set up a presentation for February 8th for all parents, where it will be a vaping presentation along with In Plain Sight, which will be here again at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3478.627s">We</a>  had that at City Hall last year, but we thought it would be something that in light of everything that we could bring back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3485.985s">And</a>  as part of our Michigan model curriculum, we've added vaping to any lesson that included tobacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3493.849s">So</a>  this is in the second year at the high school and the first year at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3498.171s">I</a>  did reach out to the principals at the middle schools and they really haven't seen much going on with vaping there, but we have seen the uptick here at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3506.675s">They</a>  know what to look for in the middle schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3508.656s">The</a>  teachers and? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3509.857s">That's</a>  something that we can actually present. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3511.938s">That</a>  would be the next step to bring it down to the middle school.</p>
