00:00:05,229 --> 00:00:06,649

[SPEAKER_13]: Present, seven present, none absent.

11
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:23,698
[SPEAKER_13]: All please rise and salute our flag.

12
00:00:23,718 --> 00:00:26,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Also present is our student group, just in time.

13
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:27,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, Justin.

14
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:41,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

15
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:52,490
[SPEAKER_13]: We're very proud to have with us tonight members of the Met Republic Schools Fine Arts Department, the holiday music presentation.

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Take it away, maestro.

17
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:22,401
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tradition that we always play this tune at this event because it was written right across the square at Simpson's Tavern many years ago about the slag erasers that came right downstairs during the Great Ohio War.

18
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:26,761
So here's our arrangement of Jingle Bells.

19
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:27,982
One, two, three.

20
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:44,420
I'd like to do one more.

21
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish everybody a joyous and safe and happy holiday season.

22
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:16,900
Okay.

23
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,345
One, three, two.

24
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:47,658
you.

25
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:36,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

26
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:36,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloot.

27
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:45,004
[SPEAKER_21]: So Mr. Zigny, before you and the students go, first I want to tell you how much I was looking forward to hearing you tonight.

28
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:46,265
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's made our night.

29
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:47,365
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so very much.

30
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:53,327
[SPEAKER_21]: I will also tell you it made our night when we went to the orchestra concert at the high school.

31
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,368
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think you could get another student on that stage.

32
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:57,728
[SPEAKER_21]: It was unbelievable.

33
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:04,490
[SPEAKER_21]: As well, myself and some of my colleagues, including the mayor and Kathy Kretz, we were able to go to the middle school concert as well.

34
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,930
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's just, I felt so proud.

35
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:09,071
[SPEAKER_21]: And so proud of our students here.

36
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:10,351
[SPEAKER_21]: You represent us so well.

37
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,772
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's so magnificent that we have this interest in our music program.

38
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:16,072
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's just wonderful.

39
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:16,953
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you very much.

40
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:20,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, Mr. Zigny, though, I actually happen to have something I have to give you.

41
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,354
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you wouldn't mind coming forward.

42
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:26,775
[SPEAKER_21]: This is kind of funny, but I just happen to be given a donation of drumsticks.

43
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:37,744
[SPEAKER_21]: from someone who was formally connected and did a student internship at Medford High, and he remembers us so fondly, so here's some drumsticks for you.

44
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much Mr. Zigney and all members.

45
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,140
[SPEAKER_13]: You're fabulous.

46
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,583
[SPEAKER_13]: We love listening to you and we're very very proud of the rich musical tradition we have in our great city.

47
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,544
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you and happy holidays.

48
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:05,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

49
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuneo, thank you.

50
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say thank you to all of you.

51
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:19,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that you're only representing the larger group of all the students that are participating in the orchestra, but not only to the orchestra, but to everyone itself, the marching band, the orchestra, the drama club.

52
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:24,227
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys represent us, and you've done a terrific and wonderful job.

53
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:33,654
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing I also want to ask Mr. Zigney, and I know I've mentioned it on record here, is that we did get a donation from Mr. John Costas for the lights.

54
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:45,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we could recognize him, well, if you guys could recognize him, come the new year, that would be really nice because we do have a lot of people in the city, as Ms.

55
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:52,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Van de Kloot, you know, sometimes when someone else might not need something, it is very valuable to us.

56
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to say thank you to all.

57
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:04,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

58
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,171
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also like to make a quick announcement.

59
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,314
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a Black Ford Explorer 7MP588 with your lights on.

60
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,236
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you hear.

61
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:15,658
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all set.

62
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:16,298
[SPEAKER_11]: All set?

63
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:17,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to put that on record.

64
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,600
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all set.

65
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,742
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time, I would like to invite Ms.

66
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:26,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Ann Marie Cuno, vice chairperson of the Medford School Committee, to step forward and conduct the rest of this evening's meeting.

67
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:26,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

68
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:40,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everyone.

69
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:40,974
[SPEAKER_11]: I need John.

70
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:53,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Is everybody's mic on?

71
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:53,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

72
00:07:54,038 --> 00:08:04,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Put them all on.

73
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,542
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all on.

74
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:10,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Is everyone's mic on?

75
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:11,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

76
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:17,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the first thing on our agenda is the approval of the minutes of December 4th.

77
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Moved to approve by Mr. Skerry, seconded by?

78
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,200
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have a couple questions.

79
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:46,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to know, in regards to the field trip policy, if the teachers and all the other administrators are aware of the school policies, what they need to follow before they make their field trip.

80
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

81
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Nelson, could you help answer that question?

82
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:59,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a couple of questions from a teacher, and I just wasn't sure if everybody's aware to follow these policies.

83
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:13,975
[SPEAKER_00]: As you approved it on December 4th, the next day I sent it to the administrators informing them that it was officially approved and they were to get it out to the teachers.

84
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:15,856
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked on the forms.

85
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:18,677
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the preliminary forms in front of you this evening.

86
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:20,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I did email.

87
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:28,663
[SPEAKER_00]: our webmaster to put the form, the policy rather, and the forms on the webpage so that it's available to everyone.

88
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:35,889
[SPEAKER_00]: But my assumption is that the principals did inform their staff about the policy shortly after it was sent to them.

89
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:36,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

90
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:36,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

91
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:37,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

92
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

93
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:40,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just had one more.

94
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:53,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to know from Superintendent Belson if there was an update on the ongoing investigation with the concussion that was on the soccer field on October 11, 2017.

95
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:58,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear anything from the superintendent in Barreley?

96
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:58,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there an update?

97
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:05,341
[SPEAKER_15]: So I emailed the superintendent in Beverly with the details that I felt were pertinent to the matter.

98
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,823
[SPEAKER_15]: I've given you a quick update the other day.

99
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:10,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm waiting to hear back from him.

100
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:16,649
[SPEAKER_15]: I did speak with him, and I feel like something will be forthcoming from Beverly very shortly.

101
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

102
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:17,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

103
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:20,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

104
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:21,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Kratz, you all set?

105
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:21,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

106
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:24,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can now second the motion to approve.

107
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,325
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

108
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:30,567
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. Skerry, motion and the second of Ms.

109
00:10:30,607 --> 00:10:30,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Kratz.

110
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:32,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

111
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:33,688
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

112
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:34,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

113
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,769
[SPEAKER_11]: All opposed?

114
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,670
[SPEAKER_11]: It's affirmative.

115
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

116
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:43,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Approved to put the minutes on file.

117
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:47,193
[SPEAKER_11]: approve of bills and transfers of funds.

118
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:49,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Move to approve them.

119
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Ms.

120
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:50,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Vander Kloot.

121
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:52,156
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

122
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:53,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

123
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:56,479
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need a roll call.

124
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:07,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wonder if the superintendent or the chief financial officer could

125
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:13,991
[SPEAKER_08]: It says it's still the generalization, like Meffitt High School miscellaneous charges.

126
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:19,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any way that we can get more information when those items are placed on here?

127
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:22,057
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the first item on page one of six.

128
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:23,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the student activity accounts.

129
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:26,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are always going to be there?

130
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

131
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,001
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

132
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. DiBenedetto, if I may?

133
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:29,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

134
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:37,733
[SPEAKER_21]: Just so you know, that as secretary, when I sign that, I look through every single one of them to make sure they're proper and in order.

135
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,375
[SPEAKER_21]: And they consistently have been.

136
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:39,835
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

137
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:40,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

138
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:45,094
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, roll call.

139
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:46,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call for the bills.

140
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,556
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Cuneo?

141
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:48,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

142
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:49,398
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. DiBenedetto?

143
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:49,798
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

144
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,140
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Kretz?

145
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,600
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

146
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:52,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. McStone?

147
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:53,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

148
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:53,902
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Scurry?

149
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:54,243
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

150
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Vanderkoop?

151
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:55,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

152
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:56,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor Burke?

153
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:56,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

154
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

155
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:04,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to accept and approve the bill transfers of funds.

156
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:06,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Passes.

157
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:07,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Passes.

158
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:10,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve the payrolls.

159
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:12,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Move approval.

160
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:13,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

161
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:16,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Approved by Mr. Scurry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

162
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a secretary.

163
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:18,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. Cuneo?

164
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:19,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

165
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:20,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. DeBenedetto?

166
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:20,554
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

167
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:21,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Kratz?

168
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:21,875
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

169
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:22,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. McStone?

170
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:23,257
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

171
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:23,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Scurry?

172
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:24,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

173
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Vander Kloot?

174
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,419
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

175
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:25,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor Burke?

176
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:26,480
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

177
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:28,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

178
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:33,475
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion to approve the payrolls and place on file have passed.

179
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:34,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of the secretary?

180
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:38,098
[SPEAKER_21]: There is none.

181
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:40,859
[SPEAKER_21]: There is one, but we'll take it under report of committees.

182
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:42,200
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to do it under report of committees?

183
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:44,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

184
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:44,361
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

185
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of the committee.

186
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:45,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is next?

187
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:47,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of the committees.

188
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:48,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Committee of the whole meeting.

189
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:50,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Minutes for December 11, 2017.

190
00:12:54,292 --> 00:13:04,121
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you would, Mrs. Cuneo, I think that tonight it would be appropriate to just quickly say that we met at 6.30 on December 11th.

191
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:14,509
[SPEAKER_21]: All of us were present, as well as Michael Ruggiero, school committee elect, Paul Rousseau, school committee elect, the superintendent, deputy superintendent,

192
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:22,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccadeli, and community members Jen Graham, Michelle Ciccolo, and Franco Leary.

193
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:34,669
[SPEAKER_21]: The purpose of the meeting was to establish a process for the selection of the next superintendent, to identify the criteria for selection, to review application forms for candidates, and to initiate a process for selection.

194
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:52,318
[SPEAKER_21]: The superintendent spoke about different items, going over what our challenges would be, what its job description should be, giving us some information about the MASS, that's Massachusetts Superintendent Organization, salary information, et cetera.

195
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:57,821
[SPEAKER_21]: The outcome of this meeting was that the mayor appointed a subcommittee.

196
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:03,103
[SPEAKER_21]: She appointed me as chair, Mrs. McStone, Mrs. Kretz,

197
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:06,585
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't say here.

198
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:07,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Jenny.

199
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Jen.

200
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Jenny.

201
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:10,208
[SPEAKER_21]: And.

202
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:12,110
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael.

203
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,391
[SPEAKER_21]: No, and Paul Rousseau.

204
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:13,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry about that.

205
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:27,302
[SPEAKER_21]: And we are going to meet this Thursday, December 21st at 715 up at the high school to carry forward our charge of coming up with a

206
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:35,512
[SPEAKER_21]: questionnaire and also a information document that could be given out to prospective candidates.

207
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just a clarification, if I may, 7.15 a.m.

208
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:39,457
[SPEAKER_11]: or p.m.?

209
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:40,017
[SPEAKER_11]: P.m.

210
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:41,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

211
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,001
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

212
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:43,682
[SPEAKER_21]: We had talked about a.m.

213
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:44,844
[SPEAKER_21]: so it's a good question.

214
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:47,709
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

215
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:48,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair?

216
00:14:49,050 --> 00:15:00,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, during this meeting, we turned out some job applications and job descriptions that I asked the members of the committee to look at and review to see if they had any suggested changes.

217
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:05,140
[SPEAKER_13]: We did receive some from Kathy Brett, and I likewise have some changes.

218
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,483
[SPEAKER_13]: We can circulate them around so that everyone can take a look at them and see if they concur.

219
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:13,466
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we can send our suggestions to the superintendent to make the amendments.

220
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:32,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Just on that topic, I was wondering if the mayor could at some point possibly give us a list of criteria for school committee members to be on the committee and how she's going to make that decision.

221
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:36,626
[SPEAKER_13]: We will all be on the committee for the internal candidate portion of it.

222
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,169
[SPEAKER_13]: So it will be an open session, and it will be all seven of us.

223
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,434
[SPEAKER_13]: And then moving forward from that, only two members will be allowed to be on?

224
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:52,602
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I handed out a draft application for those that are interested in applying to be on the search committee if we need to go that far.

225
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:53,543
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, great.

226
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:53,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

227
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:57,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I had a question also.

228
00:15:57,465 --> 00:16:07,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to know, because I think some of the public community was asking me, you know, why are there only two school committee members allowed for the external search?

229
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And I couldn't quite remember the answer.

230
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to know if

231
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:26,735
[SPEAKER_06]: if there was any opportunity for there to be an alternate where two committee members could serve for five meetings, and then another two committee members could serve for another five meetings, so that everybody would have an exposure if we get to that level.

232
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:28,395
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may on that one?

233
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:29,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

234
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:38,859
[SPEAKER_11]: When we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by.

235
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:46,502
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee.

236
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:57,167
[SPEAKER_11]: If we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee if you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting.

237
00:16:57,547 --> 00:17:02,969
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something that you as a committee have to sit down and discuss on that.

238
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be one.

239
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:18,019
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very, we're kind of like playing very fine line with that law.

240
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:32,769
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws.

241
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,034
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was the reason we can't do that.

242
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:37,935
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thank you.

243
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,477
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

244
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,238
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve.

245
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:43,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Who was seconded?

246
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:44,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded.

247
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Mayor Burke.

248
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:48,201
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

249
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:48,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

250
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:54,825
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file.

251
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:58,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Community participation, Maureen Roney.

252
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:01,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Roney, I apologize.

253
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:09,235
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm here tonight because of my ongoing concerns about the math program test scores at the Columbus.

254
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:11,837
[SPEAKER_20]: But Mr. Superintendent, I understand that you have an update.

255
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:11,977
[SPEAKER_20]: I do.

256
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:17,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you like me to do that instead of speaking to yourself right now?

257
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

258
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:20,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

259
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:32,669
[SPEAKER_15]: This evening, I passed out an update based on our discussions about what might be possible in order to provide additional assistance to students at the Columbus.

260
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:44,995
[SPEAKER_15]: In your packets, you have a much more comprehensive discussion about additional measures that we're doing, but apropos to some suggestions made from the outside, including Mrs. René,

261
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:57,537
[SPEAKER_15]: I put this memo together to give you a clarification, an update of what additional things we're going to do, and with your permission, I'll read it publicly so everyone can hear it.

262
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:58,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have a copy?

263
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:58,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

264
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:08,308
[SPEAKER_15]: As part of our plan to assist students at the Columbus with their mathematics preparation for MCAS 2.0, please note the following.

265
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:20,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Students in grades 3, 4, and 5 who require extra assistance to master the mathematics curriculum will be eligible to receive additional tutoring from paid Medford Public Schools teachers.

266
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:26,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Students will receive between one and two hours per week based upon their need.

267
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:32,523
[SPEAKER_15]: It depends on what the student's need is and what kinds of recommendations their individual teachers make.

268
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:40,550
[SPEAKER_15]: We expect to hire six teachers for two hours each as tutors a week who will be paid by the Medford Public Schools from our budget.

269
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,014
[SPEAKER_15]: This program is planned for 16 weeks starting in January and the projected cost is an additional $6,200.

270
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:57,705
[SPEAKER_15]: We project that the cost of an extra afternoon bus at the Columbus will be paid approximately $150 a day for a total of $4,800.

271
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:01,928
[SPEAKER_15]: We're working with our current provider, Easton Bus, to arrange a schedule.

272
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:12,357
[SPEAKER_15]: We may have to find another provider since Easton's schedule is very tight and additional busing may not be possible through them, although we had discussions with them this afternoon and we think it is possible.

273
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:21,344
[SPEAKER_15]: But since there are three buses leaving the Columbus each day with different routes, we will have to devise a route that serves the majority of students in the program.

274
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:23,885
[SPEAKER_15]: And then maybe you need to create a consolidated route.

275
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, buses go in different directions.

276
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,671
[SPEAKER_15]: In order for us to create a consolidated route, there may have to be some different types of stops.

277
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:36,713
[SPEAKER_15]: The overall cost of transportation, we believe, will be about $4,800.

278
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:45,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Since there are, well, the overall cost then is projected between tutorial and busing to be about $11,200 for the 16 weeks.

279
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:53,621
[SPEAKER_15]: There are multiple logistical issues to be worked out and there may need to be some modifications.

280
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:56,522
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll make those adjustments based upon multiple factors.

281
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:00,064
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll keep the school committee informed as we progress with implementation.

282
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:09,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Things like which teachers volunteer to teach, which days are most appropriate, which days the buses can go and what routes and so on and so forth.

283
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:15,693
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a number of things to be worked out in the interim, but this is the basic plan and hopefully that addresses your issue.

284
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:19,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to just ask.

285
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:20,408
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

286
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:21,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So Ms.

287
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:22,949
[SPEAKER_11]: DiBenedetto and then.

288
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:23,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

289
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:26,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for handling this so quickly, Ms.

290
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,231
[SPEAKER_08]: DeBelson, in such a proactive way.

291
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:37,734
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we hope to be as a committee, find out that there is an issue and be very proactive about handling it so that way it doesn't continue.

292
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:40,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for handling it so quickly.

293
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:41,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a few questions.

294
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Based on this map.

295
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:50,038
[SPEAKER_08]: $150 a day for a bus for a total of $4,800 divided by 16 weeks.

296
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:52,259
[SPEAKER_08]: That's two days a week for a bus.

297
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:53,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

298
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:55,679
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the way we're planning it right now.

299
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:56,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

300
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:05,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, so since we have a bus at that school and leaving, can the kids in the extracurricular programs take the bus as well home?

301
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:07,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way more kids

302
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:19,505
[SPEAKER_08]: that can have access to after school activities, since we're already paying $150 per bus, given that if there's enough room, can we look at opening that up, please?

303
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:29,088
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a variable we should look at, but I don't want to make any commitments till I see exactly how many students are riding the bus for this particular program, because I just don't know.

304
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,808
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be concentrated in a full bus.

305
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:33,629
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be that we have a lot of room.

306
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,470
[SPEAKER_15]: So let us get into the weeds, and we'll see exactly what's possible.

307
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:41,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And what is the criteria for the students that would be picked for this?

308
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:42,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it their grades?

309
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:44,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it their MCAT scores?

310
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:46,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a combination of both?

311
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,107
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the criteria for a student to be?

312
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Could it be parent requests?

313
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:54,468
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll sit with the teachers and the principal to look at which students clearly need it.

314
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:57,888
[SPEAKER_15]: If a student's doing exceptionally well, then chances are they don't want the help.

315
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:02,169
[SPEAKER_15]: If a student really needs it, we hope that they will want to participate.

316
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:04,449
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't make anybody participate.

317
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:07,470
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some people that maybe don't want to participate who could use the help.

318
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:22,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Or there might be a parent that wants their child to participate even though it may look like they're doing well in school, but what they see at home, the struggle at homework is not always the same as it is in the classroom, as I remember it as a parent.

319
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:30,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I would like the parents to have some say and input or at least be able to request it for their child as well.

320
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:36,663
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've got to begin with, let's target the students that we're looking at, and then we can open it up a little bit more.

321
00:23:36,703 --> 00:23:38,924
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's see exactly what kind of response we've got.

322
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:41,746
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've also got to make sure I've got six teachers that want to do it.

323
00:23:43,078 --> 00:23:46,440
[SPEAKER_15]: And I feel they can actually do that particular work.

324
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:51,664
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a few things that variables, like I say, the logistics have to be worked out.

325
00:23:52,304 --> 00:24:03,612
[SPEAKER_15]: And until we actually talk to people specifically at the school and work out some of the details as to how many students would be on which days, there may be some students who want to come one day, some will want to come two days.

326
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:05,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Got to work it out.

327
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:09,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this time, I'd like to motion to approve this program and get that going.

328
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:18,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like a follow-up report the first meeting back in January, since time is of the essence, because MCAS are coming.

329
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:20,584
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't slow down for anyone.

330
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:26,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to make sure we get the word out to parents as quickly as we can that this program is going to be taking place.

331
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:29,069
[SPEAKER_08]: and that they can have some input as well.

332
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:35,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much again and there's a motion on the floor to have this approved and to have an update.

333
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:46,075
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can just suggest that, what do you call it, that the update, I can give you a briefer update through email or through some process, but it may take an extra little time to work out some of the logistics.

334
00:24:46,395 --> 00:24:58,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Because remember, next week is going to be a fairly, well this week rather, is going to be a fairly chopped up week with different things going on, and the logistics of getting commitments from people to do things may take a little bit of time in January.

335
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:07,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And even if you only have partial update, just either by email or at our next meeting, we want to be kept abreast of this issue.

336
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,050
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll keep you posted.

337
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

338
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:09,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

339
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:09,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Van de Kloop?

340
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, a couple of different things.

341
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:15,712
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to mention that in our

342
00:25:17,513 --> 00:25:40,820
[SPEAKER_21]: Folders we also received all the other things which are all the other plans adding 15 minutes of math instruction daily And Chromebook practice so that we had a further report which covered additional in school items That would be addressed It also

343
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:43,948
[SPEAKER_21]: though, I just wanted to clarify.

344
00:25:44,108 --> 00:26:00,038
[SPEAKER_21]: And Mr. Superintendent, I know we're being redundant here, but I understand that you're now committed to having a after school tutoring for the math students paid for by the district, because I'm just clarifying that, because earlier there was a rumor.

345
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,660
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I want to put that to rest.

346
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:12,965
[SPEAKER_21]: and committed to working out transportation, after school transportation, it sounds like so far, financially, you've committed to at least two days a week.

347
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:13,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that correct?

348
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:14,366
[SPEAKER_15]: That's our plan.

349
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:15,007
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

350
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,508
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that your request would have preferred three.

351
00:26:17,948 --> 00:26:20,289
[SPEAKER_21]: I think two is probably a reasonable place to start.

352
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,071
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, that's great.

353
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:22,912
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

354
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:26,015
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would like to thank you very much from the get-go.

355
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:31,440
[SPEAKER_21]: You've been very, very concerned about this issue, Maureen.

356
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,283
[SPEAKER_21]: And I thank you for coming forth and addressing us.

357
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,624
[SPEAKER_21]: And see, I told you it'd be easy.

358
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,547
[SPEAKER_21]: The other thing, too, is, though, I think that,

359
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:50,951
[SPEAKER_21]: When I went and first met Maureen at the math night, one of the things that just stood out so much that night was when I had a great discussion with some of the teachers.

360
00:26:51,431 --> 00:26:58,552
[SPEAKER_21]: And they were telling me about all the different things our math program could do, but then admitted that not every student had access to that at home.

361
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:06,794
[SPEAKER_21]: So by providing this after school time, this gives them an opportunity to utilize our math program to the full.

362
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:09,255
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent, and thank you,

363
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:09,555
[SPEAKER_21]: Maureen.

364
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

365
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:16,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Through you to the superintendent, thank you for putting this report together Mr. Paulson.

366
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:18,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very comprehensive.

367
00:27:18,923 --> 00:27:28,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I as one member have been very vocal when it comes to MCAS tutoring and I'm glad to see that we're reaching out to the middle schools and helping with their math and other problems.

368
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask that you report back to your committee in

369
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:43,502
[SPEAKER_02]: late April, early May on the trials and tribulations of putting this program in place, see where we can do better, see what works, and possibly incorporate it into the other schools that need this.

370
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:45,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we discuss it?

371
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,265
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.

372
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:52,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Scarry just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?

373
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

374
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:54,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I just want to make sure of that.

375
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:00,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said.

376
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:06,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school.

377
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:15,589
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way.

378
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:26,575
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity to utilize it the best we possibly can.

379
00:28:26,815 --> 00:28:30,477
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, let's see.

380
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:34,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry.

381
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:38,560
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second.

382
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,841
[SPEAKER_11]: So all in favor?

383
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:40,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

384
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:42,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Any opposed?

385
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

386
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:49,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Chair, since we're expending money, I think we should do a roll call.

387
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:50,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call.

388
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:50,943
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

389
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:52,803
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion, Mrs. Cuneo?

390
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:53,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

391
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:54,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. DiBenedetto?

392
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:55,024
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

393
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:55,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Koretz?

394
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:56,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

395
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:56,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. McStone?

396
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:57,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

397
00:28:57,525 --> 00:28:58,105
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Scurry?

398
00:28:58,165 --> 00:28:58,365
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

399
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Vander Kloot?

400
00:28:59,325 --> 00:28:59,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

401
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:00,125
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor Burke?

402
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:00,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

403
00:29:01,566 --> 00:29:04,027
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

404
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:08,668
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can.

405
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:10,543
[SPEAKER_11]: and placed in file.

406
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:15,168
[SPEAKER_11]: So recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?

407
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:25,480
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to call upon Carolyn Joy, who's here, our Director of Mathematics, to come up and talk about the very generous gift, once again, from Dr. Martinez, I'm sure.

408
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:32,835
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, and thank you so much.

409
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:37,916
[SPEAKER_22]: We are now in our seventh year of the robotics at Medford High School.

410
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:53,141
[SPEAKER_22]: And the robotics team, every year they participate in what they call a football competition, and specifically design a robotics tournament for students in the New England region.

411
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:57,003
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're happy to present to you

412
00:29:58,383 --> 00:30:10,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Dr. Ventura has graciously donated some funding, a gift, to the Medford High School to enable the students to participate in this.

413
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:11,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

414
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:15,670
[SPEAKER_22]: Faiza Khan, who's here tonight, is the advisor for the club this year.

415
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:16,630
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

416
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:21,372
[SPEAKER_22]: Faiza might want to tell you a little bit more about the students and what they've done so far.

417
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:24,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

418
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:25,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for having me here.

419
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,636
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really an honor to be representing robotics team here.

420
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:33,678
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a great set of students and they are very diverse.

421
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:39,601
[SPEAKER_19]: They are very enthusiastic and they came to me and they said that Ms.

422
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Chen would like to pass the torch.

423
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:43,943
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you please take this on?

424
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:45,544
[SPEAKER_19]: And so here I am.

425
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:48,225
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm very excited to be the advisor.

426
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,645
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a great opportunity.

427
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:52,125
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really the kids that are driving me.

428
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:58,827
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate it that they came to me.

429
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:03,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Van Scor, Dr. Van Scor has been very generous.

430
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:08,129
[SPEAKER_19]: He replied back, his secretary replied back to my email within a few hours.

431
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:15,931
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I appreciate that and I'm grateful for the grant on behalf of the students.

432
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:17,031
[SPEAKER_11]: you.

433
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:17,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

434
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:18,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

435
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:24,575
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could just make sure that during the year you left students are doing, especially when it comes to their competitions, we'd like to see them.

436
00:31:24,955 --> 00:31:25,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

437
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:25,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

438
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,536
[SPEAKER_19]: The competition will be in April.

439
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

440
00:31:29,897 --> 00:31:30,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

441
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:30,597
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

442
00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:31,478
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion for approval.

443
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:33,078
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to approve.

444
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:33,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

445
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:33,899
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

446
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote, please.

447
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,620
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Scurry will be speaking first.

448
00:31:39,423 --> 00:31:39,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

449
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:42,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Joy and your cohort, I'd like to thank you.

450
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:52,950
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been, during my tenure on the board, every year, Dr. Vanshaw has always come up to help our kids out, and no matter what competition they go to, they always do well.

451
00:31:53,430 --> 00:32:05,196
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish you well in your endeavors, and I would ask that the school committee invite Dr. Vanshaw to a meeting, and he can present himself to us and to the community for his great efforts.

452
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,717
[SPEAKER_02]: deeds, and I hope he continues for many years to come.

453
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:11,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish you and your team much success in April.

454
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,320
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

455
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,740
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

456
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,780
[SPEAKER_19]: We are deeply honored.

457
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,201
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

458
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:15,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

459
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:15,481
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

460
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:16,762
[SPEAKER_19]: Vandiqua, did you have a question?

461
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:17,222
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

462
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:17,903
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

463
00:32:17,923 --> 00:32:18,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

464
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,183
[SPEAKER_08]: DiBenedetto.

465
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:23,466
[SPEAKER_08]: For you to the superintendent, could we please send a letter of thank you?

466
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:24,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

467
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:24,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

468
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,168
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year?

469
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:27,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Seventh.

470
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:28,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Seventh year.

471
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:29,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Seventh year.

472
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:30,970
[SPEAKER_11]: He's done a great job.

473
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, we appreciate all that he's done, all of them.

474
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:35,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

475
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:48,911
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to make it clear to everyone that the work that the students are doing through the department is not only incredible, but I've been told that at least one of the robots they're creating is going to apply as an internal candidate for my job.

476
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:54,754
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have known better than to say yes.

477
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:56,835
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the office.

478
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:58,736
[SPEAKER_11]: They're building this for you.

479
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,716
[SPEAKER_11]: So may I interrupt?

480
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:02,918
[SPEAKER_11]: motion.

481
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:04,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Second by, uh, Ms.

482
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Vander Kloof, I believe it was?

483
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

484
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call, please.

485
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:08,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Cuneo?

486
00:33:09,262 --> 00:33:09,522
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

487
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:10,823
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. DiBenedetto?

488
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:11,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

489
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:11,824
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Kretz?

490
00:33:12,064 --> 00:33:12,264
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

491
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. McStone?

492
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:13,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

493
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:14,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Scurry?

494
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:14,506
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

495
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:15,446
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Vander Kloof?

496
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:15,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

497
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:16,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor Berger?

498
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:16,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

499
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:19,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

500
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:22,571
[SPEAKER_11]: We will graciously accept the gift from Dr. Smith.

501
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:23,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

502
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:23,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

503
00:33:23,692 --> 00:33:24,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

504
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:24,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

505
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:29,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, report on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

506
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,781
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is something that's been in the works for a few years.

507
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:42,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Trotta has continued to be involved as the director along with Michael Skorka as the coordinator and you have some materials in front of you.

508
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:54,246
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna let Mr. Trotta tell you about what's here and have some of the students and Mr. Skorka tell you a little bit more because I think this is a terrific project and it's got tremendous implications for the development of our young people.

509
00:33:55,026 --> 00:34:02,086
[SPEAKER_15]: not only as academics, but as full-blown citizens in our community and in the world where I think that's a bigger need these days.

510
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:11,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Richard Trotter, Director of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, better known as the CCSR.

511
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:16,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I begin the report, though, I wanted to say that I've had the pleasure of working with Ms.

512
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:23,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Cugno and Mrs. Carey for many years, and both of you have been so supportive of all the programs and the schools.

513
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:26,257
[SPEAKER_01]: You truly have, you know, been, you know,

514
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:30,220
[SPEAKER_01]: a real positive influence on what I've been involved with.

515
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wish you well.

516
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:35,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I still see you after you beat the seat.

517
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:40,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thank you for working to help the kids in Medford.

518
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:41,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

519
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:45,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CCR has a mission.

520
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:59,592
[SPEAKER_01]: The basic mission is to create global citizens who will combat things like racism, bigotry, gender bias, and help promote positive experiences to other students in their own lives.

521
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:03,354
[SPEAKER_01]: help them become successful in the future.

522
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:11,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So the students who work in the CCSR, and we have some here tonight, they do positive things in the community.

523
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:13,397
[SPEAKER_01]: But it helps the community, but it also helps them.

524
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:20,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole point of the program is to make the world a better place, and you do it one student at a time.

525
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,002
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very active at the high school, and we are spreading the program down to elementary and middle school.

526
00:35:27,808 --> 00:35:34,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, we were very low on funding, so we basically just did the high school as the only major area for the projects.

527
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:46,455
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we have a grant from the Cummings Foundation, a $100,000 grant that we obtained, that's allowing us to expand the program and do more things in the school district to help the students and the faculty.

528
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:52,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of major things are going on.

529
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:57,769
[SPEAKER_01]: One is we've awarded 10 mini grants to faculty members to do projects at their schools.

530
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:02,774
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope a full report later on in the year when they've actually accomplished their work.

531
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:12,663
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now I can tell you that we have a project that did Thanksgiving meals for needy people with a French class, so using French cuisine.

532
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:21,225
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we're organizing a race, a road race to raise money for a charity with some of the students at the high school.

533
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:27,227
[SPEAKER_01]: We're beautifying the Meffitt High School grounds by planting fruit trees around the area.

534
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:29,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an environmental project.

535
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:41,630
[SPEAKER_01]: We're adding composting to the cafeterias at the high school to teach the students to be environmentally friendly and to maximize the resources that people use and not waste things.

536
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:50,794
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also helping at the Brook students, helping renovate a play area for other students.

537
00:36:51,494 --> 00:36:55,255
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the teachers down there is working with us on that and with the school people.

538
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of those mini-grants.

539
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:00,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Mini-grants, they have to apply for them.

540
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:03,297
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to show the project and what the outcome is going to be.

541
00:37:03,377 --> 00:37:08,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get them by, not competitive, but you have to prove that you're doing something valuable.

542
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:14,460
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have five total school leader advisors, similar to Mr. Skorka.

543
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:26,349
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just getting going now, and they're gonna be organizing multiple events at their schools, and provide leadership for the school, but also the students become leaders at that school, and set the role models for other students.

544
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:36,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that students typically do, they look at other students as role models, and if they see them doing positive things, we're hoping that that will spread, and more students will do positive things.

545
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:47,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now at the high school, we have a very active group.

546
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:50,926
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna go into that too much deeply, but it's coming up.

547
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:56,249
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 33 projects going on right now, and so I'll let Mr. Skorka and his students talk about those.

548
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,791
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the things planning for this year with the grant.

549
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:02,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we didn't have this funding before, so now we've got some new innovations going on.

550
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,136
[SPEAKER_01]: We've added professional development for teachers.

551
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:07,477
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be offering workshops.

552
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:19,627
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to work on SEL, social emotional learning in the classroom, and also ways of technologies that we can use to improve teaching.

553
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:23,169
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, one of the things that we feel strongly about is project-based learning.

554
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Project-based learning emphasizes student activity in the learning process.

555
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:33,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It emphasizes students being engaged and actually doing something they have an interest in.

556
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:38,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe by doing this, they will certainly gain a positive result.

557
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:42,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be more of an impact on the learning when they're actively involved.

558
00:38:42,914 --> 00:38:52,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things that we're going to do professional development on to help other teachers do that sort of thing, whether it's in our area of focus or their own area of focus.

559
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:58,422
[SPEAKER_01]: But clearly, project-based learning is a philosophical initiative that we believe in.

560
00:39:00,627 --> 00:39:03,948
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want to provide parents with information.

561
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:26,718
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have some activities at night, speakers and symposium type things that will help parents gain more information about how do you deal with anxiety with students, how do you deal with students who exhibit certain behaviors that might lead to problems with their self-esteem and their resiliency to fight negative activities like drug use and that kind of thing.

562
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:31,120
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also looking at new strategies in thinking and learning.

563
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:41,645
[SPEAKER_01]: The mirror neuron is a relatively new concept that students, people, identify with other people by mirror neuron in the brain.

564
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:53,812
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel that some students in early ages who lack empathy, maybe by going through this kind of a process of identifying with other people who have problems, will help them become more empathetic.

565
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:57,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a goal at the elementary and middle school.

566
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:04,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're also going to use the money that we have for resources on the web.

567
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:23,968
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to provide web resources for teachers and parents about this social-emotional area and about identifying positive activities for parents to use and teachers to use in the classroom and at home to make them, students, more positive contributors to society.

568
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:30,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last initiative was we want to share our mission.

569
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:36,570
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe that this kind of a program should exist in more public schools, more areas.

570
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:55,405
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend a ton of time doing academics, MCAS and all that, but there seems to be a need now to do more work in developing character and positive attributes in students that will lead them to be successful and not to be subject to things like addiction and prejudice.

571
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:01,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, as I finish, I want to thank the superintendent.

572
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:11,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually we, so this mission came and vision came from a conversation we had a few times back when we got the money from Bloomberg.

573
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:19,976
[SPEAKER_01]: So superintendent is part of the brainstorm behind this thing and he's always supported us and his support has been very critical to our success.

574
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:29,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the school committee, obviously all of you have supported us and I look forward to getting to do more with you guys and back again.

575
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:30,262
[SPEAKER_01]: You thought you got rid of me?

576
00:41:30,302 --> 00:41:30,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh you haven't.

577
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:35,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so are there any questions before I pass it on to Michael's book?

578
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:43,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?

579
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:44,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's three years.

580
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:46,679
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is our second?

581
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:47,580
[SPEAKER_01]: First.

582
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, OK, because we got it approved last year.

583
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:51,303
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is, OK, three years.

584
00:41:51,803 --> 00:42:05,374
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, just because it's been such a great program, and already there's been so much going on, at the end of the three years, have they already discussed, like, what the process is going to be, if you're going to be able to reapply for it?

585
00:42:05,534 --> 00:42:11,259
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are going to be able to reapply, or is this, like, one of those, you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time?

586
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:11,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.

587
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we'll get into that one.

588
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:17,102
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also not stopping with the Cummings Foundation.

589
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:18,222
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for other resources.

590
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:19,343
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for what?

591
00:42:19,423 --> 00:42:20,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Other resources.

592
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:24,685
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for other venues and foundations to contribute.

593
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:28,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but

594
00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:44,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students.

595
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:49,894
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors.

596
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:54,396
[SPEAKER_11]: with our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students.

597
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,057
[SPEAKER_11]: So you hear, you know, certain stories.

598
00:42:56,157 --> 00:43:05,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect.

599
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:10,806
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids.

600
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:13,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know the type of kids that we have.

601
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:23,431
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do.

602
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:31,113
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on.

603
00:43:32,073 --> 00:43:34,094
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would be amazing for them.

604
00:43:34,734 --> 00:43:37,075
[SPEAKER_11]: just as much as it's amazing for us and our kids.

605
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:46,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa.

606
00:43:46,361 --> 00:43:54,245
[SPEAKER_11]: It was amazing when I left there, because they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories.

607
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:59,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's nice, they're here, they're in our center of our square, they're in the center of the heart of our city.

608
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:03,251
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be nice for them to know what type of students we have.

609
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:05,603
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. Benedetto.

610
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:06,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

611
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:10,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted some more logistics about the grant.

612
00:44:11,209 --> 00:44:19,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know that Mr. Skorkis, you've retired from the school district, and you're still involved in this project.

613
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:23,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it your intent to stay with it for the next three years?

614
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:36,788
[SPEAKER_08]: And then does this project and this grant free up any teaching time for Mr. Skorka so he can focus on this or is this after school?

615
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,591
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that whole thing work?

616
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:46,517
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a mini, where he has some students, which is two times a cycle, a mini course.

617
00:44:46,597 --> 00:44:50,140
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of his work is on his own time after school, during free periods.

618
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:54,304
[SPEAKER_01]: So if he could get freed up a class, that would be marvelous.

619
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:59,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, does he get paid for his time in addition to his salary for this project?

620
00:44:59,508 --> 00:45:00,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that part of the grant funding?

621
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,449
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

622
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a stipend for him?

623
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:03,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

624
00:45:03,431 --> 00:45:04,412
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

625
00:45:04,692 --> 00:45:07,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And your son is part of this project?

626
00:45:08,015 --> 00:45:08,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

627
00:45:08,798 --> 00:45:19,027
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I just want to make sure that we're not burning out some of our finest and best within the district by having them wear too many hats.

628
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:27,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't know if it was something that the school district was partially funding by helping him with that, or if that's a dream in the future.

629
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:33,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the superintendent can enlighten me a little bit more of the logistics of all of this.

630
00:45:36,435 --> 00:45:41,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, all these programs, we seek outside funding to support them long-term.

631
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:46,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Originally, the funding came from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

632
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:48,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Cummings is the next round.

633
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:50,983
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a three-year grant.

634
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:56,166
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be looking to get more money into this activity and expand it and develop it.

635
00:45:57,107 --> 00:46:04,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I might tell you, I think I mentioned it once before, that Mr. Cummings, William Cummings, is going to be a special speaker at graduation this year.

636
00:46:06,052 --> 00:46:24,609
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll be having other outreaches to different people at different times, because obviously philanthropy is an important piece of what we do in order to keep some of these programs going and to develop them into model programs that can then receive even greater sources of funding long-term.

637
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:35,876
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the game plan, and obviously the great work, I think, you know, they'll tell you that they're finalists already in some outside programs, and they're already getting some great recognition.

638
00:46:36,437 --> 00:46:49,945
[SPEAKER_15]: I won't spoil this at this particular thing, but I was told on Saturday night that another one of our programs is going to go national, so I'm excited about that, but you can't find out about it tonight because I can't tell you.

639
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:53,207
[SPEAKER_15]: But these are the kinds of things we want to do, and as we do these things,

640
00:46:54,267 --> 00:47:06,255
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we attract sources of funding that are extraordinary and support our efforts to keep meaningful projects moving in addition to our regular academic and educational program.

641
00:47:07,216 --> 00:47:23,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So my point was, based on the social, emotional needs of so many students that I see, both at the district I work at and our district, and this book of wonderful things that have been done, I just didn't know

642
00:47:24,387 --> 00:47:34,316
[SPEAKER_08]: if we had plans on expanding this program so that way it's like more full-time position for someone from the Method Public Schools to manage because this is a lot.

643
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:38,139
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a lot of wonderful things and I would just hate for it to go away.

644
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:38,839
[SPEAKER_08]: To go away.

645
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:45,004
[SPEAKER_15]: We just need to develop it over time, you know what I mean, and develop other dimensions to it and create it in a certain way.

646
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:51,110
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things that's happening and something I'll tell you about at a subsequent meeting is the Commonwealth

647
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:59,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is launching what they call Celebrating Massachusetts Leading the Nation.

648
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:14,673
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had a meeting with representatives from the department the other day, and the purpose of it was to identify projects in our school system and some other school systems that would demonstrate how Massachusetts leads the nation beyond testing.

649
00:48:15,888 --> 00:48:26,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Because obviously testing is something that we brag about as a nation, I mean as a school system, not a school system, as a state, as a commonwealth.

650
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:32,236
[SPEAKER_15]: But there are many other dimensions to education that Massachusetts leads the nation in.

651
00:48:32,816 --> 00:48:34,217
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a good example of it.

652
00:48:34,837 --> 00:48:44,002
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's some other really terrific examples, our family networks, other things like that, that are really unique and model programs that other people should be trying to do.

653
00:48:44,862 --> 00:48:47,443
[SPEAKER_15]: because they fill the gaps that many communities don't have.

654
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:51,563
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is one of them, and this will also bring in resources.

655
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,084
[SPEAKER_15]: This is how you do it.

656
00:48:53,404 --> 00:49:04,706
[SPEAKER_08]: So just as we increase the number of school adjustment counselors and counselors and, you know, different behavior lists throughout buildings, this is a positive way to bring that forward.

657
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:11,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that as a committee, we should really look at positive ways to influence and to enable our children to become leaders.

658
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:14,548
[SPEAKER_08]: But in order to have that, we need to have people

659
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:25,052
[SPEAKER_08]: like Mr. Trotter and like Mr. Skorka to lead the way and have these programs and to really invest in this in our committee and I mean in our district.

660
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:26,672
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my point.

661
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:35,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make sure that you know we don't burn out people by trying to do everything and we just want things to be done well.

662
00:49:35,896 --> 00:49:36,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

663
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:37,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

664
00:49:37,116 --> 00:49:39,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else?

665
00:49:41,403 --> 00:49:42,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay, so thank you.

666
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:46,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to pass the baton to Mr. Skorka and the students.

667
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:47,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

668
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, good evening, Michael Skorka.

669
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:59,074
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the advisor at the High School for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

670
00:49:59,714 --> 00:50:00,475
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll keep this brief.

671
00:50:01,035 --> 00:50:10,783
[SPEAKER_16]: As Rich was telling you, right now at the high school, we have, you have the booklet in front of you, we have just over 35 projects happening.

672
00:50:11,764 --> 00:50:16,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of them are at the high school, but a majority of them are happening citywide.

673
00:50:16,988 --> 00:50:18,689
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm looking at the mayor here.

674
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,429
[SPEAKER_16]: You've met with a lot of our students already.

675
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:21,890
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank you so much for your time.

676
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,551
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you've met with three or four groups already, and you're meeting with another one next week, they tell me.

677
00:50:27,352 --> 00:50:28,812
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate the collaboration.

678
00:50:29,212 --> 00:50:31,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm thankful for all of your support, Superintendent Belson.

679
00:50:31,993 --> 00:50:33,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Very thankful for your support as well.

680
00:50:34,634 --> 00:50:38,475
[SPEAKER_16]: This is, like I said, a collaborative effort, and we couldn't do it without the support of you.

681
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:39,336
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you so much.

682
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:46,798
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to the 35 projects or so, we have 84 members at the high school right now.

683
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:51,560
[SPEAKER_16]: It has grown exponentially since the first year we started to include students.

684
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,902
[SPEAKER_16]: The first year at the high school with student involvement was only 18, so we went from 18 students to 84.

685
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,123
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's growing every single day.

686
00:51:00,163 --> 00:51:02,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I have students coming up to me asking to be part of it.

687
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:05,145
[SPEAKER_16]: and the club is inclusive of anybody.

688
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:15,610
[SPEAKER_16]: So anybody who would like to join that is interested in doing a project to help other people, interested in being a positive contributor to society, we're looking for them and we never say no.

689
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:20,853
[SPEAKER_16]: The point really is I'm really the guide on the side for a lot of these projects.

690
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:29,797
[SPEAKER_16]: The students approach me with something that they're passionate about, something that they've been thinking about changing or an idea that they had to maybe make the community a better place.

691
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:39,322
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I sit with them, I've sat with all 84 of them so far, and we come up with a strategy to make that plan happen, to set that plan in motion.

692
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:46,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe it's meeting with some of you, maybe it's talking to somebody in the building, or maybe it's just really starting from the ground up and seeing where the project can go.

693
00:51:47,306 --> 00:51:50,828
[SPEAKER_16]: All of these projects will happen throughout the course of the school year this year.

694
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:54,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of them, the majority of them, will be finished in May, where we have a fair,

695
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,692
[SPEAKER_16]: As Rich mentioned, we have started the CCSR at four schools now.

696
00:52:00,152 --> 00:52:05,695
[SPEAKER_16]: We're at the Roberts, we're at the Columbus, the Brooks, and I'm forgetting one.

697
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:13,219
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of those schools will be putting on a fair at the end of the year as well to showcase the projects that they have done.

698
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:20,984
[SPEAKER_16]: The fair usually takes place in May, and so we like to form, we'll send out a notification when that happens to invite you.

699
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:23,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I think some of you came last year.

700
00:52:23,745 --> 00:52:25,767
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember, Mr. Scare, you were there.

701
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:27,828
[SPEAKER_16]: I really want to thank you for coming.

702
00:52:27,868 --> 00:52:32,331
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you saw how passionate the students were and what great work they're doing.

703
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:39,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides that, I just want to let you know, tonight we're going to have really short presentations about some of the projects that are happening now.

704
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:41,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of these projects have already been

705
00:52:43,018 --> 00:52:46,361
[SPEAKER_16]: have already claimed national news.

706
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:50,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Some have been on Channel 5, which you'll hear from Stella in just a second.

707
00:52:50,764 --> 00:52:58,370
[SPEAKER_16]: And without further ado, before I announce Stella to give the first presentation from the students, does anybody have any questions?

708
00:52:58,411 --> 00:52:58,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

709
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:08,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Scowcroft, I'm really glad to see that your Orchards into the Fells will hopefully come to fruition.

710
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:13,891
[SPEAKER_02]: As a kid growing up in Medford, where the high school is now, that was once the city infirmary.

711
00:53:14,612 --> 00:53:17,695
[SPEAKER_02]: where indigent citizens in their later years ended up.

712
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:25,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And before they built the high school, there were pear trees, cherry trees, peach trees, four or five different kinds of apple trees.

713
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be really great if we could bring this back to that location.

714
00:53:30,265 --> 00:53:35,870
[SPEAKER_16]: We started cleanup just two weeks ago, just to start getting the area cleaned up.

715
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:44,237
[SPEAKER_16]: We're working with Miss Breda Smith at the high school, and so our goal by the end of the school year is to have that orchard ready to go.

716
00:53:44,498 --> 00:53:53,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure if you contact the Johnny Appleseed Museum in Littleton, they might be able to help you out with some apple trees.

717
00:53:54,086 --> 00:53:54,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

718
00:53:55,687 --> 00:53:55,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

719
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:57,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

720
00:53:57,578 --> 00:53:57,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

721
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:01,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So I see one of the projects is called Benches for Duggar.

722
00:54:01,582 --> 00:54:07,728
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if you realize this, but my, this is scary.

723
00:54:08,129 --> 00:54:08,990
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a new job.

724
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:13,975
[SPEAKER_08]: He builds beautiful benches and tables.

725
00:54:17,479 --> 00:54:22,045
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, you may want to write him up when there's building involved.

726
00:54:22,565 --> 00:54:29,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know he recently retired from his job as state auditor, so he does have the time to come and volunteer and help.

727
00:54:30,815 --> 00:54:31,695
[SPEAKER_16]: The students.

728
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:34,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I never say no to help.

729
00:54:34,296 --> 00:54:35,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone will tell you that.

730
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:36,437
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're hired.

731
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:41,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I volunteered them, but you know me.

732
00:54:42,058 --> 00:54:42,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll throw anybody.

733
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:46,859
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, yes, I will.

734
00:54:47,379 --> 00:54:47,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry.

735
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say throw you under the bus, but this week I don't want to say that.

736
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been there before, so it's nothing new.

737
00:54:54,021 --> 00:54:59,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, what I'd like to say is I would like to see some more PR about this.

738
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that the transcript is always at our meetings.

739
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:11,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering if we could highlight one of these groups on a weekly thing with the transcript and see where they are now in the planning stages.

740
00:55:12,078 --> 00:55:15,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And then every once in a while, pop a different group every week.

741
00:55:15,921 --> 00:55:19,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Or some way, since they're here and you're here,

742
00:55:20,773 --> 00:55:23,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping that we can push for that to happen.

743
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:24,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the moment.

744
00:55:24,596 --> 00:55:27,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'd like for all of you to join us.

745
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:28,259
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a Facebook page.

746
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:34,004
[SPEAKER_16]: It's funny to say that we just finished publishing this book.

747
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:48,056
[SPEAKER_16]: And so from this point forward on our Facebook page and our Instagram page, and you can feel free to follow us on both, we are posting each project once every three days so that the public is aware of the projects that are happening right now.

748
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:54,898
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is great, but a lot of us citizens, especially linking the seniors, as Ms.

749
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuneo suggested earlier, we need to imprint.

750
00:55:58,796 --> 00:55:59,176
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree.

751
00:55:59,336 --> 00:55:59,577
[SPEAKER_16]: And Ms.

752
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:04,540
[SPEAKER_16]: Cuno, if I could mention, one of our projects that's happening right now is called Tech Time.

753
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:12,645
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are three students that go to the senior center and they teach the senior citizens how to use technology.

754
00:56:12,725 --> 00:56:24,032
[SPEAKER_16]: So for example, how to set up a Facebook, what is Instagram, how to send an email, how to upload a photo, and how to take a selfie was a big one for them.

755
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:27,615
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they started in September of last year.

756
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:32,198
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the senior citizens have to sign up for an activity they want to do that day.

757
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:34,600
[SPEAKER_16]: And so only two signed up on the first day.

758
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,583
[SPEAKER_16]: And those two went back and told everyone else how awesome the session was.

759
00:56:38,923 --> 00:56:40,144
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they went from two.

760
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:42,626
[SPEAKER_16]: And the next month, they had 20 there.

761
00:56:43,206 --> 00:56:44,868
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they go once a month.

762
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:46,169
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're still doing it right now.

763
00:56:46,189 --> 00:56:47,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I did hear about that program.

764
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:49,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I had a lady who approached me on that.

765
00:56:49,591 --> 00:56:51,593
[SPEAKER_11]: And she was extremely thrilled.

766
00:56:52,233 --> 00:56:53,954
[SPEAKER_11]: that we were, that you guys were doing it.

767
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to say we, you guys were doing it.

768
00:56:56,716 --> 00:57:02,559
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something.

769
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes.

770
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:13,004
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that they get together on a Friday at lunchtime, especially around the holiday times.

771
00:57:13,044 --> 00:57:15,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And around the year, they have certain lunches that they do.

772
00:57:15,405 --> 00:57:17,325
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know why, because our kids are in school.

773
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:23,228
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves.

774
00:57:23,668 --> 00:57:25,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell them what you're there for.

775
00:57:25,128 --> 00:57:29,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing.

776
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that.

777
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,531
[SPEAKER_11]: That was what I was looking at.

778
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:33,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I did hear about that.

779
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,652
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a fabulous program.

780
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:36,873
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

781
00:57:36,933 --> 00:57:37,854
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a really great idea.

782
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:39,475
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it?

783
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:39,816
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

784
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:42,718
[SPEAKER_11]: So are we going to introduce the students?

785
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:42,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

786
00:57:42,999 --> 00:57:45,161
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to call up Stella Eliopoulos.

787
00:57:45,181 --> 00:57:47,303
[SPEAKER_16]: She's going to talk about her project from the CCSR.

788
00:57:47,503 --> 00:57:47,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

789
00:57:50,165 --> 00:57:50,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

790
00:57:51,086 --> 00:57:51,887
[SPEAKER_09]: My name's Stella.

791
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:53,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of you know me.

792
00:57:54,149 --> 00:57:54,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a senior.

793
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:59,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a part of CCSR since I've been a senior.

794
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:05,834
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my regrets of high school is not knowing about it earlier, not joining it earlier.

795
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:16,159
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't fortunate enough to have Mr. Skorka as a teacher, so I didn't hear about it until the spring of last year from one of his students.

796
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:19,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Immediately, though, I went and I talked to him.

797
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I'm interested.

798
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:20,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to join.

799
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:24,722
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he kind of got me in for this fall.

800
00:58:26,752 --> 00:58:37,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been a really great way for students that want to be active and don't necessarily have the means to be active and do these projects that they want to do.

801
00:58:38,898 --> 00:58:49,423
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a way for them to kind of, it's a vessel for them to initiate those projects and make a change that they've been hoping to see or that they want to move forward with.

802
00:58:50,284 --> 00:58:52,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, the project that I did

803
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:55,504
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually out of state.

804
00:58:55,845 --> 00:58:58,588
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in Houston, Texas.

805
00:58:58,889 --> 00:59:01,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much you all know about it.

806
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:08,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So over the summer, I was at this program in New York through the New York Times, and I met this girl from Houston.

807
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:18,210
[SPEAKER_09]: We stayed connected when we got back and right around the time the hurricane hit was when her school started and Hurricane Harvey.

808
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:28,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And so she said a little bit here and there about how it was affecting her and of course we heard it on the media, saw pictures and stuff like that.

809
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:38,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It was different for me this time hearing this personal firsthand account from someone that I knew, how she was experiencing it.

810
00:59:38,562 --> 00:59:40,743
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of school was canceled for her.

811
00:59:41,103 --> 00:59:42,943
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of her friends' houses got damaged.

812
00:59:44,224 --> 00:59:49,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I kind of felt that tug of compassion that I hadn't before with something like this.

813
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:52,066
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to do something.

814
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:56,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that I was part of CCSR, I had been searching for an idea for my project at the same time.

815
00:59:58,288 --> 01:00:03,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that connecting the two would be able to

816
01:00:04,178 --> 01:00:06,599
[SPEAKER_09]: do what I wanted to do with this help for Houston.

817
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:18,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And so with the help of Mrs. Skorka, Mr. Trotta, and CZSR, I planned a donation drive back in September, I think late September.

818
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:28,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And school-wide, so I had students, I encouraged students to bring in donations like toiletries, non-perishable items, clothes, different things like that.

819
01:00:29,068 --> 01:00:36,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And at first I was a little worried about students not really being active about the fundraising because I know that that's been kind of a problem in the past.

820
01:00:38,257 --> 01:00:42,378
[SPEAKER_09]: whether fundraisers are very widely known around the school.

821
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:45,099
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was very pleasantly surprised at the amount of goods that we got.

822
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:52,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was actually so many goods that we didn't have the funds to ship them all down because it was too expensive.

823
01:00:54,661 --> 01:00:56,801
[SPEAKER_09]: So here I got kind of stuck for a little while.

824
01:00:56,881 --> 01:00:58,682
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was trying to figure out how to get them down there.

825
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:05,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And we reached out to different organizations to see if we could get any help.

826
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:11,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Red Cross, once the Red Cross was like, we can't really help you out in shipping them down there.

827
01:01:11,638 --> 01:01:12,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, oh.

828
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:13,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I got kind of worried.

829
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:15,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought we were pretty stuck and that we'd have to end up.

830
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:27,410
[SPEAKER_09]: donating the goods locally, but I didn't want to, I mean, I know that if they were to have gone somewhere locally, they would have been appreciated, but I was intent on seeing my project through.

831
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:28,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to get them to Houston.

832
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:42,761
[SPEAKER_09]: So my dad and I ended up renting out a U-Haul, and we packed up the 10-foot U-Haul, and it was so full that we could barely close the door, and we drove it all the way down to Houston ourselves.

833
01:01:44,002 --> 01:01:56,472
[SPEAKER_09]: two days, and on the third day when we got there, we unloaded the goods at a church that we were able to get in contact with, with a person that my dad knew in Houston.

834
01:01:57,333 --> 01:02:03,138
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was very successful, and now we're sort of still in the fundraising process.

835
01:02:03,758 --> 01:02:10,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And none of it would have been possible without CCSR backing me up, and without their help, and Mr. Trott and Mr. Skorka helping me out.

836
01:02:10,985 --> 01:02:11,545
[SPEAKER_09]: And your father.

837
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:18,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And my, yes, and my dad.

838
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:19,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Very certainly.

839
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,289
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fabulous.

840
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:21,569
[SPEAKER_11]: That's absolutely fabulous.

841
01:02:21,629 --> 01:02:24,391
[SPEAKER_11]: And hearing stories, and everyone can do it.

842
01:02:24,431 --> 01:02:27,712
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that.

843
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:31,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And you also represented the students in your school doing that.

844
01:02:32,274 --> 01:02:34,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Talk about a great way of opening up your heart.

845
01:02:35,195 --> 01:02:40,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, and opening up your mind that for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us.

846
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,440
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be us.

847
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,283
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you.

848
01:02:45,684 --> 01:02:55,832
[SPEAKER_11]: And lucky enough, you know, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days.

849
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:56,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just wonderful.

850
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,394
[SPEAKER_11]: So anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?

851
01:02:59,575 --> 01:02:59,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Kathy?

852
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:01,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I just want to say thank you very much.

853
01:03:01,996 --> 01:03:05,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw the story shared on Facebook, and I couldn't believe it.

854
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you're here.

855
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so wonderful.

856
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:10,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for doing that.

857
01:03:11,123 --> 01:03:11,803
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredible.

858
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:17,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I really wasn't expecting it to become as big as it was, but it's all pretty exciting.

859
01:03:17,287 --> 01:03:18,408
[SPEAKER_09]: It was my pleasure.

860
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a lot of fun doing it and a lot of fun helping.

861
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:21,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

862
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

863
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:23,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

864
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Secretary?

865
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:24,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

866
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:26,773
[SPEAKER_02]: of information through you.

867
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:30,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can residents, if they so wish, send contributions to?

868
01:03:32,015 --> 01:03:37,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a little blog that I made kind of talking about the trip.

869
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:40,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And we decided not to go with an online donation system.

870
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So if people wanted to donate, they should do so through checks.

871
01:03:46,082 --> 01:03:50,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the posts that I made on the blog is about how to donate.

872
01:03:50,504 --> 01:03:52,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you write out the check.

873
01:03:54,580 --> 01:04:02,483
[SPEAKER_09]: you indicate that it's going to Medford CCSR for the Houston relief, and then you send it to the high school with the attention to Mr. Trotta.

874
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:04,904
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can assure that it gets there.

875
01:04:05,264 --> 01:04:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

876
01:04:06,865 --> 01:04:08,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

877
01:04:08,186 --> 01:04:09,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

878
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:10,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

879
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:20,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to pass it on to Luisa Barbosa and Rubia Fernandez.

880
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:20,611
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

881
01:04:26,454 --> 01:04:27,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Louise Barboza.

882
01:04:27,995 --> 01:04:29,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm Ruby Fernandez.

883
01:04:29,995 --> 01:04:33,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Between both of us, we work together on two different projects.

884
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:43,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the ELL program alongside Jenna Agnew, and Medford's Diversity Day alongside our another partner, Sarah Pondockley.

885
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,861
[SPEAKER_03]: With Medford's Diversity Day, we work with the

886
01:04:47,981 --> 01:04:52,526
[SPEAKER_03]: mayor's office and as well with the Human Rights Commission.

887
01:04:53,947 --> 01:05:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: What we plan to do with Medford's Diversity Day is to really showcase the diversity of Medford because we feel like it is not shown as often.

888
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:10,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just with race, we want to show the inclusion as well with disabilities and sexualities as well.

889
01:05:12,193 --> 01:05:19,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And with our ELL Give Back program, it has been recognized recently, nationally, by the KIND Grant.

890
01:05:19,659 --> 01:05:24,483
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were, out of nearly 200 contesters, we were the top 10.

891
01:05:24,904 --> 01:05:26,205
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're currently finalists for it.

892
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:31,469
[SPEAKER_14]: And with it, we work together to bridge the gap between new

893
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:43,078
[SPEAKER_14]: students coming from different countries and the difficulties that they may have doing regular tasks and just getting used to the art culture and the new environment.

894
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:50,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so with both of our projects, it really goes with the mission statement of what CCSR is.

895
01:05:51,275 --> 01:05:58,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So CCSR is really to make global citizens and do it one student at a time.

896
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:05,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And both of our projects are really near and dear to us, because we obviously come from backgrounds.

897
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:06,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We were both in the ELL program.

898
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:22,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we obviously want diversity to be shown throughout Medford and have everyone access to learn more about cultures.

899
01:06:23,739 --> 01:06:33,882
[SPEAKER_11]: When you say that you actually, do you, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to like introduce them to other students?

900
01:06:33,902 --> 01:06:45,066
[SPEAKER_14]: So what it was is that we created a website and it acts as an online database with videos and these videos are made in different languages by students themselves.

901
01:06:45,366 --> 01:06:51,728
[SPEAKER_14]: We try and focus on getting students that have been in the OLB program because it's a way to get back to a program that helped them.

902
01:06:52,468 --> 01:07:05,158
[SPEAKER_14]: And the videos focus on tasks that we know from experience are very different in other countries, such as opening a locker, getting a bus pass, how to get your money order, or submitting any community service form.

903
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:08,541
[SPEAKER_14]: And currently, we're working on expanding that.

904
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:13,404
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're editing a lot more videos and including more languages throughout the year.

905
01:07:14,205 --> 01:07:14,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

906
01:07:14,565 --> 01:07:15,086
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

907
01:07:16,427 --> 01:07:16,527
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

908
01:07:17,716 --> 01:07:20,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?

909
01:07:20,946 --> 01:07:21,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

910
01:07:21,528 --> 01:07:23,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And up next is Kayla Malone.

911
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:24,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

912
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:33,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Kim Malone, and I'm a senior at the high school.

913
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:36,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been part of CCSR for two years and a half.

914
01:07:36,577 --> 01:07:43,020
[SPEAKER_12]: I originally started helping out some friends of mine who were already part of CCSR doing a mural that they were doing for the club itself.

915
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:50,382
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, from the little snippets I heard about the club, I was very interested because it obviously showed a lot of potential.

916
01:07:50,822 --> 01:07:55,124
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, the people that were already part of it were already making moves, like,

917
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:56,545
[SPEAKER_12]: making progress.

918
01:07:57,265 --> 01:08:02,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Two friends of mine also created like a newspaper so I was like I want to like do something for the community.

919
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:17,163
[SPEAKER_12]: So I joined my senior year and we had to create a project and what was it for me and my friends it was a major like there are a lot of issues we're passionate about but one particular one was essentially that uh what is it

920
01:08:17,924 --> 01:08:34,837
[SPEAKER_12]: or Medford itself doesn't really have a lot of black role models in regards to, what is it, like teaching staff in schools and we wanted to create a way to bring black role models to, you know, the young students and what is it, we specifically focused on females.

921
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:40,621
[SPEAKER_12]: So our project was black female empowerment workshops and our last

922
01:08:42,022 --> 01:08:56,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Well our first one, our first workshop was last week on Wednesday the 13th and essentially we brought in speakers, pharmacists and two biomedical engineers who would discuss their lives, the struggles they face getting to where they are.

923
01:08:57,323 --> 01:08:59,705
[SPEAKER_12]: And also to give advice to the students that were there.

924
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:02,428
[SPEAKER_12]: And we had a very nice turnout of 20, 30 students.

925
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:09,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And so far, we've gotten much positive feedback from both the students and faculty that attended.

926
01:09:09,515 --> 01:09:14,379
[SPEAKER_12]: And it would never have been possible without CCSR, because they pushed

927
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:22,843
[SPEAKER_12]: The club itself pushes and encourages the students involved to find issues that they're passionate about and be able to engage it.

928
01:09:23,364 --> 01:09:28,746
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know definitely that this workshop would not exist if I wasn't, if this club didn't exist.

929
01:09:29,306 --> 01:09:36,510
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have four more workshops planned for the rest of the school year on half days in January, February, March, and May.

930
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:39,751
[SPEAKER_11]: The workshops that you had, were they videotaped?

931
01:09:40,132 --> 01:09:42,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, by Mr. Elliot Opulus over there.

932
01:09:43,693 --> 01:09:44,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.

933
01:09:46,355 --> 01:09:47,796
[SPEAKER_11]: But are they playing?

934
01:09:47,876 --> 01:09:49,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they playing on our studio station?

935
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:59,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing, the creative workshops.

936
01:10:00,223 --> 01:10:03,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped.

937
01:10:04,084 --> 01:10:08,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Even what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing.

938
01:10:08,565 --> 01:10:11,847
[SPEAKER_11]: But even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing.

939
01:10:13,587 --> 01:10:23,636
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react.

940
01:10:24,157 --> 01:10:35,907
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost.

941
01:10:35,947 --> 01:10:37,248
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be there to help you out.

942
01:10:37,268 --> 01:10:38,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's very beneficial.

943
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:41,044
[SPEAKER_11]: play that on our station.

944
01:10:41,084 --> 01:10:41,764
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be great.

945
01:10:42,444 --> 01:10:42,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

946
01:10:42,664 --> 01:10:43,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Van de Kloot?

947
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:48,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so I think tonight we've heard about three different projects, which are very different.

948
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:55,130
[SPEAKER_21]: And I thank you so much for coming forward and telling us about your project, and girls also, about your projects.

949
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:02,533
[SPEAKER_21]: When you look at the project portfolio that the school committee members received, the scope of the projects is really just amazing.

950
01:11:03,713 --> 01:11:09,976
[SPEAKER_21]: It makes me, again, feel so very proud because here we have kids coming up with projects, all sorts of different projects.

951
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:16,719
[SPEAKER_21]: What a wonderful idea to have role models come in and speak to our students and for you to be interested in that.

952
01:11:17,459 --> 01:11:25,727
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I read another one, one of our students, and I suspect we'll hear from her gladly so, is concerned about the styrofoam that we use for trays.

953
01:11:26,147 --> 01:11:36,657
[SPEAKER_21]: And I could go through each one because there were so many positive, wonderful projects that kids came up with, and not just came up with, but then went forward and said, we're going to do that.

954
01:11:36,937 --> 01:11:37,778
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to make a difference.

955
01:11:37,978 --> 01:11:40,160
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that you've already made a difference.

956
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,801
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm so proud that you're making a difference in Medford.

957
01:11:42,821 --> 01:11:43,922
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you very, very much.

958
01:11:44,022 --> 01:11:50,367
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm just grateful that the CCSR has flourished and taken off, especially.

959
01:11:51,047 --> 01:11:55,490
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know that the leadership has been extraordinarily positive and helpful in this.

960
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:56,631
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I thank them as well.

961
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:57,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

962
01:11:58,532 --> 01:11:58,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

963
01:11:58,852 --> 01:11:59,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

964
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:06,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for clarification, Mr. Spock, you had said that you're working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools?

965
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:08,631
[SPEAKER_11]: McGlynn?

966
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:10,873
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so everybody's included.

967
01:12:10,933 --> 01:12:14,396
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, is there anyone else?

968
01:12:14,436 --> 01:12:17,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair, if I could just make just a quick comment.

969
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I've gotten to meet several of the groups.

970
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:29,630
[SPEAKER_13]: And the passion that you've all shown when you're talking about what you've selected to bring to the rest of the school year has been amazing.

971
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:30,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And also the cross.

972
01:12:32,132 --> 01:12:32,673
[SPEAKER_13]: grades.

973
01:12:32,993 --> 01:12:35,175
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not just all seniors working together.

974
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:40,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen seniors and freshmen and just a whole mix that's really been refreshing.

975
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,560
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to thank you all.

976
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I know your advisors are fabulous.

977
01:12:44,062 --> 01:12:52,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Skorka, Mr. Torati, you're great people and you're really invested in our students and it shows because you're so polished and so mature.

978
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:54,871
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just really, really proud of all of you.

979
01:12:54,891 --> 01:12:56,833
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for sharing your stories with us.

980
01:12:57,963 --> 01:12:58,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

981
01:12:58,523 --> 01:12:59,484
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Justin.

982
01:12:59,884 --> 01:13:06,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I would also like to add that CCSR is an organization that truly makes Medford unique among other communities.

983
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:08,688
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it really helps to stand out.

984
01:13:08,728 --> 01:13:15,151
[SPEAKER_17]: If you just look at all these projects and the projects that we see in the portfolio, and we know that Medford students

985
01:13:15,831 --> 01:13:19,254
[SPEAKER_17]: like to give back, they want to give back, and that Medford is in good hands.

986
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:29,983
[SPEAKER_17]: It's one of the organizations that's central to so much in our community, and we see it in about everything that we do, regarding schools and even outside of the community.

987
01:13:30,403 --> 01:13:33,686
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I remember there was one meeting I was at, and

988
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:41,729
[SPEAKER_17]: There was just a whole list of initiatives starting in Medford, and almost everyone has attended back in the CCSR.

989
01:13:41,849 --> 01:13:50,192
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just love to thank Mr. Trotta, Mr. Skorka, all the students, all the student leaders for doing so much for our community.

990
01:13:58,698 --> 01:14:00,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I pass it.

991
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:02,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have a motion to approve?

992
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:03,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're all set, right?

993
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:05,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I entertain a motion to accept this?

994
01:14:06,423 --> 01:14:06,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

995
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:08,325
[SPEAKER_11]: By Mr. Benedetto.

996
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:09,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Second by Mr. Skerry.

997
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:10,767
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

998
01:14:11,087 --> 01:14:11,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

999
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:12,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Any opposed?

1000
01:14:13,903 --> 01:14:21,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, seven in the affirmative, the report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file, thank you.

1001
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:24,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to throw something out there.

1002
01:14:24,574 --> 01:14:29,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking.

1003
01:14:30,759 --> 01:14:36,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people.

1004
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:47,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city.

1005
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:52,652
[SPEAKER_11]: And this, this particular program, is something that the superintendent definitely worked on.

1006
01:14:52,993 --> 01:15:05,543
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was with his networking and finding the people that did it, and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford, and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant.

1007
01:15:05,963 --> 01:15:07,725
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to recognize him for that.

1008
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:09,085
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

1009
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:12,446
[SPEAKER_11]: And now for the report statement of interest.

1010
01:15:12,486 --> 01:15:13,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1011
01:15:13,326 --> 01:15:17,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Report on statement of interest application to NSBA.

1012
01:15:17,207 --> 01:15:18,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Superintendent.

1013
01:15:18,707 --> 01:15:31,429
[SPEAKER_15]: So we heard from the Massachusetts School Building Authority and the statement of interest that was put in place last year, last April, is not going forward in this round.

1014
01:15:32,109 --> 01:15:34,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I had a good long chat with

1015
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:38,191
[SPEAKER_15]: executives in the MSBA.

1016
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:46,073
[SPEAKER_15]: And without going through the whole report, a year ago 26 projects were approved based on available funding.

1017
01:15:46,153 --> 01:15:49,494
[SPEAKER_15]: This year only 15 could be approved based on available funding.

1018
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:55,396
[SPEAKER_15]: But we were strongly encouraged to go forward, to resubmit, to push the button, get it back in.

1019
01:15:56,257 --> 01:15:59,858
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have a feeling that a year from now we'll be in the

1020
01:16:00,538 --> 01:16:01,138
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be in the hunt.

1021
01:16:02,379 --> 01:16:04,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, there's work to be done.

1022
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,921
[SPEAKER_15]: We update a few more things than in the proposal.

1023
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:11,423
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think it's going to go forward, and I think it's just a year delay.

1024
01:16:11,743 --> 01:16:13,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one of those things happens.

1025
01:16:13,864 --> 01:16:19,187
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes the money coming from the pool is greater or smaller.

1026
01:16:19,727 --> 01:16:20,948
[SPEAKER_15]: It just happened to be one of those years.

1027
01:16:21,028 --> 01:16:24,950
[SPEAKER_15]: So from 26 to 15 projects, it is what it is.

1028
01:16:25,697 --> 01:16:25,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1029
01:16:25,897 --> 01:16:26,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Musto?

1030
01:16:26,837 --> 01:16:30,878
[SPEAKER_10]: It says 83 people of school systems applied and 15.

1031
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:32,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we know who the 15 are that?

1032
01:16:33,499 --> 01:16:37,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Hasn't been released yet, but when it's released we'll know.

1033
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:48,723
[SPEAKER_15]: I was told by the senior staff and their key people that the fact they came out and visited us on a full blown visit with architects and engineers, that we were very close.

1034
01:16:49,453 --> 01:16:51,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they have a few dates.

1035
01:16:51,894 --> 01:16:54,595
[SPEAKER_10]: One date for the accelerated repair is February 16th.

1036
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:56,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going for that one?

1037
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:57,837
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going for the core program.

1038
01:16:58,177 --> 01:17:00,358
[SPEAKER_15]: The core program is April.

1039
01:17:00,418 --> 01:17:03,779
[SPEAKER_15]: The accelerated repair, we already got money from boilers for that.

1040
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:06,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really a much smaller and more targeted program.

1041
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,582
[SPEAKER_15]: This is much more expansive and has longer term values.

1042
01:17:11,054 --> 01:17:14,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And is there anything you have to do for this application by April that's different than what?

1043
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:16,677
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to come back to you for approval.

1044
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:24,181
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just going to look over the application to see if there's any changes we want to make, if there are any things we want to emphasize or modify a little bit.

1045
01:17:24,701 --> 01:17:27,983
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we go back to the council and ask them to certify as well.

1046
01:17:28,836 --> 01:17:32,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So is it that the other people are more in need, that you think the 15 got it?

1047
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:33,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1048
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:38,805
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that they obviously prioritize by need, but they also prioritize by money.

1049
01:17:39,505 --> 01:17:46,231
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you have a project like ours, which could be a very expensive project, they have to be able to fit it in.

1050
01:17:46,932 --> 01:17:47,473
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1051
01:17:47,533 --> 01:17:47,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1052
01:17:48,013 --> 01:17:48,113
[SPEAKER_10]: OK?

1053
01:17:48,173 --> 01:17:48,293
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1054
01:17:49,174 --> 01:17:49,334
[SPEAKER_11]: And?

1055
01:17:49,955 --> 01:17:51,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Staff report, please, on file.

1056
01:17:52,508 --> 01:17:56,532
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question?

1057
01:17:56,552 --> 01:17:56,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1058
01:17:56,732 --> 01:18:06,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be starting... No, it's going to go back into the pool.

1059
01:18:06,622 --> 01:18:07,403
[SPEAKER_11]: A new application.

1060
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:11,186
[SPEAKER_11]: So a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee.

1061
01:18:11,206 --> 01:18:12,568
[SPEAKER_11]: No fee, just the approval, right?

1062
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I just want to make sure that that's...

1063
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:25,134
[SPEAKER_11]: the way that is, but in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this.

1064
01:18:25,615 --> 01:18:30,797
[SPEAKER_11]: With this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April.

1065
01:18:33,378 --> 01:18:36,541
[SPEAKER_11]: What happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing?

1066
01:18:36,642 --> 01:18:45,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved, or are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and saying, we really need to do certain things?

1067
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:53,740
[SPEAKER_15]: There are projects we'll go forward with, and there are projects that we should try to match up with MSBA because they're very expensive projects.

1068
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,922
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's plenty of projects we can go forward.

1069
01:18:55,942 --> 01:19:00,406
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be going to the council on technology in January and a couple of other things.

1070
01:19:00,446 --> 01:19:02,008
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to keep moving.

1071
01:19:02,048 --> 01:19:06,853
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a question of trying to get somebody else's money to purchase our own resources.

1072
01:19:08,434 --> 01:19:11,057
[SPEAKER_11]: So with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second?

1073
01:19:11,077 --> 01:19:11,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1074
01:19:12,478 --> 01:19:13,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Second by Mayor Burke.

1075
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:14,981
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

1076
01:19:15,281 --> 01:19:15,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1077
01:19:16,182 --> 01:19:16,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Any opposed?

1078
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Six affirmative, one absent.

1079
01:19:21,819 --> 01:19:24,980
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion to place the report on file is passed.

1080
01:19:25,841 --> 01:19:27,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Report on security cameras.

1081
01:19:27,982 --> 01:19:30,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so this is a report you've asked for.

1082
01:19:32,004 --> 01:19:34,505
[SPEAKER_15]: The committee has a much more detailed report.

1083
01:19:35,065 --> 01:19:41,529
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, as a rule, issue anything on security that could lead to someone

1084
01:19:42,469 --> 01:19:45,271
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, perhaps interfering with our operations.

1085
01:19:45,751 --> 01:19:47,532
[SPEAKER_15]: So the cover report speaks for itself.

1086
01:19:47,592 --> 01:19:51,774
[SPEAKER_15]: The committee, if you want to ask me specific questions at some point, please do.

1087
01:19:52,315 --> 01:20:01,039
[SPEAKER_15]: But for the general public, let's just simply say that we've spent approximately $200,000 on security camera upgrades and replacements at our schools.

1088
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:05,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Security cameras, especially external ones, are very fragile devices.

1089
01:20:05,662 --> 01:20:10,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Over the years, they have been susceptible to adverse weather conditions, unpredictable power outages.

1090
01:20:11,325 --> 01:20:16,248
[SPEAKER_15]: The newer models are a little bit more resilient, but are not invincible, and they're not invulnerable.

1091
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:27,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Placement of external calendars, cameras rather, on metal poles outside of the buildings tend to make them susceptible to lightning strikes, so we want to minimize that as much as possible.

1092
01:20:27,134 --> 01:20:27,895
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a few cameras

1093
01:20:28,335 --> 01:20:34,118
[SPEAKER_15]: We have no choice but to put them on metal walls because of the angle, but we try to minimize that and reduce that.

1094
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:39,901
[SPEAKER_15]: We've contracted with American Alarm to upgrade and replace various cameras district-wide.

1095
01:20:39,921 --> 01:20:47,085
[SPEAKER_15]: There's 154 cameras across the district in our nine schools, and believe at this time that we have sufficient coverage to

1096
01:20:49,066 --> 01:20:49,967
[SPEAKER_15]: ensure security.

1097
01:20:49,987 --> 01:20:58,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, there's some cameras watching different things that aren't as essential as the main cameras that are watching entrances, exits, and main pathways in the school.

1098
01:20:59,117 --> 01:21:07,385
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, some of those are still a little bit more work to do, but you can see from the backup report that most of it's being done and will be done very quickly.

1099
01:21:08,086 --> 01:21:11,810
[SPEAKER_15]: The maintenance of full security coverage will require that we annually budget

1100
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:13,390
[SPEAKER_15]: significant funding.

1101
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:17,612
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not something that we can just look at every once every five years or four years.

1102
01:21:18,432 --> 01:21:32,957
[SPEAKER_15]: It may be approved to set aside funding and a special account to ensure that it will be used each year for upgrades and replacements, as well as other security equipment that's related to that, like the Raptor equipment and things like that, because those things wear out after a period of time.

1103
01:21:33,777 --> 01:21:37,098
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's not used in any given year, we can roll it over.

1104
01:21:37,698 --> 01:21:41,422
[SPEAKER_15]: and use it in the year that we absolutely need it.

1105
01:21:41,482 --> 01:21:47,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Security cameras, I need to emphasize, are only one element of our overall school security and safety response system.

1106
01:21:47,509 --> 01:21:54,196
[SPEAKER_15]: We continue to interact with public safety agencies and to practice special situation drills at all of our schools.

1107
01:21:56,163 --> 01:21:57,364
[SPEAKER_15]: You have specifics.

1108
01:21:57,444 --> 01:22:01,126
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask if the committee wants to talk to me about any of it, you know, personally.

1109
01:22:01,927 --> 01:22:10,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd rather not be talking about anything specific about security that might lead someone to game the system at all.

1110
01:22:11,831 --> 01:22:12,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Skaggs.

1111
01:22:12,132 --> 01:22:14,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a general question through you to Roy.

1112
01:22:15,094 --> 01:22:23,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Roy, since the new schools have been built, has anyone done an audit of the cameras and the way they record the daily happening?

1113
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:24,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1114
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:31,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in some instances, you know, the cameras are there, but they don't, you don't get a full view of what's happening.

1115
01:22:32,785 --> 01:22:33,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that has to be addressed.

1116
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:34,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Cameras are two types.

1117
01:22:34,907 --> 01:22:37,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Cameras that move and pan an area.

1118
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:38,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Cameras that are fixed on an area.

1119
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:46,319
[SPEAKER_15]: The cameras that move are very expensive, but they're also more susceptible to needing more repair and upgrades.

1120
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,324
[SPEAKER_15]: We have upgraded our cameras many times since they were first installed, since 2001 and 2003.

1121
01:22:54,827 --> 01:22:55,768
[SPEAKER_15]: The system's changed.

1122
01:22:55,788 --> 01:22:57,148
[SPEAKER_15]: They no longer run DVRs.

1123
01:22:57,208 --> 01:22:58,389
[SPEAKER_15]: They're now more digital.

1124
01:22:58,829 --> 01:23:02,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Other things are different than when they originally were installed.

1125
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:04,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Cabling has to be different.

1126
01:23:04,532 --> 01:23:06,713
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to be locked into 911 right now.

1127
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:09,135
[SPEAKER_15]: So all these things require upgrades.

1128
01:23:09,435 --> 01:23:11,776
[SPEAKER_15]: And they'll continue to require upgrades as we go forward.

1129
01:23:11,816 --> 01:23:15,398
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've got good coverage.

1130
01:23:15,438 --> 01:23:18,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Some cameras cover the same area, but they cover it from a little different angle.

1131
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:30,151
[SPEAKER_15]: So, as we talk and we set up a meeting, perhaps we can go into an executive session, allowable for security purposes, I'll give you more detail.

1132
01:23:30,391 --> 01:23:35,677
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think at this particular point, we're in good shape, and I think we've moved forward.

1133
01:23:35,697 --> 01:23:38,920
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the fact that the mayor has authorized us to spend.

1134
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:42,182
[SPEAKER_15]: for the security cameras because this is a big expense.

1135
01:23:42,782 --> 01:23:52,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to thank Christine because Christine did an awful lot of work putting it together with Alan Arena in my office to ensure that we did all the work that needed to be done.

1136
01:23:53,192 --> 01:23:53,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

1137
01:23:53,933 --> 01:23:54,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1138
01:23:56,136 --> 01:23:57,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Through you to the superintendent.

1139
01:23:57,998 --> 01:24:09,112
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you so much for addressing concerns on the security cameras and making sure that all upgrades will be done by mid-January in every single area.

1140
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:11,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that as a committee member.

1141
01:24:13,773 --> 01:24:18,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to talk a little bit about locking of the doors, especially at our high school building.

1142
01:24:19,158 --> 01:24:21,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we made some changes and rules.

1143
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:25,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you just go over what that is or provide us with an update on that?

1144
01:24:25,405 --> 01:24:27,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me provide you with an update rather than try to talk about it.

1145
01:24:28,007 --> 01:24:36,295
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a big discussion about doors because even though we lock doors, we have buzzer systems and the like, somebody from the inside could let somebody in.

1146
01:24:37,136 --> 01:24:41,519
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've got to make sure that people know that that's not allowed.

1147
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:49,545
[SPEAKER_08]: And could you look at how the weekends are handled at different buildings and with people using our facilities and how they're locked after?

1148
01:24:49,885 --> 01:24:51,766
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm requesting, actually,

1149
01:24:53,067 --> 01:25:01,209
[SPEAKER_08]: requesting motion, I'm making a motion, sorry, brain freeze, to have that report presented to us by mid-January.

1150
01:25:01,709 --> 01:25:07,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to set up, if I could, a special meeting for this purpose, because I don't want to talk about security in public.

1151
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:08,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's great.

1152
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:13,512
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think if we start talking about security, if we start opening up what is and what isn't, it's great.

1153
01:25:14,312 --> 01:25:15,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a great idea.

1154
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:19,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So I make that motion that we have a meeting, a committee meeting.

1155
01:25:20,113 --> 01:25:20,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Committee of the whole.

1156
01:25:21,314 --> 01:25:22,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Committee of the whole.

1157
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:22,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1158
01:25:23,294 --> 01:25:27,099
[SPEAKER_08]: on security and doors locked and to school for different things.

1159
01:25:28,281 --> 01:25:30,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's so imperative in this day and age.

1160
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:36,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for all the work that you've done to make sure that we're moving forward in this direction.

1161
01:25:36,689 --> 01:25:42,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?

1162
01:25:42,397 --> 01:25:45,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't we make it as soon as possible?

1163
01:25:45,141 --> 01:25:46,963
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be the beginning of February.

1164
01:25:47,204 --> 01:25:52,751
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to get the work done and we want to get a lot of other things in place so we can be complete in our discussion.

1165
01:25:53,452 --> 01:26:02,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible.

1166
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1167
01:26:06,003 --> 01:26:06,703
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1168
01:26:06,963 --> 01:26:07,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1169
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:08,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Any opposed?

1170
01:26:09,826 --> 01:26:12,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes, and we will have a meeting.

1171
01:26:12,568 --> 01:26:14,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you receive and place this report on file?

1172
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, sorry.

1173
01:26:18,723 --> 01:26:23,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommendation to approve school lunch charge, I mean, sorry, charge policy.

1174
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:27,420
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration to talk to you about this.

1175
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:30,406
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a requirement of the federal government.

1176
01:26:31,502 --> 01:26:34,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for clarification, change policy or charge policy?

1177
01:26:34,363 --> 01:26:34,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Charge.

1178
01:26:35,143 --> 01:26:35,263
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1179
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:39,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Charging of a meal through the school lunch account.

1180
01:26:39,884 --> 01:26:40,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1181
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:42,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Breakfast or lunch, I should elaborate.

1182
01:26:43,425 --> 01:26:52,187
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, we are going to be under our review from DESE, the Department of Education, in February of 2018.

1183
01:26:52,467 --> 01:26:58,348
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a reoccurring audit event that happens every three years now.

1184
01:26:59,128 --> 01:27:01,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will be up for review.

1185
01:27:01,629 --> 01:27:13,059
[SPEAKER_07]: As we started to prepare our initial documentation, we realized that we do not have an up-to-date charge policy, which every district is required to have.

1186
01:27:13,659 --> 01:27:19,865
[SPEAKER_07]: So we wanted to bring forward a draft copy for review and approval.

1187
01:27:21,343 --> 01:27:35,655
[SPEAKER_07]: in regards to when students are going through the line and do not have money for lunch or breakfast that day and or have not qualified or submitted a pre-reduced application.

1188
01:27:36,076 --> 01:27:43,782
[SPEAKER_07]: So they would be of a paying status and or a reduced status that still requires money to come through the line for purchase.

1189
01:27:44,983 --> 01:27:56,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we have online capabilities so that parents and families can load the funds automatically on a routine basis, get reminders when the accounts are low.

1190
01:27:57,991 --> 01:28:08,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to ensure that we have our compliance and that the requirements are directed for implementing and enforcing throughout the school year.

1191
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:12,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So the purpose of this is mostly informative

1192
01:28:14,661 --> 01:28:23,945
[SPEAKER_07]: encourage and have the families understand that the meal programs are necessary to maintain a positive balance within each of their students' accounts.

1193
01:28:24,646 --> 01:28:30,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have charges throughout the district that range from five cents to $55.

1194
01:28:30,588 --> 01:28:38,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So in order to be able to pursue them in an accurate way, we need to have our own charge policy identified.

1195
01:28:39,172 --> 01:28:43,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So the school lunch program, again, is required to be self-sufficient.

1196
01:28:43,574 --> 01:28:48,116
[SPEAKER_07]: It cannot go in the deficit, and it cannot pay for its own overcharges.

1197
01:28:48,136 --> 01:28:51,317
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have something in place documented.

1198
01:28:52,097 --> 01:29:01,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a whole, as a district, we have a relatively low negative balance in relation to our size and enrollment for the schools, which is very encouraging.

1199
01:29:02,562 --> 01:29:05,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't have a significant issue at this time.

1200
01:29:06,343 --> 01:29:15,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a district-wide negative balance of about $2,500, and that's, as I mentioned, ranging from 5 cents to $55.

1201
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:28,020
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, some of these families will put funds on, but we need to have a mechanism to be able to remind them to be able to put prompts and have additional resources to reach out.

1202
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:45,884
[SPEAKER_07]: So the recommendation that we are providing and the draft language incorporates the mandatory requirements that we need for this type of a charge policy that follow USDA guidelines as well as school nutrition guidelines here in Massachusetts.

1203
01:29:46,404 --> 01:29:53,926
[SPEAKER_07]: So our recommendation at the end of the draft policy is to limit the number of chargeable meals.

1204
01:29:54,746 --> 01:29:57,927
[SPEAKER_07]: We've identified three meals for

1205
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:02,749
[SPEAKER_07]: the middle and high school students and five meals for the elementary students.

1206
01:30:03,249 --> 01:30:08,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Now again this does not mean that children are going through the line and cannot get a type of meal.

1207
01:30:08,592 --> 01:30:13,254
[SPEAKER_07]: They would get an alternate meal such as a cheese sandwich and other items.

1208
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:19,858
[SPEAKER_07]: What it does is it requires that we put prompts in place to notify families again via

1209
01:30:20,478 --> 01:30:31,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Email response through the online Nutri-Kid system and or notes home and or reaching out through the guidance departments if there could be some situations at home.

1210
01:30:31,671 --> 01:30:38,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, reminder to families that at any point during the school year, they can apply for free and reduced lunch.

1211
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:47,206
[SPEAKER_07]: If they are getting services from other entities through the Commonwealth, they would be eligible for free lunch and or reduced capacity.

1212
01:30:47,286 --> 01:31:00,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So encouraging that level of participation, if it's not directly a free and reduced application, that they are gaining services in other departments that we would then be able to reach those students.

1213
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:05,603
[SPEAKER_07]: So the document in front of you is in draft form.

1214
01:31:06,283 --> 01:31:11,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would like to be able to have something in place when we have our review coming up in February.

1215
01:31:11,625 --> 01:31:16,287
[SPEAKER_21]: So just a clarification.

1216
01:31:16,307 --> 01:31:24,951
[SPEAKER_21]: On the front page, you say we'll cap the charges at three meals for middle and high school students and five for elementary.

1217
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:29,933
[SPEAKER_21]: But then if I understand it, they can still take a regular meal.

1218
01:31:30,773 --> 01:31:31,874
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an alternative meal.

1219
01:31:32,255 --> 01:31:49,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the meal of the day was chicken nuggets and something else, there would be an alternate meal option that would not be the same type of meal, such as a cheese sandwich and or another alternate.

1220
01:31:50,427 --> 01:31:58,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't like to have the students come through and be in a situation where they've had a meal, and now they have to return it.

1221
01:31:58,751 --> 01:32:01,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is where a charge policy comes into place.

1222
01:32:01,932 --> 01:32:06,374
[SPEAKER_07]: We are able to prompt them, remind them up front, OK, you've charged two meals.

1223
01:32:06,414 --> 01:32:08,095
[SPEAKER_07]: You've charged one meal.

1224
01:32:08,575 --> 01:32:13,657
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to remind your parents or guardians that you need money in your lunch account.

1225
01:32:14,017 --> 01:32:19,360
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just trying to figure out, first of all, in terms of the alternate lunch, are cheese sandwiches

1226
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,522
[SPEAKER_21]: An option for all the time for everybody?

1227
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:26,266
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have an option for an alternate during the line, yes.

1228
01:32:26,566 --> 01:32:30,490
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, because one of the things that we worked hard is not to signal students out.

1229
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:37,774
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and again, it's not a factor of free or reduced capacity.

1230
01:32:37,834 --> 01:32:52,824
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a reminder that their account needs either attention in terms of pre-funding and or a notification to families to fill out an application that we can get them in that capacity.

1231
01:32:53,224 --> 01:32:57,967
[SPEAKER_21]: So three days in a row is pretty short time.

1232
01:32:59,188 --> 01:33:00,271
[SPEAKER_21]: is what I'm concerned about.

1233
01:33:00,391 --> 01:33:05,442
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm just thinking about for a family who's got a sort of short-term crisis, I mean...

1234
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:16,152
[SPEAKER_07]: In regard to the high school and middle school level, so we did look at other districts and some of their suggested language.

1235
01:33:16,192 --> 01:33:20,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are many that do not allow any charges at the high school level.

1236
01:33:21,533 --> 01:33:25,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So we tried to be a little bit more flexible and indicate.

1237
01:33:25,514 --> 01:33:28,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this is sporadic.

1238
01:33:29,235 --> 01:33:33,576
[SPEAKER_07]: If three days in a row, that's usually students can be forgetful.

1239
01:33:33,656 --> 01:33:36,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Parents might not have been able to get online.

1240
01:33:37,518 --> 01:33:51,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's a mechanism to flag either the guidance department and or to reach out to the parents in a more formalized manner to be able to say, you know, we need to provide some assistance and

1241
01:33:53,248 --> 01:33:56,330
[SPEAKER_07]: unless it's just a habitual problem with a particular student.

1242
01:33:56,650 --> 01:33:57,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1243
01:33:57,370 --> 01:34:07,815
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, obviously my concern is for the student who might have not yet signed up for a reduced price lunch or something, but all of a sudden there's a crisis.

1244
01:34:08,616 --> 01:34:11,077
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just wouldn't want them to be in any way signaled out.

1245
01:34:12,578 --> 01:34:15,479
[SPEAKER_21]: This is consistent, you say, with other school districts?

1246
01:34:15,919 --> 01:34:16,660
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have to have?

1247
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,340
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to have a charge policy, yes.

1248
01:34:18,681 --> 01:34:21,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'll be curious what other people think about it.

1249
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:23,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1250
01:34:24,574 --> 01:34:26,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I have similar concerns to my colleague.

1251
01:34:28,937 --> 01:34:36,823
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this day and age some families really struggle and paying for school breakfast or lunch is not easy for everyone.

1252
01:34:36,843 --> 01:34:37,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all who

1253
01:34:40,787 --> 01:34:45,952
[SPEAKER_08]: don't qualify for free and reduced have the funds available either.

1254
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:49,696
[SPEAKER_08]: They just might make a little too much money, but not enough for the whole month.

1255
01:34:50,437 --> 01:34:58,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just feel like children know that children didn't get the same lunch as them.

1256
01:34:59,673 --> 01:35:02,535
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're given the cheese sandwich, it is a signal.

1257
01:35:02,635 --> 01:35:07,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we're providing food, and I appreciate that we do that.

1258
01:35:08,598 --> 01:35:10,059
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a concern for me.

1259
01:35:10,299 --> 01:35:13,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see the number increase at the bare minimum.

1260
01:35:14,422 --> 01:35:16,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see no number there.

1261
01:35:17,163 --> 01:35:22,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And just remind us of the parent, because I hate holding children accountable for things that are out of their control.

1262
01:35:24,748 --> 01:35:27,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it's not the child, it's the parent's situation.

1263
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:30,832
[SPEAKER_08]: that causes the lack of payment.

1264
01:35:31,453 --> 01:35:39,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And having a school lunch person say to you when you're in the line and your friend's next to you, I'm sorry, you've already charged two over.

1265
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:44,344
[SPEAKER_08]: And someone hears it, it's an issue.

1266
01:35:44,624 --> 01:35:46,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just an issue for me.

1267
01:35:46,225 --> 01:35:49,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not really on board with it as it's written.

1268
01:35:50,189 --> 01:35:51,890
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I wanted to.

1269
01:35:53,130 --> 01:36:05,036
[SPEAKER_08]: to go back to the report I requested on December 4th with how many free and reduced lunch applications we received by building, by school.

1270
01:36:05,196 --> 01:36:09,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we getting the word out to everybody initially in September?

1271
01:36:10,418 --> 01:36:18,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a great undertaking, so I was just still hoping to get that report before we make changes to what we're already doing.

1272
01:36:19,364 --> 01:36:21,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

1273
01:36:21,165 --> 01:36:22,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still on the fence.

1274
01:36:22,465 --> 01:36:23,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a point of clarification.

1275
01:36:23,726 --> 01:36:25,607
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a separate item.

1276
01:36:25,687 --> 01:36:27,649
[SPEAKER_07]: This is mandatory for our review.

1277
01:36:28,049 --> 01:36:30,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So without this document, that would be a write-up issue.

1278
01:36:31,751 --> 01:36:47,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is why we're bringing it forward for draft form and discussion in order to, if that's the committee's direction to extend or provide a greater threshold, that's the prerogative of the committee.

1279
01:36:47,999 --> 01:36:58,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be aware that that could mean additional funds that would have to be addressed and or moved from a different source because the school service budget could not allocate that.

1280
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,526
[SPEAKER_07]: When does this draft have to be accepted by?

1281
01:37:02,287 --> 01:37:04,368
[SPEAKER_07]: We are under review in February.

1282
01:37:04,388 --> 01:37:04,428
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1283
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:14,354
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?

1284
01:37:14,594 --> 01:37:14,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1285
01:37:15,415 --> 01:37:16,436
[SPEAKER_11]: But the amount is it?

1286
01:37:16,936 --> 01:37:17,116
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1287
01:37:17,236 --> 01:37:18,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's a recommendation.

1288
01:37:18,377 --> 01:37:21,178
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a draft document for your review and discussion.

1289
01:37:21,599 --> 01:37:23,480
[SPEAKER_10]: So, excuse me.

1290
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:23,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1291
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:24,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Stone?

1292
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:24,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1293
01:37:26,303 --> 01:37:42,698
[SPEAKER_10]: The first page, the last paragraph under policy is students without meal money on a consistent basis will have outreach provided by the administration to investigate the situation more closely and take further action as needed to assist in providing an application for services.

1294
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:46,081
[SPEAKER_10]: So how, like I'm just thinking the process.

1295
01:37:46,422 --> 01:37:57,875
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lunch woman, I'm sorry I don't think there are any men, I'm not being sexist, sees that there's negative balance of $9.75 for the high school student.

1296
01:37:58,156 --> 01:37:58,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1297
01:38:00,258 --> 01:38:02,440
[SPEAKER_10]: dining service will then call someone?

1298
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:02,840
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1299
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:08,584
[SPEAKER_07]: So none of this would transpire in the course of the lunch or breakfast line.

1300
01:38:08,924 --> 01:38:10,585
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be outside of that.

1301
01:38:11,346 --> 01:38:21,713
[SPEAKER_07]: In the reporting capacity, we would be able to run a negative balance report and identify based on any thresholds that we've established to then reach out.

1302
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:27,357
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, with nothing in place formally, there's not a mechanism for us to

1303
01:38:28,598 --> 01:38:30,140
[SPEAKER_07]: to reach out to those families.

1304
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:36,045
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you're saying outreach, are you saying, I'm going to send them because I've gotten it low balance for Nevin at the Roberts?

1305
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:39,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you saying someone will actually call and say, is something going on?

1306
01:38:39,248 --> 01:38:43,552
[SPEAKER_07]: We would call and reach out to the family in that capacity because that would be

1307
01:38:44,988 --> 01:38:50,254
[SPEAKER_07]: they would likely not have an account that they're receiving the negative balance accounts.

1308
01:38:50,354 --> 01:38:56,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And or if they have, we would say, you've been notified, we need to address this.

1309
01:38:57,022 --> 01:39:04,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if there's a different type of hardship, let us direct you in the right area for services to be provided elsewhere.

1310
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,613
[SPEAKER_10]: and will it be your office that will be doing the calling?

1311
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:19,552
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this is food service that they have access to the reports and they run them on a daily basis for their number of meals served, all of that activity that they could run on a daily basis.

1312
01:39:20,415 --> 01:39:20,615
[SPEAKER_11]: May I?

1313
01:39:20,675 --> 01:39:21,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1314
01:39:21,536 --> 01:39:21,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1315
01:39:21,596 --> 01:39:22,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Van de Klooten, and then we'll go.

1316
01:39:23,937 --> 01:39:24,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

1317
01:39:24,297 --> 01:39:33,641
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that having some threshold where the account is followed up on, that's not a problem for me.

1318
01:39:34,542 --> 01:39:42,405
[SPEAKER_21]: I definitely think that all of a sudden the kid goes through the line and they get a different meal is a problem for me.

1319
01:39:42,905 --> 01:39:45,667
[SPEAKER_21]: I would rather them still be able to take the regular meal.

1320
01:39:52,866 --> 01:39:54,467
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, because it still shows up.

1321
01:39:54,487 --> 01:39:57,971
[SPEAKER_21]: The follow-up would still be necessary, right?

1322
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:03,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they would be in a negative capacity going through the line.

1323
01:40:03,054 --> 01:40:07,056
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it says here, I mean, because there's a punishment instated in here.

1324
01:40:07,116 --> 01:40:14,338
[SPEAKER_21]: The child will be allowed to take a meal, and that meal will continue to be charged to the account at the standard lunch rate based on their meal benefit.

1325
01:40:14,898 --> 01:40:21,961
[SPEAKER_21]: So if the meal is three and a quarter, even though they're getting a cheese sandwich rather than chicken nuggets, they're being charged the same three and a quarter.

1326
01:40:22,541 --> 01:40:25,302
[SPEAKER_21]: To me, there is a punishment there, and I'm not comfortable with that.

1327
01:40:26,275 --> 01:40:29,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is going in the school nutrition guidelines.

1328
01:40:29,776 --> 01:40:35,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's nothing occurring that is outside of that context.

1329
01:40:36,139 --> 01:40:44,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, if it's the purview of the committee, there would be no item that was altered in that regard.

1330
01:40:44,762 --> 01:40:52,225
[SPEAKER_07]: That is what is provided as the USDA alternative and or to encourage participation and or

1331
01:40:53,425 --> 01:41:01,130
[SPEAKER_07]: looking for additional services and resources in order to possibly get free or reduced capacity.

1332
01:41:01,470 --> 01:41:06,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the intent of, and that's the school nutrition program itself.

1333
01:41:06,573 --> 01:41:07,834
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a Medford item that we're.

1334
01:41:10,155 --> 01:41:10,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1335
01:41:11,215 --> 01:41:16,877
[SPEAKER_21]: So I understand that it's important for us to have some thresholds so that parents are contacted.

1336
01:41:17,337 --> 01:41:22,738
[SPEAKER_21]: And I understand that the alternative lunch meets the same criteria.

1337
01:41:23,159 --> 01:41:24,299
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm not comfortable with that.

1338
01:41:24,459 --> 01:41:25,459
[SPEAKER_21]: Substitution.

1339
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't substitute.

1340
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,901
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm comfortable with saying, OK, flag the account.

1341
01:41:31,201 --> 01:41:32,881
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to talk to the parents.

1342
01:41:33,201 --> 01:41:33,701
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine.

1343
01:41:34,201 --> 01:41:34,802
[SPEAKER_21]: That makes sense.

1344
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:39,143
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm not comfortable with changing the lunch for the student.

1345
01:41:40,849 --> 01:41:42,197
[SPEAKER_21]: That just doesn't sit well with me.

1346
01:41:43,798 --> 01:41:48,540
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's important that you understand one fundamental point about all this.

1347
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:53,881
[SPEAKER_15]: The federal government gives us money to subsidize lunches for free and reduced.

1348
01:41:54,882 --> 01:42:12,168
[SPEAKER_15]: If people are getting lunches who are not eligible because they haven't either done the work or haven't, you know, filled out their work or actually been declared eligible, the federal government looks at that as us taking their money to subsidize people who otherwise should be paying.

1349
01:42:13,008 --> 01:42:15,709
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where the federal law comes into play.

1350
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:21,492
[SPEAKER_15]: They're concerned, and by the way, there are communities in the Commonwealth that have run up balances of $50,000, $60,000, $70,000.

1351
01:42:21,993 --> 01:42:25,494
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, was it Wellesley?

1352
01:42:25,595 --> 01:42:26,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Framingham was one.

1353
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:32,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Framingham, Wellesley, places like that really got slammed because people were taking lunches on a regular basis.

1354
01:42:32,938 --> 01:42:34,099
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to have something.

1355
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:41,223
[SPEAKER_15]: But it has to be reasonable so we can be defended with the feds when they come in and do the audit.

1356
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:50,269
[SPEAKER_15]: But the reason behind it is when they give us a free lunch and they pay for it, they're saying that we want to pay the kid that's eligible.

1357
01:42:50,309 --> 01:42:52,711
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want to pay for somebody who's just never paying.

1358
01:42:53,531 --> 01:42:54,492
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the way they look at it.

1359
01:42:54,953 --> 01:42:57,214
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've got to find some way to get something on the books.

1360
01:42:57,895 --> 01:43:01,297
[SPEAKER_15]: If not tonight, we certainly have to do it early in January.

1361
01:43:01,898 --> 01:43:08,763
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you want us to come back with some, you know, something a little less, let's say, severe as far as you're looking at it, that's fine.

1362
01:43:08,803 --> 01:43:11,305
[SPEAKER_15]: But we've got to do something that's got to be on the books.

1363
01:43:13,378 --> 01:43:15,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I move that this paper be tabled.

1364
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:16,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1365
01:43:16,781 --> 01:43:18,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Burke, will you withdraw?

1366
01:43:18,762 --> 01:43:18,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1367
01:43:19,222 --> 01:43:19,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1368
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:26,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Christine, could you just explain where in the policy the three meals for middle and high school and five for elementary are?

1369
01:43:26,195 --> 01:43:27,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm having trouble.

1370
01:43:27,796 --> 01:43:28,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not.

1371
01:43:28,336 --> 01:43:28,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not in there.

1372
01:43:28,957 --> 01:43:30,278
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a recommendation.

1373
01:43:30,378 --> 01:43:33,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to put some sort of a threshold.

1374
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:35,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't include it in the draft document.

1375
01:43:35,742 --> 01:43:36,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I left it open for discussion.

1376
01:43:36,663 --> 01:43:37,944
[SPEAKER_07]: So the draft should include.

1377
01:43:38,164 --> 01:43:38,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1378
01:43:38,865 --> 01:43:39,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1379
01:43:39,585 --> 01:43:41,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I was struggling to find that.

1380
01:43:41,187 --> 01:43:41,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1381
01:43:41,647 --> 01:43:41,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1382
01:43:41,867 --> 01:43:42,308
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not.

1383
01:43:42,348 --> 01:43:42,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

1384
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:56,076
[SPEAKER_13]: The policy states is that if you reach zero, you're not allowed to get a la carte items such as a second entree or an additional beverage or snack.

1385
01:43:56,337 --> 01:43:56,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

1386
01:43:57,277 --> 01:43:58,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, in that.

1387
01:43:58,338 --> 01:44:00,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Non a la carte is a cheese sandwich?

1388
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:02,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct?

1389
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:03,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be a meal.

1390
01:44:03,701 --> 01:44:15,089
[SPEAKER_07]: So once they, if they're not paying for their regular meal, the item is not, you should not be allowed to charge other items, such as.

1391
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:16,950
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of makes sense.

1392
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:18,631
[SPEAKER_13]: That you can't get extra stuff.

1393
01:44:18,911 --> 01:44:19,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1394
01:44:19,051 --> 01:44:21,032
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can't pay for the core lunch.

1395
01:44:21,313 --> 01:44:22,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that makes sense.

1396
01:44:22,613 --> 01:44:22,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

1397
01:44:24,007 --> 01:44:27,208
[SPEAKER_13]: You're defining the core lunch as, is it just a Tuesday lunch?

1398
01:44:27,288 --> 01:44:27,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there options?

1399
01:44:27,908 --> 01:44:31,028
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I was giving that as an example of an alternate.

1400
01:44:33,009 --> 01:44:33,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1401
01:44:33,629 --> 01:44:35,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess what Ms.

1402
01:44:35,849 --> 01:44:46,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Vanden Heuvel said, if the parents are going to be called anyway, because that is going to be an underbalance, right?

1403
01:44:46,431 --> 01:44:51,492
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be called and said, gee, you have extra, you have minus balance on this.

1404
01:44:51,552 --> 01:44:52,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it really matter if it's like,

1405
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:59,638
[SPEAKER_11]: a cheeseburger or if it's a salad, I mean, they're going to be under the amount no matter what, and they'll be notified.

1406
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:11,053
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess my suggestion for this, and I know that you still want to speak, but my suggestion for this is that why don't we look at this and approve

1407
01:45:11,979 --> 01:45:15,322
[SPEAKER_11]: what you need to be approved as far as what we need for the federal government.

1408
01:45:15,382 --> 01:45:16,564
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have that piece.

1409
01:45:16,984 --> 01:45:19,226
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't approve, make it separate.

1410
01:45:19,266 --> 01:45:23,831
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't approve the amount until maybe you could come back with something a little bit better.

1411
01:45:24,331 --> 01:45:31,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that the amount and or the threshold is what really kind of helps drive what the policy and what we're able to.

1412
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:34,420
[SPEAKER_07]: act upon at that point.

1413
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:51,908
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have any direction at this point in order to reach out in a true capacity and say, obviously we can take a look at our current negative balances and go from there, but that's just a guideline.

1414
01:45:51,988 --> 01:45:57,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking for something formalized in which they will be looking for as well for the review process.

1415
01:45:57,551 --> 01:46:05,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So whether it's just identified as a dollar threshold, a number of meals, this was merely a suggestion for that language.

1416
01:46:05,856 --> 01:46:16,663
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to cap it at $50 per child, again, recognizing at the end of the year that has to be made up every year and cannot be funded by the school lunch program.

1417
01:46:18,578 --> 01:46:27,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a cost difference between the cheese sandwich meal and the other meal that the school system is like paying more for one than the other?

1418
01:46:27,671 --> 01:46:28,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there is.

1419
01:46:29,373 --> 01:46:30,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it significant?

1420
01:46:30,475 --> 01:46:31,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be.

1421
01:46:32,798 --> 01:46:33,318
[SPEAKER_07]: day-to-day.

1422
01:46:33,778 --> 01:46:41,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't give you an exact amount every day, but if you're serving a cheeseburger versus a peanut butter sandwich, yes, there's a cost differential there.

1423
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:48,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's based on federal guidelines and what we're required to provide.

1424
01:46:49,841 --> 01:46:56,963
[SPEAKER_08]: My second question is, can we pass this without changing the food we offer to the children?

1425
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:14,186
[SPEAKER_08]: without substituting the meal, contacting parents after three missed days, reaching out to do all the outsourcing, contacting them to get payment without saying, now you have this separate meal.

1426
01:47:14,366 --> 01:47:15,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we do it that way?

1427
01:47:16,167 --> 01:47:23,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I will have to look and get clarification through the SNA if that wording specifically is acceptable.

1428
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:39,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we do have federal guidelines that we have to adhere to and this may be derivative of that because the federal government is subsidizing these meals through free and reduced programs at a much higher rate than the state.

1429
01:47:39,519 --> 01:47:40,479
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would have to be

1430
01:47:42,527 --> 01:47:43,347
[SPEAKER_07]: closer reviewed.

1431
01:47:43,567 --> 01:47:55,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm making a motion at this point that you go back and you look at the guidelines to see if we can accept this without changing the actual lunch that the students get.

1432
01:47:56,653 --> 01:47:58,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And if so, great.

1433
01:47:58,253 --> 01:48:04,496
[SPEAKER_08]: And if not, how much leeway we have in the number of meals that we need to

1434
01:48:05,376 --> 01:48:08,920
[SPEAKER_08]: to a minimum number or the largest number we can put down.

1435
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:13,385
[SPEAKER_07]: The leeway of number of meals is really per the committee's.

1436
01:48:14,506 --> 01:48:15,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could say 20.

1437
01:48:16,008 --> 01:48:25,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying that that was a recommendation based on food service and how we've looked at other communities in that regard.

1438
01:48:25,858 --> 01:48:33,740
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, recognizing the cost implication at the end of a year, trying to collect on some of those negative balances.

1439
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:38,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So we wanted to just put something in relatively conservative as a starting point.

1440
01:48:38,621 --> 01:48:45,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is a draft document to review as a first round and certainly go from there.

1441
01:48:45,883 --> 01:48:55,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So the motion's on the floor right now for her to check the wording to see if we can do this and move forward without changing the lunches for any of the students.

1442
01:48:56,786 --> 01:48:57,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a second.

1443
01:48:57,507 --> 01:48:57,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I second.

1444
01:48:58,508 --> 01:48:58,648
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1445
01:48:58,728 --> 01:49:06,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.

1446
01:49:06,516 --> 01:49:15,926
[SPEAKER_08]: To see if we can meet the federal requirements without changing the mail options for our students.

1447
01:49:16,026 --> 01:49:17,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And second by Mrs. Bandicoot.

1448
01:49:18,438 --> 01:49:19,500
[SPEAKER_13]: All in favor?

1449
01:49:20,422 --> 01:49:26,492
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could also get the actual language that you want inserted into the document, so in policy language terms.

1450
01:49:27,817 --> 01:49:28,857
[SPEAKER_13]: of a few different options.

1451
01:49:29,358 --> 01:49:33,079
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of a threshold for chargeability?

1452
01:49:33,259 --> 01:49:33,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1453
01:49:33,459 --> 01:49:34,519
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, very good.

1454
01:49:34,599 --> 01:49:46,022
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report.

1455
01:49:46,182 --> 01:49:46,962
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1456
01:49:47,202 --> 01:49:47,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1457
01:49:48,203 --> 01:49:49,063
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1458
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:50,830
[SPEAKER_11]: The ayes have it.

1459
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:55,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to place this on file for our following week.

1460
01:49:55,712 --> 01:50:04,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one final reminder to our families that this week Stop and Shop has generously donated free lunch to all the students within the district.

1461
01:50:04,996 --> 01:50:07,997
[SPEAKER_07]: So on Thursday the 21st.

1462
01:50:08,137 --> 01:50:09,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So nobody has to worry about that.

1463
01:50:10,078 --> 01:50:11,598
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you to Stop and Shop.

1464
01:50:11,878 --> 01:50:13,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you to Stop and Shop.

1465
01:50:16,201 --> 01:50:19,124
[SPEAKER_11]: to send out a letter of recognition and thanking them.

1466
01:50:19,565 --> 01:50:20,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Justin, I think we did.

1467
01:50:21,287 --> 01:50:23,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you still want to say something on this?

1468
01:50:23,109 --> 01:50:32,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, I just wanted to echo what committee member said about having to make sure that

1469
01:50:33,421 --> 01:50:39,163
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not discriminating against students because they don't have the financial need for a bunch of circumstances.

1470
01:50:39,703 --> 01:50:49,967
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was also concerned that the word that you pointed out with regard to having two bunches of different policies charged at the same price.

1471
01:50:50,908 --> 01:50:55,329
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that's equal, and I think that needs to be reviewed.

1472
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1473
01:50:57,690 --> 01:50:57,810
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1474
01:50:57,970 --> 01:50:59,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Negotiations and legal matters, there are none.

1475
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:03,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1476
01:51:04,381 --> 01:51:05,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And two items under suspension.

1477
01:51:05,661 --> 01:51:07,703
[SPEAKER_11]: May I have a motion to entertain?

1478
01:51:07,743 --> 01:51:09,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for suspension of the rules.

1479
01:51:10,104 --> 01:51:10,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded.

1480
01:51:11,865 --> 01:51:13,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to suspend the rules by Mayor Burke.

1481
01:51:14,206 --> 01:51:14,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Ms.

1482
01:51:14,947 --> 01:51:15,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Vanderpool.

1483
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:20,350
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Dr. Perrault is here.

1484
01:51:20,370 --> 01:51:22,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I gave you two reports tonight.

1485
01:51:22,991 --> 01:51:24,592
[SPEAKER_15]: One is on the bus situation.

1486
01:51:24,632 --> 01:51:25,813
[SPEAKER_15]: The other is on vaping.

1487
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:38,430
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think we need major discussion tonight, but I want to give you an opportunity to get up-to-date on this, so you're aware of what's going on, and we can follow up and give you additional information as we go forward.

1488
01:51:38,671 --> 01:51:49,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Prowler has met with us today, and we've met with the bus company, we've met with the police, we've done a whole pile of things, and let Dr. Prowler explain the reports in front of you.

1489
01:51:51,323 --> 01:51:51,623
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1490
01:51:52,363 --> 01:51:53,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, colleagues.

1491
01:51:53,404 --> 01:52:01,506
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's begin, as well, by thanking and congratulating two outgoing members, Mr. Scarry and Ms.

1492
01:52:01,526 --> 01:52:01,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Cunha.

1493
01:52:02,486 --> 01:52:04,907
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been an honor and pleasure to work with you the past six years.

1494
01:52:05,047 --> 01:52:08,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Both of you do the city of Medford dignity and honor in your service.

1495
01:52:08,768 --> 01:52:08,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1496
01:52:09,609 --> 01:52:09,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1497
01:52:10,569 --> 01:52:15,070
[SPEAKER_18]: The two reports that I presented to the superintendent are obviously quite different.

1498
01:52:15,170 --> 01:52:19,232
[SPEAKER_18]: One is on vaping concerns in the building, as well as some of the

1499
01:52:20,312 --> 01:52:31,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the maneuvers we have made to adjust regarding the North Menden bus, I'd be happy to answer any questions regarding those if you like, or I can present them as well if you like.

1500
01:52:34,084 --> 01:52:34,584
[SPEAKER_20]: brief presentation?

1501
01:52:34,924 --> 01:52:35,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1502
01:52:35,965 --> 01:52:38,025
[SPEAKER_18]: We can begin with the North Manfred Bus.

1503
01:52:39,226 --> 01:52:52,130
[SPEAKER_18]: In response to the incident that took place on Friday, December 15th, we have spent many hours meeting to discuss what took place and why it took place and how we best ensure that nothing like that happens again.

1504
01:52:52,730 --> 01:52:55,471
[SPEAKER_18]: In the review of our data, we did notice that the North Manfred Bus

1505
01:52:56,071 --> 01:53:12,381
[SPEAKER_18]: has not been filled to capacity over the past few months since we instituted a listing and basically we confirmed students who are utilizing the bus during the afternoon.

1506
01:53:13,382 --> 01:53:20,387
[SPEAKER_18]: We have also decided to change the location of the drop-off and pick-up for the North Bedford bus.

1507
01:53:20,427 --> 01:53:25,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Initially, it had been in the executive loop, which, if you know anything about it, logistically is a concern.

1508
01:53:26,292 --> 01:53:28,734
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of traffic during the end of the day in that area.

1509
01:53:30,415 --> 01:53:34,796
[SPEAKER_18]: And we do have supervision in that area, but it also encompasses a larger chunk of space.

1510
01:53:35,296 --> 01:53:42,897
[SPEAKER_18]: So beginning this afternoon, actually, we changed the bus route to meet in the West Courtyard area where the MBTA buses go.

1511
01:53:43,257 --> 01:53:49,439
[SPEAKER_18]: This is much easier for us to control because we have a system in place there with the buses.

1512
01:53:49,519 --> 01:53:50,999
[SPEAKER_18]: And today, it went really smoothly.

1513
01:53:51,279 --> 01:53:56,660
[SPEAKER_18]: There were 44 members of our student body that took the bus this afternoon without any incident or concern.

1514
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:12,307
[SPEAKER_18]: We also will be meeting with the students who signed up for that bus tomorrow afternoon with the police department to discuss concerns regarding behaviors and appropriate approaches when getting on the bus.

1515
01:54:12,907 --> 01:54:16,328
[SPEAKER_18]: For the remainder of the school year, we do have two assistant principals that are assigned

1516
01:54:17,729 --> 01:54:23,773
[SPEAKER_18]: West Courtyard area for the busing, so we'll be taking attendance and keeping track of students getting on and off the bus.

1517
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:36,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, we have been in communication with the family concerned over the past four days, and we are working with them to ensure that they get all the materials for furthering their education while the student is out.

1518
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:38,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1519
01:54:38,921 --> 01:54:39,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

1520
01:54:39,882 --> 01:54:40,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1521
01:54:40,803 --> 01:54:42,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Perla, thank you for coming forward.

1522
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:44,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just describe what happened?

1523
01:54:44,308 --> 01:54:50,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're talking about an incident most people watching at home have no idea what happened, how it happened.

1524
01:54:51,277 --> 01:54:55,162
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to clarify for ourselves as well as everybody watching.

1525
01:54:56,238 --> 01:55:08,608
[SPEAKER_18]: So what took place on Friday afternoon was there were roughly between 30 and 40 students that were in front of the superintendent's offices, and that is usually the pickup area for the North Benford bus, which comes around 2.50.

1526
01:55:08,889 --> 01:55:16,055
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a cold afternoon, and as the bus turned the corner to come into the loop, students started to get excited.

1527
01:55:16,795 --> 01:55:21,759
[SPEAKER_18]: My understanding is that they were jostling for position for seats that they wanted to sit in, particularly.

1528
01:55:22,519 --> 01:55:25,682
[SPEAKER_18]: As the bus came around the corner, it's a very short area where the turn is.

1529
01:55:26,202 --> 01:55:27,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Students were pushing.

1530
01:55:27,583 --> 01:55:30,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, there were two cars parked in that area, which is a fire lane.

1531
01:55:31,546 --> 01:55:38,170
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes we have to continuously ask people to move their cars during the afternoon, again, because of the location of where all the administrative offices are.

1532
01:55:39,471 --> 01:55:47,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Students, while they were pushing out, one inadvertently was pushed too far out, and as the bus was still moving, it ran over the student's foot.

1533
01:55:48,457 --> 01:55:52,259
[SPEAKER_18]: At that point, the student went back to the lawn.

1534
01:55:52,499 --> 01:55:56,082
[SPEAKER_18]: The principal was right in the area, not too far away, about 50 yards from that.

1535
01:55:57,022 --> 01:55:58,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Walked over, we called the school nurse.

1536
01:55:59,364 --> 01:56:01,985
[SPEAKER_18]: The students all got on the bus, then they were taken off the bus.

1537
01:56:02,906 --> 01:56:04,007
[SPEAKER_18]: What we did was we were able to get

1538
01:56:04,767 --> 01:56:15,014
[SPEAKER_18]: another bus to come quite quickly because we had to have the police department come and the ambulance come as well to keep record of what happened and to basically investigate the situation.

1539
01:56:15,455 --> 01:56:17,916
[SPEAKER_18]: The other students all got on the bus safely.

1540
01:56:18,076 --> 01:56:27,263
[SPEAKER_18]: We made a phone call to all the families for those students on that bus to just explain to them that there's going to be a late arrival home because of the incident that took place.

1541
01:56:27,923 --> 01:56:29,364
[SPEAKER_18]: We worked with the police department as well.

1542
01:56:29,865 --> 01:56:34,168
[SPEAKER_18]: We showed them the videotape that we had of the situation, which confirmed the story I just presented to you.

1543
01:56:37,147 --> 01:56:38,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have a few questions.

1544
01:56:38,828 --> 01:56:45,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been bringing up throughout this school year some concerns of overcrowding of this bus.

1545
01:56:45,372 --> 01:56:47,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been assured that it's not overcrowded.

1546
01:56:48,774 --> 01:56:52,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been assured that it's been monitored repeatedly throughout there.

1547
01:56:53,377 --> 01:56:57,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there someone assigned to stand at this bus stop from this point forward?

1548
01:56:58,201 --> 01:57:04,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, the bus stop has been changed, so it will be in the area where we have more extensive supervision.

1549
01:57:04,323 --> 01:57:16,008
[SPEAKER_18]: There has always been an individual placed in that area, ironically because of concerns regarding vaping that we had spotted in the same exact spot, which is not connected, obviously, to this bus situation.

1550
01:57:16,348 --> 01:57:21,170
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have been stretched pretty thin, trying to cover as many areas as we can during the afternoon, which is, you can imagine,

1551
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:25,172
[SPEAKER_18]: is a pretty interesting time period with lots of people moving.

1552
01:57:25,553 --> 01:57:37,121
[SPEAKER_18]: But for the remainder of the school year and for the foreseeable future, we will have individuals who will monitor the actual getting on of that bus, that specific bus, in the West Courtyard.

1553
01:57:37,922 --> 01:57:43,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So another concern I have is high school kids are big kids, and they take up a lot of space on a bus.

1554
01:57:43,664 --> 01:57:51,546
[SPEAKER_08]: And you add the size of their backpacks, which is like another person, really, another small person, trying to fit on the bus.

1555
01:57:51,606 --> 01:57:55,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe that's why a lot of students are trying to push on.

1556
01:57:55,988 --> 01:57:57,328
[SPEAKER_08]: It is colder now.

1557
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:03,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe some of the athletic teams are done, and there might be more students taking this bus.

1558
01:58:03,511 --> 01:58:12,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to see it closely monitored, and maybe another update in a month as to how that's going, and to follow up with this.

1559
01:58:12,514 --> 01:58:13,735
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want our students hurt.

1560
01:58:14,215 --> 01:58:14,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1561
01:58:14,775 --> 01:58:20,978
[SPEAKER_18]: And just to detail, the day of the incident, that bus was not full either.

1562
01:58:21,378 --> 01:58:26,381
[SPEAKER_18]: The police department also confirmed that, that there was plenty of space on the bus, unfortunately.

1563
01:58:26,621 --> 01:58:31,043
[SPEAKER_18]: And this afternoon as well, there were 44, and the bus fits about 53, I believe.

1564
01:58:32,944 --> 01:58:33,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the update.

1565
01:58:33,944 --> 01:58:40,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for taking care of the manor so quickly and effectively, and making sure our student was treated well.

1566
01:58:40,727 --> 01:58:41,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You're very welcome.

1567
01:58:41,208 --> 01:58:41,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

1568
01:58:42,575 --> 01:58:43,035
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, Ms.

1569
01:58:43,055 --> 01:58:45,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Kratz, waiting patiently.

1570
01:58:46,898 --> 01:58:49,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the updated report, Dr. Brower.

1571
01:58:50,020 --> 01:59:00,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I also spoke to a couple of parents, and they mentioned to me that over the last week or so, there's been a lot of pushing and shoving every day.

1572
01:59:01,007 --> 01:59:05,829
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just not sure, did you interview any of the students to find out why that's happening?

1573
01:59:05,869 --> 01:59:06,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it because?

1574
01:59:06,589 --> 01:59:09,550
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems like it's because it's overcrowded.

1575
01:59:09,830 --> 01:59:11,930
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that particular day, it wasn't.

1576
01:59:12,451 --> 01:59:22,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the parents I spoke to said that one parent said that their student was waiting in line, but it was so crowded that their student went off to call for a ride from a parent.

1577
01:59:24,614 --> 01:59:29,499
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like maybe it starts out crowded and maybe it doesn't end as crowded.

1578
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:36,066
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think what I've heard is that students are sitting on the ground in the bus.

1579
01:59:36,106 --> 01:59:37,447
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I've heard.

1580
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've also heard that the bus passes aren't being checked for ridership.

1581
01:59:43,853 --> 01:59:48,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And that there's just, for some reason, recently, pushing and shoving going on.

1582
01:59:48,796 --> 01:59:56,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know why, if it's not overcrowded, why are shooting, you know, pushing and shoving to get on the bus?

1583
01:59:56,881 --> 01:59:57,661
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, is it?

1584
01:59:58,121 --> 02:00:02,264
[SPEAKER_15]: So let me answer that a little, because we had an interesting discussion with the police.

1585
02:00:03,404 --> 02:00:05,966
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems that preferred seating is the back of the bus.

1586
02:00:07,063 --> 02:00:13,024
[SPEAKER_15]: they shoved to get to the back of the bus, because that's where they can have a little more mischief, perhaps in some cases.

1587
02:00:13,704 --> 02:00:18,545
[SPEAKER_15]: And I say that benevolently, but I mean, they wanna get to the back of the bus, so they're trying to get preferred seating.

1588
02:00:19,226 --> 02:00:22,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Normally you like to sit up close and get off the bus faster, but that's not the case.

1589
02:00:23,447 --> 02:00:34,069
[SPEAKER_15]: So obviously we have to have a meeting with the students, we have to make it very, very clear that behavior on this bus is really going to be monitored very closely, because

1590
02:00:35,209 --> 02:00:43,780
[SPEAKER_15]: You just can't put buses on just simply to, you know, get more of the same, because if they're going to push and shove on an uncrowded bus, they're going to push and shove on the next uncrowded bus.

1591
02:00:44,381 --> 02:00:48,185
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to make sure that they understand that this is something, it's a privilege to ride the bus.

1592
02:00:48,466 --> 02:00:53,011
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying very hard to give them the transportation they want, but they've got to work with us.

1593
02:00:53,572 --> 02:00:55,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone has to own the solution.

1594
02:00:55,434 --> 02:01:05,462
[SPEAKER_15]: We also worked with the bus company, Christine worked with the bus company this afternoon, that if in fact we needed a backup bus on a given day because it was particularly cold or we anticipated bad weather.

1595
02:01:06,083 --> 02:01:09,065
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's say it was a snowstorm and we know that everyone's going to want to ride the bus.

1596
02:01:10,155 --> 02:01:12,596
[SPEAKER_15]: we could get a backup bus in that situation.

1597
02:01:12,616 --> 02:01:14,417
[SPEAKER_15]: But then it costs us to do that.

1598
02:01:14,938 --> 02:01:20,540
[SPEAKER_15]: So we wanna do these things, we wanna have contingency plans in place, but we need the students to cooperate with us.

1599
02:01:21,081 --> 02:01:24,563
[SPEAKER_15]: As the headmaster points out, we're gonna have a meeting with them, we're gonna make it very clear.

1600
02:01:24,583 --> 02:01:29,005
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you do things you're not supposed to do, you're not gonna ride that bus, we're gonna take you off.

1601
02:01:29,705 --> 02:01:34,128
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing that's a situation for us is that people like to go with their friends.

1602
02:01:35,048 --> 02:01:41,513
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't be in a situation where people who don't need the ride home get on the same bus.

1603
02:01:41,593 --> 02:01:43,454
[SPEAKER_15]: It just is not workable for us.

1604
02:01:43,975 --> 02:01:45,516
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a major expense with that.

1605
02:01:45,556 --> 02:01:48,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially now, we're talking about adding a bus to the elementary schools.

1606
02:01:49,278 --> 02:01:50,920
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about other kinds of costs.

1607
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:55,063
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had to add a bus to move some ELL students to the Brooks this year.

1608
02:01:55,603 --> 02:01:57,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Transportation costs are not inexpensive.

1609
02:01:58,165 --> 02:01:59,125
[SPEAKER_15]: They cost $375 a day for a bus.

1610
02:02:02,606 --> 02:02:05,807
[SPEAKER_15]: times 180 days, that's a lot of money.

1611
02:02:06,308 --> 02:02:12,090
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we're going to provide services, we expect people to be respectful and we expect them to work with us.

1612
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:15,271
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've gotta keep working at it, no question about it.

1613
02:02:15,771 --> 02:02:22,654
[SPEAKER_15]: And the injury is obviously tragic and unfortunate and we've been in contact with the family and we'll continue to be supportive to them.

1614
02:02:23,294 --> 02:02:25,535
[SPEAKER_15]: But everyone's gotta own the solution.

1615
02:02:25,555 --> 02:02:29,637
[SPEAKER_15]: It just can't be, you know, whatever you do will be okay.

1616
02:02:34,561 --> 02:02:35,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you all set?

1617
02:02:35,381 --> 02:02:36,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I think so.

1618
02:02:36,021 --> 02:02:46,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make sure, so are the student IDs going to be monitored to make sure that the students that are going on the bus are the students that are eligible to go on the Fulton Heights bus?

1619
02:02:47,904 --> 02:02:53,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure, like it does say that there will be administrators out there reviewing student usage of the bus.

1620
02:02:53,665 --> 02:02:55,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to be checking them as they go on?

1621
02:02:56,086 --> 02:02:58,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so we have a running list as well.

1622
02:02:59,127 --> 02:03:11,931
[SPEAKER_18]: As was reported in the fall, there are approximately 90-odd students who could use the North Memphis bus, but at any point there's between 30 and 40 that take the North Memphis bus, which creates a unique situation that

1623
02:03:12,331 --> 02:03:16,634
[SPEAKER_18]: like the superintendent just mentioned, it could happen that one day all decide that they want to take the bus.

1624
02:03:17,435 --> 02:03:26,702
[SPEAKER_18]: But because of the different things that happen at the school with sports and a variety of other reasons why they might not be going home immediately after school, it isn't the case on a typical basis.

1625
02:03:27,162 --> 02:03:39,371
[SPEAKER_18]: And back to your original questions, our understanding was that because of the way the cars were situated that day, students were sort of getting to the bus by going between two cars, which caused a sort of a

1626
02:03:40,412 --> 02:03:42,393
[SPEAKER_18]: a problem for people behind pushing.

1627
02:03:42,493 --> 02:03:43,874
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's basically how it played out.

1628
02:03:43,894 --> 02:03:46,116
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think it's as typical, the pushing part.

1629
02:03:46,796 --> 02:03:48,437
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is obviously a concern for us.

1630
02:03:48,457 --> 02:03:50,938
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'll be addressing with students beginning tomorrow.

1631
02:03:51,319 --> 02:03:53,380
[SPEAKER_18]: And that conversation will be ongoing for the remainder of the year.

1632
02:03:54,641 --> 02:04:03,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was just one other concern was what I also heard was that the students were walking in the street along with the bus.

1633
02:04:04,186 --> 02:04:09,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there anybody going to be right out there making sure that students aren't doing that for any of the buses?

1634
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:13,292
[SPEAKER_18]: So that will be happening, obviously, when the new location is in.

1635
02:04:13,472 --> 02:04:15,673
[SPEAKER_18]: The North Method bus is unique because it comes later.

1636
02:04:16,274 --> 02:04:17,394
[SPEAKER_18]: It comes by itself.

1637
02:04:17,935 --> 02:04:21,417
[SPEAKER_18]: So sometimes, you know, the time varies between when it actually arrives.

1638
02:04:21,877 --> 02:04:29,282
[SPEAKER_18]: So sometimes it'll come and students will see it and they'll come running from outside the foyer to get to it, where it's now going to be picking up and dropping off.

1639
02:04:29,782 --> 02:04:32,143
[SPEAKER_18]: There'd be other buses that would basically file in.

1640
02:04:32,483 --> 02:04:34,063
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's much more organized in that sense.

1641
02:04:35,003 --> 02:04:41,785
[SPEAKER_18]: So we anticipate that not being an issue, especially because there's no reason to cross the street where the new buses are coming.

1642
02:04:42,065 --> 02:04:43,585
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where the faculty parking area is.

1643
02:04:43,945 --> 02:04:50,507
[SPEAKER_18]: But where this area is, people are constantly crossing, adults and students, to get into the student parking lot area.

1644
02:04:51,107 --> 02:04:55,608
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was just sort of a concerning location where it had initially been.

1645
02:04:55,928 --> 02:04:59,649
[SPEAKER_18]: But we think that by moving it, it's going to actually address the core problem.

1646
02:05:01,009 --> 02:05:01,429
Thank you.

1647
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:02,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Justin?

1648
02:05:02,570 --> 02:05:11,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I want to say that I feel that Mr. Bilson's analysis of the situation is completely accurate.

1649
02:05:11,872 --> 02:05:17,634
[SPEAKER_17]: From my experience, students push and shove to get on the bus because they want preferential seating.

1650
02:05:18,034 --> 02:05:23,275
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you don't want to walk onto a bus where half the seats are already taken and you don't have as many options.

1651
02:05:23,815 --> 02:05:34,546
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, I've been on both sides of the situation where I've been pushed, and I, well, I haven't been shoved, but I'm purposefully shoving.

1652
02:05:35,487 --> 02:05:41,313
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, I know what it's like to, why we do this.

1653
02:05:43,014 --> 02:05:46,255
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, what he says is completely correct.

1654
02:05:46,515 --> 02:05:55,337
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it's part of our responsibility as students to understand that, you know, this is a privilege and that we have to be respectful in using it.

1655
02:05:55,477 --> 02:06:01,858
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we should find a way to advance that idea in the schools and within the student body.

1656
02:06:02,299 --> 02:06:05,819
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd like to thank Dr. Peralta for doing that thing.

1657
02:06:05,839 --> 02:06:10,220
[SPEAKER_17]: I think moving the location where the bus picks up is very important and it will do us a lot of good.

1658
02:06:14,267 --> 02:06:15,367
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say one thing.

1659
02:06:15,487 --> 02:06:18,208
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Justin for the first time in my career.

1660
02:06:18,228 --> 02:06:25,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone said I was completely correct.

1661
02:06:25,129 --> 02:06:26,310
[SPEAKER_11]: First and only.

1662
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:34,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say thank you to you, staff, for doing it in such a professional manner.

1663
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:36,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And you really did expedite it very quickly.

1664
02:06:36,752 --> 02:06:43,433
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent,

1665
02:06:44,033 --> 02:06:51,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And Justin, I stand here and sometimes over the years I kind of think that, you know, what's happening?

1666
02:06:53,255 --> 02:06:54,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I hear someone like you.

1667
02:06:55,516 --> 02:06:57,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And you just make it so refreshing.

1668
02:06:57,236 --> 02:07:00,397
[SPEAKER_11]: And you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes.

1669
02:07:00,857 --> 02:07:02,678
[SPEAKER_11]: That we have to be sensible.

1670
02:07:03,098 --> 02:07:08,519
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person.

1671
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:12,220
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have to get back to a society where we have to take

1672
02:07:13,557 --> 02:07:19,260
[SPEAKER_11]: our responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules.

1673
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:25,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school.

1674
02:07:25,963 --> 02:07:32,946
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free-for-all all the time.

1675
02:07:33,226 --> 02:07:33,686
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

1676
02:07:34,326 --> 02:07:36,407
[SPEAKER_18]: The second topic is vaping and juuling.

1677
02:07:39,445 --> 02:07:42,486
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a very concerning topic for, I think, everyone.

1678
02:07:43,467 --> 02:07:49,309
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, and I think you're starting to see it infiltrate conversations in homes, and I know I've had that with my children as well.

1679
02:07:49,809 --> 02:08:02,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to give you a little bit of summary, about six months ago we started to see this on the radar, that this was, this concept of vaping or jeweling was creeping into schools, and we hadn't really experienced it at the high school last spring.

1680
02:08:03,394 --> 02:08:04,655
[SPEAKER_18]: But we had conversations about it.

1681
02:08:04,875 --> 02:08:07,897
[SPEAKER_18]: We were aware that it was something to be concerned about.

1682
02:08:09,157 --> 02:08:13,560
[SPEAKER_18]: In the fall, we began to see it more often in the building.

1683
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:24,246
[SPEAKER_18]: We immediately pulled in some experts and had many discussions about it, including the assistant district attorneys, also the Medford Police Department.

1684
02:08:25,006 --> 02:08:29,350
[SPEAKER_18]: We decided pretty quickly that we had to share this information with the faculty of the building.

1685
02:08:29,811 --> 02:08:39,620
[SPEAKER_18]: We had faculty meetings where we not only discussed it, but we showed videos of how it's used and we also presented to the faculty items to look at.

1686
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:44,044
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, I brought one with me today just to show you if you're curious what it looks like.

1687
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:55,855
[SPEAKER_18]: And in that case is a classic vape with a charger, which you can plug into any USB port.

1688
02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:58,017
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is actually quite a large one.

1689
02:08:58,217 --> 02:08:59,638
[SPEAKER_18]: The Jules is much smaller.

1690
02:09:00,658 --> 02:09:05,001
[SPEAKER_18]: In our experience, they're very concerning because they're hard to see, they're hard to find.

1691
02:09:05,021 --> 02:09:06,482
[SPEAKER_18]: You can hide them.

1692
02:09:06,502 --> 02:09:12,346
[SPEAKER_18]: The odor that emits from it, there is some odor, but it's not something that would alert you to a concern.

1693
02:09:12,546 --> 02:09:14,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes it's flowery or perfumey.

1694
02:09:15,588 --> 02:09:26,755
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something also that I'm collaborative with other principals, ten other principals that we meet monthly and this is the number one topic for all of us, talking about how do we deal with it, how do we react to it.

1695
02:09:27,816 --> 02:09:33,259
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we've decided at the high school to build a leadership team is, like I said, we've had many conversations about it.

1696
02:09:33,459 --> 02:09:34,140
[SPEAKER_18]: The first key was to

1697
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:38,361
[SPEAKER_18]: inform the faculty what to look for and to be aware of this might be happening.

1698
02:09:38,901 --> 02:09:46,743
[SPEAKER_18]: We also started to implement ideas from this into our health courses and health classes, specifically on vaping.

1699
02:09:47,544 --> 02:09:54,546
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, presently, there is a public service announcement program, a presentation being created by students for students on vaping.

1700
02:09:54,626 --> 02:09:56,446
[SPEAKER_18]: We think that's a real key ingredient.

1701
02:09:57,026 --> 02:10:01,208
[SPEAKER_18]: But the thing we haven't done really well yet is begin to share this with the community as a whole.

1702
02:10:02,408 --> 02:10:10,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Partially it's because we were still trying to understand ourselves and we didn't feel comfortable basically alarming the community of something that we didn't really truly understand.

1703
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:16,731
[SPEAKER_18]: To that end, we'll be holding a parent forum Thursday, February 8th at 6.30 p.m.

1704
02:10:17,151 --> 02:10:31,735
[SPEAKER_18]: where we have public speakers coming in, doctors and other people in the tobacco prevention field as well as the Memphis Police Department to begin the conversation with the community as well as the In Plain Sight program that was so successful last year about

1705
02:10:32,455 --> 02:10:39,259
[SPEAKER_18]: what it looks like, for instance, where it could be hidden, and what do they smell, and how do you actually identify this as a concern?

1706
02:10:39,859 --> 02:10:54,428
[SPEAKER_18]: So obviously we've taken this very seriously, and we're going to continue to take it seriously, and we think the best way to approach this is to communicate with not only the faculty and the community and the parents, but really the students, to sort of begin the conversation with them.

1707
02:10:54,488 --> 02:10:59,511
[SPEAKER_18]: If we're not going to teach them about this issue, what are we really doing as professional educators?

1708
02:10:59,971 --> 02:11:01,132
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a concern for us.

1709
02:11:01,652 --> 02:11:03,414
[SPEAKER_18]: So these are the steps we have taken to date.

1710
02:11:04,075 --> 02:11:10,762
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be happy to continue to update you on the strategies that we create and approach for this concern.

1711
02:11:11,082 --> 02:11:13,144
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd be happy to answer any questions at this time.

1712
02:11:13,564 --> 02:11:15,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Perola, you said 630?

1713
02:11:16,407 --> 02:11:17,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, 630.

1714
02:11:17,509 --> 02:11:20,632
[SPEAKER_18]: This is also run in conjunction with our school nurse, Tony Vento.

1715
02:11:21,312 --> 02:11:23,435
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a lot of coordination in place for this.

1716
02:11:25,208 --> 02:11:32,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to ask real quick, what are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it?

1717
02:11:32,774 --> 02:11:34,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it based on cigarette smoking?

1718
02:11:34,756 --> 02:11:37,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so technically it depends on what it is.

1719
02:11:37,978 --> 02:11:42,522
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's a tobacco that's being vaped, then of course it would be considered as a tobacco or cigarette.

1720
02:11:43,563 --> 02:11:50,128
[SPEAKER_18]: There are times when you can vape other types of drugs, typically marijuana, and that would be treated as a drug.

1721
02:11:51,108 --> 02:11:58,873
[SPEAKER_11]: And could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?

1722
02:11:59,193 --> 02:12:03,276
[SPEAKER_18]: So basically, the key to it is communication with the families.

1723
02:12:03,296 --> 02:12:05,797
[SPEAKER_18]: We bring the families in, we talk about tobaccos.

1724
02:12:07,098 --> 02:12:09,620
[SPEAKER_18]: as a really addictive sort of, it's a disease.

1725
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:20,305
[SPEAKER_18]: So we do punish, there are punishments, but what we find is more important is the communication and really trying to help a student move from, if it's tobacco or drug use, to away from that.

1726
02:12:20,325 --> 02:12:26,269
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have lots of different programs that we incorporate into that treatment or that discipline or that consequence.

1727
02:12:26,709 --> 02:12:28,370
[SPEAKER_18]: It really depends on the situation and the student.

1728
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:33,852
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, someone who the first time is very different than someone that's a chronic situation.

1729
02:12:34,273 --> 02:12:41,436
[SPEAKER_18]: But the real key is to bring the families in and to have an open conversation because what we've come to realize is that we can't actually fix this problem.

1730
02:12:41,516 --> 02:12:42,396
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a community problem.

1731
02:12:42,797 --> 02:12:47,099
[SPEAKER_18]: So the only way we can to properly address this is in partnership with the families.

1732
02:12:47,839 --> 02:12:51,801
[SPEAKER_11]: And is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?

1733
02:12:52,221 --> 02:12:55,863
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be the same as if we found them with marijuana on them, yes.

1734
02:12:56,532 --> 02:12:58,293
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're definitely right.

1735
02:12:58,333 --> 02:13:02,656
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student.

1736
02:13:03,136 --> 02:13:06,698
[SPEAKER_11]: But you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion.

1737
02:13:06,778 --> 02:13:06,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1738
02:13:06,939 --> 02:13:10,801
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.

1739
02:13:10,981 --> 02:13:12,042
[SPEAKER_18]: So we moved away from that.

1740
02:13:12,362 --> 02:13:13,983
[SPEAKER_18]: What you have 222 a few years back,

1741
02:13:15,724 --> 02:13:23,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I should say, in the past, a consequence from something like this could be suspension, could be expulsion.

1742
02:13:24,286 --> 02:13:26,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, that doesn't solve the issue of concerns.

1743
02:13:26,667 --> 02:13:29,048
[SPEAKER_18]: And plus, it's, at this point, not legal.

1744
02:13:29,368 --> 02:13:31,589
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have to find ways to continue to educate the student.

1745
02:13:31,889 --> 02:13:34,549
[SPEAKER_18]: But we also look at this as an addictive problem.

1746
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:40,871
[SPEAKER_18]: And oftentimes, the solution to something like this isn't just punishment.

1747
02:13:41,431 --> 02:13:43,632
[SPEAKER_18]: It's working with them to find the solutions.

1748
02:13:44,758 --> 02:13:55,904
[SPEAKER_11]: When you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore?

1749
02:13:57,124 --> 02:14:00,506
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?

1750
02:14:00,846 --> 02:14:01,947
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there are two pieces to this.

1751
02:14:02,067 --> 02:14:07,512
[SPEAKER_18]: One, obviously, with the change in marijuana laws, the way it's viewed in society.

1752
02:14:08,032 --> 02:14:12,176
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the technology in these are probably appealing for lots of students.

1753
02:14:12,856 --> 02:14:17,020
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's also marketed as sort of a solution to people who smoke.

1754
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:27,169
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's seen as a cure or a help to cure people, which kind of, I think, hid it from us as a concerning, like a problem, I think, in society.

1755
02:14:27,669 --> 02:14:32,033
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think there are a combination of factors that probably attract students to it.

1756
02:14:32,633 --> 02:14:34,835
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, you know, we hear all kinds of different things.

1757
02:14:34,875 --> 02:14:41,519
[SPEAKER_18]: And the principals I work with tell me that there are games to see if you can actually get away with vaping close to somebody.

1758
02:14:41,539 --> 02:14:46,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Because literally, if you weren't looking at me and I was vaping, you wouldn't know.

1759
02:14:46,782 --> 02:14:48,383
[SPEAKER_18]: You wouldn't be able to smell it.

1760
02:14:48,483 --> 02:14:52,626
[SPEAKER_18]: It wouldn't seem like I was smoking a cigarette or a drug.

1761
02:14:53,186 --> 02:14:55,407
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, it's concerning.

1762
02:14:55,768 --> 02:15:00,731
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, there's lots of things that it can be done in ways that it had to find.

1763
02:15:01,251 --> 02:15:18,850
[SPEAKER_18]: for us and it's not expensive so how much is like I think that is actually expensive that piece right there I think it ranges from 60 to 100 dollars really the gadget the gadget which is passing yes I thought it was a lot and a lot of these things can be bought online which doesn't require identification so

1764
02:15:20,972 --> 02:15:32,138
[SPEAKER_18]: It's definitely, I know the schools take the brunt of these situations and how to handle them, but we view it as a serious community and really a societal issue that we have to work together to address.

1765
02:15:33,177 --> 02:15:33,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1766
02:15:33,437 --> 02:15:35,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Vice Chair, if I could.

1767
02:15:35,659 --> 02:15:40,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Last year we held in plain sight in City Hall, actually this corner office that's just behind us.

1768
02:15:40,763 --> 02:15:48,209
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was amazed at what was in this room and how deceiving these gadgets are.

1769
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:54,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I might have mentioned last month when Team Medford came forward, it could look like a can of hairspray, but really it's not.

1770
02:15:54,554 --> 02:15:57,455
[SPEAKER_13]: It's completely empty, and it's just a spot for something else to go in.

1771
02:15:58,055 --> 02:16:00,696
[SPEAKER_13]: And he had brushes that have pieces that come out.

1772
02:16:01,297 --> 02:16:05,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Every object that you may normally see in a bedroom now has another purpose.

1773
02:16:06,058 --> 02:16:11,921
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really urge all parents to come if you could announce the night when you have it scheduled.

1774
02:16:12,501 --> 02:16:17,983
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so important to be on top of it and have an awareness that this is happening right underneath your nose.

1775
02:16:18,183 --> 02:16:22,885
[SPEAKER_13]: And to just stay on top of it could make the difference between that road or, mm-hmm,

1776
02:16:23,465 --> 02:16:24,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Staying on track.

1777
02:16:24,407 --> 02:16:26,552
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a great program.

1778
02:16:26,672 --> 02:16:29,077
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, if you need any assistance, thank you from us.

1779
02:16:29,297 --> 02:16:29,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Please let us know

1780
02:16:31,398 --> 02:16:32,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Kathy, did you have your hand up?

1781
02:16:33,299 --> 02:16:33,999
Yes.

1782
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:45,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dr. Perrella, over the weekend between Friday and Sunday, the Medford High School Medford Vocational Facebook page, parents were writing just nonstop about the vaping.

1783
02:16:46,446 --> 02:16:52,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And they want to know who's monitoring the hallways and outside the bathrooms.

1784
02:16:52,550 --> 02:16:55,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess, like you said, it's in plain sight.

1785
02:16:55,211 --> 02:16:59,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So a student could walk by you, and then they're vaping just as they walk by you.

1786
02:17:00,214 --> 02:17:20,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been told that this is happening, and that people, you know, students are doing, you know, vaping in the bathroom, in the classroom, like Aaron described once before, where they're puffing it right into their sweatshirt, and it's, they're just, it's done in plain sight, almost like right in the classroom, and it's really concerning to a lot of parents.

1787
02:17:21,562 --> 02:17:27,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems like, because they're such small devices, very hard to detect, and it's odorless.

1788
02:17:29,465 --> 02:17:34,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned to the parents that we had the discussion with Team Medford, and that Penny was here.

1789
02:17:34,907 --> 02:17:39,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And I added the YouTube video and told them exactly what sections that were discussed.

1790
02:17:39,829 --> 02:17:43,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And I encouraged them to go to the seminar.

1791
02:17:44,851 --> 02:17:48,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'd also like to know, when is the student assembly?

1792
02:17:49,015 --> 02:17:50,016
[SPEAKER_06]: That was their big question.

1793
02:17:50,116 --> 02:17:52,678
[SPEAKER_06]: What did they hear from their children about the student assembly?

1794
02:17:52,758 --> 02:17:54,780
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think it happened yet.

1795
02:17:55,341 --> 02:17:56,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Or did it happen?

1796
02:17:56,802 --> 02:17:57,022
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1797
02:17:57,102 --> 02:18:01,987
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, our thinking in the past two or three months is to sort of identify the concern.

1798
02:18:02,907 --> 02:18:17,200
[SPEAKER_18]: explore it, investigate it, share it with the faculty and the families, and then begin to work with the health curriculum to make sure it's implemented in those areas, and then create conversations around it with the PSAs, for instance, that students are creating for students.

1799
02:18:18,601 --> 02:18:20,582
[SPEAKER_18]: So I agree with a thousand percent what you're saying.

1800
02:18:20,602 --> 02:18:24,384
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, in fact, as I was mentioning earlier, I was at the principal's meeting in Beverly High School.

1801
02:18:24,644 --> 02:18:27,965
[SPEAKER_18]: And as I was leaving Beverly High School, two kids walking in were vaping.

1802
02:18:28,205 --> 02:18:30,226
[SPEAKER_18]: As I was leaving, the discussion on vaping.

1803
02:18:30,626 --> 02:18:33,508
[SPEAKER_18]: And I actually did, I turned around and walked back in.

1804
02:18:33,548 --> 02:18:34,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, can you tell me something?

1805
02:18:34,948 --> 02:18:36,549
[SPEAKER_18]: I felt like I was chasing them down the hallway.

1806
02:18:36,569 --> 02:18:37,950
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, these aren't even my students.

1807
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:42,592
[SPEAKER_18]: But it just really bothered me that this is such an issue and a concern.

1808
02:18:42,932 --> 02:18:45,453
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure Justin could probably tell us a lot more than we know.

1809
02:18:45,953 --> 02:18:46,594
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure he will.

1810
02:18:46,614 --> 02:18:52,459
[SPEAKER_18]: But the big concern for us, obviously, is that they're small, they're portable, they can be hidden.

1811
02:18:53,059 --> 02:18:57,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Once they go into a bathroom stall, there's nothing that we can do to find out what's going on in there.

1812
02:18:58,584 --> 02:19:04,829
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, as far as we can't go in the bathrooms to that degree, to check in constantly, looking in and out.

1813
02:19:04,889 --> 02:19:05,430
[SPEAKER_18]: That happens.

1814
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:10,154
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have the principal go into the bathrooms on occasion, a couple times a day, to check

1815
02:19:11,275 --> 02:19:14,947
[SPEAKER_18]: the bathrooms, but sometimes it's not done in bathrooms either.

1816
02:19:14,967 --> 02:19:16,773
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a lot of concerns of where it can be done.

1817
02:19:18,728 --> 02:19:27,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a question, like, is it a particular bathroom or area, and could we have, like, Officer Riccardi, you know, monitor that area?

1818
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,851
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if there's, like, a certain bathroom that, you know, this is really happening in.

1819
02:19:32,191 --> 02:19:40,833
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I also read a comment that, you know, that, you know, one parent said that their child was offered, you know, to purchase marijuana.

1820
02:19:42,114 --> 02:19:44,317
[SPEAKER_06]: outside the bathroom or in the hallway.

1821
02:19:45,018 --> 02:19:50,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just don't know if we need to have maybe Officer Riccardi kind of rotate around.

1822
02:19:51,067 --> 02:19:51,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1823
02:19:51,787 --> 02:19:53,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to bring it to your attention.

1824
02:19:55,482 --> 02:19:59,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Officer Akadi is pretty busy during the day, too.

1825
02:19:59,724 --> 02:20:00,764
[SPEAKER_18]: So he does a lot of that.

1826
02:20:01,284 --> 02:20:04,626
[SPEAKER_18]: But we can always probably use more supervision and oversight.

1827
02:20:04,766 --> 02:20:11,368
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will speak with the principals to really up their surveillance of the bathrooms.

1828
02:20:12,169 --> 02:20:15,710
[SPEAKER_18]: But we do think, ultimately, the solution isn't in that direction.

1829
02:20:15,850 --> 02:20:17,911
[SPEAKER_18]: It's in communication and education with families.

1830
02:20:18,651 --> 02:20:20,132
[SPEAKER_18]: We think that's really the way to address it.

1831
02:20:20,172 --> 02:20:23,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if not in school, then the minute they leave,

1832
02:20:23,833 --> 02:20:28,142
[SPEAKER_18]: I think vaping will continue to be used outside, obviously, the school.

1833
02:20:29,350 --> 02:20:29,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Superintendent?

1834
02:20:30,271 --> 02:20:35,515
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that, you know, Dr. Burrell was expressing extremely well is that this is a community thing.

1835
02:20:36,096 --> 02:20:37,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Parents, everyone has to be involved.

1836
02:20:38,398 --> 02:20:42,141
[SPEAKER_15]: If you put enforcement in one place, they'll go to another place.

1837
02:20:42,161 --> 02:20:43,602
[SPEAKER_15]: So just move the location.

1838
02:20:44,263 --> 02:20:49,847
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to change the outlook on the dangers about it and why it's not a good idea.

1839
02:20:50,728 --> 02:20:55,972
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've got to work with the merchants, perhaps even to possibly put a city ordinance in to ban the sale of it.

1840
02:20:56,673 --> 02:21:07,098
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it may be something that we can look at and possibly work with neighboring communities to get a regional ban in the area, so it makes it that much more difficult to acquire the materials.

1841
02:21:07,778 --> 02:21:14,341
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a comprehensive issue, but it's not going to be done by just having a person chase somebody down the corridor.

1842
02:21:14,461 --> 02:21:14,882
[SPEAKER_15]: That may be...

1843
02:21:16,182 --> 02:21:20,607
[SPEAKER_15]: nice for a particular situation, but not as a solution to the larger picture.

1844
02:21:20,627 --> 02:21:22,029
[SPEAKER_13]: The sale is banned to minors.

1845
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:22,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1846
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:23,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like cigarettes.

1847
02:21:24,231 --> 02:21:24,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1848
02:21:24,472 --> 02:21:26,314
[SPEAKER_13]: In the city of Medford, for a vote of health.

1849
02:21:26,634 --> 02:21:30,959
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just, you know, hopeful that maybe it's banned in general, because I don't think it's good for adults either.

1850
02:21:31,339 --> 02:21:35,524
[SPEAKER_15]: If adults have it, they give it to the kids at home, just like a beer, you know, your home.

1851
02:21:37,038 --> 02:21:38,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's have a beer or watch a football game.

1852
02:21:39,021 --> 02:21:40,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do this, let's do that.

1853
02:21:40,182 --> 02:21:44,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes there's a sense that if a parent's doing it, it's okay.

1854
02:21:45,210 --> 02:21:46,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Gotta get that message across.

1855
02:21:47,737 --> 02:21:49,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Justin, I know you had your hand up.

1856
02:21:49,239 --> 02:21:54,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think baking is a really serious issue that really came out of nowhere.

1857
02:21:55,804 --> 02:21:58,947
[SPEAKER_17]: And it really took hold about six months ago.

1858
02:21:58,967 --> 02:22:05,233
[SPEAKER_17]: And I didn't know it was such a big issue until the beginning of this school year.

1859
02:22:05,553 --> 02:22:07,935
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we have to work with different communities.

1860
02:22:08,355 --> 02:22:16,317
[SPEAKER_17]: talk about it too, because I know people who've gotten them from Uber or from different cities, and it's just, it's a super serious issue.

1861
02:22:16,717 --> 02:22:27,801
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a really effective way we can tackle this, in addition to implementing lessons about it in the health department and with students, is having faculty, teachers talk about it with students too.

1862
02:22:27,901 --> 02:22:35,803
[SPEAKER_17]: My math teacher just wrapped up a unit on drug use with our class, and I think it was super, super insightful and super effective.

1863
02:22:36,483 --> 02:22:42,028
[SPEAKER_17]: And just having teachers be very genuine about, you know, you shouldn't do this.

1864
02:22:42,148 --> 02:22:53,439
[SPEAKER_17]: And actually vaping is, could be, we don't know enough about it, but it could be worse than cigarettes because of the frequency, the high levels of nicotine and the frequency that people use it.

1865
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:56,502
[SPEAKER_17]: And I totally agree.

1866
02:22:56,542 --> 02:22:58,724
[SPEAKER_17]: It just has to be a whole community effort.

1867
02:22:59,364 --> 02:23:04,009
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's tougher to deal with than cigarettes because it's less visible.

1868
02:23:04,589 --> 02:23:05,871
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have to try.

1869
02:23:05,891 --> 02:23:09,934
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've been so, so successful with cigarettes in the last 20 years.

1870
02:23:10,515 --> 02:23:14,379
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to start doing the same things with vaping.

1871
02:23:14,459 --> 02:23:17,862
[SPEAKER_17]: And I trust that you and the school community will do whatever we can.

1872
02:23:18,617 --> 02:23:25,441
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really happy to hear what Justin just said, because one of our initial strategies was to get the teachers to have these conversations with the students in class.

1873
02:23:25,841 --> 02:23:32,264
[SPEAKER_18]: We know that the relationships that they build are much more powerful than a presentation in front of 300 students in an auditorium.

1874
02:23:32,845 --> 02:23:41,289
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm really happy to hear that, because part of the initial training was to inform the faculty what these things were, and how they operate, and the effect that they have on people.

1875
02:23:42,430 --> 02:23:43,691
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's good to hear.

1876
02:23:43,911 --> 02:23:45,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, we have a lot more work to do.

1877
02:23:46,830 --> 02:23:51,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece.

1878
02:23:51,653 --> 02:24:00,719
[SPEAKER_11]: But an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about.

1879
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:04,642
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue.

1880
02:24:04,682 --> 02:24:06,603
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a country issue.

1881
02:24:06,623 --> 02:24:07,964
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a worldwide issue.

1882
02:24:09,485 --> 02:24:14,989
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard.

1883
02:24:16,250 --> 02:24:17,911
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want to make sure that our kids are safe.

1884
02:24:17,991 --> 02:24:20,813
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think just opening up and talking more about it.

1885
02:24:20,913 --> 02:24:26,397
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about this, you know, like we do about the cigarettes.

1886
02:24:26,857 --> 02:24:28,218
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't want to get there either.

1887
02:24:28,638 --> 02:24:36,624
[SPEAKER_11]: And the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having.

1888
02:24:37,064 --> 02:24:39,626
[SPEAKER_11]: just to like, if they can get away with it type of thing.

1889
02:24:41,107 --> 02:24:41,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1890
02:24:41,607 --> 02:24:49,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, OK, could I fool them?

1891
02:24:49,533 --> 02:24:50,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Could I get away with it?

1892
02:24:50,915 --> 02:24:53,937
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that has a huge component to it too.

1893
02:24:54,077 --> 02:24:59,281
[SPEAKER_11]: But the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet.

1894
02:24:59,701 --> 02:25:01,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they made it legal, but it doesn't, you know.

1895
02:25:02,003 --> 02:25:03,044
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what really could happen.

1896
02:25:03,785 --> 02:25:09,942
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.

1897
02:25:10,968 --> 02:25:11,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1898
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:11,588
[SPEAKER_21]: Van Der Poot?

1899
02:25:11,608 --> 02:25:15,209
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I just wanted to thank Dr. Perella for being proactive on this issue.

1900
02:25:15,289 --> 02:25:16,709
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's extremely important.

1901
02:25:16,729 --> 02:25:23,771
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I remember when vaping was considered to be healthier than cigarette smoking.

1902
02:25:23,831 --> 02:25:26,772
[SPEAKER_21]: And so the idea was that you were stepping down if you were vaping.

1903
02:25:27,332 --> 02:25:33,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Clearly, when you presented the last time and mentioned jeweling and the amount of nicotine, I was shocked.

1904
02:25:33,253 --> 02:25:37,414
[SPEAKER_21]: And clearly, this has taken on a new concern for us.

1905
02:25:37,755 --> 02:25:38,515
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you very much.

1906
02:25:38,535 --> 02:25:39,035
[SPEAKER_21]: You're welcome.

1907
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:43,011
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had a couple questions.

1908
02:25:43,851 --> 02:25:52,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we tracking how many students, how many incidents are occurring both in school and on the school grounds so we have data?

1909
02:25:53,193 --> 02:25:54,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1910
02:25:55,114 --> 02:25:59,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Have we gotten any flyers like just we were talking about at a last meeting about bullets?

1911
02:25:59,935 --> 02:26:16,164
[SPEAKER_08]: about and putting them up through the school like when they equals you know a whole pack of cigarettes like people don't know that kids don't know that they think that this is better when my doctor I mean my daughter is

1912
02:26:17,064 --> 02:26:20,447
[SPEAKER_08]: getting her nurse practitioner, and everybody comes in and said, oh, I quit smoking.

1913
02:26:20,487 --> 02:26:21,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just so happy.

1914
02:26:21,368 --> 02:26:22,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm only vaping now.

1915
02:26:23,029 --> 02:26:24,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's like, no.

1916
02:26:25,010 --> 02:26:26,832
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not something to be happy about.

1917
02:26:26,852 --> 02:26:29,394
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually worse for you in many ways.

1918
02:26:30,094 --> 02:26:31,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Even without the data, they know that.

1919
02:26:32,351 --> 02:26:37,074
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's particularly terrible for adolescents, obviously.

1920
02:26:37,234 --> 02:26:41,277
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, adults, the impact on adults is a bit different than on adolescents.

1921
02:26:41,757 --> 02:26:53,525
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are right now gathering up a lot of steam for our presentations to the faculty, the students, the community, through the PSAs, through literature, as well as presentations for the spring.

1922
02:26:53,565 --> 02:26:59,149
[SPEAKER_08]: And we talked about using the Vocal Graphics Department to make those posters.

1923
02:26:59,489 --> 02:27:00,230
[SPEAKER_08]: The sooner the better.

1924
02:27:00,833 --> 02:27:02,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get that education started.

1925
02:27:02,835 --> 02:27:06,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just let them talk about, hey, did you see that poster in the hallway?

1926
02:27:07,018 --> 02:27:08,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And then keep moving forward.

1927
02:27:11,122 --> 02:27:14,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I would hate to have a kid do it one more day than necessary.

1928
02:27:14,965 --> 02:27:15,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Agreed.

1929
02:27:16,386 --> 02:27:18,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your presentation.

1930
02:27:18,148 --> 02:27:24,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe by the end of the school year, you can follow up with some data and what things have worked and what

1931
02:27:24,892 --> 02:27:26,614
[SPEAKER_08]: which areas we need to improve.

1932
02:27:26,634 --> 02:27:30,597
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be happy to and obviously all of you are invited to that forum as well.

1933
02:27:30,717 --> 02:27:31,258
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope to attend.

1934
02:27:31,298 --> 02:27:31,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1935
02:27:31,738 --> 02:27:37,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting?

1936
02:27:38,164 --> 02:27:38,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved.

1937
02:27:38,564 --> 02:27:43,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have a second?

1938
02:27:44,289 --> 02:27:45,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Mayor Burke.

1939
02:28:06,922 --> 02:28:08,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Vice Chair.

1940
02:28:08,983 --> 02:28:16,669
[SPEAKER_13]: At this point, it is our last meeting of the calendar year, and we have two of our members that will be leaving us.

1941
02:28:17,409 --> 02:28:20,471
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'd like to pay tribute to them, Mr. Superintendent.

1942
02:28:21,732 --> 02:28:24,594
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a number of presentations here.

1943
02:28:24,934 --> 02:28:32,839
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd like to make each of them, and it's our custom to give everybody a chance to say something.

1944
02:28:32,899 --> 02:28:34,601
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can...

1945
02:28:36,304 --> 02:28:38,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Let everybody say something and then make the presentations.

1946
02:28:38,726 --> 02:28:39,606
[SPEAKER_15]: That's probably a good way to go.

1947
02:28:40,407 --> 02:28:40,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1948
02:28:40,547 --> 02:28:40,987
[SPEAKER_21]: Vandekloot.

1949
02:28:43,309 --> 02:28:44,009
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1950
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:54,356
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've been thinking about this for the last couple of weeks and really wondering what to say to my esteemed colleagues who are leaving us.

1951
02:28:55,957 --> 02:29:02,242
[SPEAKER_21]: First, I'm going to turn to Robert Emmett Scurry, who's been sitting next to me for an awfully long time.

1952
02:29:04,705 --> 02:29:15,953
[SPEAKER_21]: We've shared many different instances, but amongst our colleagues from the back, and some of these names won't mean anything to some of you, but some of them will mean a great deal to others.

1953
02:29:16,714 --> 02:29:32,025
[SPEAKER_21]: So we sat with Bill Brady, Lena DiGiantomaso, the esteemed Fred Pompeo, Mary Alabirdy, Carol Sharpton, Fred Lasky, Jack the Bulldog Buckley,

1954
02:29:33,331 --> 02:29:49,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Ed Nolan, Ron Vining, Beth Fuller, Sharon Guzik, Bill O'Keefe, the Honorable Mike McGlynn, and now our current colleagues, Erin, Mia, Kathy, Anne Marie, and of course Mayor Burke.

1955
02:29:51,064 --> 02:29:53,846
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if I got everybody, but I think I did.

1956
02:29:55,267 --> 02:30:01,032
[SPEAKER_21]: And through that, we've had a lot of different experiences.

1957
02:30:02,664 --> 02:30:08,066
[SPEAKER_21]: With Lena, we were climbing on roofs of buildings to check out the roofs.

1958
02:30:09,027 --> 02:30:15,410
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we had many, many long evenings as we prepared for building new schools.

1959
02:30:15,870 --> 02:30:26,975
[SPEAKER_21]: And I suspect, Bob, like me, your proudest moments come when you go see your name on those plaques in the new schools, because those were incredible, an incredible period of time.

1960
02:30:28,429 --> 02:30:30,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Bob, you and I haven't always gotten along.

1961
02:30:31,291 --> 02:30:33,512
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not always on the same page.

1962
02:30:34,313 --> 02:30:37,995
[SPEAKER_21]: But I know and have never doubted that your heart is in the right place.

1963
02:30:38,695 --> 02:30:52,564
[SPEAKER_21]: And this position here and your commitment to Medford and to the students of Medford has meant everything to you and that you have given a great deal of time and energy to the city of Medford and the children of Medford and our families.

1964
02:30:53,444 --> 02:30:54,405
[SPEAKER_21]: So colleague.

1965
02:30:54,745 --> 02:30:55,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Almost four decades.

1966
02:30:56,106 --> 02:30:57,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Almost four decades.

1967
02:30:58,183 --> 02:31:03,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Colleague, I'm not quite sure what it's going to be like sitting here without you, and I'm going to miss you.

1968
02:31:04,350 --> 02:31:08,275
[SPEAKER_21]: But I know that you will take your time and commitment and energy.

1969
02:31:09,136 --> 02:31:11,638
[SPEAKER_21]: Working on behalf of students in Medford will continue.

1970
02:31:12,139 --> 02:31:13,841
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you very much for your service.

1971
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:22,822
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, Mrs. Kunio, you've not been here quite as long as Mr. Scurry, but your impact has been huge over the last, is it 12?

1972
02:31:22,862 --> 02:31:23,642
[SPEAKER_21]: 12 years.

1973
02:31:24,043 --> 02:31:24,383
[SPEAKER_21]: 12 years.

1974
02:31:25,183 --> 02:31:28,924
[SPEAKER_21]: And in that time, we also got to see your family grow up.

1975
02:31:29,764 --> 02:31:31,105
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was pretty cool.

1976
02:31:31,985 --> 02:31:37,347
[SPEAKER_21]: So because those boys, they were in elementary school way back when, and now they're in college or beyond.

1977
02:31:38,187 --> 02:31:41,788
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's really been quite an amazing ride, Anne Marie, hasn't it?

1978
02:31:46,928 --> 02:31:47,568
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't do this.

1979
02:31:49,989 --> 02:31:50,529
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to.

1980
02:31:50,649 --> 02:31:50,949
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

1981
02:31:51,869 --> 02:32:01,791
[SPEAKER_21]: So in that ride, one has to say, I mean, through all of the different things, of course, like with Mr. Skerry, the building of the new schools was just an amazing project.

1982
02:32:01,831 --> 02:32:10,934
[SPEAKER_21]: And so many meetings, so many, so many meetings that we spent talking about the bigger picture and then the small picture.

1983
02:32:11,034 --> 02:32:16,195
[SPEAKER_21]: And the small picture was the color of the paint, the location of the switches,

1984
02:32:17,035 --> 02:32:23,880
[SPEAKER_21]: and then the bigger issues of equity, which was so, so, so important to us.

1985
02:32:24,621 --> 02:32:25,542
[SPEAKER_21]: And you were part of that.

1986
02:32:25,582 --> 02:32:27,203
[SPEAKER_21]: You were a very big part of that.

1987
02:32:28,244 --> 02:32:31,686
[SPEAKER_21]: And it fueled your becoming a school committee member.

1988
02:32:32,347 --> 02:32:36,250
[SPEAKER_21]: And we were all grateful for that.

1989
02:32:36,770 --> 02:32:38,071
[SPEAKER_21]: You went on, though, to be

1990
02:32:40,153 --> 02:32:42,534
[SPEAKER_21]: very active on the state level.

1991
02:32:42,894 --> 02:32:56,102
[SPEAKER_21]: First by becoming the head of division two for the MASC, Massachusetts Association of School Committee, and then working your way up to an incredible year as being president of the MASC and representing Medford.

1992
02:32:56,982 --> 02:33:05,870
[SPEAKER_21]: I quite honestly believe that, sorry, most of my colleagues here don't really realize what you did during the course of that period of time.

1993
02:33:06,431 --> 02:33:17,481
[SPEAKER_21]: But I was fortunate to sit on the board with Anne-Marie and be able to experience her leadership and the amount of work and travel that it took over that time.

1994
02:33:18,442 --> 02:33:21,945
[SPEAKER_21]: So Anne-Marie, maybe luckily my voice is giving out.

1995
02:33:23,578 --> 02:33:26,540
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to thank you as a friend and as a colleague.

1996
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:28,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your time and effort.

1997
02:33:28,481 --> 02:33:34,664
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know that you will be continuing to give your heart and your love to the city of Medford.

1998
02:33:34,684 --> 02:33:40,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1999
02:33:40,747 --> 02:33:40,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

2000
02:33:40,808 --> 02:33:41,488
[SPEAKER_08]: DiBenedetto.

2001
02:33:42,088 --> 02:33:42,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2002
02:33:42,548 --> 02:33:43,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to find my notes.

2003
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:45,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here they are.

2004
02:33:48,297 --> 02:33:53,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Farewell to my school committee members and friends, Robert M. and Skerry and Ann Marie Cuneo.

2005
02:33:54,162 --> 02:33:59,406
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I want to thank you both for your service and your commitment to the students of Medford.

2006
02:34:01,787 --> 02:34:07,712
[SPEAKER_08]: They are why we are here, and you've always put what's in their best interest first.

2007
02:34:08,252 --> 02:34:13,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Ann Marie, you've worked hard from the first moment you decided to run for school committee.

2008
02:34:14,117 --> 02:34:15,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I might have been there then.

2009
02:34:16,107 --> 02:34:16,527
[SPEAKER_11]: You were there.

2010
02:34:16,888 --> 02:34:17,668
[SPEAKER_11]: You were a parent.

2011
02:34:19,110 --> 02:34:20,050
[SPEAKER_11]: We were all parents.

2012
02:34:21,091 --> 02:34:25,395
[SPEAKER_08]: You have done many things that have benefited this city, this great city.

2013
02:34:26,116 --> 02:34:31,160
[SPEAKER_08]: A few I want to mention are how you helped develop the summer camp program,

2014
02:34:32,201 --> 02:34:44,483
[SPEAKER_08]: You represented Meffitt very well on the state level, and you made sure our little theater was remodeled so that our students have a professional place to perform and to receive their many awards.

2015
02:34:45,163 --> 02:34:51,844
[SPEAKER_08]: You've worked tirelessly to attain what is best for the students and the employees of Meffitt Public Schools.

2016
02:34:52,364 --> 02:34:53,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for all your years.

2017
02:34:53,905 --> 02:34:54,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2018
02:34:55,585 --> 02:35:00,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Bob, your quiet mannerism and knowledge in history

2019
02:35:01,448 --> 02:35:04,229
[SPEAKER_08]: of MedFit have always amazed me.

2020
02:35:05,349 --> 02:35:12,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Your passion to make sure our MedFit students have civics in the curriculum has benefited all of MedFit students.

2021
02:35:13,172 --> 02:35:27,577
[SPEAKER_08]: You have always looked out for me on this committee to make sure I follow the rules and ask the questions in a manner that I get the answers I need and to not get myself in too much trouble.

2022
02:35:28,057 --> 02:35:29,958
[SPEAKER_08]: You also know who everyone is

2023
02:35:31,952 --> 02:35:36,936
[SPEAKER_08]: in what their job is, that also has been tremendously helpful to me.

2024
02:35:37,996 --> 02:35:45,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be calling to ask you many questions, and I'm sure you'll be sending me message of what I did wrong and how to ask it right the next time.

2025
02:35:47,223 --> 02:35:54,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am so happy to have had the opportunity to serve with such devoted members for the last six years.

2026
02:35:54,989 --> 02:35:58,932
[SPEAKER_08]: In closing, I just want to say how much I will miss you, making faces,

2027
02:36:00,307 --> 02:36:09,751
[SPEAKER_08]: at me, across the chambers, or beside me, when I go on about an issue, or I ask oh so many questions.

2028
02:36:10,632 --> 02:36:20,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And I might miss when you piggyback one of my comments, which happened again tonight, to make sure that the superintendent understands what I meant.

2029
02:36:20,116 --> 02:36:23,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm grateful to both of you.

2030
02:36:26,095 --> 02:36:33,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm grateful to both of you for the things I have learned while working with you and wish you great things as you move forward, onward.

2031
02:36:37,462 --> 02:36:38,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2032
02:36:38,363 --> 02:36:38,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

2033
02:36:39,243 --> 02:36:40,384
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I'll start with Bob.

2034
02:36:41,064 --> 02:36:44,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob, I want to thank you very much for your years of dedication.

2035
02:36:44,266 --> 02:36:48,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I see your eyes light up when you go to a classroom.

2036
02:36:48,489 --> 02:36:53,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to a kindergarten classroom with you to pilot at the Roberts Elementary.

2037
02:36:53,652 --> 02:36:55,312
[SPEAKER_06]: and we had a blast together.

2038
02:36:55,332 --> 02:37:01,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Noah absolutely loves you and he has the same passion for history that you have.

2039
02:37:02,254 --> 02:37:17,718

[SPEAKER_06]: And I just thank you so much for that.

2042
02:37:24,380 --> 02:37:25,920

2050

[SPEAKER_06]: She immediately started telling me okay well there's the MASC and you need to go to one of the meetings to you know the

02:39:40,329 --> 02:39:40,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2076
02:39:41,189 --> 02:39:42,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

2077
02:39:44,391 --> 02:39:56,858
[SPEAKER_15]: So having been around a long time, having seen an awful lot of things, and having interacted with both of you in different ways and at different times, I have some perspective.

2078
02:39:56,918 --> 02:39:58,039
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll start with Bob.

2079
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:01,081
[SPEAKER_15]: So Bob, you've been a coach.

2080
02:40:01,661 --> 02:40:02,441
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been a teacher.

2081
02:40:03,583 --> 02:40:04,944
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been active in the community.

2082
02:40:04,984 --> 02:40:09,707
[SPEAKER_15]: You've come from a family with tremendous tradition in public service.

2083
02:40:10,708 --> 02:40:13,009
[SPEAKER_15]: An uncle who was a mayor of the city.

2084
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:21,375
[SPEAKER_15]: You had a relative who was an uncle, I guess, who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

2085
02:40:21,495 --> 02:40:26,178
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been on this committee through different periods of time when different activities were going on.

2086
02:40:27,977 --> 02:40:30,537
[SPEAKER_15]: You experienced the sting of Proposition 2 1⁄2.

2087
02:40:31,018 --> 02:40:36,779
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what it's like to be a teacher who got displaced, so you had always empathy for teachers.

2088
02:40:37,919 --> 02:40:42,160
[SPEAKER_15]: And you worked for the state auditor, and you had a really good investigative mind.

2089
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:50,141
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you play Columbo and Mickey the Dunce, we know that you really know what's going on, even though you don't let on that you really know what's going on.

2090
02:40:50,901 --> 02:40:55,122
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes, you know, it's kind of interesting to see how you play that out.

2091
02:40:55,922 --> 02:41:00,047
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyone who knows Bob Scurry knows that Bobby really cares about kids.

2092
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:07,295
[SPEAKER_15]: He does a lot of things that he doesn't take credit for, just quiet on the side, takes care of a kid here, takes care of a family there.

2093
02:41:07,315 --> 02:41:09,257
[SPEAKER_15]: And he just doesn't talk about it.

2094
02:41:09,758 --> 02:41:11,520
[SPEAKER_15]: But I know about it because I hear about it.

2095
02:41:12,040 --> 02:41:16,681
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that that really reflects on your good heart and your caring.

2096
02:41:17,361 --> 02:41:25,203
[SPEAKER_15]: And even though sometimes it looks like you've got that bravado coming on, you're really a soft puppy and you really care about people.

2097
02:41:25,643 --> 02:41:32,865
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're really one of these guys that you can always count on for loyalty and knowing what's going on without making a big deal out of it.

2098
02:41:33,665 --> 02:41:35,686
[SPEAKER_15]: You were the secretary for the committee for many years.

2099
02:41:35,706 --> 02:41:36,946
[SPEAKER_15]: You went over all the bills.

2100
02:41:37,586 --> 02:41:39,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Very little got by you, if anything got by you.

2101
02:41:41,207 --> 02:41:43,729
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and you sometimes give me a wink and say, what is this?

2102
02:41:44,489 --> 02:41:47,251
[SPEAKER_15]: And I try to dance a little bit, and you give me a wink.

2103
02:41:47,731 --> 02:41:49,512
[SPEAKER_15]: And you say, don't do it again.

2104
02:41:49,592 --> 02:41:51,333
[SPEAKER_15]: And I remember all those things.

2105
02:41:51,373 --> 02:41:53,875
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a lot of history, Bob.

2106
02:41:53,995 --> 02:41:58,177
[SPEAKER_15]: We go back a long way, and I look forward to seeing you around the community and interacting with you.

2107
02:41:58,217 --> 02:42:06,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know that while you're not sitting as a member, you'll still be an active citizen and an active contributor to the young people of this community.

2108
02:42:06,482 --> 02:42:07,923
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what it's all about.

2109
02:42:08,663 --> 02:42:09,564
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it's all about, pal.

2110
02:42:10,756 --> 02:42:15,641
[SPEAKER_15]: So Ann Marie, you are a person that I've come to know very, very well.

2111
02:42:15,661 --> 02:42:25,169
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been very active, you were involved with student sports, you were involved with student activities, very little.

2112
02:42:25,970 --> 02:42:28,132
[SPEAKER_15]: went on that Ann Marie didn't get involved in.

2113
02:42:28,373 --> 02:42:32,197
[SPEAKER_15]: School councils, you were one of the great joiners of all time.

2114
02:42:32,657 --> 02:42:39,165
[SPEAKER_15]: If there was something to belong to, Ann Marie was one of the members who was joining on to that activity.

2115
02:42:40,166 --> 02:42:43,609
[SPEAKER_15]: You rose up through the ranks, you became involved in the state association.

2116
02:42:44,310 --> 02:42:56,435
[SPEAKER_15]: to the rank of president of MASC, which gave you incredible perspective, and you brought back a lot of very good ideas, and brought back an awful lot of very, very good thoughts to help the school system move forward.

2117
02:42:58,096 --> 02:42:58,957
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been a good friend.

2118
02:42:58,977 --> 02:43:07,280
[SPEAKER_15]: I can always count on you to listen and to understand some of the perspectives we may have, even if you couldn't vote on a particular issue the way I wanted.

2119
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:11,722
[SPEAKER_15]: But still, you understood it, and you provided good feedback.

2120
02:43:13,503 --> 02:43:29,098
[SPEAKER_15]: You're an individual that I will clearly miss along with Bob, you know what I mean, as I feel like you've really contributed and I believe that your involvement at the state level will continue to be an important factor as we go forward in public education.

2121
02:43:29,118 --> 02:43:33,162
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank you both because it's been a great ride with both of you.

2122
02:43:34,744 --> 02:43:43,652
[SPEAKER_15]: As I reflect on all the things that I've come to see, I know that the two of you are among the best school committee members that I've served with, so I want to thank you all.

2123
02:43:44,053 --> 02:43:44,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2124
02:43:44,693 --> 02:43:45,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2125
02:43:53,101 --> 02:43:54,423
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could call Ann Marie up.

2126
02:44:02,108 --> 02:44:13,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations, the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Ann Marie Cuno on your many years of service to the children and families of Medford as a member of the Medford School Committee, signed by all of the members.

2127
02:44:14,466 --> 02:44:15,787
[SPEAKER_13]: We wish you the very best of luck.

2128
02:44:15,807 --> 02:44:15,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2129
02:44:17,290 --> 02:44:17,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2130
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:18,011
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll miss you.

2131
02:44:31,496 --> 02:44:36,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say thank you to all of you.

2132
02:44:36,559 --> 02:44:40,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it.

2133
02:44:42,830 --> 02:44:51,813
[SPEAKER_11]: This was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too.

2134
02:44:52,854 --> 02:44:54,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody comes from a different perspective.

2135
02:44:56,475 --> 02:45:00,597
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing that when I started, I started with, I was,

2136
02:45:01,557 --> 02:45:02,217
[SPEAKER_11]: the new member.

2137
02:45:03,317 --> 02:45:07,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And within the next term, I became a senior member.

2138
02:45:07,938 --> 02:45:11,339
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee.

2139
02:45:12,239 --> 02:45:14,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were lucky enough to get on board.

2140
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:22,782
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door.

2141
02:45:23,843 --> 02:45:26,944
[SPEAKER_11]: and keep what's important in here, okay?

2142
02:45:28,064 --> 02:45:29,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I said I was going to do this.

2143
02:45:29,565 --> 02:45:40,207
[SPEAKER_11]: So, with that being said, always make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else.

2144
02:45:40,768 --> 02:45:49,970
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are.

2145
02:45:51,213 --> 02:45:54,695
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to be disrespectful to any PTOs.

2146
02:45:55,215 --> 02:45:55,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been there.

2147
02:45:56,475 --> 02:45:57,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been on the side councils.

2148
02:45:58,176 --> 02:46:00,077
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not a glorified PTO.

2149
02:46:00,577 --> 02:46:05,099
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to abide by rules, regulations, the state and federal government.

2150
02:46:05,699 --> 02:46:09,021
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not.

2151
02:46:09,901 --> 02:46:19,205
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent who always has his door open.

2152
02:46:21,007 --> 02:46:22,669
[SPEAKER_11]: This was my decision, I'm crying.

2153
02:46:22,689 --> 02:46:24,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank God I didn't get it now.

2154
02:46:24,771 --> 02:46:27,334
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't because I didn't want to be here.

2155
02:46:28,516 --> 02:46:39,369
[SPEAKER_11]: He opened up the door and to the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present.

2156
02:46:40,670 --> 02:46:47,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Perrella, really all of the principals have always had an open door.

2157
02:46:48,956 --> 02:46:54,560
[SPEAKER_11]: When I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office.

2158
02:46:54,620 --> 02:46:57,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea.

2159
02:46:57,903 --> 02:46:59,084
[SPEAKER_11]: What is she gonna come up with today?

2160
02:46:59,564 --> 02:47:02,126
[SPEAKER_11]: But all in all, it was just a wonderful ride.

2161
02:47:03,687 --> 02:47:08,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And I couldn't have done it without the people back there.

2162
02:47:08,110 --> 02:47:08,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh.

2163
02:47:11,999 --> 02:47:14,519
[SPEAKER_11]: When I decided to run, it was a family decision.

2164
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:25,283
[SPEAKER_11]: My family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight who probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college.

2165
02:47:25,964 --> 02:47:30,285
[SPEAKER_11]: And Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here.

2166
02:47:30,305 --> 02:47:39,509
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, to my husband, to my son, Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who has always been there for me to make me look good back here.

2167
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:55,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Work with your minds, but really work with your heart.

2168
02:48:13,578 --> 02:48:16,047
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no more, I have plenty of life, believe me.

2169
02:48:16,328 --> 02:48:17,412
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the relaxing part.

2170
02:48:25,142 --> 02:48:26,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

2171
02:48:26,563 --> 02:48:27,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, it's great to be back.

2172
02:48:27,463 --> 02:48:30,965
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Robert Emmett Skerry, Jr.

2173
02:48:31,485 --> 02:48:36,448
[SPEAKER_13]: on your many years of service to the children and families of Medford as a member of the Medford School Committee.

2174
02:48:36,788 --> 02:48:37,949
[SPEAKER_13]: We wish you the best of luck.

2175
02:48:38,489 --> 02:48:41,371
[SPEAKER_13]: This man made a buddy bench for the Brooks School.

2176
02:48:42,511 --> 02:48:44,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely beautiful piece of furniture.

2177
02:48:44,232 --> 02:48:45,253
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know you always have the kids.

2178
02:48:45,273 --> 02:48:46,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's supposed to know about that.

2179
02:48:46,234 --> 02:48:47,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Always have the kids at heart.

2180
02:48:47,354 --> 02:48:47,994
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what?

2181
02:48:48,395 --> 02:48:49,035
[SPEAKER_13]: It's important.

2182
02:48:49,195 --> 02:48:52,417
[SPEAKER_13]: You do really nice things behind the scenes, and we appreciate it.

2183
02:48:52,637 --> 02:48:54,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody needs a picnic table, just let me know.

2184
02:48:58,042 --> 02:49:04,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long, long, long, fun term being a school committee member here in Medford.

2185
02:49:04,511 --> 02:49:08,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Roy, I'm not gonna let you sneak out on skates tonight.

2186
02:49:08,917 --> 02:49:14,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've done a lot of great things for Medford, but the only thing that I really disagree with you with,

2187
02:49:14,905 --> 02:49:17,888
[SPEAKER_02]: was when you tried to take my soccer field and baseball diamond away.

2188
02:49:18,248 --> 02:49:21,151
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, remember when he wanted to build a school to place that back?

2189
02:49:21,651 --> 02:49:23,994
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had a lot of fun.

2190
02:49:24,354 --> 02:49:29,179
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the main reasons I ran for the school committee was I wanted to see the schools change.

2191
02:49:30,323 --> 02:49:31,143
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done a complete 180.

2192
02:49:32,644 --> 02:49:38,687
[SPEAKER_02]: We have beautiful buildings, and I just hope that you guys will keep up and give them the maintenance that they need.

2193
02:49:39,208 --> 02:49:41,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It was long overdue with a city this size.

2194
02:49:42,490 --> 02:49:44,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I've met a lot of friends along the way.

2195
02:49:44,691 --> 02:49:47,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had the dubious distinction of working with Bev Nelson.

2196
02:49:49,133 --> 02:49:51,415
[SPEAKER_02]: She was my mentor when I taught at the Roberts.

2197
02:49:51,956 --> 02:50:08,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I taught at the high school, I taught at the vocational school, and like Roy said, Prop 2 1⁄2 came by, I gave up my coaching job, and I rediscovered myself as an investigator, but I never lost my feelings for education.

2198
02:50:09,911 --> 02:50:11,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm here.

2199
02:50:13,607 --> 02:50:20,433
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, one of the members of the fourth estate gave me the wonderful pen name of the laconic one.

2200
02:50:20,913 --> 02:50:30,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that it's a lot easier to work behind the scenes, make your opinions known, do your homework, do your research, and get things done that had to be done.

2201
02:50:30,662 --> 02:50:33,704
[SPEAKER_02]: A few years back, we needed kindergarten aides.

2202
02:50:35,305 --> 02:50:39,248
[SPEAKER_02]: It was out there, it was an issue that had to be contended, dealt with.

2203
02:50:39,949 --> 02:50:41,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Budget time came, nobody said anything.

2204
02:50:42,051 --> 02:50:47,395
[SPEAKER_02]: The 11th hour, I spoke up, and we got our kindergarten dates thanks to Mr. Belson.

2205
02:50:47,795 --> 02:50:49,937
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that the kids deserve.

2206
02:50:50,918 --> 02:50:55,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that I've always been proud of, that I've always fought for the underdog.

2207
02:50:55,482 --> 02:51:09,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always made sure that kids at the high school that were having problems passing their MCAS test, that we provided the instruction and the tools that they needed to compete in a global economy, finish their education, and move on.

2208
02:51:10,510 --> 02:51:23,457
