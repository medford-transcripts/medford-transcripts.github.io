1
00:00:00,554 --> 00:00:01,314
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,354 --> 00:00:07,056
This is the November 18th meeting of the Medford Historical Commission.

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:09,956
I'm going to call the meeting to order at 7.01 p.m.

4
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:13,997
I'm going to read the governor's statement, and then we'll jump right into our agenda.

5
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:24,700
On March 29, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law to March 31, 2025.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,321
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings

7
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:38,189
without a quorum of the public body physically present at a meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:47,739
The language does not make substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:01:03,347
So for everybody following along, this meeting is gonna be recorded, usually it's posted to Medford Community Media a couple of days after the meeting, sometimes it's being broadcast live.

10
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:13,033
And if anybody wants to follow along, we publish our information along with our agenda on our website, www.medfordhistoricalcommission.org.

11
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:18,137
You can go to the news section and see the latest information that we posted there for tonight's meeting.

12
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:25,064
All right, tonight we are going to start off with 110 Brooks Street.

13
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:30,907
Motion on the subcommittee recommends to lift the demolition delay.

14
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:39,110
So I posted on the website for all to see the new design that the owners have worked with us on.

15
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,611
The subcommittee met with the owners.

16
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:44,652
They made multiple changes to the design.

17
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,873
We'll see if I can

18
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:56,711
bring those up right now real quick, just so we have an opportunity to see them.

19
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:02,919
Does everybody can see my screen?

20
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,271
So we made just very simple changes.

21
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:11,113
There's a great line here, just so you don't get confused.

22
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:12,855
This is Stone Foundation.

23
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:17,598
We provided trim around all the windows, changed the window designs up.

24
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:25,605
We maintained this pediment window on the third level, made changes surrounding the doors to more traditional design.

25
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:31,189
And then we reverted back to more traditional windows and more traditional materials on the,

26
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:35,712
mainly the front facade, but it carries through for the rest of the project.

27
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:41,916
And overall, I think the subcommittee was entirely happy with the way that this project is proposed now.

28
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:47,139
And I think the subcommittee is comfortable with recommending that the commission lift the delay.

29
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,582
Any questions, comments from commissioners?

30
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:59,406
So Ed, you're moving to release the delay on the building.

31
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:06,185
you know, subject to the plan submitted to the building department.

32
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:09,227
Okay.

33
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:10,247
Do I hear a second?

34
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:12,448
Second.

35
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:13,969
Okay, Eleni.

36
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:15,249
Eleni, got it.

37
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:19,331
Okay.

38
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:21,913
Motion's been made and seconded.

39
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:24,794
I'll just go around as I see you on my screen.

40
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:25,214
Doug?

41
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:26,475
Yes.

42
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:28,576
And Eleni?

43
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:29,416
Yes.

44
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:31,217
And Peter?

45
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:32,072
Yes.

46
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:33,374
And Ed?

47
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:35,598
Yes.

48
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:36,840
And Kit?

49
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:37,941
Yes.

50
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,405
All right, motion passes five zero.

51
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:47,740
All right, so I will tonight, the owners have already uploaded this to the permit system.

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,883
So I will pull together my letter and I will upload it to the permit system and then I will release the permit.

53
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,664
So tomorrow morning they can contact the building department.

54
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:02,106
And if there's anything further on the building department side, they will take care of that and take care of the permit.

55
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:07,649
Thank you, Adriana and Chris for working with us.

56
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:08,989
Good luck on your project.

57
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:10,410
Yeah, thank you so much.

58
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:11,487
Good luck.

59
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:12,468
Good luck.

60
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:12,768
Thank you.

61
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:14,029
Can't wait to see the finished design.

62
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:15,330
Me too.

63
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,831
All right.

64
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:18,912
Have a good night.

65
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:19,652
Thank you.

66
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:20,373
You too.

67
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:20,713
Thank you.

68
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:22,714
OK.

69
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:25,796
Next up on the agenda, 20 Harvard Ave.

70
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:28,038
I sent around a section 106 review.

71
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:33,521
We often receive these little documents that are for cell phone tower additions, alterations.

72
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:38,984
This is a cell phone tower on a building that is already loaded with cell phone towers.

73
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,067
Doug and I reviewed this as the section 106 committee.

74
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:45,449
We didn't think it was necessary to comment.

75
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:50,152
We just will send them that we have no comment, provided that the commission has no comment.

76
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:52,634
So our recommendation is that the commission has no comment.

77
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:54,775
Any questions, comments, concerns?

78
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:56,596
Agreed.

79
00:04:56,676 --> 00:05:06,303
Move that the MHC expressly have no comment on the Harvard Avenue project.

80
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:08,184
OK.

81
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:09,065
And a second?

82
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:12,882
I'll second.

83
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,003
Who was that?

84
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:15,783
Was that Kit?

85
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:16,804
Yeah, that was Kit.

86
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,565
All right, motion's been made and seconded.

87
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:20,745
I'll go around.

88
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:20,985
Doug?

89
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:21,745
Yes.

90
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:22,806
Eleni?

91
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:26,047
Yes.

92
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:27,027
Peter?

93
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:27,947
Yes.

94
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:29,508
Ed?

95
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:32,249
Yes.

96
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:33,669
Yeah, yes, get it there.

97
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:34,650
Kit?

98
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,290
Yes.

99
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,350
Okay, great.

100
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,671
Motion passes five to zero.

101
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:40,957
Okay, next.

102
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:43,478
Preservation ordinance discussion.

103
00:05:45,859 --> 00:06:00,666
We received some information that Redding has a really robust ordinance geared towards their existing historic properties that is specific in the sense that it

104
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:14,574
it helps non-conforming buildings, helps the zoning board and community development board in those communities grant relief to non-conforming buildings when historic preservation is in play.

105
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:20,978
And so I sent around the ordinance for the commissioners to review because I think it's

106
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,962
It might be something that the city of Medford might want to consider.

107
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:28,425
And so I think we should first give it a review.

108
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:37,214
And if we think that it's something worthwhile to support, I think we should also that approach the zoning board and the community development board here.

109
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:41,739
And, of course, the Department of planning, sustainability and development and.

110
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,609
get them involved to see if we might work together to bring that to the City Council for review and approval.

111
00:06:51,730 --> 00:07:01,662
And of course along the way there'll be a robust community participation and feedback sessions that we want to educate the community as to why we might want to

112
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:04,544
appropriate something like that.

113
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:18,267
But it would be a really good tool for all those projects in Medford that, like our borderline, require some very minor variances and that sort of thing for dimensional requirements, slot size, etc.

114
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:28,890
That would give all boards, including ourselves, a few more tools in their arsenal to help support projects, to help things move along in the city.

115
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,671
I don't know if anybody had a chance to review the

116
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:38,939
Information I sent out this afternoon already, but if you haven't, we can just kind of get it on the table now and spend the next 30 days reviewing it.

117
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:47,348
If that makes sense, I took a quick look at it.

118
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,011
Is it only for residential projects.

119
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,985
I think that's how they worded it, but I haven't dug into it too much.

120
00:07:56,025 --> 00:08:03,929
I mean, we could make it for more than, we have, I think our community is a little bit more, has more commercial buildings than theirs does.

121
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,592
And their center may be in a historic district, I'm not exactly sure.

122
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:14,516
But I think the majority of their community is residential.

123
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,198
But we could certainly tailor it to.

124
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:39,578
You know, when I did a very quick scan a minute ago, one thing which caught me was that it would be required that any project benefiting from the North Reading Ordinance would have to agree to historical preservation easements, which is fine in principle.

125
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:43,900
But the whole problem I see is who becomes the enforcing party.

126
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,762
We've been talking here about whether the MHC can become

127
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:54,135
the holder of the easement or not, and I'm not sure that's, you know, whether that's, you know, that is what you're looking for, what they're looking for there.

128
00:08:55,496 --> 00:09:13,764
Yeah, I think the path of least resistance there may actually just be that they agree instead of saying preservation easements, which is a strong form of enforcement, that it may just be more beneficial to put the project in a local historic district in that particular instance where

129
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:21,211
Most of the concern for additions and repairs and whatnot is the exterior.

130
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:29,338
So really, the only thing we would concern ourselves with in a historic preservation project of that nature is the exterior of the building.

131
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:32,141
Therefore, you don't need a preservation easement to accomplish it.

132
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,142
You could put it in the district.

133
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,416
You can abolish a district.

134
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:44,138
So I can see why they might use the language for preservation easements, which are a little bit more difficult to abolish.

135
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:50,480
But we could maybe put something in writing that says, you're not going to.

136
00:09:51,801 --> 00:10:00,064
The agreement is that they're not going to try to approach city council or whatever to try to abolish the district for a certain period of time.

137
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:03,245
And if they do, then it's in writing.

138
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:20,640
I mean, that to me is the one problem with, again, whatever your view of even single home districts are in principle, they do have to go to the city council, which has shown signs of never being a rubber stamp on such issues.

139
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,673
Yeah, I mean, they just passed a local historic district with something like 15 properties in it.

140
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:34,798
So I think the current council supports districts, but I don't know about future endeavors.

141
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:35,799
So we'll have to see.

142
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,382
Ryan, you emailed this earlier today, is that correct?

143
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,903
Yeah, yeah, with the agenda.

144
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:56,995
Okay, yeah, I just if you want to take time, I think if we review it over the next 30 days and provide initial feedback over email, and then let's take those thoughts and see how we might craft something.

145
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,356
And then there are.

146
00:10:58,977 --> 00:10:59,677
Key pieces, right?

147
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:05,902
Like, we've got to approach Alicia and community development and all those boards to get their sign on.

148
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:10,024
KP law would need to take a look at it at least there and then we have to have a.

149
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:13,046
uh, you know, a community input process.

150
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:19,668
I think it's important anytime you're doing this, you might want to start with what is the community think of it right off the bat.

151
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:25,190
What problem are we trying to solve with this legislation without getting too deeply into it?

152
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,712
I think there are a lot of buildings that are on the borderline of being able to, uh, pass, um,

153
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:45,245
past muster in front of a, for variances and historic preservation is not currently in their tool of arsenals.

154
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:51,170
They can say, you know, they can't really say, you know, it's good for the community.

155
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:59,798
This kind of clears the way for that and gives them just one more thing that they can use as a positive for the community, you know.

156
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:12,054
Well, and especially if if those projects are like really, really close to like being sufficient, but like what stands between them is say 5 feet, right?

157
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:16,496
And they need a 5 foot variance or something like that because they almost have the square foot.

158
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:21,917
Apparently it's really easy to challenge variances in the community.

159
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:28,079
This would kind of further solidify and give more ammunition to preventing any sort of.

160
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,971
small and minor variances that really will help push a project.

161
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:38,796
It's never going to stop somebody completely from challenging it, but I think that's also a help.

162
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,877
Go ahead, Ed.

163
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:49,424
The other thing I saw was it did provide, in effect, subdivision relief in some cases that would permit you to carve out a lot.

164
00:12:50,770 --> 00:13:08,730
And the issue there is, again, I'm not going to express a marriage view, but the grandfather's house situation where the lot which was carved out did not look, you know, did not look anything like grandfather's house, even though they did preserve grandmother's house.

165
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:28,516
Yeah, I think we would want to avoid somebody here, I think it might have been on this board, called them fork chop lots, where they're just carved out with any sort of space and size to meet the dimensional requirements of the code, but they clearly don't meet the spirit of the code.

166
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:38,363
So I think that we could certainly, and I think since city council has changed some of their zoning, it's possible that that

167
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:47,787
has been rectified and we don't have to tackle that portion in this proposed code relief.

168
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:53,309
We can really craft it for anything that we need it to do or not do.

169
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:57,571
And of course, we have to make sure that we're not stepping on anything else.

170
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:12,568
It would be really interesting to talk to somebody at the Reading, assuming they have a historic commission, which they apparently do, and just get a sense of how it's worked and what it's been used for.

171
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:17,850
Okay, I can reach out to Virginia.

172
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:30,703
There's a Virginia that has come to our board before that we talked about, because they had a six-month demo delay, and they were able to establish a local historic district in their town for a building that they wanted to save.

173
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:34,365
And I can see if she's still on the board.

174
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:43,069
If not, you can try to get somebody else and have a joint afternoon meeting or something like that, just to have a discussion saying, we're interested in your bylaw.

175
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:43,609
What works?

176
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:44,150
What doesn't?

177
00:14:44,950 --> 00:15:07,035
have you changed anything what sort of process did you go through to get it what problems were you trying to solve that sort of thing yeah they've got 19 years since 2005 it passed so this should be a track record there that's pretty substantial by this point i would think okay all right i'll ask them uh to set up a maybe we can set up a zoom meeting and um certainly try to get them to come to the you know if not

178
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,792
the next meeting, maybe we can have a special meeting some afternoon.

179
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:16,036
I just have to, you know, if we're all going to be in the same room, even if it's an informational meeting, just for safety sake, I should post it.

180
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:22,720
So, you know, if there's just a subcommittee and just a few of us interested in that sort of thing, then I don't have to post it.

181
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,783
But I think out of the spirit of things, we should just post the meeting whenever we get it set up.

182
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:30,746
So because the public might be interested to and learning more about it.

183
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:34,308
So Okay, anybody else?

184
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:35,129
Any other questions?

185
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:42,440
All right, hearing none, you have the link, so we can certainly review that over the next 30 days.

186
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,488
I'll work on that meeting, and you guys can send comments around, and we'll go from there.

187
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:51,759
Next up is officer's positions.

188
00:15:52,079 --> 00:16:02,807
So I put this on here because Jen expressed to me that she might want to shake up her position here at MHC.

189
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,908
And I told her that was fine.

190
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:11,413
I am willing to step up as chair for next year for the 2025 season.

191
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:16,957
But I wanted to put it in all the commissioner's minds, those who I've asked and who I haven't yet asked.

192
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:21,599
If anybody wants to be vice chair, I'm certainly open to it.

193
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,021
It certainly would express their help.

194
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,723
Peter will be secretary for next year.

195
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:28,524
He's already claimed that role.

196
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:32,286
So if you're thinking about jumping out of secretary's shoes, you can't do it.

197
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:37,469
But we will also have, you're muted, Peter.

198
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,614
Two points on that.

199
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:53,571
One would be that I want to express my thanks to the commission for the kind gift after the bereavement last week.

200
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:54,792
It did mean a lot.

201
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:56,594
It's sitting on the kitchen table right now.

202
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:07,104
The second thing is in terms of my future service, I am unlikely to seek reappointment at the end of whatever my term is.

203
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,863
I don't think I'm going to be living in the city in two years.

204
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:15,205
It may be less than that.

205
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:24,456
The nest is emptied and we're probably turning over the custodianship of the house to somebody else with the full intent to be preserved.

206
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:37,079
But in terms of a combination of emptiness and desire to no longer deal with two stories, it's likely not going to be our house in now what I would have to call foreseeable future.

207
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:43,460
And probably if we are out of the city, I would probably resign subject to appointment of successor at that point.

208
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:45,881
Okay.

209
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:46,481
Yeah.

210
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:47,841
Your term is good until 12-21-2030.

211
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:48,961
So no, I'm just kidding.

212
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:54,603
I saw Doug's face.

213
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:59,505
It's, um... What is this?

214
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:02,026
Is this a Soviet election year?

215
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:02,706
What is this?

216
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:08,469
It's called Ball and Chain Organization, where once you join, you can't unjoin.

217
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,991
No, Ed, you're good until 2025, December 1st.

218
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:21,015
So if you'd like to serve out the rest of your term, I think that's... No, I think at that point, I would not want to make a commitment beyond that point.

219
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:24,199
but I did want to give people fair notes from a recruiting point of view.

220
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:28,264
All right, so add his chair next year.

221
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:36,635
We're gonna need a sharp legal mind to replace him because he's been very good on a lot of these tough issues.

222
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:54,306
Yes, there's definitely no replacing him, but we will put a call out maybe somewhere at the six month mark or so, saying that we're looking for volunteers and then see if we can get a suitable replacement.

223
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:59,447
Ed, any thoughts on turning your house into a single house historic district to make sure it's preserved?

224
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:10,625
That is, you, I started getting into this when you first posed this question to me about 15 years ago.

225
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:23,451
My tip is going to be that, you know, and we've had this discussion, you know, and we went through this actually my father-in-law's house, which did not merit preservation legally in Belmont.

226
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:27,153
But we, you know, you know, if we had a choice between

227
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:37,098
uh, choice between the flip, you know, the, the flippers with the bulldozers and somebody would take the, take a mid-century modern house as it was, we sold to the person who would take the mid-century modern house.

228
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:50,823
And, you know, we, we have talked to people already because as Jen will tell you, uh, whatever, however they price the house, that pricing includes an assumption there's going to be a lot of interior work to be done, uh, at that point.

229
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:55,344
But I think we do want to, again, we've been custodians for 36, 37 odd years and,

230
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,386
we would intend to sell to another custodian.

231
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:00,587
Good.

232
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:01,347
Good.

233
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,328
All right.

234
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,349
Well, thank you for the notice.

235
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:13,853
And since at a full disclosure, I'd be telling you, you'd be waiting three and a half years to tear the place down anyway, while your mortgage is being paid.

236
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,214
I don't think we're going to see that.

237
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:18,776
No, I think it's already been moved once.

238
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:27,458
I think it has enough of its own legacy between being moved and being cared for by people who really like it, that it's a no brainer.

239
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,858
And you're right across the street from the royal house.

240
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,619
It itself is kind of a good pair side by side.

241
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,460
So I don't think it'll be any question that somebody will try to develop it.

242
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:40,901
So.

243
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:47,689
All right, and then Doug, I don't know, when does your CPC term expire?

244
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,330
Not sure, let me look into it, hold on a second.

245
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,230
Okay.

246
00:20:55,151 --> 00:21:07,654
Just because if we're rattling everything, we might as well just rattle everything and just see if somebody else might want to just grab your position on CPC, but I don't think they will.

247
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:10,973
If somebody wants to have an extra 12 meetings every year, call me.

248
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,303
Yeah, well, I know you, I know you're on the Brooks Estate and I know Jen is on the Brooks Estate.

249
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:33,333
So we're just trying to, you know, kind of like spread various workloads around because I know the Brooks Estate is going to spend a good amount of time trying to get up and running as a venue and, you know, working on reinventing themselves.

250
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:42,640
So I want you guys to, you know, I think the entire historical commission wants to see the M-Belt succeed in their role as custodians for the building with the city of Medford.

251
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,301
So I want to make sure that we

252
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:48,945
you know, don't take up a huge amount of the time away from that belt.

253
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:49,925
Sure.

254
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:51,687
So good.

255
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,327
Yeah.

256
00:21:52,347 --> 00:22:00,333
The new president's been been a jolt of fresh air and some new ideas and some new energy, which is exactly what we were looking for.

257
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:04,236
Okay.

258
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:04,716
All right.

259
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:06,137
So you have 30 days.

260
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:13,362
If anybody is interested in, you know, vice chairing the board for 2025.

261
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:19,926
And I will send around the list of subcommittees that we have.

262
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:22,128
Those work very well.

263
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:28,012
So I just want to make sure that we establish them for next year, just so we can keep on

264
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:38,001
I as chair and whoever is in the vice chair position just keeps on rolling right on with being able to call upon those people and do the work as it comes in.

265
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:42,466
So very great.

266
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:44,808
Let's go.

267
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:46,930
Is there any other new business that I didn't bring up?

268
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:48,572
I do have old business.

269
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:53,705
All right, for old business, let's jump into properties currently under demo delay.

270
00:22:55,105 --> 00:23:02,109
Yale and said, we're asked to come here because there was a subcommittee meeting schedule, but there was an issue with zoom.

271
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:03,069
So, I think.

272
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:15,147
The subcommittee is just simply, I think that the best thing is going to be that the subcommittee wants to set up a meeting with them this coming week just to go over the design issues.

273
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:33,037
But the bottom line is that I think the entire commission reviewed the progress where it stands and didn't feel confident in where the design is at this point, that it wasn't successfully preserving enough of the building, but that the design details need to be worked out by the subcommittee still.

274
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:36,500
Let me just jump in here.

275
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,648
Ryan thought process was I talked to any and.

276
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:53,228
Peter, earlier tonight, we were trying to set up a subcommittee meeting for tomorrow night at seven o'clock, if that works for you, Yale, and your client, to try to move this along.

277
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:55,489
I apologize for not setting up last week.

278
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:57,910
I dropped the ball there, I apologize.

279
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:05,273
We're gonna try to have a quick meeting tomorrow night to see if we can come up with something that can close the loop and then bring it back to this group.

280
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:11,684
I mean, I'm okay with that.

281
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:12,865
Yael, are you available?

282
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:15,827
Yeah, 7 is a little tight.

283
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:19,610
I mean, I may be stuck in traffic coming back.

284
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,551
I mean, can we do 7.30 maybe?

285
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:23,673
I can do 7.30, absolutely.

286
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:28,136
Yeah, 7.30 is probably easier for me to commit to, yeah.

287
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:29,617
Alina, you're good.

288
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:30,017
I see.

289
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:30,898
Peter, are you good too?

290
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:31,859
Yeah.

291
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,240
Okay.

292
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:36,646
Uh, let me send out that meeting right now.

293
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,247
So I don't don't forget it again.

294
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:42,670
And I'll send it to both of you guys and we'll meet tomorrow night at 7.

295
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:42,670
30.

296
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:44,971
Thank you.

297
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:45,932
Thank you.

298
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:50,115
Be great.

299
00:24:50,915 --> 00:24:55,158
Um, the only other project that we have on the table right now is 27 street.

300
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,822
I want to get back to, uh, try to circle them back to us.

301
00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:01,263
So, Doug, why don't I.

302
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:15,933
why don't I email them and see if they're available tomorrow to come talk to you guys about while you're meeting to see if you're available to just talk to them about the existing design and where they stand on it.

303
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:19,094
And if they have no plans, get a direction to them.

304
00:25:19,674 --> 00:25:28,217
I think we were pretty clear we wanted to see the preservation of the forward mass of the house, but if they've done nothing yet to date, then let's try to get them on their way to now.

305
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:36,943
And if not, we can try to set up a meeting relatively soon between now and that next meeting to try to get something out of them.

306
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:39,125
Okay, does that make sense?

307
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:42,447
Can you just send me the link so I can send it to them as well?

308
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:43,208
Yes.

309
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:44,128
Okay.

310
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,210
I'll copy you on the link.

311
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,612
Have we seen any design from them at all?

312
00:25:49,147 --> 00:26:06,847
No they did like when we first started talking with them they did like a sketch that basically said they wanted to try to put three units on that site in an L shape and they only wanted to preserve the forward block but and not even the full forward block they only wanted to preserve like the forward third of the building so and that

313
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:19,780
It was too schematic for us to really understand what they were trying to do, so we asked them to come up with some more concrete plans that at least give us a footprint or a unit layout or something basic.

314
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,544
It doesn't have to be a crazy investment, but we wanted to see something a little bit more concrete.

315
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:28,453
you know, kind of shut up.

316
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:38,558
So we want to kind of, you know, open the door again and say, hey, we're meeting, you know, we've got nothing but you guys on this, on the table.

317
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:48,822
So we want to try to at least get you guys going so that you don't have to wait out the full 18 months because they're, they're under demo delay for an entire number of years.

318
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,743
So, you know, they've already waited eight months.

319
00:26:52,063 --> 00:26:56,105
And so we don't want to, we don't want to see them continue to waste time.

320
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:01,898
Okay, good.

321
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,185
All right, I'll work on that.

322
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,032
Uh, Form Bs for projects.

323
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:16,892
This is just normal.

324
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:19,353
These are just normal updates that are following this now.

325
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:29,917
I don't have any projects that I've seen that will require documentation by Form Bs, but you know, as you know, there's a standing order to just have John and

326
00:27:30,537 --> 00:27:33,679
Claire prepare them as needed by the commission.

327
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,180
We've only gone through like a third of our budget.

328
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:49,947
So if anybody sees properties that are up for sale, that look like they're being advertised to developers or they look like they might be heading in the direction of demolition by neglect, you know, feel free to send an email.

329
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:54,910
I'm happy to at least look at it and we can certainly order a preemptive form B for it.

330
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:57,852
We have the budget for it.

331
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:14,465
There are now three properties between the river and George Street on Main Street up for sale, one of which I've walked through clearly is not going to, you know, is being sold as a two-unit, two-bedroom, which has been completely renovated.

332
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:15,385
It's not going anywhere.

333
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:21,809
There's another one which has got signs on it saying, you know, being sold as if it were two condos.

334
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:31,615
It looks like, again, they're not going to do major exterior work on it to get it done that way, but at least I will send you the street number on that.

335
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:40,039
Third, I don't recall, made no impression on me whatsoever, so I can't tell you yet, but I will send you the street numbers.

336
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:51,605
I looked today, is one of the Manning Street, because it looked like a big Victorian that went up for sale that would easily pass for a two-family.

337
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,377
I'll be curious to see if that's one of them.

338
00:28:58,187 --> 00:28:58,408
Okay.

339
00:28:59,312 --> 00:28:59,713
Anybody else?

340
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:04,945
All right, hearing nobody, I'll move forward.

341
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:10,410
Jen's been working on keeping the permit system clear for us.

342
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,394
There's a few permits that we have to go through this week, but it's been going relatively smoothly.

343
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:23,340
I think the building department, they had a good meeting the last time Jen met with all the building, the commissioner and all the inspectors.

344
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,823
They have a good, they said there was a good vibe that came out of that meeting.

345
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,464
They enjoy the collaboration.

346
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:33,777
So I just want to keep up working with the building department and keep that going forward.

347
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:40,826
Okay, Cross Street Cemetery.

348
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:43,188
I have a couple of big project updates on this.

349
00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:49,553
So project update number one, the consultants are working on the assessment still.

350
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,034
They're wrapping up work.

351
00:29:51,175 --> 00:30:00,943
They're hoping to have the assessment to the cemetery trustees by the end of the year, which is good because that works with the grant that we got for their work.

352
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,005
So that all.

353
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:10,550
alliance well and that will pave the way for understanding how much that project's going to cost and who's going to end up doing the work.

354
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:21,938
There are a couple of people who were interested in bidding those projects when it comes out, including the current consultants, but there are other consultants that do that type of work as well.

355
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:23,999
There's no reason why we can't have more

356
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:31,681
more than one consultant working provided they all share the same qualifications and basic gravestone technique preservation techniques.

357
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:35,621
So I did have somebody look at the wall at Cross Street.

358
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:37,742
It's in relatively good condition.

359
00:30:37,862 --> 00:30:46,884
It's surrounded by a sort of field stone in concrete wall that's kind of like rustic and it's in really good condition.

360
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:52,625
It's just covered with moss so they just recommended that it be pressure washed and then

361
00:30:52,905 --> 00:31:00,731
the hair, few, very few hairline cracks that it has will get patched and it will be as good as it was in 1958 when it was completed.

362
00:31:03,132 --> 00:31:17,943
On the other end of the site, the former Cross Street Cemetery site, we hired an archaeologist, it's PAL, and we're in the process of hiring an excavator and if all the stars align,

363
00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:26,550
and we get the green light from Mass Historical, we may be in the ground this year doing investigations at that site.

364
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:37,240
If not, and the winter sets in sooner than later, then we will have to wait until the ground unfreezes, and that will be sometime April, May, unfortunately.

365
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:44,606
So I'm really trying hard to get the city to move and to get everybody to move, but we're at the will of MHC now because it's

366
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:48,379
a project that most certainly will require a permit.

367
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,966
So that's in process.

368
00:31:55,587 --> 00:31:57,427
CPA, we had a good meeting.

369
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:08,472
I posted the meeting recording that MCM is currently hosting up on our website and with the meeting slides.

370
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:15,294
And we occasionally, still after about two weeks, are still getting trickle-in feedback from the community.

371
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:16,775
I think

372
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:46,611
a lot of the residents are concerned what happens there but um you know once we dispelled the fact that we were not putting in community gardens nor trying to um build the bridge over the railroad tracks that everybody was on board with the tree work and uh other various work that has to has to take place in order to make the park safe um so that's um that's up online if you haven't had a chance to see the recording and see the meeting and Peter's presentation uh feel free to go watch it it is um

373
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:54,851
It is there, it's about an hour long in total, including public feedback, so should be, it's a good watch.

374
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:03,673
And then the last thing that's up on the table is that we have a project out to bid.

375
00:33:03,753 --> 00:33:07,055
It's the Sagamore Vale Community Survey.

376
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:13,739
So we have a little neighborhood north of Medford Square by City Hall.

377
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:19,682
That's a little development called Sagamore Vale that was laid out in the middle of the 19th century.

378
00:33:20,822 --> 00:33:21,563
We have some

379
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:25,147
of our regular budget that we normally apply to SMP projects.

380
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:26,628
We went out to bid.

381
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:39,202
We got two proposals in the process of reviewing them and should, once the reference checks come back, we should be able to award the project, but I just have to check it.

382
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:52,013
Check the procedure with Fiona procurement and once that's good, then we'll get that get a consultant underway and we can start survey work on that in December, January.

383
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,194
Okay.

384
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:54,875
And then I put in.

385
00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:02,053
for an MHC survey and planning grant for 2025.

386
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:12,420
So within a relatively short amount of time, I would expect sometime in the next week or two, we should get notice whether or not we're going to get invited back to the long app.

387
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:19,285
Even though it's a survey and planning grant, this particular year's project was more focused on

388
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:26,933
both like preservation plans and long-term plans, but because we're a CPC, we're usually guaranteed 10% of the state funding.

389
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:30,697
So it's possible we'll get, we'll definitely get invited back.

390
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,778
We're usually invited back.

391
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:38,927
And even if then the funding pool becomes very competitive, then, you know, they may just simply diminish the amount of money coming our way.

392
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:50,470
So, but I'm hopeful for a 50-50 match from MHC, which will take our normal $15,000 and turn it into a nice $30,000 project.

393
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,734
So, that's it for old business.

394
00:34:54,774 --> 00:34:55,714
Did I miss anything?

395
00:34:58,377 --> 00:34:59,898
Anything happening at the Perks Estate?

396
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:04,050
There's always stuff happening at the Brooks Estate.

397
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:07,212
I did check the CPC site.

398
00:35:07,632 --> 00:35:12,034
I'm listed as my term expires on April of next year.

399
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:16,177
If somebody really wants it, this is the chance to jump in.

400
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:20,159
Otherwise, I'll continue if that's the will of the board.

401
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:27,963
We are having some struggles with the city of Brooks Estate in terms of

402
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:40,254
alignments on things like maintenance and utilities and other things that are in a gray zone right now.

403
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:46,039
We're in a transition between caretakers and we're working on that.

404
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:55,927
Also some repairs and we're trying to figure out what the next step is for the manor building, about what we're going to do.

405
00:35:56,932 --> 00:36:01,234
We've completed the access drive, but, you know, it's a multimillion dollar.

406
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:08,096
Project we're trying to figure out if we can do some kind of phasing to get a temporary parking lot.

407
00:36:08,657 --> 00:36:15,579
At the state, you know, the manner without doing the whole 3 plus million dollar rebuild from the Grove street to.

408
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,261
Parking lot, which is a half more than a half mile in distance.

409
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:19,721
So it's a.

410
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:25,475
We're getting on our feet with the new president.

411
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:26,556
She's doing a great job.

412
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,097
She's got some great ideas.

413
00:36:29,177 --> 00:36:38,163
And we also got a small grant for an admin to assist the president that we got from the city, which was really helpful.

414
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:38,984
I think it was about $5,000.

415
00:36:39,504 --> 00:36:42,746
So that'll help.

416
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:49,090
Just anything we can get to assist and take membership and other things off the president's

417
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:51,752
played is a good one.

418
00:36:52,232 --> 00:36:55,753
So that's the Brooksville State update.

419
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:57,334
Great.

420
00:36:57,374 --> 00:37:15,439
Well, it's, you know, anything that we can do to support EMBO, you know, we have a permanent position on the board that Jen currently sits at, I believe, so, or you could sit in it if you really wanted to, but I, you know, whoever sits, we just need to make sure that there's some representative

421
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:32,127
And, you know, to make sure that we continue to support that I think the people who originally put forth the preservation efforts to save it from becoming more cemetery space, you know, would really get justice so to speak and seeing it.

422
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:37,388
sort of opened up as a venue, and I would like to see that in my lifetime.

423
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:42,589
I did send to Carly and Jen, and I forgot to CC you on it, but you may like this.

424
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:50,811
I sent around, and I'll make sure I send it to you, Hingham Historical Society built for their caretaker.

425
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:52,812
They have a caretaker in the historic museum.

426
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:57,573
They built a net zero house immediately adjacent to their historic building.

427
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:00,174
in the same general vibe.

428
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:20,580
So I thought that might be a neat idea if in the future you guys decided you needed a caretaker but don't necessarily want them in the house or you could build an environmentally friendly house faster and cheaper than in the estate building that you might be able to cleverly disguise it as the little cottage that was across the way with

429
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:25,564
where partially where the parking lot's going, but you know.

430
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,187
No, it's actually not in the footprint of the parking lot.

431
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:35,353
It does not expect the caretaker's ruins from, not caretaker, the Hamlet building from the 1900, I think.

432
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:41,219
But I don't think the preservation restriction allows additional structures of that new structure.

433
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:44,502
I don't think that's actually allowed, if I remember the legislation correctly.

434
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:45,657
Interesting.

435
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:51,780
All right, well, I mean, there's enough building that you certainly don't need to add anything.

436
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:58,244
We have more than enough building at 10,000 square feet, which is what the manor is, if you add it all up.

437
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,227
But I like the creativity, and we're trying to think outside the box.

438
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:23,382
If anyone does have a landscape architect or someone who is a preservation architect or has those skills or is willing to learn, we do need to start bringing the next generation of those two skill sets into the MBEL board.

439
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,403
Peter Edlund.

440
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:29,749
He just did the other Brooks Park, right?

441
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:33,689
And he lives over in Arlington, so he's not too far distant.

442
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:39,230
So you might ask him if he might consider serving on a board in the city.

443
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:46,032
There's nothing that would, because you guys are a separate organization, there's nothing that would prevent him from working with us later.

444
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:49,632
But he's also really, he's really no-nonsense, he's very smart.

445
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:52,853
He's very sharp, I like his designs.

446
00:39:54,238 --> 00:39:55,499
So, thank you.

447
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,601
Yeah, I think he'd be a, I think he'd be a good one.

448
00:39:57,621 --> 00:40:01,785
But, you know, there's maybe other landscape architects in Medford.

449
00:40:01,825 --> 00:40:08,892
So, if you have Carly post something on your blog, we can certainly blast it around to various sites on our website or social media.

450
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:10,894
So, okay.

451
00:40:10,914 --> 00:40:11,335
Thank you.

452
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:13,537
Good.

453
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:15,679
Great.

454
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:17,400
I think that's it other than meeting minutes.

455
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,622
Did anybody else have old business?

456
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:22,797
All right, hearing none, Peter sent around meeting minutes.

457
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,857
Can I get a motion to preserve?

458
00:40:24,198 --> 00:40:24,858
Yeah, to preserve.

459
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:27,019
A motion to approve.

460
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,120
All moved.

461
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,700
Got a second?

462
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:37,062
None?

463
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:40,164
Okay.

464
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:44,185
Sorry, Andrew.

465
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:46,186
Seconds, no, Doug got it this time.

466
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:48,427
All right, go around the room, Eleni.

467
00:40:50,105 --> 00:40:50,385
Yes.

468
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:51,186
Ed.

469
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:53,468
Aye.

470
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:54,890
Kit.

471
00:40:55,611 --> 00:40:55,871
Yes.

472
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:56,772
Doug.

473
00:40:57,553 --> 00:40:57,813
Yes.

474
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:58,614
Peter.

475
00:40:59,214 --> 00:40:59,454
Yes.

476
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:01,536
All right, 5-0 approved.

477
00:41:03,238 --> 00:41:04,600
All right, motion to adjourn.

478
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:09,905
So moved.

479
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:11,486
Second.

480
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:15,645
Thank you, Lenny.

481
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:16,506
Yes.

482
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:17,287
Ed.

483
00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:18,829
Yes.

484
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:19,670
Kit.

485
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:20,331
Yes.

486
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:21,172
Doug.

487
00:41:21,593 --> 00:41:21,873
Yes.

488
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:22,674
Peter.

489
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:23,595
Yes.

490
00:41:24,136 --> 00:41:24,476
All right.

491
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:24,977
Five zero.

492
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:25,477
We passed.

493
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:26,058
All right.

494
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:26,719
Thank you all.

495
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,465
So next meeting is December.

496
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:35,804
December 9th, so it would be relatively quick.

497
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:37,385
So we will see you all then.

498
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:40,406
Doug, I'll look forward to that.

499
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:43,987
And I'll let you know if 27-0-BOT's going to join you tomorrow.

500
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:46,468
Okay, you got the meeting invite?

501
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:49,410
I'll take a look at it in a minute, but I'm sure I did.

502
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,611
Yeah, we need to be there, right?

503
00:41:53,231 --> 00:41:54,832
Yeah, I got it.

504
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:55,632
Great.

505
00:41:56,032 --> 00:41:56,533
I got it.

506
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:57,213
Thank you all.

507
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:58,053
Thanks, everyone.

508
00:41:58,073 --> 00:41:58,614
Have a good night.

509
00:41:58,894 --> 00:41:59,374
Bye, everyone.
