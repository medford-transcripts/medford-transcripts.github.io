00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:34,388
Hello everyone, and welcome to Medford Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:38,349
I'm John Petrella, host of the show.

3
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:47,131
The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed decisions.

4
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:55,032
Today, we have a special guest, Ron Jovino, a member of the City Charter Committee.

5
00:00:56,216 --> 00:01:02,261
Ron will be speaking on things you need to know about the revised city charter.

6
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,162
Welcome, Ron.

7
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:05,523
Thanks for coming on the show.

8
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,063
Thanks, John.

9
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:07,044
I appreciate having me.

10
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:23,557
Before I get into questions for Ron, I just want to make a note that Zach Beers and Justin Singh were also invited to join us on the show today, but unfortunately they were unavailable due to work obligations.

11
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:24,838
So,

12
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:31,794
Let's get going with the show, an all-important show for the citizens of Medford.

13
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:42,437
Ron, my first question is why did you want to become a member of this committee and what exactly was the process?

14
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:44,498
Sure, John.

15
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:51,840
You know, simply put, it's maybe a silly answer, but it's because I care about the city of Medford.

16
00:01:53,988 --> 00:02:05,056
The mayor sent out a request for people may be interested in helping the process of reviewing the existing charter and I just submitted my name.

17
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:09,786
And that was the whole process.

18
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:13,268
Okay, so now I guess you got appointed.

19
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,349
How did that happen?

20
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:15,709
What was that all about?

21
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,851
So we got a letter letting us know we were appointed.

22
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:27,756
We were given a charge from the mayor, official charge from the mayor of what our role would be.

23
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,738
And this was in October of 2022.

24
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,279
So it's been a long road.

25
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:34,860
Wow.

26
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,721
It certainly has been.

27
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:43,911
Okay, so the next question is what was the committee charged to do?

28
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:45,232
What was it all about?

29
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:50,455
We all know how important a charter is, so I mean what

30
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,105
What were you charged to do exactly?

31
00:02:53,205 --> 00:03:19,540
So the official charge from the mayor's office was for us to thoroughly review the current charter, to identify potential ways to amend the charter in order to modernize Medford's governance, ensure it's representative, effective, transparent, responsive, and accountable, to ensure that the city is responsive to current and future challenges.

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,985
Our charge was to gather residents, current, past elected officials, city staff, and other stakeholders.

33
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:34,730
We were also asked to educate and engage the community in robust discussions through meetings, surveys, and more.

34
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:43,096
We were also charged with working with the Collins Center and then making recommendations to the mayor and to the city council.

35
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:43,837
Okay.

36
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:46,459
Thank you for that answer.

37
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,720
Now, I guess,

38
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:54,459
which is probably the most important thing and, you know, for our audience, what is a charter?

39
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,720
What exactly is it?

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,440
Exactly what does a charter do?

41
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,441
Yeah, it's a good question.

42
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:05,422
Again, in simplest terms, the charter is equivalent to the city's constitution.

43
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:10,104
It's the guideline, the blueprint for how we run our government.

44
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:13,837
There are two ways that this could have been done.

45
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:25,128
The first way was a home rule petition, which required a lot of signatures, legislative approval, and actually creating a full elected body.

46
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:30,354
This has been tried over the last ten years, two or three times, and it never succeeded.

47
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:32,997
So the only path left was to form a

48
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:46,617
an advisory committee through a special act that gave us the ability to make recommendations that went to the mayor and from the mayor to the city council and then to the statehouse.

49
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:48,538
Okay.

50
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:50,659
Thank you for that answer.

51
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:56,461
So, obviously, there had to be, you know, over a two-year period

52
00:04:57,553 --> 00:04:58,474
That's a long time.

53
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:00,256
It's a lot of work.

54
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:12,106
You know, can you let us know, like, what type of activities, what exactly, or how did you go about when you guys got together, guys and girls got together?

55
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,909
What was the activities?

56
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:15,950
How did you reach out?

57
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,231
Yeah.

58
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:21,375
You know, the committee, when we started meeting in November of 2022,

59
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,133
11 members, I think I was familiar with maybe two of them.

60
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:33,417
So it was quite a widespread of the city, which was great, different views.

61
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:36,259
But we came together on this.

62
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:43,845
Over the two-year period of time, we had more than 50 public meetings, recorded, open to the public.

63
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,843
We distributed a survey, which has lately been getting a lot of publicity.

64
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:58,749
It was distributed in many different languages through the help of Francis Nowajay, and we gathered all those results.

65
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:10,637
Much has been said about the results, but honestly, in a city where 6,000 or 7,000 voters make up who gets elected in the city,

66
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:19,451
600-700 votes is 10% of that amount, so it was significant, but certainly not the only thing we used to make our decisions.

67
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:23,034
We did dozens of listening sessions around the city.

68
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:26,117
We had three public meetings at City Hall.

69
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:33,142
We conducted more than two dozen interviews with current and former elected officials and other city department heads.

70
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,825
We had conversations with officials from other cities.

71
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:39,327
We had a conversation with the Mass.

72
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:40,889
Secretary of State.

73
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:49,204
We organized community events around the city, from the farmer's market, popsicles at Wright's Pond, Circle in the Square.

74
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:58,466
We worked with groups like the Chamber of Commerce, Metro Family Network, and the Mass Housing Network to reach residents.

75
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:02,867
We created a charter review Jeopardy game to connect some of our younger voters.

76
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:12,193
It was a long, involved, very detailed process, and everybody on the committee really worked hard, because we all believed in the process.

77
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:14,775
Okay.

78
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:22,561
Now, I just got to put this in there, 6,000 voters, it's a pretty, I mean, that bothers me.

79
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:22,961
Yeah.

80
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:27,184
In this city, that we only have 6,000 people show up to vote.

81
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:27,925
On average.

82
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:28,305
Yeah.

83
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,866
That's what it takes to get elected.

84
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:30,747
And that's pretty bad.

85
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:32,088
That's sad when you think about

86
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:36,551
All the people that should be involved that aren't.

87
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,574
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

88
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:47,659
So you did all this work, and I followed some of it because I became interested.

89
00:07:49,692 --> 00:08:02,719
If people really look at this and understand what it's all about, I think they'd understand how important your task really was, like what you people did and how important it was.

90
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,081
And actually, you guys did a great job, all of you.

91
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:11,444
So it wasn't an easy thing, that's all.

92
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:12,684
It was very difficult.

93
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,905
It wasn't, it was a lot of man hours.

94
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,080
It wasn't easy.

95
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,742
I don't think anybody on the committee could ever say that they got their way every time.

96
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:22,122
There was debates.

97
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:23,883
There was information gathering.

98
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:30,786
There was presentations under the leadership of Milva McDonald, who did an incredible job leading us.

99
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,248
The process was to prioritize some of the issues.

100
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:56,135
build subcommittees, which there were several different subcommittees, finance, ward representation, school committee, and all those subcommittees were working in conjunction with the main committee and would bring presentations to the main group and we'd work on the final resolution.

101
00:08:57,681 --> 00:09:00,122
So congratulations are in order for everyone.

102
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:06,605
I think we posted a graphic of the members, but congratulations to all of them because they all did a great job.

103
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:08,705
Okay.

104
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:14,528
So now you collected all this data over a two-year period.

105
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:18,409
And now you have it all.

106
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,150
Now what do you do with it?

107
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:28,789
So, once the subcommittees had finalized their vote, we put those votes on pause, knowing that we could always come back to them.

108
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,615
And then, with the help of the Collins Center, we started to build our version of the charter.

109
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:46,704
Painstakingly, word for word, listening to suggestions, voting on suggestions, all of that process took a very long time.

110
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:54,539
Then it had to be all put together in a professional package because the charter is voted on as one unit.

111
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,900
Then it was delivered to the mayor.

112
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:05,282
For her, she had the first swing at it to approve it and move it to the city council.

113
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:13,545
So it was delivered in a small ceremony in her office, but it gave her a chance to review what we had done.

114
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:16,906
And by the way, I must say too, over the two and a half years,

115
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,971
Everything was public.

116
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:27,156
There should be nobody who had an interest in this who was surprised by anything we presented because it was already predetermined.

117
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:28,517
True, true.

118
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:29,357
Yeah.

119
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:30,618
You mentioned the Collins Center.

120
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:30,958
Yeah.

121
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,279
They advised you?

122
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,141
I mean, did they play a role in this then?

123
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:38,743
Yeah, the Collins Center has years and years of experience.

124
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:40,804
You know, they are the go-to.

125
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,405
They're the ones, that's their business.

126
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:44,667
They write charters all through the state.

127
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:55,541
extremely helpful in guiding us not only in what the law says but on the best way to get this to the statehouse and get it on the ballot in November.

128
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:59,327
So we use their advice all the time and they were

129
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:06,912
When they were with us, they gave us, you know, an instant correction or guidance, yes or no.

130
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:11,155
Of course, the call-in center was not the eyes and ears that we were.

131
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:12,536
We met the people.

132
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:15,898
They were just looking at our raw data and making sure it was refined.

133
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,899
So, very, very important.

134
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,000
We couldn't do it without them.

135
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,262
But they did not impact opinion.

136
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:25,444
They were there to produce a legal document.

137
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,825
Okay, great answer.

138
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:34,109
I just want to, I think people need to know, you know, what the Collins Center, what their role was in the whole process.

139
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:34,309
Sure.

140
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,773
All right, so as you mentioned, it's all a nice neat package now, all that work.

141
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,233
Yeah.

142
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:42,654
Give it to the mayor.

143
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:43,474
Yeah.

144
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:44,535
What does the mayor do?

145
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,061
What's next?

146
00:11:46,361 --> 00:12:04,927
The Mayor, with her staff, and I believe with some guidance from the Collins Center as well, I'm sure she had questions, was her responsibility to make any adjustments and present that, her amended version of our version, to the City Council.

147
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,428
And there were some changes made.

148
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:18,318
I would say, if I had to guess, 90% of what the Charter Committee wrote was passed on to the City Council by the Mayor.

149
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:26,346
She trusted the group enough that she believed that we were representing the people and moved it on to the City Council.

150
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:30,627
Okay, so she moves it on to the council.

151
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:43,420
So you put this whole document together, and let's be honest, there's a little bit of this, a little bit of that, a little blah blah blah, but then comes the key issues, I mean the really important stuff.

152
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:54,265
You have examples of some of the key issues that you guys brought out, brought forward.

153
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:58,549
Well, first I want to say that there was no issue that we did not take seriously.

154
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:06,597
The preamble was a very important piece to our presentation, but certainly, clearly, the key issues for our committee was

155
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,418
what the form of government would be.

156
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,300
Would it be a strong mayor or a weak mayor?

157
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,200
Would we have a city manager back, the old government?

158
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,421
That was the number one issue by far.

159
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:26,063
Number two issue was the composition of the city council and the school committee and thus the issue of the ward representation.

160
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:32,265
By far the most discussed and debated issue, the subcommittee was the busiest

161
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:39,182
most controversial as it turns out, but that was definitely right up there as a popular one.

162
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:43,464
The third issue for me was making the mayor

163
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:48,690
stepped down from the school committee chairman role.

164
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:57,558
And that was done, I was also served on the school committee subcommittee, and that was done under the leadership of that subcommittee by Paul Advandiclu.

165
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:03,404
I don't know if you can choose a better person to represent what goes on in the school system.

166
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:08,849
But it met with a lot of resistance, and, you know, but we chose to

167
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:13,914
to keep her as the chairperson.

168
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:23,659
And that was one of the issues that the school committee, the city council came back to say that they didn't want her, they wanted her to step down as the chairperson.

169
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:39,908
And then there were other issues of, a lot of issues around requirements, signature requirements on certain initiative petitions, things like that, you know, ethics laws, things that,

170
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:45,529
You know, we were always guided, whatever your charter is, you're always guided by the Massachusetts General Laws.

171
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,310
So that's what the Collins Center always brought to us.

172
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,892
But those are the top issues that we dealt with.

173
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:58,494
But there certainly were a lot of other issues of how to get a budget done, how to do many different things.

174
00:14:58,554 --> 00:15:00,915
But those, I would say, are the four top ones.

175
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:02,636
OK.

176
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:05,817
That makes sense.

177
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:06,177
Yeah.

178
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,674
some pretty big issues there too.

179
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:22,624
So let me ask you this, you know, the committee, how did you come to a conclusion?

180
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,247
How do you, you know, you got a major issue.

181
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:26,888
You just gave us a few.

182
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:28,530
I mean, those are major.

183
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,733
How did you get to where you, how do you get

184
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:35,636
to a conclusion on those major issues.

185
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:36,376
Where do you go?

186
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:43,319
I would say we were always guided by Milva to get the personalities out of the process.

187
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,381
We dealt with a mayor, a city council, a school committee, not

188
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:59,742
Brianna Lungo Kern, Zach Beers, that was, we took personalities out of this because we were building a document, a living document that would be a changeable and go into the future.

189
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,606
That was the one thing that always guided me.

190
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:16,182
It was difficult because sometimes you went in with preconceived notions and you'd listen to the people, particularly the school committee subcommittee was very well received by the citizens and they gave a lot of input.

191
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:24,326
And that's why we didn't, we recommended ward representation for the city council, but not for the school committee based on the input we got.

192
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,547
We met with Roy Belson.

193
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:40,809
former superintendent, we met with the current superintendent, we met with school committee members, we met with a lot of people who gave us varying opinions of whether they thought there needed to be changes.

194
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:49,747
The commitment that everybody had, Milva insisted we have, it's the process that we must respect.

195
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,428
It's the process that we must follow.

196
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:56,550
And whether you win or lose an argument, you support the process.

197
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,431
So if we lose a vote by, you know, six to five, then you lost the vote.

198
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:02,872
But I support the process.

199
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:07,453
So that was a lesson we all had to learn and grow up and figure that out.

200
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:09,294
But we got there.

201
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:12,555
We got there enough that we're all pretty proud of the document we sent.

202
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:13,899
Okay.

203
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,842
So it sounds to me like, you know, the political stuff is out, which I think is great.

204
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:20,102
Yeah.

205
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:21,983
I mean, that is, that's important.

206
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:27,986
And I think you guys went above and beyond to make sure that, you know, that was kept out.

207
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:36,170
I, myself, my opinion was that was, that was well done to keep all that stuff out of there.

208
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:36,570
Yeah.

209
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,192
So I was kind of,

210
00:17:43,210 --> 00:18:03,856
you know, looking at this and, you know, I watched the city council meetings and, you know, I heard you speak and I heard, you know, back and forth and basically, and this is my opinion, correct me if I'm wrong, if you don't agree with my opinion, but this document was basically

211
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:07,564
from the citizens of Medford.

212
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,086
That's what this document was about.

213
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:14,248
When you boil it all down, it came from us, from the people.

214
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:22,174
Well, I'm very proud of the work that the committee did, because it is a work from the people.

215
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:28,041
And we didn't, I mean, we all bring our prejudices to these arguments.

216
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:31,785
We all bring, of course, we all brought a piece of an open mind as well.

217
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:37,691
And so I am very confident from, you know, passing out popsicles at Wrights Pond to

218
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:41,659
It was a two-way conversation, a real conversation with people.

219
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:44,982
You know, ward representation, what is ward representation?

220
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:45,962
These are your options.

221
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:48,665
And people would come back and give us those opinions.

222
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:59,534
So, I think, you know, as again, our chairperson, Milva, did an incredible job mixing so many different personalities from so many political

223
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:04,719
of views that we all should be very proud of this document and how it represents.

224
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:14,128
What happened after that was out of our control, but I know the document we presented met all the charges from the mayor.

225
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:29,734
Tuesday night, this past Tuesday night, council meeting, the charter, which I think was the most important thing on the agenda.

226
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:31,316
Apparently not.

227
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:33,537
Well, you know, what are you going to do?

228
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:36,600
It sort of got pushed to the back of the night.

229
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,921
you know, later on in the evening.

230
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:41,823
For whatever reason, that's fine.

231
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:43,344
Nothing you can do.

232
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:47,107
My opinion was that should have been one of the first things.

233
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:50,169
That deserved a long discussion, whatever.

234
00:19:50,690 --> 00:20:04,261
Okay, so, you know, without getting into too much, I was kind of surprised what I saw, what was done on Tuesday night, okay?

235
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:06,963
So, I guess my question is,

236
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,081
You know, I'm a little confused.

237
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:17,286
So Tuesday night, can you explain Tuesday night what happened, maybe why it happened?

238
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:24,951
And I guess my biggest question is, I'm under the impression that this is now going back to the mayor, but with changes.

239
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,133
Yeah, well, first I want to say that

240
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:34,750
The charter study committee has disbanded.

241
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,073
So my views are not representative of anybody on that charter committee.

242
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:47,119
I go to those meetings, the governance meetings, the public meetings because I care that we're doing what's right.

243
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:52,723
And Tuesday night was a shocker to me because I didn't understand what was going on.

244
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:57,166
I figured that it was going to be a time where they would,

245
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:02,055
except with the mayor's changes, the mayor agreed.

246
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:12,365
They went back to the mayor and said we want some other form of composition for the city council, a four or five, using districts as opposed to wards.

247
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:17,049
Totally disagree with it, but that's what they wanted.

248
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,751
They sent that back to the mayor along with

249
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,214
having her step down as a chairperson.

250
00:21:22,554 --> 00:21:25,075
There were other issues, but those are the two primaries.

251
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:27,777
There's a lot of balance of power, I admit.

252
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:31,219
There's a lot of balance of power issues that are in there as well, I get that too.

253
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,900
But those are the two main issues.

254
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:40,145
What we discover is that the mayor immediately responds and says, we're going with ward representation.

255
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,983
That's what the people want, and that's the right thing.

256
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:50,344
And she agrees, as part of the negotiations, to step down as chairperson of the school committee.

257
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:58,246
Now, if anybody knows anything about negotiations, it is a give and take, and that's a pretty major give when you do that.

258
00:21:58,606 --> 00:21:59,126
Absolutely.

259
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:00,927
So that came back for Tuesday night.

260
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:07,796
So, in my mind, knowing the timeframe, we have to get this to the statehouse by mid-April.

261
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:11,278
So, I knew the timeline would be that, you know, they have to do something.

262
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:19,023
Either they're going to vote against it and forget about it and scrap it, or they're going to accept the mayor's version, which I was hopeful for.

263
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:23,485
But, you know, we know that you don't always get what you ask for.

264
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:41,393
What was the most disturbing part to me was they were claiming that it was such a rush, and all these things just came out, and the mayor's changes were done on a press release and not formally, and we don't have time to look at it, and all these things.

265
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:50,435
And then, out of nowhere, no, I mean, Councilor Callahan had introduced a ranked vote based

266
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:56,349
theory of the best way to elect folks.

267
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,911
But we had that going in.

268
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:06,675
But out of nowhere, Councilor Collins announced that, you know, she wanted to amend to remove the mayor from the school committee.

269
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:09,257
Never been discussed, never brought up.

270
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,899
In the two and a half years, I never, ever heard of it.

271
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:14,119
And there it was.

272
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,004
And they went over to Councilor Lemming, and he suggested the same thing, and here we go.

273
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:27,731
All of a sudden now, we've got this, you negotiate, and now you bring in something that's never been heard of before.

274
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:31,955
And that was kind of what really got me to go back to the microphone, because I was kind of tired of it.

275
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:55,246
So I don't want to impart my position on this, but you have to wonder, if everybody is on board with making this go, then why are you bringing in something from out in left field into the discussion that you know, as I said to

276
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:59,071
council president bears that night.

277
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:07,062
If you're sitting at a table and there are two people, one's the president of one company and you're the president of the other company, you both have to agree.

278
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:11,389
If I come to you and say, the only condition I'm going to accept is you're out as president,

279
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:12,710
He's not going to agree to that.

280
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:17,657
And logically speaking, you have to say to the mayor, how is the mayor who's fiscally responsible?

281
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:22,204
I know school committee is not a department under her, but she is the budget person.

282
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:25,188
She's the CEO of the city, eventually rolls up to her.

283
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:28,532
Do you really want a mayor to not have to be able to attend these meetings?

284
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,376
It was just, I didn't understand it.

285
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,478
There was no debate about it.

286
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:35,822
It was just the amendment appeared, and here we are, ready to vote on it.

287
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:40,068
And then everybody starts agreeing to it, and I'm just like, I don't get it.

288
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:45,796
It just seems to me to be a tactic that is unacceptable.

289
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:56,636
And, you know, I use the example of Councilor Zaro, who had some amendments, not major, but a couple of amendments that she wanted to add.

290
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:02,700
She picked up the phone and called the mayor's office to make sure the mayor was okay with these changes.

291
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:08,664
So, she presented two sound amendments and also confirmed that the mayor was okay with this.

292
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:10,306
So, of course you're going to say okay.

293
00:25:10,326 --> 00:25:11,887
If everybody's okay, everybody's okay.

294
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:19,874
This other stuff is just, you know, for lack of a better word, I don't know what it is.

295
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:21,195
I don't know where it came from.

296
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,216
So, it's confusing.

297
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:32,007
Now, next Tuesday is an emergency meeting of the city council to pass the charter, which everybody says we should have.

298
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:32,888
We should.

299
00:25:34,555 --> 00:25:39,039
So Tuesday night, everybody should go and let them know we want the charter.

300
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,241
We haven't had a charter in over 30 years.

301
00:25:41,822 --> 00:25:44,825
How can we possibly move forward as a city?

302
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:53,773
And the arguments made, there's a lot of arguing about the composition of the Charter Review Committee because the mayor selected us.

303
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:57,917
For some reason, it's all weighted towards the mayor, totally false.

304
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:01,910
Charter committee just brought data to them.

305
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,031
We didn't have any say.

306
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:03,591
We have no problem.

307
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:04,071
We still don't.

308
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:05,632
Well, we will eventually.

309
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:08,072
But it was presented to them to do it.

310
00:26:08,153 --> 00:26:13,315
So don't, you know, there was no political reasons why we did something.

311
00:26:13,335 --> 00:26:15,555
Certainly I had zero conversations with the mayor.

312
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:20,097
I'm guessing Milva McDonald might have updated the mayor on several occasions.

313
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:21,598
There was no phone calls from the mayor.

314
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:27,482
There was certainly no phone calls in two and a half years from any of the city councilors except Councilor Scarpelli.

315
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:28,483
I can verify.

316
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:30,825
For me personally, nobody picked up the phone.

317
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:32,466
Nobody appeared at a meeting.

318
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,289
Nobody called during the public participation time.

319
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:42,775
And I can tell you that when you're talking to people, and they speak for 20 minutes, and I'm limited to three minutes, it's a very, very frustrating process.

320
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,318
One of their focal points, if I can just continue, is

321
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,461
the survey.

322
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:51,843
And the survey was a very, very important piece of our data.

323
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:55,346
But it was one piece, one small piece.

324
00:26:55,887 --> 00:27:00,931
And when there's a survey, you can take any number out of there and make it any way you want to do it.

325
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:02,012
And I'll give you an example.

326
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:12,929
When Councilor Lemming was talking about the survey, he talked about how many people wanted the mayor to not be on the school committee.

327
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:21,233
And he quoted numbers that 56 percent of all the people said no, 43 percent said yeah, 36 percent said yes.

328
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:25,935
But there's an undefined, undecided amount that they didn't want to address.

329
00:27:26,676 --> 00:27:30,398
Now, that was the basis for why we wanted to get rid of the mayor.

330
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:41,255
That was ranked in that survey, it was ranked the number ninth issue of most importance to the people who filled out the survey.

331
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,856
You know what the number two issue was?

332
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:45,058
Ward representation at the city council.

333
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:51,143
Do you know how many people voted that they wanted ward representation?

334
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:52,864
60%, 60, not 60%.

335
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:55,406
But that was okay that they didn't go with that.

336
00:27:55,886 --> 00:28:00,991
So there's so many inconsistencies, that's the one I really, I find the most amazing.

337
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:02,726
I think, you know...

338
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:14,246
At earlier meetings, I brought up the conversations that each council had with our teams, telling us how important it was that ward representation be a priority.

339
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,947
Many of the councilors told us they loved the idea and they want to support that idea.

340
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:24,609
The Our Revolution website promises voters that that's what they're going to do.

341
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:29,511
Many councilors wrote blogs that committed them to ward representation.

342
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,851
For some reason, all that's gone.

343
00:28:31,451 --> 00:28:32,512
So I'm hoping that

344
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,694
I don't mean to talk a lot about it, but I spent two and a half years, so it's kind of important to me.

345
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:45,478
I hope that the voters call their city councilor, go to the meeting Tuesday night, get on Facebook.

346
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:53,461
I know everybody loves Reddit and Facebook and all those, you know, fun places to give your opinion, and start talking about this a little bit more.

347
00:28:53,481 --> 00:29:00,605
I will say this, and Councilor Lemming gave us our best compliment by saying the Charter Committee has become very popular.

348
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:08,068
You're not sure why they do, but we accomplished our number one goal, get the city talking about the charter.

349
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:14,532
And I think that that gets the city government really hyped about the future.

350
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:18,556
And issues like ward representation shouldn't be looked at as

351
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:21,446
an unfair process.

352
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:29,268
It should be looked at an opportunity for two wards in particular to be energized and to start feeling like they're part of the process again.

353
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,210
And who knows, in ten years it may have worked, it may have not.

354
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,311
But, you know, we're not locked into this charter.

355
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,691
We're creating a charter that's going to be a living document.

356
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:41,273
If in two years they want to change it, we go through the same process and change it.

357
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:46,557
Everybody's, you know, we've lived so long under these charter guidelines.

358
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:47,678
It's time for a change.

359
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:55,925
And I hope, I really hope that Tuesday night people will appreciate the effort and really come out and let people know.

360
00:30:00,802 --> 00:30:17,014
Here's something that you always hear, we represent the people, the council, we listen to the people, we represent the people, we want to do what's right for the people.

361
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:25,260
In my opinion, it's not often that people get a chance to speak and be heard.

362
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:32,824
I look at what your committee did.

363
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:35,964
Mel, you know, everybody, all of us together.

364
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:37,044
I shouldn't say your committee.

365
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:40,945
I'm saying it because you're here, but, you know, it was everybody.

366
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:41,485
It was.

367
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:46,146
And you really went out and it was the voice of the people.

368
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,046
That's my opinion.

369
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:55,327
So we speak and, you know, I watched the council meeting Tuesday assuming that, oh, this is it.

370
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,108
You know, great.

371
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,728
You know, there's things, by the way,

372
00:30:58,683 --> 00:31:06,246
that are in there that I don't necessarily agree with, but it's what the people wanted.

373
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:09,908
And it's a good chunk of the people that vote and everything else.

374
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:17,571
So I guess, you know, it's a shame what's happening right now.

375
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:21,733
But the other, you know, this will probably be the last question.

376
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,694
And I want to thank you really for coming on because

377
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:26,195
Thanks for having us.

378
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:33,298
In my opinion, you know, everyone in Method has to know, you know, that this is so important.

379
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,500
I mean, this is how we're going to be governed and everything else.

380
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,783
But, you know, I still want to ask.

381
00:31:44,184 --> 00:31:45,425
It went back to the mayor.

382
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:46,065
Yeah.

383
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,886
And they made changes.

384
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:48,587
Yeah.

385
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:54,210
And I, you know, the mayor has made a decision and she gave it to them.

386
00:31:55,491 --> 00:32:01,092
And it is sort of like, I don't know, maybe it is a little bit of a fife of power, but it went back to the mayor.

387
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:06,953
So the mayor, I assume, is sending them back to them on Tuesday.

388
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:13,074
But I mean, it's gonna be the same document, basically, because that's what the mayor wants too.

389
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,215
The mayor agrees with you.

390
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:17,875
With the committee, she agrees with the people of Method.

391
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:21,356
So now it goes back to the council.

392
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:22,908
Let me just correct.

393
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:30,035
The council has not made a decision of what they're sending back to the mayor.

394
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:30,856
Okay.

395
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:39,905
Only Tuesday night they'll choose whether to accept the mayor's proposal or accept their amendments and send it back, which is another delay.

396
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,387
So there's another delay in there.

397
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:43,528
I just want to say that.

398
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:51,727
The charter committee is a microcosm of what the city should be.

399
00:32:52,148 --> 00:32:56,909
People of all different opinions getting together, working hard.

400
00:32:56,949 --> 00:33:01,791
We had a little dinner over at Maury Carroll's house.

401
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:07,853
And these people are friends, I consider, acquaintances that I never knew before, my neighbors.

402
00:33:08,293 --> 00:33:09,353
So it's been a great process.

403
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:10,454
What everybody's forgetting.

404
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:14,049
The mayor has her share of this process.

405
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,131
City Council has their share.

406
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:25,239
The importance of sending a document that is a 7-0 vote and the mayor's approval to the Statehouse is only going to help us get this on the ballot.

407
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,064
If we start continuing to delay and fight, it's just going to die, and maybe that's the strategy.

408
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:33,587
But what happens in November

409
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:36,017
is the ultimate survey.

410
00:33:36,677 --> 00:33:39,960
It's when the people vote up and down for the charter.

411
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,243
They're the ones who still have the power, not the city council, not the mayor.

412
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:52,409
The people will vote on the biggest survey of the year in November, and that's what I'm hoping people have been educated about the process.

413
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:54,751
And that's the way it should be, by the way.

414
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:56,792
I believe, yeah.

415
00:33:56,932 --> 00:34:00,455
See, you taught me something, because I was under the impression that

416
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:04,031
They were going to be voting on it Tuesday night.

417
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:08,358
So they're just either going to approve or not approve what the mayor wants.

418
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:11,323
If they approve the mayor's version, it's done.

419
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,685
It goes to the state house.

420
00:34:13,006 --> 00:34:14,508
If they approve their amendments.

421
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:22,367
The Lazaro amendments will be approved by the city council, but they already know the mayor's accepted them.

422
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:24,648
So that's also part of it.

423
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:29,190
But the mayor's already come out and said she's not getting off the school committee, so we know that.

424
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,330
And she shouldn't.

425
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:31,411
She shouldn't, I agree.

426
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:34,112
I think the mayor has done some great leadership.

427
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:42,456
In fact, I sent her an email congratulating her and telling her, I think that the preamble should be written in the front lobby of city hall, so when people come in,

428
00:34:42,836 --> 00:34:46,900
They see the biggest three words at the beginning of that preamble, which is we the people.

429
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,901
We the people.

430
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:49,982
And that's what this is all about.

431
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:52,605
So it's going to be an interesting Tuesday.

432
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,646
I hope people are watching.

433
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:54,106
Yeah.

434
00:34:54,827 --> 00:35:00,071
Well, I hope we made some people aware of what the whole process was about.

435
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:04,215
You guys, I know you worked hard.

436
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:05,076
I followed it.

437
00:35:06,797 --> 00:35:09,239
And, you know, to say like right now,

438
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,365
You know, the only words I can use is, like, I'm disappointed, you know?

439
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:15,508
I still hold faith.

440
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:22,658
Yeah, no, I do too, but, you know, the people spoke and, you know, it's like we have an opportunity to actually

441
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:52,448
Be listened to and and that to me like you just said it's the most important thing and then come November I mean, that's the ultimate The ultimate decision so yeah, but you know, I want to thank you Ron, you know, we we're gonna be coming to a close I I really do I mean valuable stuff great information good information and I'm

442
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:55,889
You know, we'll see what happens, you know.

443
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:57,330
Appreciate the opportunity.

444
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,812
Oh, no, it's my pleasure.

445
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,073
Really, it really was.

446
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:02,294
We thank you for joining us.

447
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:07,058
You know, this is the end of the show.

You know, I want to thank Ron again.

449

You know, all the information he gave us, the facts, and what people really need to know about the revised city charter.

450
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:27,568
