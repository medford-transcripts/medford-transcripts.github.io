1
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:04,734
All right.

2
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:06,675
Good evening, everybody.

3
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:10,757
Welcome to tonight's meeting of the Community Development Board.

4
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:13,278
I will call the meeting to order.

5
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:26,483
And since we have a couple of new members this evening, and we also do not have a chair, I'd like to motion that we suspend the rule requiring that we elect new officers tonight so that we can move forward with an acting chair this evening.

6
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:29,985
Can I get a second from a member of the board?

7
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:32,386
I'll second that.

8
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:37,144
Awesome.

9
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:41,267
Now I will call each member's name and take a vote.

10
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:42,909
John Anderson?

11
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:44,090
Yes.

12
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,071
Ari Goffman?

13
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:46,832
Fishman?

14
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:51,476
Dina Caliguero?

15
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:52,917
Present.

16
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:54,619
Doug Carr?

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,180
Yes.

18
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:58,922
Sean Began?

19
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:01,324
Yes.

20
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:02,605
And myself, Adam Behrens?

21
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:02,966
Yes.

22
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:07,513
So I guess motion passes.

23
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,315
Danielle, do you want to chime in now?

24
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:28,500
So we need a member to make a motion to nominate someone to serve as acting chair.

25
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,782
Member Behrens, you graciously volunteered for that.

26
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:38,516
So if we could have a member make that motion.

27
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:43,360
I'd like to make a motion to nominate Adam Behrens as acting chair for the meeting tonight.

28
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,282
I second the motion.

29
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:51,948
Danielle, you can take the roll.

30
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:52,989
OK.

31
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:53,610
Doug Carr?

32
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:54,811
Yes.

33
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:58,134
Sean Began?

34
00:01:58,655 --> 00:01:58,935
Yes.

35
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:00,797
John Anderson?

36
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,799
Uh-oh, John's frozen, I think, or very still.

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,381
We'll skip John.

38
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:14,923
Dina, you're going to have to remind me how to pronounce your last name again.

39
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:15,703
Colagero.

40
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:16,924
Colagero.

41
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:18,064
OK, Dina Colagero.

42
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:19,685
Yes, I accept.

43
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:20,826
Oh, say it one more time.

44
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:22,046
Colagero.

45
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,347
Colagero, OK.

46
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:23,667
Yep.

47
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:28,290
And Adam Behrens?

48
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:29,730
Yes.

49
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:32,632
So the motion passes.

50
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:41,494
4 to 0 with John Anderson having a technical difficulty and not part of that vote.

51
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:48,896
All right, so as acting chair, thank you for bearing with us.

52
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,597
I will now begin with some procedural matters.

53
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:58,700
This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,742
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings.

55
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:16,145
Anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included in the meeting agenda posted to the City of Medford website.

56
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:22,822
A recording of this meeting will be posted to the Medford Community Media website as soon as possible.

57
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:29,489
A reminder that given the remote nature of the meeting tonight, all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

58
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:38,838
Please know that the project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed at the city's website, medfordma.org.

59
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:43,603
by clicking on the current CD board filings tab.

60
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:52,246
For those on Zoom, I believe someone will post a link in the chat so that you can see those, the agenda and the meeting items for tonight.

61
00:03:56,087 --> 00:04:00,768
To begin with, I will now take roll call for the meeting now that we're in session.

62
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,450
John Anderson, I think just say present.

63
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:12,275
He might still be having technical difficulties.

64
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:13,796
Ari Goffman-Fishman?

65
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,818
Dina Caliguero?

66
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:17,939
Present.

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,880
Doug Carr?

68
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,941
Present.

69
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:23,122
Sean Began?

70
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:24,203
Present.

71
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:27,365
And John, maybe we'll try you again.

72
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:28,065
John Anderson?

73
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:30,847
Nope.

74
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:31,988
Nope.

75
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:37,753
Maybe I'll note that John is in the meeting, but still having difficulties.

76
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:42,155
And then I, myself, Adam Behrens, Acting Chair, present.

77
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:47,458
So I believe we have quorum.

78
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:51,720
Danielle, I will let you introduce any staff that are on the call tonight.

79
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,061
Yes, thank you.

80
00:04:54,341 --> 00:05:00,884
Attending tonight is myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability.

81
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:17,389
Director Alicia Hunt, the director of PDS, our wonderful intern, Christian Zapata-Lepofsky, and we have Nina Nazarian, our chief of staff, who will be presenting one of the agenda items.

82
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:20,368
Great.

83
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:24,070
So before we begin, I'll just run through the agenda very quickly.

84
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:32,895
We have a request from the mayor's office to take her request to endorse the submission of an amendment to Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District zoning.

85
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:34,536
We'll take that first.

86
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:42,441
Then we'll discuss the approval of a tripartite agreement and release of covenant for the Bridal Path subdivision.

87
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:44,602
Then we'll discuss a request.

88
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:48,625
Then we'll move to a public hearing regarding the site plan review for

89
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,663
a development at 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway.

90
00:05:54,645 --> 00:06:00,472
And then I see John might have his service backup.

91
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:03,715
John, can you confirm that you can hear us?

92
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:10,063
All right, he's still having a little difficulty.

93
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,291
So first, we'll take a motion.

94
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:21,454
Just since the public agenda, the Salem Street corridor item was listed as the last.

95
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,395
We'll do an amendment to take that item first.

96
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:29,498
So can I get a roll call vote to take that item first?

97
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,359
Well, I'll do the roll call.

98
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,020
Dina Caliguero?

99
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,881
Yes.

100
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:38,502
Doug Carr?

101
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:39,282
Yes.

102
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:43,655
Sean Began?

103
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,037
Yes.

104
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,421
Myself acting chair, Adam Behrens?

105
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:47,902
Yes.

106
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:53,352
So I believe

107
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,622
That's enough to take the item first.

108
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:05,404
I will now let Danielle introduce the agenda item, and then she'll pass it to Nina Nazarian, who's the chief of staff for the city.

109
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:14,046
And then I think Danielle will also give a little bit of context for just the procedural process for the zoning amendment and the public's ability to provide comment.

110
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:17,847
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.

111
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:38,079
So, as you are aware, the Salem street neighborhood quarter district, there was a zoning amendment that was adopted by city council back in March 2025. the city board had held several public hearings and made recommendations.

112
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,996
to the draft that was submitted to them.

113
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:55,981
City Council adopted most of them, save for one, which was the Salem Street and Park Street node.

114
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,762
The City Board had recommended that it be

115
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:07,120
The mixed use 1 zoning district, rather than the mixed use 2 zoning district, which would have been referred to to your board.

116
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:10,362
However, they did not accept that change.

117
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:17,984
So there are several ways that amendment zoning amendment can get started and.

118
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:33,823
1 of those is ways is for the community development board to submit an amendment to city council to start the amendment process under section 5 of chapter 48 mass general law.

119
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:41,526
The mayor does not have that authority to submit an amendment directly to city council.

120
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:48,249
So she is requesting that this board consider.

121
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:59,063
submitting an amendment to City Council to take up your original recommendation.

122
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:04,087
With that, I will turn it over to Chief of Staff, Nina Nazarian.

123
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,934
Thank you very much to the members of the City Board and Senior Planner, Danielle Evans.

124
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,477
As Senior Planner Evans stated,

125
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,975
This is a request that's coming from the mayor.

126
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:22,939
And just to add to the information that Ms.

127
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:32,407
Evans has presented, basically there, as you may know, there was a petition of over 1000 residents of Medford on this matter.

128
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:41,113
A lot of those people spoke up at prior city board hearing meetings, as well as city council meetings.

129
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:43,095
But as stated by Ms.

130
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:43,415
Evans,

131
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:54,460
the recommendation by the CD board to the city council on this specific node was not accepted and it was adjusted to MX2.

132
00:09:58,461 --> 00:10:12,065
And the mayor's asking for this board to reconsider by way of effectively presenting its prior recommendation back to the city council procedurally

133
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:21,428
Under Mass General Law, Chapter 40A, Section 5, there are a variety of ways in which a zoning amendment may take place.

134
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:27,510
And it is those ways that are listed in that statute identify how it gets referred.

135
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,470
They get referred to the city council.

136
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,531
One of the scenarios in which a referral can be made to the city council for a zoning change is for the

137
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:44,846
It's quoted in the law as the planning board, but in the city of Medford, that has the effect of the community development board.

138
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:58,314
Once it goes, if this body chooses to refer this proposal to the city council, then the city council would have to go through its procedures in order for a zoning amendment.

139
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:00,396
So it would review and consider the matter.

140
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:05,599
And then if it approved, it would refer it back to the CD board for a hearing.

141
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:12,370
then the CD board would have a formal hearing in which it would have to go through all the required posting and notification processes.

142
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:25,560
And then once the CD board formalized and finalized its decisions and made a recommendation to the city council, that would then go to the city council for further hearing, frankly.

143
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:34,686
Again, all those are assuming that the proposal tracks with the avenue of making the change.

144
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:49,997
The main reason the mayor is presenting this request to the CD board is because of the, well, frankly, the real reason, the reason specifically is the number of stories.

145
00:11:50,758 --> 00:12:04,285
MX1, as proposed by the CD board, had a maximum of four stories, but six stories is what MX2 would ultimately allow.

146
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:17,361
So, with the additional height, there's a concern and there's been an expression by the mayor and members of the community that, you know, the Salem street quarter is frankly quite mature and.

147
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:33,543
This is effectively attempting to right a wrong that exists, and the mayor wants to show the public that she is listening to the issues and concerns that have been presented by the public as to some of the zoning changes.

148
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:36,547
And this particular one, I think, has risen to the very top.

149
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:39,630
Thank you.

150
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,372
Happy to answer any questions.

151
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:07,384
So at this stage, this is Gina, at this stage, I as a member could make a motion to submit this amendment back to the city council.

152
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:21,474
And that would be to change the MX2 subject district back to the MX1 sub district as proposed by the community development board that was rejected by the city council.

153
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,656
Can I ask for a second?

154
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:26,358
I second that motion.

155
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,768
I heard John Anderson say he seconded it.

156
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:34,149
Correct.

157
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:39,009
All right, I guess this might be where I step in and do roll call.

158
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,570
So let me do roll call.

159
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,910
John Anderson?

160
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,491
Yes.

161
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:48,031
Ari Guffman-Fishman?

162
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:50,411
Tina Caliguero?

163
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:50,991
Yes.

164
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:52,672
Doug Carr?

165
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:53,672
Yes.

166
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:55,272
Sean Began?

167
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:56,312
Yes.

168
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:59,693
And myself, Adam Behrens.

169
00:14:01,418 --> 00:14:07,041
So the motion passes and the mayor's letter will be sent to the city council for consideration.

170
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:19,446
And then just to underscore for members of the public, that will then come back to the community board where we'll have a public hearing and the public will be able to provide additional input.

171
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:29,771
All right, now let me find my place in the long document here as my first time as acting chair.

172
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:37,710
So let's see, we asked for a motion.

173
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:43,136
And so now we will consider the bridal path subdivision.

174
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:48,341
There was a tri-party agreement and release of covenant.

175
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:53,571
I will ask Danielle to introduce this item specifically.

176
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:58,094
And then we have Kathy Desmond present, the attorney for the applicant.

177
00:14:58,994 --> 00:15:06,939
And then Kathy will add anything that's worth noting for the community board, after which we will then take a vote as a board.

178
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:12,983
Take it away, Danielle.

179
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,705
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

180
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:32,717
Yes, so as you recall, this board approved a subdivision, Bridal Path is what it's being called, off of Franklin Ave, or Franklin Street, rather, by the high school.

181
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:40,542
And as part of the subdivision approval, a covenant was put in place.

182
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:53,655
Attorney Desmond can explain this more artfully than I can, but there are, you know, there's... Oh, Danny went on mute.

183
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:58,978
Have I been talking this whole time?

184
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, we heard most of it and then there was a pause.

185
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,460
Oh, weird.

186
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,321
Okay, I'm sorry.

187
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:07,622
Where did I...

188
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,913
You said that Ms.

189
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:15,014
Jasmine could describe this in further detail.

190
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:15,434
Yes.

191
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:36,318
There's currently a covenant in place and there's a menu of options that it's the applicant's choice of what kind of surety to have in place, whether it's a bond or a covenant, or in this case, a tripartite agreement.

192
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:44,794
So Attorney Desmond is looking to have the covenant released and the tripartite agreement approved.

193
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:49,376
And this has been reviewed and approved by legal counsel.

194
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:52,538
So we don't have any issues with it.

195
00:16:52,658 --> 00:17:00,101
So it's sort of a kind of a perfunctory kind of board action at this time.

196
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:04,544
So through the chair, we'll pass this

197
00:17:06,698 --> 00:17:08,979
Attorney Desmond, I think I need to unmute.

198
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,860
There we go.

199
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:14,902
Good evening, Chairman Behrens and board members.

200
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:18,443
Kathleen Desmond of 335 Main Street Stoneham.

201
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:22,905
I'm here this evening with Ron Lopez of North Shore Residential Development.

202
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:34,450
As Danielle mentioned, when we originally brought this project forward, we proposed a covenant to be recorded on the eight lots, the single family lots in the subdivision.

203
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:43,767
The covenant indicated that the roadway would have to be constructed prior to the release of the lots.

204
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:47,728
At that time, my client did not own the property.

205
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:49,869
It was subject to a purchase and sale agreement.

206
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:58,591
So there weren't other options in terms of what's permitted under Chapter 40 of Section 81U of the statute.

207
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:04,493
So this was the only real option because to place a bond or a cash deposit

208
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:17,186
at that stage where you don't own the property is a substantial financial risk and the tripartite agreement was not a possibility because there weren't loan proceeds to be held back.

209
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:28,249
So at that time we indicated to the board that we would be coming back once my client acquired the property to substitute the covenant for the tripartite agreement.

210
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:31,630
I think it's significant to mention too that at the

211
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:39,832
the time of the hearing, the engineer, city engineer, uh, would have preferred a, uh, a whole back of $200,000.

212
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:42,293
And this is actually $220,000.

213
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:54,319
Um, so what we're seeking to do is substitute under chapter 40, section 81, you, uh, the tripartite agreement, which gives the city security in the amount of $220,000.

214
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,840
There's an exhibit a attached, which,

215
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:11,326
provides the client, the developer gets returned to him, um, in increments, uh, the amount that is being held based on a certificate of completion, uh, that has been approved by the city.

216
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:16,509
So the city has essentially a hold back of the 220 until the road is completed.

217
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:22,492
Um, this project has, has, um, has moved forward very quickly.

218
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:26,935
Um, most of the utilities are in, it's anticipated that, um,

219
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:31,128
that the utilities will be installed as of October.

220
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:44,354
And the road, the binder on the cover on the road, will be hopefully in place in November in order to move this project along, because the project is required to be finished within two years.

221
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:56,239
This allows the developer to multitask, essentially, to complete the road and also to start construction on the houses so that it can quickly move to completion of the subdivision development.

222
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:06,852
It's anticipated that my client will be prepared to have certificates of occupancies for the dwellings, at least some of them, in the summer of 2026.

223
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,936
So he's moving this project right along.

224
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:20,385
I think it's also worthy to mention in terms of our efforts and our good faith in this project is that we have negotiated easements with

225
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:28,031
uh, the 2 owners that are on Winthrop street behind the development so that their access to bridal path is protected.

226
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:34,194
And also they have rights in terms of, of, uh, of maintenance of that, that roadway.

227
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:40,156
So they'll be able to share in bridal path, the use of bridal path.

228
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,818
And that's essentially, uh, yeah.

229
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,347
if there are any questions.

230
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:50,648
Thank you, Kathleen.

231
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:52,049
I had a question.

232
00:20:53,349 --> 00:21:05,955
Uh, if I may through the chair, is it the applicants understanding that the money's set out in exhibit a can only be released upon further approval by this board?

233
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,756
Or is it some other city mechanism that you would be looking for?

234
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:16,379
Well, so that the statute, um, and there aren't regulations that

235
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:19,543
that have been drafted that apply to this.

236
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:34,271
It would be certainly nice if, upon a certificate being issued by the city of completion, by the city engineer, that it be permitted to be released by the department director, Director Hunt.

237
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:38,813
But there isn't any specific authority in the regulations or the statute.

238
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:45,256
I think the board could, if they sought to delegate responsibility to Director Hunt to do that.

239
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:56,514
or to take those matters up without having to have an appearance once the certificate is presented, then the board can certainly authorize the release of the funds.

240
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:05,582
Great.

241
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:09,546
I'll open it up for any other questions that board members might have.

242
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,873
I would just like to add, I appreciate the work, Ms.

243
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,194
Desmond, that your team has done.

244
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:34,081
I think the community board sees many different proposals in front of it from developers and from folks.

245
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:40,186
And so it's appreciated the speed at which you guys have acted and the cooperation with the city.

246
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:49,987
So I guess if there are no other comments from the board, I believe we have to do this in two parts.

247
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:56,688
The first is to ask for a motion to release the covenant.

248
00:22:57,769 --> 00:22:58,829
Oh, yes, Kathleen, sorry.

249
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:00,549
One other item.

250
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:12,352
We have requested that the board give the director of planning and sustainability authority to sign the documents so that in terms of notarizing signatures, we only have to notarize

251
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:17,254
one signature as opposed to collecting signatures and notarizations for each board member.

252
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:19,875
Okay, great.

253
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:30,037
All right, so if there are no comments from the board, we'll do this in two parts.

254
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,098
I think the first is a motion to release the covenant.

255
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:40,259
And then after that motion, we'll do a motion on these specific tripartite agreement.

256
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,820
So I'll ask for a motion to release the covenant.

257
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:47,953
I'd like to make a motion that we release the covenant.

258
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,314
Thanks, Sean.

259
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:50,294
Is there a second?

260
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:51,455
I seconded.

261
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:54,318
Great.

262
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:56,519
That would be John Anderson with the second.

263
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,303
And so we'll now take a vote to release the covenant.

264
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:03,004
John Anderson.

265
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:03,084
Aye.

266
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:06,407
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

267
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:09,269
Dina Caliguero.

268
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:09,909
Yes.

269
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:11,811
Doug Carr.

270
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:12,911
Yes.

271
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:14,553
Sean Began.

272
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:15,512
Yes.

273
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:17,894
And myself, Adam Behrens, yes.

274
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:20,155
So the motion passes.

275
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:24,978
So now we will do a second motion.

276
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:33,263
And so the second motion is a motion to approve the triparty agreement and authorize Alicia to sign on behalf of the board.

277
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:35,404
Is there a motion?

278
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:37,986
I second the motion.

279
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:40,603
great.

280
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:46,046
If I think the procedurally will do Dina, you can do a motion.

281
00:24:46,226 --> 00:25:00,394
So Mr. Mr. Chair, before we vote, can we add onto that motion that the applicant is excused from appearing at any future board meeting in regards to the release of the funds and exhibit a unless specifically asked to attend?

282
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:04,807
I am good with that addition.

283
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:08,830
So let me try to reword this.

284
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:22,320
Is there a motion to approve the triparty agreement to authorize Alicia to sign on behalf of the board and to release the obligation of the applicant to appear back before the board?

285
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:23,962
So is there a motion?

286
00:25:24,782 --> 00:25:26,744
So moved.

287
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:27,384
Is there a second?

288
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:28,445
Seconded.

289
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:33,054
Great, so now I'll do a roll call vote.

290
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:34,775
John Anderson?

291
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:35,776
Aye.

292
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,097
Ari Goffman-Fishman?

293
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,559
Dina Caliguero?

294
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,319
Yes.

295
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,940
Doug Carr?

296
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:43,741
Yes.

297
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:45,182
Sean Began?

298
00:25:45,642 --> 00:25:45,942
Yes.

299
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:48,644
And myself, Adam Behrens, yes.

300
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:52,306
The motion passes.

301
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:55,088
And I see we have a question from Ms.

302
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:55,488
Desmond.

303
00:25:56,523 --> 00:26:10,348
Yes, I would ask the board to also allow or take a vote to allow the director to sign the release of covenant as well, because that needs to be signed by either the board or under the board's authorization.

304
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,509
Okay, yes, we can definitely do that.

305
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:23,331
The previous motion authorized Alicia to sign the tri-party agreement on behalf of the board.

306
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:34,813
So just to make sure that we have everything, every T crossed and I dotted, is there a motion to allow Alicia to sign the release of covenant on behalf of the board?

307
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,894
So moved.

308
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:39,555
Is there a second?

309
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:40,575
I second it.

310
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,058
All right, I'll take roll call.

311
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:44,279
John Anderson.

312
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:45,520
Aye.

313
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,440
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

314
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,382
Dina Calagaro.

315
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:51,482
Yes.

316
00:26:52,463 --> 00:26:53,043
Doug Carr.

317
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:53,783
Yes.

318
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:55,384
Sean Began.

319
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:56,384
Yes.

320
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:58,986
And myself, Adam Behrens.

321
00:26:59,086 --> 00:26:59,346
Yes.

322
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:01,847
So the motion passes.

323
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:13,302
And now we will move on to the third item on the agenda, which is the site plan review for a number 10 and number 20 Revere beach Parkway.

324
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:14,843
Mr. Chairman.

325
00:27:15,523 --> 00:27:16,223
Yes, John.

326
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:22,306
Can I just apologize to the board and anyone who's tuned in for going dark here?

327
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:29,068
I was having some trouble with my internet connection and I think it's going to work a lot better if I don't send my video.

328
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,842
So appreciate John, I think we've all we've all experienced that over the past few years was with with zoom.

329
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:40,084
So, great for the site plan review.

330
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:42,225
This is a new public hearing.

331
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:47,548
And so I will read the public hearing notice for the record.

332
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:56,439
The Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on September 17th, 2025, after 6 p.m.

333
00:27:56,479 --> 00:28:10,689
via Zoom, relative to an application by Transom Real Estate for site plan review to permit the construction of a new seven-story multifamily residential structure that would contain 248 units.

334
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:16,554
The subject property is located in the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District.

335
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,602
zoning district 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway in Medford, Massachusetts.

336
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:37,787
Now, if there's any introductory comments that the staff would like to make, I'll provide room for the staff and then we'll pass it over to the applicants from TransOm.

337
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,550
Yes, Danielle.

338
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:49,598
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

339
00:28:49,918 --> 00:29:15,348
Um, I just wanted to, um, state that this Wellington station multifamily overlay district is our, um, compliant district under the MBTA communities act, um, which is section three a, um, where cities, cities and towns that are, um, served by the MBTA needed to create these multifamily districts where,

340
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:25,288
A certain amount of units based on a formula are allowed by right so this project is coming in by right.

341
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:27,570
But we do have the.

342
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:34,777
The local authority to perform a site plan review so that is what is.

343
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,531
before you all tonight.

344
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:38,671
This is our first one.

345
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:47,495
Um, we were a rapid transit community, so we had the shortest, um, deadline to comply and we got it done in time.

346
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:49,256
Um, so that was exciting.

347
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:52,838
So that must've been, was that 2023?

348
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:54,018
I think December, 2023.

349
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:55,479
It must've been.

350
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:56,159
Yeah.

351
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,202
So here we are in September of 2025 and this is our first test case.

352
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:03,323
So, um,

353
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:09,492
With that, Mr. Chair, you could pass this on to the applicant.

354
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:13,374
I believe Attorney Moore is representing Transom Development.

355
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:15,175
Okay, terrific.

356
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:19,677
And then just procedurally, I see we have a question from a board member, Doug.

357
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:25,760
Mr. Chair, Peter Spellios, who's raised his hand, is actually the owner, so I think we would pass it to him.

358
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:27,182
Ah, OK.

359
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:30,225
I will then pass it to Peter Spellios.

360
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:37,350
And I guess this will be to Peter to give any comments.

361
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,093
And then we'll pass it to Trans Am Real Estate to present the slides.

362
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:44,676
If you want to take Doug's question first, you can.

363
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:46,217
Oh, OK.

364
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:46,597
Sorry.

365
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:49,420
I interpreted that as needing to supersede Doug.

366
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,561
Doug, your question.

367
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:55,160
Yes, Daniel, kind of a quick follow-up question.

368
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,465
This gets us over the line for the amount of units that we need for the state.

369
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:05,567
How much are we above that line right now with this project?

370
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:11,932
Oh, so there's two different, there's

371
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:19,262
the subsidized housing inventory of having your 10% or making incremental progress.

372
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:27,209
But then there was the zoning under MHCA communities, which required that you zone to allow so many units.

373
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,333
And the state didn't actually care if they ever got built.

374
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:34,636
You just had to zone that they would be possible.

375
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:36,198
So that's what we did.

376
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:44,654
We do currently have Safe Harbor through incremental production of units.

377
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:54,897
I haven't crunched the numbers to see what would happen with the number percentage-wise with this project.

378
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:57,038
Thank you.

379
00:31:59,158 --> 00:31:59,618
OK, great.

380
00:32:00,178 --> 00:32:03,139
We'll then pass it to Peter and a chance on real estate.

381
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,040
So let Peter, you go.

382
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:12,730
Good evening, everyone.

383
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,755
I'm Peter Spellios with Transom Real Estate.

384
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:18,844
Mr. Chairman, members of the board, thanks very much for taking the time tonight.

385
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:25,256
We understand that we are the first 3A project coming for the city of Medford.

386
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,458
So I just want to say 3 quick things before I turn it over to our team.

387
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:44,808
1st is the 3A has obviously garnered a lot of news about the both the need for the production of housing and also the change that makes it perceived anyways to be easier to be able to do housing developments.

388
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:49,430
I do want to credit the City of Medford, this board and staff.

389
00:32:49,831 --> 00:33:00,957
You folks, when you did implement the 3A district and you did so on time, you did so with some very significant design standards and dimensional requirements to address concerns.

390
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:13,544
So while we are before you on site plan, it's important to note that it's site plan that comes with a very long list of design guidelines and dimensional requirements.

391
00:33:14,304 --> 00:33:24,796
I'm pleased to say that our plan complies with those dimensional requirements and guidelines, and we're seeking no waivers in that regard.

392
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:35,908
And that's really a credit to staff and to you all for putting forth something that was substantive, sophisticated, and that we were able to follow.

393
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:40,130
Second, I just want to comment and credit City staff.

394
00:33:40,610 --> 00:34:03,059
City staff has been available to meet, to share comments, to share technical feedback about the proposal and has provided significant feedback for which the team has just this week received and submitted, end of last week, excuse me, received and then earlier this week submitted responses to those.

395
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:04,580
Really helpful feedback.

396
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,422
And, and last but certainly not least on my list is I just want to acknowledge the neighborhood.

397
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:20,307
We are adjacent obviously in the corner of reach Parkway, middle sex, and then we're also adjacent to a private street nine street.

398
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:29,477
For those tuned in City of Medford, I understand that Medford has a long history of private ways and challenges with private ways.

399
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:33,661
There are many parties that have ownership interests in these adjacent private ways.

400
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:38,467
I really appreciated the ability of the neighborhood to get together.

401
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:47,374
and to meet and to talk about what we can collectively do to improve some of those private ways and to address long-standing concerns in those private ways.

402
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:52,719
And so I do want to acknowledge three condo associations in very close proximity.

403
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:53,940
We've met several times.

404
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,764
We'll be continuing to meet really productive, really thoughtful conversations.

405
00:34:59,504 --> 00:35:03,308
And I think those conversations result in better projects and better neighborhoods.

406
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:08,969
So with that, I would like to turn it over to Valerie Moore, our counsel, and she will take it from here.

407
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:12,590
And I'm available tonight to answer any questions as they arise.

408
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:25,914
Thanks, Peter.

409
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,075
We'll get you unmuted, Valerie, and hand it off to you.

410
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:29,828
Thank you so much.

411
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:31,752
Good evening, members of the board.

412
00:35:32,874 --> 00:35:38,104
Could you allow Ryan Sprague to screen share so that he can put up our presentation?

413
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:39,707
Thank you.

414
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:42,478
I'm Valerie Moore.

415
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm an attorney from Nutter, McLennan and Fish.

416
00:35:45,860 --> 00:36:01,690
Those of you who've been on the board for a couple of months may recall that I was in front of you with respect to this site, seeking a couple of amendments to the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District just a few months ago.

417
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,814
And we'll talk about how those facilitated compliance momentarily.

418
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:17,202
So you'll see on your screen the CAPES building which is the current use of the site.

419
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:22,766
This site is a gateway to Medford so we are really excited to be before you

420
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,988
with a new vision for the site this evening.

421
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:30,408
And we'll be showing you what that looks like in just a few minutes.

422
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:37,970
I do want to acknowledge that we received a lot of thoughtful comments from city staff and departments.

423
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,791
We submitted responses to those comments this morning.

424
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:50,993
So I don't know if those have been shared with the board yet, but you should have them and they should be circulated to city staff.

425
00:36:52,674 --> 00:36:57,721
None of those comments required material changes to the site plan.

426
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:03,468
So the site plan is the same as what was submitted to you for this project.

427
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,992
Do you want to move to the next slide, please?

428
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:19,345
So as Peter indicated, this project has been really carefully designed to comply with what was put forward in the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District.

429
00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:34,149
As you can see from the slide in front of you, the site, which is currently comprised of two lots, that's both the CAPU site that we showed a moment ago, as well as the Monroe, Muffler and Brake building site that is next to it.

430
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:35,389
It's 1.877 acres.

431
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:44,813
and the building has been designed to comply with all setbacks.

432
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:49,857
Now, the site has frontage on two state-controlled roadways.

433
00:37:50,457 --> 00:38:00,203
The Department of Conservation and Recreation holds setback easements on those two state roadways, and so our maximum front yard setback

434
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:20,246
Pursuant to the footnote that we had added to the dimensional table as part of the amendments to the Wellington station multifamily overlay district is set to coincide with those setbacks so that we're complying with both what the state requires as well as what's required by the zoning district.

435
00:38:21,982 --> 00:38:31,089
Additionally, with respect to the height, compliance is proposed through the bonuses that are outlined in the zoning overlay.

436
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:34,251
And I'll get into those on the next slide.

437
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:44,438
I'm not going to speak to each of these criteria specifically because they'll be addressed through the subsequent overview of the site plan.

438
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,400
Do you want to move to the next slide?

439
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:54,767
So we're taking advantage of two separate height bonus incentives.

440
00:38:55,928 --> 00:39:06,539
One of them is that the building is going to be designed to be LEED Platinum certifiable, and that entitles the development to two additional stories of height.

441
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:12,226
And the other is we are providing some deeper affordability units.

442
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:21,336
So 15% affordable units is what's required by the overall zoning ordinance for development of this size.

443
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,941
Normally those units are required to be provided at 80% AMI.

444
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:44,456
in order to qualify for that additional story of height, 20% of those 15% of the units are going to be provided at a deeper affordability level so that they will be affordable to persons earning 65% or below of the area median income.

445
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:52,642
So that's how we propose to comply with the zoning bonuses for height.

446
00:39:54,444 --> 00:40:03,210
So with that, I am going to pass it over to our architect, D'Artagnan-Brown, who is going to give an overview of the rest of the project.

447
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,992
So if you want to allow him to unmute, I believe he has his hand raised so you can find him.

448
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:09,774
Wonderful.

449
00:40:09,854 --> 00:40:10,535
Can you guys hear me?

450
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:13,298
Good evening.

451
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:14,819
Thank you.

452
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:15,620
Good evening, all.

453
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,781
D'Artagnan from Embark.

454
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:18,622
Excited to be here tonight.

455
00:40:18,662 --> 00:40:19,903
We have a great team with us.

456
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:24,706
We look forward to running through our presentation and can certainly answer any questions.

457
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:29,109
I'll kick it off by following where Valerie left.

458
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:32,051
So as mentioned, 248 units.

459
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:36,894
Within that, and through the density bonus, we are at 38 affordable units.

460
00:40:37,494 --> 00:40:39,976
We meet the lot coverage percentage

461
00:40:41,537 --> 00:40:45,481
Requisite parking for both bikes and vehicles.

462
00:40:45,681 --> 00:40:55,390
And then working with Transim and our landscape architects, Spencer from MDLA, we have a very robust amenity and public realm program we'll show you.

463
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,531
Next slide, please.

464
00:40:57,675 --> 00:41:09,924
The site, as you may know it well, close to two acres, really nicely located as kind of a gateway into this neighborhood coming off of Middlesex and Revere Beach Parkway.

465
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:17,209
You can see to the southeast, Tober Park, walking distance to Wellington Station.

466
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:22,874
So quite an opportunity here to really design something, which we'll show you more tonight.

467
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:27,316
As we move to the next slide, we're really walking around the site.

468
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:31,698
The first is the view from the Fellsway intersection.

469
00:41:31,718 --> 00:41:35,820
You can see our site straddles both Middlesex to Revere Beach.

470
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:49,888
As we go to the right, the existing view down Revere Beach, you'll notice a heavy tree line which will be remaining both with those setbacks and easements that Valerie mentioned and just the positioning of our

471
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:51,649
site as well.

472
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:57,972
And as we loop around down to 9th and then 9th and Middlesex, really rounding out the existing conditions.

473
00:41:58,092 --> 00:42:03,255
So quite a good opportunity here, really a blank canvas to do something special.

474
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:12,840
Here we've worked with MDLA, which we'll jump in, but really look to kind of take the public realm and provide something meaningful here.

475
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,582
So with that, Spencer, take it away.

476
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:17,408
Thank you, Dr. Tanian.

477
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,229
Spencer Beebe with MDLA.

478
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:20,890
I'm the landscape architect on the project.

479
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:25,013
So what we're looking at here is our landscape concept plan.

480
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:28,475
I'd like to start along page north here on 9th Street.

481
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:44,544
With the improvements that we are doing, we're increasing the existing sidewalk to five foot wide clear, as well as adding a buffer that gets up to about six and a half feet wide, which will be filled with shrubs and perennial plantings that will help kind of soften the facade on that north side.

482
00:42:45,792 --> 00:43:05,361
Moving page right, where we abut our neighboring condo, we have our five-foot wide egress pathway leading to 9th Street, as well as a substantial planting buffer of shrubs and perennials, as well as shade trees along that to buffer our building, as well as our tenants from the adjacent property.

483
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:10,784
Moving page south along Revere Beach Parkway, D'Artagnan mentioned that we are

484
00:43:12,182 --> 00:43:16,405
leaving the existing trees, you know, outside of that, you know, inside the easement.

485
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:20,987
We are leaving the existing curb cuts as they are today.

486
00:43:21,588 --> 00:43:28,732
We will be introducing permeable paving, as you can see in the textured paving running page left and right.

487
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:36,076
This will be a one-way traffic flow as well, so improving that, you know, coming in and coming out.

488
00:43:36,736 --> 00:43:37,497
We've introduced

489
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:45,425
parking space as well for the loading and unloading of moving trucks for the protected tenants.

490
00:43:46,826 --> 00:43:50,049
And due to the multifamily, they are dog friendly.

491
00:43:50,229 --> 00:43:51,510
They have a pet wash station inside.

492
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:57,395
We've added a pet relief area where number eight is shown just outside of that exterior amenity space.

493
00:43:59,137 --> 00:43:59,437
Next slide.

494
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:13,016
And then as we kind of move towards Middlesex Avenue, we'll zoom into the main entry here, you know, noting coming from the intersection, trying to keep, you know, the view to the main entry open that we'll kind of take a look at later as Ryan will talk about.

495
00:44:13,036 --> 00:44:17,221
You know, we've added in another vehicular access.

496
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:24,428
So this will also be one way we'll have a drop off for Uber, drop off for food, deliveries.

497
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:30,119
We've added in a few parking spaces for future tenants, you know quick drop us as well.

498
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:43,091
Worth noting as well this is all permeable paving that you see here with the kind of brownish white paving in the vehicle area as well as the pedestrian, where we have our drop off.

499
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,683
you kind of step out onto the pedestrian area, our paving pattern changes 90 degrees.

500
00:44:49,124 --> 00:44:52,727
And the reason for that is that we're kind of drawing everybody down to the main entry.

501
00:44:53,447 --> 00:45:02,234
And as we're kind of coming down about the halfway point where that number seven is, we've added a few exterior bike parking spaces, which will allow for six bikes outside.

502
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:06,618
Additionally, there are a lot of bike parking spaces on interior of the building as well.

503
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:10,522
continue to move south towards the main entry.

504
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:15,483
We have our perennial plaza space that's filled with loose outdoor seating.

505
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:19,764
It's framed by these low architectural seat walls with wood insets as well.

506
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:35,187
The whole thing is really framed by very nice shrubs and perennials that not only soften the space on the inside from the intersection, but also soften the building a little bit and creates a very nice space for the tenants in the building.

507
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:41,066
you'll see we have along Middlesex Avenue, we have some street trees spaced along.

508
00:45:41,087 --> 00:45:42,067
These will be ornamental.

509
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:46,389
We do have utilities, overhead utilities there, so being mindful of that.

510
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,112
And we do have a net gain of 15 trees throughout the whole property as well.

511
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:52,813
Thank you.

512
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:54,134
Hand it back to D'Artagnan.

513
00:45:55,094 --> 00:45:55,694
Thanks, Spencer.

514
00:45:56,415 --> 00:46:00,157
So as we move from here to the next slide, a couple

515
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:07,229
Key things we've done is really look at shielding the parking within the footprint of the building.

516
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:17,612
Coming off of Revere Beach, as mentioned, the curb cuts will remain in place, but redone from a materials perspective.

517
00:46:17,652 --> 00:46:20,694
We've aligned active program with building amenity.

518
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:25,878
We have a second lobby here, pet spa, direct access, bike storage, bike workshop.

519
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,181
That pulls you into the garage as we go around clockwise.

520
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:36,064
As mentioned, off of Middlesex, we do have the main lobby here.

521
00:46:36,384 --> 00:46:42,087
There is a two-story really kind of grand space at the northwest corner, which we'll show you in rendering.

522
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:45,088
But the idea is to pull tenants within the building.

523
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:55,473
Within here, we have kind of the requisite setup between leasing office, mail, package room, gender-neutral bathrooms, utility space.

524
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,677
kind of ringing the perimeter of the building.

525
00:46:58,697 --> 00:47:10,149
And as we pop into the garage itself, we've started to establish all of the back of house spaces needed to operate the building between trash, electrical room, et cetera.

526
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:13,253
This level will house 125 of the total cars with, um,

527
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:22,566
a couple of additional tandem and EB spots, which I'll talk about in a second.

528
00:47:23,147 --> 00:47:30,239
And as we pop up with an internal ramp to the next level, we have the balance of

529
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:40,971
we have a total of 98 spaces here with 109 total with the tandem, and we are meeting the city's requirements around EVs.

530
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:50,636
We have that requirement met both in spots provided day one and then also future proofing for EV-ready spaces as well, which will be a total of 50.

531
00:47:52,157 --> 00:47:54,618
Here is where we start to introduce the residential units.

532
00:47:54,718 --> 00:48:00,059
On this floor, we have 16 units that ring both Revere Beach and Middlesex.

533
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:03,020
The amenity continues to that two-story space.

534
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,481
And really, the goal is to take from here up.

535
00:48:06,741 --> 00:48:17,344
And then if we pop to the next floor, it will spill out onto the amenity courtyard, which MDLA has lusciously designed here.

536
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:20,125
I think a couple key things to note, really,

537
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:39,180
beyond the units in the breakout here is if you can see in the facade, in the footprint, we've really taken effort to work on deliberate kind of architectural camps in the lengths of the building to break up the massing, use it as an ability to really define the architecture.

538
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:46,365
You'll see in renderings that really helps set up quite cool gateway views onto the site within

539
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:51,868
both kind of on a hyper level around the building, but pulling back out.

540
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:55,570
It allows us to transition material really nicely into the neighborhood.

541
00:48:56,491 --> 00:49:01,153
And so as we move up to the next floor, you can see that kind of continues.

542
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:15,422
And then to note, which we'll show you in renderings on the northwest corner, we've pulled back a unit and really terminated the tenant experience at a outdoor roof deck and a lounge space here.

543
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:19,787
In the next slide, Ryan, if you don't mind.

544
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:42,642
More technical in nature, but just to let you know, we are working with both our mechanical and structural engineers to make sure not only do we get all of the required equipment for the heating and cooling, but we also are solar ready, both in terms of space layout and structural sizing for our joist members on the roof.

545
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:50,181
And I think with that, in the next slide, I'm going to turn it over to Ryan, who will walk through the architectural narrative.

546
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:50,842
Thank you.

547
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:52,437
Great.

548
00:49:52,577 --> 00:49:53,317
Thank you, D'Artagnan.

549
00:49:53,878 --> 00:49:55,058
My name is Ryan Sprague.

550
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:56,119
I'm with Embark.

551
00:49:56,179 --> 00:50:15,827
I'll take you through these next few slides that deal with kind of our conceptual design, our generative thinking, starting with this slide, which is really just illustrating that from the outset of our design process, we like to sort of research and understand kind of the context in which we're building.

552
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:22,791
which includes sort of how the city is looking at the area in which we're proposing our building.

553
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:36,841
So through our research and going through Medford's comprehensive plan, we sort of began to understand that this area is really seen as a gateway node, an area where people are arriving to the city, an area where people are

554
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:54,079
Sorry, sorry, an area that that presents an opportunity to sort of announce welcome and reflect and reinforce the identity of Medford on the right is a plan that just sort of illustrates land uses in the area in our immediate vicinity.

555
00:50:54,099 --> 00:50:58,885
And I think the real takeaway from us for us from this diagram is really the.

556
00:50:59,385 --> 00:51:03,872
that our site is kind of negotiating this transition in scale and density.

557
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:14,086
So to the south, sort of these larger scale, higher density projects, and then transitioning to the north into sort of a lower scale, lower density neighborhood.

558
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:19,540
And these are just some takeaways that started to inform kind of our design process and our conceptual thinking.

559
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:26,903
This is a massing strategy and material strategy that just reflects our acknowledgment of those conditions.

560
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:33,906
So one of those being this transition of scale from south to north and how that's reflected in our massing.

561
00:51:33,986 --> 00:51:44,190
So a larger sort of expression along Revere Beach Parkway that then transitions and breaks down in scale as you move north along Middlesex Ave.

562
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:57,277
And then this material just sort of steps back up as you move east along 9th Street in an appropriate way that sort of reflects the scale of these other multifamily buildings.

563
00:51:58,357 --> 00:52:08,603
With that stepping reveals kind of a warmer material that we're using along these exterior facades to just kind of warm and soften the exterior.

564
00:52:11,468 --> 00:52:18,671
This secondary material that we're using is an acknowledgment of that idea of gateway that I was mentioning.

565
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:36,617
These larger expressions along gestural movements along Middlesex and Revere Beach Parkway that reach out to Everett and Somerville to the south at these corners where people are arriving to this intersection.

566
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:48,907
I move to the next slide starts our elevations that start to sort of illustrate how this is sort of panning out in greater detail.

567
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:53,589
So, I'm starting at the bottom with our Revere Beach Parkway elevation.

568
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:59,632
You can see the sort of the, the 5 story expression of our material a, which we're thinking of as corrugated metal at the moment.

569
00:53:00,032 --> 00:53:06,876
that then, as you turn the corner along Middlesex Ave, starts to break down and scale into a four-story expression.

570
00:53:07,336 --> 00:53:24,065
This is also where you enter the building, our main lobby, which is sort of this grander two-story expression, atop which sits this gateway, sort of that gestural sort of movement that I was referring to down Middlesex Ave over the bridge towards Somerville.

571
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:31,574
Then the next slide is our remaining two elevations.

572
00:53:31,594 --> 00:53:32,355
It'll come up.

573
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:32,775
There it is.

574
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:48,882
Starting on the bottom of the 9th Street elevation where we do have that two-story expression of parking garage, which I'll show you in the following slides, how we're proposing to soften that expression, understanding that it is a narrower

575
00:53:49,982 --> 00:53:57,986
corridor and sort of a pedestrian area, how we're really trying to sort of acknowledge that and soften the expression there.

576
00:53:58,586 --> 00:54:11,353
And then turning the corner, this upper elevation is a continuation of that garage expression that then terminates along Revere Beach Parkway with that secondary kind of gestural gateway expression.

577
00:54:13,735 --> 00:54:19,319
This is our streets or the intersection street view of the proposed building.

578
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:26,603
Here you can really see how that scale is transitioning from larger scale down to smaller scale.

579
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:41,492
These elegant inflection points that D'Artagnan was mentioning, I think you can really see here, they start to accentuate that gestural movement that I was referring to with the gateway and the reaching out down these main corridors.

580
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:54,315
the presence of our two-story lobby expression that I had mentioned and this plaza that's really well planted that Spencer was alluding to.

581
00:54:55,615 --> 00:55:07,798
This is really an opportunity we feel like to celebrate this historic or the heritage of Medford in celebrating the brick material, understanding that

582
00:55:08,478 --> 00:55:12,703
that is part of the history of Medford as brickmakers.

583
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:28,202
Then turning the corner, this is along Ninth Street, just to show that two-story garage expression that we're really taking care to soften with our screening as well as our landscaping plans.

584
00:55:30,231 --> 00:55:43,335
And then lastly, a reverse angle from Revere Beach Parkway along that sidewalk, just helping to illustrate how far we're set back from the street and the sidewalk and the maintenance of that nice green space and street trees.

585
00:55:45,036 --> 00:55:47,717
And with that, I believe I will turn it over to Samira.

586
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:57,087
You may need to unmute her.

587
00:55:57,147 --> 00:55:58,388
My name is Samira Ahmadi.

588
00:55:58,408 --> 00:56:04,349
I am at the Energy Studio, and we're providing energy and sustainability consulting for the project.

589
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:25,033
We are incorporating integrative design process for our project, and our sustainability approach focuses on not only the operational carbon, but we're also going to pay attention to embodied carbon of the materials that are going to be selected, and keeping in mind residency as well as the sustainable material selection.

590
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:36,090
Um, our project is subject to the opt in a specialist code and therefore is going to be passive house certified following the fierce core 2024 performance pathway.

591
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:40,712
For the all primary services, heating, cooling and domestic hot water.

592
00:56:40,752 --> 00:56:42,692
The project is going to be all electric.

593
00:56:42,712 --> 00:56:50,076
The only areas that the fossil fuel will be used is going to be for exterior grills as well as the fire pits.

594
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:55,138
As Valerie noted earlier, the project is going to be lead platinum certifiable.

595
00:56:56,293 --> 00:57:05,097
We are going to participate in a massive incentives program, and we are going to register the project as one of the core requisite of the passive house.

596
00:57:05,337 --> 00:57:13,120
Our project is also going to be Energy Star multifamily certified, and therefore, all the guidelines is going to be incorporated.

597
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:24,304
And also, as Embark team noted, the project is going to incorporate solar ready requirements, and they have shown the PV zone areas on the roof

598
00:57:24,883 --> 00:57:29,484
And electrical interconnection pathway to this zone is also included in the design.

599
00:57:38,126 --> 00:57:41,007
I think at this stage, we're going to turn it over to Rebecca.

600
00:57:43,007 --> 00:57:44,048
She may be muted.

601
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:49,389
Her hand is raised.

602
00:57:55,677 --> 00:57:55,998
Thank you.

603
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:56,962
Great.

604
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:57,925
Can you hear me okay now?

605
00:57:59,591 --> 00:57:59,832
Yes.

606
00:58:00,836 --> 00:58:01,217
Excellent.

607
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:01,739
Thank you.

608
00:58:02,673 --> 00:58:03,114
Good evening.

609
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:04,435
My name is Rebecca Brown.

610
00:58:04,475 --> 00:58:08,638
I'm from Greenman Peterson and we're the traffic consultants on this project.

611
00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:14,303
We have put together a traffic impact assessment for the proposed development.

612
00:58:15,324 --> 00:58:22,910
We did go out and actually count all of the existing driveways to the Cappy's Liquor and the Monroe Auto Service.

613
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:30,757
You can see here on the diagram in the middle column shows what the existing site is currently generating for traffic.

614
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:43,085
And then we also estimated how much traffic would be generated by the proposed residential development based on standard trip generation rates published from the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

615
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:57,696
And what it does show is that for all time periods, with the exception of the weekday morning peak hour, the proposed development is actually going to be a reduction in vehicle trips as compared to the existing uses on the site.

616
00:58:59,544 --> 00:59:11,315
We are also proposing a robust transportation demand management program to help further reduce the traffic that would be generated by the development.

617
00:59:12,136 --> 00:59:17,501
That includes the site being located within a half mile of the Wellington station.

618
00:59:18,381 --> 00:59:22,983
for access to rapid rail transit and commuter rail services.

619
00:59:24,404 --> 00:59:36,270
We're also proposing to reconstruct and complete the sidewalk network around the site so that there would be a continuous connection to sidewalks in the surrounding area.

620
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:46,835
We are proposing to have 248 bicycle storage parking spaces within the building itself, so there would be at least one bicycle parking space.

621
00:59:47,322 --> 00:59:49,103
for every unit within the building.

622
00:59:50,063 --> 01:00:00,506
We've also proposed a dedicated ride share and delivery drop off area at the front of the building with parking for those ride share and delivery services.

623
01:00:01,647 --> 01:00:02,907
We will have work from home.

624
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:22,808
spaces and co-working spaces within the building, as well as pet spas and over 8,500 square feet of additional amenity space to include things like gyms, lounges, rental spaces to reduce the need for residents to have to travel off of the site.

625
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:29,455
We have taken a look at the safety and access of the site as well.

626
01:00:30,677 --> 01:00:45,473
Access to the site is going to be provided, as was previously noted, via an entrance-only driveway and an exit-only driveway onto Revere Beach Parkway, which would both be limited to right-in and right-out only.

627
01:00:46,034 --> 01:00:55,131
Movements and then a full access in egress driveway out onto 9th street to access into the residential parking garage.

628
01:00:56,248 --> 01:01:07,476
then there would be an entrance-only driveway and an egress-only driveway over on Middlesex Avenue for that drop-off and pick-up loop, which would also be used for the rideshare and delivery services.

629
01:01:09,778 --> 01:01:20,185
And we have evaluated the sightlines at all of those driveways, and all of them do exceed AASHTO's recommendations for safe sightlines.

630
01:01:22,126 --> 01:01:39,815
And lastly, we did look at the existing collision patterns around all of the streets surrounding the site, and all of them had crash rates lower than statewide and district-wide average, indicating that there's no significant crash occurrence on any of the streets surrounding the site.

631
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:44,477
So overall, we do feel that this site can accommodate

632
01:01:44,897 --> 01:01:49,398
the traffic that would be generated by the development in a safe and efficient manner.

633
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:53,099
And with that, I believe I'll turn it back over to Valerie.

634
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:03,561
And not me, I believe our civil engineer is taking over at this point.

635
01:02:07,762 --> 01:02:09,482
Just Matt Costa, if he's on.

636
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:12,929
Yes, good afternoon.

637
01:02:12,969 --> 01:02:14,830
Matthew Costa with Beals Associates.

638
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,351
Just talk to this slide here.

639
01:02:17,371 --> 01:02:24,335
So we just the team now analyze the walk shed obviously with Wellington station nearby so.

640
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:32,119
Walk score transit score with the close proximity of the building to Wellington station.

641
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:37,362
It's a great opportunity to support walking paths and bike routes.

642
01:02:37,482 --> 01:02:38,022
It's about a.

643
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:48,542
a quarter mile walk, five to 10 minute walk to Wellington station and the bike path, similar route to that can be a little bit faster.

644
01:02:48,562 --> 01:02:54,607
And that's shown there with that orange line that you can see to Wellington station.

645
01:02:56,588 --> 01:02:57,769
You can go to the next slide.

646
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:02,793
Sorry, Matthew.

647
01:03:04,174 --> 01:03:04,414
Sure.

648
01:03:04,434 --> 01:03:06,936
There it is.

649
01:03:07,036 --> 01:03:07,236
Great.

650
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,221
So this is just the overall site plan again.

651
01:03:10,281 --> 01:03:15,243
Just want to speak to kind of the curb cuts and kind of the permitting behind that.

652
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:19,825
So as others have mentioned, Revere Beach Parkway is under MassDOT jurisdiction.

653
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:24,788
There are two existing curb cuts on Revere Beach Parkway at the bottom of your screen.

654
01:03:25,428 --> 01:03:26,368
They are two-way.

655
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:33,151
As of now, we are proposing to change those to a one-way, help to alleviate traffic and just a better circulation for

656
01:03:36,206 --> 01:03:42,731
tenants to enter and exit the building, including the interior parking spaces.

657
01:03:44,012 --> 01:03:50,618
On Middlesex, on the left side of your screen, there's a short section of curb cut that we'll be closing.

658
01:03:50,638 --> 01:04:01,066
There's an existing curb cut that's shared between the Cappy site and the barbershop and tattoo parlor, so we'll be closing about 18 feet of that.

659
01:04:01,106 --> 01:04:02,187
That'll help to improve

660
01:04:03,287 --> 01:04:06,329
traffic conditions and congestion at that intersection.

661
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:18,675
And then we'll be opening two new curb cuts on Middlesex, which will be one-way curb cuts 24 feet wide that are being highlighted there, as it was discussed before.

662
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:23,898
So again, helping to kind of alleviate traffic and overall better circulation.

663
01:04:25,118 --> 01:04:32,062
Up on 9th Street is a very large curb cut, about 63 feet wide, and it's right at an intersection with a stop sign and a light

664
01:04:33,948 --> 01:04:51,352
By moving that curb cut down onto Middlesex, closing that on 9th Street, that's really going to help to alleviate any traffic concerns and help to improve circulation of people getting out onto 9th Street and into that intersection where they're not blocking that intersection.

665
01:04:51,372 --> 01:04:58,793
And then there will be a two-way exit outside of the building on 9th Street to the kind of the top right corner.

666
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:09,811
They'll be closing about 30 feet of an existing curb cut, shifting that over just slightly, it'd be a 24 foot wide curb cut there for vehicles to exit the building.

667
01:05:10,592 --> 01:05:23,720
And we're also proposing, just due to the condition of 9th Street, especially along our property's frontage, we're working with the property owners along 9th Street to mill and overlay that section of roadway.

668
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,941
We'd also do new stop sign and

669
01:05:28,977 --> 01:05:32,260
crosswalk striping at the intersection of 9th and Middlesex.

670
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:42,849
So we will be working with MassDOT for both Revere Beach Parkway and Middlesex as well as DCR for their approvals of these curb cuts and all of that is ongoing.

671
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:54,258
We've also met with city staff prior to our application being submitted, including the highway department and the city engineer to talk through this site plan, the circulation,

672
01:05:55,535 --> 01:06:06,547
Um, and we got a lot of good feedback from them and have been working, um, have addressed their comments and are working to address their comments as well as, um, comments made by, um, the others out there.

673
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:08,469
Go to the next slide.

674
01:06:12,025 --> 01:06:18,930
So grading and drainage on the site, everything is going to be kind of graded interior.

675
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:23,114
We'll be capturing stormwater through a number of LID measures.

676
01:06:23,154 --> 01:06:33,542
We'll be using subsurface infiltration systems as well as water quality in the form of the permeable pavers that were mentioned before at the bottom of the screen on the left side.

677
01:06:34,242 --> 01:06:42,927
those permeable pavers will capture and treat that water before introducing it back into the groundwater, something that's not happening right now.

678
01:06:43,047 --> 01:06:49,331
So overall, this will be a great improvement to ground water recharge.

679
01:06:51,192 --> 01:07:02,098
And then interior to the building is going to be that subsurface infiltration system, chambered tanks that will capture roof runoff as well as any overflow.

680
01:07:02,778 --> 01:07:05,800
put it back into the ground, increase groundwater recharge.

681
01:07:06,261 --> 01:07:10,324
We're capturing about an inch of runoff on all impervious surfaces.

682
01:07:11,144 --> 01:07:18,109
And then to the impervious surface, we're actually reducing impervious surface on the property by about 6,000 square feet.

683
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:26,095
So overall runoff on the site, we're actually going to be reducing in the range from about zero to three cubic feet per second.

684
01:07:26,156 --> 01:07:31,940
So reducing how much is going off to the abutters, going off to the streets.

685
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:36,429
and then obviously improved water quality.

686
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:46,594
So we're getting 90% TSS removal, total suspended solid removal through this stormwater management system and about 60% of phosphorus removal as well.

687
01:07:47,534 --> 01:07:54,057
The development will also have an operation and maintenance plan for the maintenance of the stormwater system and overall site maintenance.

688
01:07:55,398 --> 01:07:58,780
And then, you know, obviously the stormwater design has been

689
01:08:00,222 --> 01:08:05,904
has been designed and designed to comply with both local and state regulations.

690
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:15,448
There will be overflows that connect into the municipal system, but as I mentioned, it's an overall reduction in runoff and flow from the site.

691
01:08:17,128 --> 01:08:19,529
So we've also, as I mentioned, we met with the city engineer.

692
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:20,550
We've talked through this.

693
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:26,432
We do have an application for a stormwater permit to the city that's being reviewed right now.

694
01:08:28,033 --> 01:08:28,713
Go to the next slide.

695
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:41,274
Uh, just quickly on the utilities, um, all new utilities across the property on the utility services, we will be tapping into the existing mains that run along the property.

696
01:08:41,294 --> 01:08:49,222
Uh, what we've shown in blue, the light blue is the existing water mains, uh, you know, wrap around nine street, middle sex and Revere beach parkway.

697
01:08:49,903 --> 01:08:55,108
We'll have a new domestic service out to nine street, new, uh, fire protection service.

698
01:08:56,123 --> 01:09:01,604
hydrants that are also added, and then a backup fire service connection onto Middlesex.

699
01:09:02,224 --> 01:09:08,666
Gas service is a new connection underground, obviously, with a gas meter along the side of the wall.

700
01:09:09,226 --> 01:09:16,988
And we'll have a new sanitary sewer service that connects to the existing main that runs down Middlesex, Fells Parkway.

701
01:09:17,548 --> 01:09:25,550
For electric and telecommunications, that'll be an underground duct bank that runs along the eastern side, which is that purple line on the right side of the screen.

702
01:09:26,844 --> 01:09:35,913
I'll be a couple or two or three transformers along Revere Beach Parkway that is all screened by a impermeable fence.

703
01:09:36,914 --> 01:09:45,843
Then I'll run Duck Bank Underground all the way out to 9th Street where it'll connect through a riser to an existing utility pole out in the street right there.

704
01:09:47,443 --> 01:09:49,484
This is all included in our site plan review package.

705
01:09:49,524 --> 01:09:56,046
We have reviewed it with the city engineer, and I believe we're all set with these utility connections.

706
01:09:58,106 --> 01:10:07,770
I believe that is our last slide, so I'd be happy to open it up to town, city comments or any public comments or whatever your next step is.

707
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,050
I appreciate your time today.

708
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:12,225
Thank you, Matt.

709
01:10:12,725 --> 01:10:14,046
We appreciate the presentation as well.

710
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:23,432
Just for procedural matter, just for visibility for the public, we will open it up to the board for questions and comments to the applicants.

711
01:10:23,592 --> 01:10:25,533
Then we will open it for public comment.

712
01:10:26,293 --> 01:10:31,417
And then we will have board discussion after the public comment.

713
01:10:31,537 --> 01:10:34,498
So I will open it up for the board for any questions.

714
01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:36,840
I see Doug has his hand raised.

715
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:40,570
Yes, thank you to the chair.

716
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,252
First of all, I want to compliment the design overall.

717
01:10:44,312 --> 01:10:47,034
I think it's a really thoughtful design.

718
01:10:47,054 --> 01:10:53,798
I think it's very well organized, and I think the aesthetics are pretty strong.

719
01:10:54,058 --> 01:10:55,419
I think the organization is good.

720
01:10:55,539 --> 01:11:04,185
Obviously, the design of the building, I think, would be very different had the corner lot that's obviously not part of this project been available.

721
01:11:05,105 --> 01:11:06,426
But I think you've made a lot of good

722
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:20,085
moves here that will allow some interest with the light coming into the courtyard, activating that space, connecting it to the larger park across the street.

723
01:11:20,906 --> 01:11:22,087
So there's a lot of good moves here.

724
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:24,369
I do have a few questions.

725
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:31,977
If you could put up the elevation facing Revere Beach Parkway, I'd like to see that slide again.

726
01:11:34,407 --> 01:11:34,787
Certainly.

727
01:11:35,548 --> 01:11:36,048
Thank you, Doug.

728
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:38,410
I think Ryan's going to flip to that.

729
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:39,451
Sure.

730
01:11:40,572 --> 01:11:45,896
I think my concern is the blank CMU wall that is behind the building.

731
01:11:46,457 --> 01:11:52,162
You can't see it obviously on this perspective because the white box is there.

732
01:11:52,202 --> 01:12:00,208
But if you go to the slide before this one, I think, yes, it's that lower left blank wall.

733
01:12:02,648 --> 01:12:03,088
Sorry.

734
01:12:03,749 --> 01:12:05,129
Elevator.

735
01:12:05,249 --> 01:12:05,870
Right.

736
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:06,550
You're on mute.

737
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,372
Yeah, it's yeah.

738
01:12:10,672 --> 01:12:12,133
Large document, a little bit of a delay.

739
01:12:14,294 --> 01:12:20,657
So I know that why it was done, but I think it is my sincere hope.

740
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:26,142
that the building in that corner may not be here in 10 or 15 years.

741
01:12:26,202 --> 01:12:32,005
And I feel like that blank wall will not be well served if that building is gone.

742
01:12:32,025 --> 01:12:35,446
I feel like there's many spaces behind there.

743
01:12:35,466 --> 01:12:38,948
There's, I believe, a leasing office behind there.

744
01:12:39,728 --> 01:12:44,210
I figure there's an opportunity there, if not to put windows, at least articulation

745
01:12:47,773 --> 01:12:50,158
Like, it's not something left behind.

746
01:12:50,178 --> 01:12:52,623
I feel like that would be an important piece.

747
01:12:52,643 --> 01:12:58,654
You could look at so that someday, you know, when that if that building is gone, if that turns into a.

748
01:12:59,534 --> 01:13:02,195
a park or whatever, a green space.

749
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:14,420
There is a proposal from MassDOT to have a pedestrian bridge across Route 16, and that would land pretty much almost not exactly where that building is.

750
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:25,625
So there are possibilities here, and I feel like that's an opportunity to articulate that in the hopes that someday that wall will be more visible.

751
01:13:26,687 --> 01:13:28,587
That's one comment just there.

752
01:13:29,228 --> 01:13:31,368
The second comment I have, it's a big one.

753
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:32,908
This is a kind of a strange one.

754
01:13:32,948 --> 01:13:34,089
I'm going to put it out there anyway.

755
01:13:35,629 --> 01:13:41,410
You've parked far more cars in this design than you need to per zoning.

756
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:45,731
You're not the maximum, but you're nowhere near the minimum as well.

757
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:50,212
And I'd like to understand that better, why that is, if someone could address that.

758
01:13:54,713 --> 01:13:55,213
Maybe Peter?

759
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,231
Go ahead, Peter, sorry, you're unmuted.

760
01:13:59,711 --> 01:14:00,412
That's all right, Doug.

761
01:14:00,492 --> 01:14:01,632
Thanks very much for the question.

762
01:14:02,713 --> 01:14:07,116
Thoughtful comments, and the first one, let me just talk about that CMU wall.

763
01:14:08,017 --> 01:14:11,819
We agree, we don't know, and we don't control what the future is of that corner building.

764
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:20,105
Our understanding is that the existing tenant might be in a state of flux, but we have actually met with the existing user, who I understand has been there for 17 plus years.

765
01:14:21,046 --> 01:14:25,830
to actually engage, frankly, their artistic creative side.

766
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:34,999
And we've actually had a conversation with the existing tenant to have his team work with us on making that wall really into a piece of public art.

767
01:14:36,665 --> 01:14:38,386
something more exciting, something more vibrant.

768
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:57,931
Obviously, we'll continue working on that, but we agree with you, whether it's in collaboration with the existing tenant and use that's there, since it's really fronting also their use, or a future user or whomever, we 100% agree with you that that wall can be brought to life in a more interesting way.

769
01:14:59,472 --> 01:15:03,093
And so we've started that, but we don't have a conclusion to that conversation yet.

770
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:04,585
Appreciate that.

771
01:15:04,605 --> 01:15:04,905
Thank you.

772
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,926
What about the parking question?

773
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:08,527
Parking is a really interesting question.

774
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:18,590
So, look, you're talking to a firm that historically, if you go through the annals of our history of development, you'll see that we actually never over park.

775
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:26,433
As a matter of fact, most of our projects are very limited parking because of the proximity to public transportation.

776
01:15:27,253 --> 01:15:45,018
Here we carefully studied the adjacencies, we carefully studied all the existing housing supply, more specifically the housing supply that's been built in the last 10 to 15 years in the area to look at what their parking ratios were and what their, more importantly, what their utilization rates are.

777
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:53,125
And it led us to be close to a one-to-one, to be comfortable, to make sure that we had ample parking.

778
01:15:53,526 --> 01:16:04,816
But secondarily to that, and something that frankly became more reinforced as I began conversations with the neighbors, is the neighbors, understandably,

779
01:16:05,536 --> 01:16:11,562
especially on the 9th Street side, there's existing parking on that private way.

780
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:16,326
But frankly, they don't want more parking on that adjacent private way.

781
01:16:16,367 --> 01:16:18,849
And I agree with them and our team agrees with it.

782
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:25,235
So it was important to us to be able to, as we met with them, to be able to talk about the fact that we had ample, that

783
01:16:25,695 --> 01:16:34,462
we weren't going to displace existing on-street parking with new parking by residents in this building, so that was a real careful consideration.

784
01:16:34,922 --> 01:16:42,048
And ancillary to that, but not less important, I would say is that just this week we met

785
01:16:43,288 --> 01:16:48,550
with some of our 9th Street neighbors, and they talked again about snow.

786
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:58,253
And we all know in small side streets, snow and snow storms, if we ever have them again, are major inconveniences and really create some traffic headaches.

787
01:16:58,853 --> 01:17:04,655
And the ask was put to us whether or not we would be willing to allow neighbors during snow storms and other events

788
01:17:05,075 --> 01:17:16,701
To the extent there was excess parking in the garage to use that so that they wouldn't have to drive into other areas, commercial parking areas across etc to to get off street.

789
01:17:16,741 --> 01:17:18,962
So hear you on that.

790
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:21,604
We, I can't it's, it's, it's.

791
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:38,529
science and art combined, we feel comfortable with the number and especially feel comfortable with the number of the adjacency on 9th Street and our neighbors, which I think you folks know this is three of our neighbors are, I think, cumulatively 6,600 condominiums.

792
01:17:38,589 --> 01:17:42,430
So it's three significant sized condominiums.

793
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:44,431
So there is quite a density in the neighborhood.

794
01:17:44,471 --> 01:17:48,172
So we feel it's important to the neighborhood as well.

795
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:57,233
Let me follow up with that, Peter, that I'd like to see the metrics for those surrounding properties.

796
01:17:58,835 --> 01:18:03,939
My firm has designed several buildings within walking distance of Wellington T Station.

797
01:18:04,939 --> 01:18:09,383
In my experience, and they're older than yours, than some of the ones around here,

798
01:18:09,735 --> 01:18:12,076
but they're all over parked.

799
01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:25,183
They were designed for a certain number and some of them have 50 or 75 empty spaces in the garage right now, because Medford zoning back in the day was much more traditional.

800
01:18:26,003 --> 01:18:33,687
And I'm not saying 1.0 is wrong, but it is for something that is a 10 minute walk door to door.

801
01:18:34,659 --> 01:18:39,820
to a major transit station, not a bus station, but an Orange Line station, it feels high to me.

802
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:47,082
And you know better than anyone that every parking space you build, it costs, what, $35,000 more?

803
01:18:47,502 --> 01:18:50,262
Structured parking.

804
01:18:50,362 --> 01:18:59,044
I mean, I could see in a different environment, you could take out an entire floor of parking and this building would still function in my head.

805
01:18:59,684 --> 01:19:04,025
Now that may not be what you want to do, but that is what a lot of communities are doing.

806
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,216
Yeah, Doug, I appreciate it.

807
01:19:06,256 --> 01:19:10,379
So let us, we will, I've written down, we'll follow up with that data so that you folks have it.

808
01:19:10,419 --> 01:19:17,323
We really have been talking with the property adjacency, property management teams, who are the ones that really deal with the daily utilization.

809
01:19:17,663 --> 01:19:19,344
So we'll follow up with that information.

810
01:19:19,364 --> 01:19:20,105
And you're correct.

811
01:19:20,145 --> 01:19:21,386
Look, parking is a

812
01:19:22,226 --> 01:19:23,227
is a cost, right?

813
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:24,668
It's not a revenue source.

814
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:30,411
And the money that a tenant pays for parking does not nearly cover the expense of parking.

815
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:36,195
And as you full know, because you're so experienced in this, parking is a significant cost.

816
01:19:36,215 --> 01:19:45,081
And if we can comfortably do less and feel as though we're meeting the needs of the project and our neighborhood, we certainly look for those opportunities.

817
01:19:45,101 --> 01:19:46,782
So we'll definitely follow up on that point.

818
01:19:47,188 --> 01:19:50,109
Yeah, I respect the neighbors, obviously their desire for that.

819
01:19:50,189 --> 01:19:51,390
I appreciate that a lot.

820
01:19:51,450 --> 01:20:01,834
I just think there's a study by the MAPC that did 200 properties in greater Boston outside the city, and they were on average over parked by 30%.

821
01:20:03,434 --> 01:20:05,855
And I just want this to be looked at closely.

822
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:07,696
I want this building to work.

823
01:20:09,036 --> 01:20:11,757
There are compromises, I think.

824
01:20:11,777 --> 01:20:14,298
So I do appreciate your wanting to look at that.

825
01:20:14,778 --> 01:20:15,599
That's all my questions.

826
01:20:15,639 --> 01:20:15,939
Thank you.

827
01:20:17,264 --> 01:20:19,286
All right, thanks, Doug.

828
01:20:21,367 --> 01:20:23,349
I will now call on Dina.

829
01:20:23,369 --> 01:20:25,130
I think she's got her hand raised.

830
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:31,355
Yeah, I want to thank you for a very thoughtful design.

831
01:20:31,455 --> 01:20:37,600
And I think it really takes into consideration a lot of the community needs and concerns.

832
01:20:38,643 --> 01:20:47,509
One of the things I was looking at in particular was there was a traffic study done between the Cappies traffic and what this type of traffic is going to be.

833
01:20:47,549 --> 01:20:53,513
And it's a little apples and oranges, because Cappies, you went in, and you bought something, and then you left.

834
01:20:53,553 --> 01:20:54,874
But these are residential, right?

835
01:20:55,354 --> 01:21:01,598
So I see that you put in walk sheds and walkways to Wellington Station.

836
01:21:01,618 --> 01:21:02,939
And I think that's a wonderful idea.

837
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:07,822
I remember walking in that area and having to go walk down the hill to get to the train station.

838
01:21:08,342 --> 01:21:18,766
So that's great, and that will assist in many of the safety concerns as residents from the facility travel from their homes into the transit.

839
01:21:19,506 --> 01:21:32,030
But what about residents that would travel to, let's say, the station landing, which has multiple restaurants and has stores, and also the Wellington Plaza area?

840
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:43,717
I think you're going to see an increase in foot traffic to the facilities rather than to the building and to the Wellington area, as well as Wellington Plaza, Stop and Shop, Aldi's.

841
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:47,200
There's all those types of stores that are there.

842
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,021
So if I lived there, I would see myself walking to those.

843
01:21:50,522 --> 01:21:55,365
And I know the area is notorious, for instance, with pedestrian traffic.

844
01:21:55,845 --> 01:21:58,287
So what are the considerations that were

845
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:05,086
that are taking place or being considered to prevent pedestrian accidents, let's say.

846
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:06,129
Thank you.

847
01:22:08,393 --> 01:22:10,814
Ryan, would you, Dina, thanks very much for that.

848
01:22:10,854 --> 01:22:12,495
Ryan, do you mind just going to the site plan?

849
01:22:12,515 --> 01:22:17,677
Because I think that's going to be a helpful tool to navigate this.

850
01:22:18,057 --> 01:22:22,759
And again, I'm very careful not to take credit for good ideas of the design team.

851
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:30,041
We're fortunate to have a team that is thinking about things that perhaps I may not be thinking about here.

852
01:22:32,482 --> 01:22:37,767
I think the slides are a little slow getting to the site plan, but a couple of things that we did here.

853
01:22:38,347 --> 01:22:51,479
So, 1st of all, obviously, the jurisdiction of and obviously, the ability for the city of Medford and us to decide to do some upgrades here is obviously inhibited by making sure that they're comfortable with them.

854
01:22:51,999 --> 01:22:57,024
There was a reconfiguration of this intersection a number of years ago to make some improvements.

855
01:22:57,624 --> 01:23:02,108
In terms of our project, in terms of things that we were looking at are the follows.

856
01:23:02,348 --> 01:23:03,950
You'll notice that there's two lobbies.

857
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:09,434
There's one facing a Middlesex and there's a smaller lobby faced on the rear beach parkway.

858
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:16,641
That was done, frankly, just to acknowledge human behavior and to frankly promote the behavior of the pedestrian behavior.

859
01:23:16,661 --> 01:23:16,821
Right.

860
01:23:16,861 --> 01:23:21,365
So we make sure that when people are coming from Wellington Station, they are safely

861
01:23:21,825 --> 01:23:32,188
Um, finding their way, they will, they will have crossed reach Parkway well up towards the station, the overpass, and they'll have made that connection there.

862
01:23:32,228 --> 01:23:36,789
But instead of having them walk around our building, we're, we're getting them into the building as quickly as possible.

863
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:39,850
Secondarily, you know.

864
01:23:41,028 --> 01:23:51,252
We think the removal of the curb cut on the existing curb cut on 9th Street, which is in close, very close proximity to Middlesex, it would never have gotten approved in today's standards.

865
01:23:52,172 --> 01:23:57,554
By eliminating that curb cut, I think we are removing what has been a contributor.

866
01:23:57,614 --> 01:24:02,656
There still are existing issues and there will be continuing issues, but a contributor to traffic concerns.

867
01:24:03,376 --> 01:24:08,921
Um, there, um, thirdly, we really separated, um, our vehicular trips.

868
01:24:08,981 --> 01:24:18,068
We've separated those of residents who are coming and going, and we've done so, I think, um, thoughtfully, both on the rear parkway, excuse me, and on 9th.

869
01:24:18,628 --> 01:24:23,050
But probably most importantly, is kind of the evolution of design over the last decade.

870
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:32,933
Two things that didn't exist a decade ago that exist now in buildings is making sure you're addressing the drop-off area, the reality of Lyft and Uber.

871
01:24:33,073 --> 01:24:36,895
For some people, it's still a novelty, but for the younger generations, it is a fact of life.

872
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:45,563
point earlier, one of the reasons less parking may be needed is because there's increased reliance on ride shares.

873
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:49,167
And so we have that exclusively off of Middlesex.

874
01:24:49,187 --> 01:24:57,477
And so we don't mix the resident traffic, if you will, with the ride share traffic, and that can be voluminous.

875
01:24:57,537 --> 01:24:59,319
And so we've created a dedicated space for that.

876
01:24:59,799 --> 01:25:02,601
That space is also available for Amazon.

877
01:25:02,661 --> 01:25:06,904
That's the second thing that is in existence in buildings now that didn't exist 10 years ago.

878
01:25:06,964 --> 01:25:15,591
And I'm sure Doug can attribute really large package rooms to accommodate the inordinate amount of drop-offs there.

879
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:17,672
So there's these.

880
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:26,400
small but I think important interventions to make sure that we are segregating kind of the activity appropriately here.

881
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:36,288
And then last but not least, making sure that our entryways are lined up and we're facilitating access to the safe crossing points on Middlesex, the safe crossing points

882
01:25:36,828 --> 01:25:37,769
on Revere Beach Parkway.

883
01:25:37,869 --> 01:25:39,670
We will say and we wouldn't say otherwise.

884
01:25:40,471 --> 01:26:01,147
Crossing Revere Beach Parkway takes time, it takes patience, and so I don't want to diminish the importance of it, but it's certainly, we agree with you that it's an amenity for the neighbourhood, so we're going to want to promote that use, and I think people, frankly, that are going to come live here are going to want the pedestrian environment as one of the reasons that they are moving here.

885
01:26:02,308 --> 01:26:02,608
Thank you.

886
01:26:04,529 --> 01:26:05,050
Thanks, Peter.

887
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:11,884
I actually had a similar question, but I do feel like I would like to underscore at that point.

888
01:26:12,004 --> 01:26:14,926
I think I've lived in many cities.

889
01:26:15,066 --> 01:26:22,231
This intersection in particular is probably the most egregious anxiety and producing intersection I've ever encountered.

890
01:26:24,007 --> 01:26:37,132
I realize the difficulty with the state ownership, but I do think if Medford is going to push density in the area, it seriously needs to consider how to make this pedestrian friendly.

891
01:26:37,152 --> 01:26:43,374
I think to Dina's point, if I lived in this building, I would want to just walk over to station landing.

892
01:26:43,934 --> 01:26:49,496
I would actually probably drive instead of walk because I just feel so unsafe with this intersection.

893
01:26:51,843 --> 01:27:02,929
I appreciate the consideration and I understand the constraints that, you know, one building cannot sort of solve the broader transit problem.

894
01:27:03,369 --> 01:27:10,173
Mr. Chair, if I can, I just want to and you folks probably know this better than I just to remind people that there is a plan out there that

895
01:27:10,733 --> 01:27:21,337
has been out there for a bit now, and I don't believe there's funding in place for a pedestrian kind of bridge to try and address some of the significance that was put forth.

896
01:27:21,377 --> 01:27:27,079
I think by MassDOT, I believe Danielle and Alicia might be able to shed a little bit more color.

897
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:27,799
I apologize.

898
01:27:28,539 --> 01:27:38,843
I just don't have it in front of me here, but I do know that there is a plan, but I'm not aware that there's any funding in place or realistic timeline for it.

899
01:27:40,579 --> 01:27:40,959
Thank you.

900
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,263
I see one remaining question from the board.

901
01:27:45,703 --> 01:27:50,908
So I will open it up for John to provide any comments or questions, or I guess also Sean.

902
01:27:51,028 --> 01:27:52,289
So there's two other board members.

903
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:54,651
Thank you.

904
01:27:54,671 --> 01:27:59,015
I have a question about the affordable housing component.

905
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:05,581
I understand if I understand you correctly, there'd be 38 affordable units.

906
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:14,378
And of those eight would be the, um, deeply affordable.

907
01:28:14,578 --> 01:28:15,278
Is that correct?

908
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,100
That is, that is correct.

909
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,962
As part of the height density, um, 20% of the 15% affordable.

910
01:28:20,982 --> 01:28:23,163
So 20% of the 38 will be at the lower AMI levels of 65%.

911
01:28:23,243 --> 01:28:23,443
Okay.

912
01:28:23,703 --> 01:28:25,124
Now how will those be distributed?

913
01:28:25,144 --> 01:28:25,845
I mean, you have mostly,

914
01:28:35,553 --> 01:28:56,328
one bedroom and studios and a much smaller number of two bedrooms and three bedrooms, will, for example, one or two of those multiple bedroom units be affordable or deeply affordable?

915
01:28:56,388 --> 01:28:56,928
Great question.

916
01:28:57,449 --> 01:29:03,513
I will admit I haven't gone through the process with the City of Medford, but I assume City of Medford goes through the lip process.

917
01:29:04,634 --> 01:29:19,754
And it works with the state, but whether it's local or with the state, there's a careful review by the public stakeholders to make sure that the allocation of affordable units are evenly distributed, both geographically, meaning across the building and different floors, different parts of the buildings.

918
01:29:20,715 --> 01:29:28,163
And in unit types to make sure that the affordable units aren't all put into dark corners in small units, for example.

919
01:29:28,223 --> 01:29:36,852
So if we have 30% one bedroom units, 30% of the affordable units would be one bedroom units as close as possible.

920
01:29:37,733 --> 01:29:47,642
we will have to submit to the city and as the state, if they do the lip process, a proposal as to what units would be designated as affordable.

921
01:29:48,142 --> 01:29:57,410
And what they look for is really equity, making sure that we evenly distributed throughout the building, high, low, different types of units and unit types.

922
01:29:57,430 --> 01:30:05,037
So I have every reason to believe that would include the lower affordable, or sorry, the more affordable units versus the standard affordable units.

923
01:30:05,917 --> 01:30:22,541
And I'll just add that in order to comply with your zoning bylaw, it in fact expressly requires that the affordable units be evenly distributed throughout the building and that they be provided with the same finishes that are provided in the market rate units.

924
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:29,983
So they will ultimately effectively be indistinguishable from the market rate units, unless they happen to review the contracts with the city.

925
01:30:31,339 --> 01:30:41,661
And the local, the Medford state public stakeholder in this process would be which group, which board, which individual.

926
01:30:44,834 --> 01:30:48,137
I mean, who would be reviewing this plan locally?

927
01:30:48,197 --> 01:30:54,183
To Valerie, maybe Danielle, or to Alicia, I just haven't gone through it with the city of Medford.

928
01:30:54,303 --> 01:31:00,869
Different cities use the state for it, but Medford may have its own process for reviewing these.

929
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:07,676
I'll call on Danielle, who probably has thoughts or understanding of the process.

930
01:31:08,435 --> 01:31:31,370
Yes, so we do get these on the subsidized housing inventory, which involves going through the local initiative program to have these units listed as local action units, meaning that they weren't produced by a 40B comprehensive permit or some other subsidized program or agency.

931
01:31:33,271 --> 01:31:37,393
So the housing planner will look at the initial

932
01:31:40,069 --> 01:31:46,773
Placement of the units to make sure they are evenly distributed and that also it's the same ratio of the bedrooms.

933
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:55,217
You know, oftentimes we'll ask them to move some of the units to get a better distribution.

934
01:31:55,237 --> 01:31:56,678
I should add that.

935
01:31:57,718 --> 01:32:00,780
Generally, they're floating units meeting, so they start off.

936
01:32:01,741 --> 01:32:04,622
All distributed, but with turnover.

937
01:32:06,603 --> 01:32:09,745
They could move because you have to have all of those units.

938
01:32:10,502 --> 01:32:14,846
occupied by eligible tenants.

939
01:32:15,587 --> 01:32:20,191
And there are provisions where if they go over income, that you don't kick them out of the unit.

940
01:32:20,511 --> 01:32:21,372
They can stay there.

941
01:32:21,472 --> 01:32:31,481
It just reverts to market rate, at which point another available comparable unit needs to be designated as one of the inclusionary units.

942
01:32:32,022 --> 01:32:35,385
So we do monitor all of our

943
01:32:38,035 --> 01:32:50,402
You know, rental developments that have inclusionary units to kind of make sure that things aren't migrating to, you know, less desirable corners of building are all being kind of clustered.

944
01:32:50,822 --> 01:32:54,444
So that is something that we do yearly.

945
01:32:54,504 --> 01:32:54,704
So.

946
01:32:56,125 --> 01:33:00,207
But I guess my question is for the applicant, did you intended for these to be floating not fixed?

947
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:01,180
Right?

948
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,981
Yeah, so we've done it both ways.

949
01:33:04,281 --> 01:33:06,642
And cities tend to have a preference of how to do it.

950
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:08,883
So the floating makes sense to us.

951
01:33:08,923 --> 01:33:13,265
It doesn't change for us, since all the finishes are the same in the units and et cetera.

952
01:33:13,705 --> 01:33:17,786
It doesn't really change any reality for the utilization of the building.

953
01:33:18,907 --> 01:33:22,008
So we're happy to do what the city's comfortable with.

954
01:33:24,409 --> 01:33:26,329
Sounds like quite a process.

955
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:33,736
Now, in terms of, for example, the three bedrooms, do you usually round up?

956
01:33:33,936 --> 01:33:42,618
I mean, by the time you take 15% and then the percentage of them that's super affordable, you're going to wind up with less than one.

957
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:45,499
Right?

958
01:33:47,099 --> 01:33:51,100
The bylaw does require us to round up for a fractional.

959
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:51,901
OK.

960
01:33:52,581 --> 01:33:52,901
OK.

961
01:33:54,381 --> 01:33:57,862
I want to go on to parking and traffic, if I may.

962
01:33:59,435 --> 01:34:17,625
I appreciate that you've looked at other condominiums in the area to determine your parking needs because for reasons that people have talked about, you can imagine that a number of people live in those buildings for whatever reason don't want to walk over the orange line.

963
01:34:17,645 --> 01:34:18,565
That leads me to believe that

964
01:34:25,007 --> 01:34:29,708
a large number of the people who live in those other condos use their cars to drive to work.

965
01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:52,694
What I'm wondering is, with the 247 parking spaces, even let's say only 220 of them were used, if your calculations are correct, for your morning traffic, you're showing how many departures?

966
01:34:52,734 --> 01:34:53,195
Was it 50 or 75?

967
01:34:57,327 --> 01:34:59,911
I'm going to defer, if okay, to you.

968
01:34:59,931 --> 01:35:04,358
I defer to Rebecca Brown, who's our traffic consultant.

969
01:35:04,418 --> 01:35:04,698
Okay.

970
01:35:04,778 --> 01:35:05,920
I don't want to misstate anything.

971
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,761
Oh, sure.

972
01:35:06,802 --> 01:35:07,563
I appreciate that.

973
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:31,127
So, we did not take a look at other parking facilities that are in the surrounding area, but what we did do was we looked at or Institute of transportation engineers what their parking demand generation rates were for.

974
01:35:33,268 --> 01:35:38,549
residential developments that are located in close proximity to rapid rail services.

975
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:43,530
What they estimated was that the peak parking demand would be about 197 parking spaces.

976
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:51,032
ITE recommends that your parking demand during the peak time not exceed 90 percent of your parking supply.

977
01:35:58,874 --> 01:36:09,241
And the reason for that is to avoid illegal parking or excessive recirculation of vehicles looking for those empty parking spaces within a lot.

978
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:14,344
So what ITE would recommend that we have is essentially 219 parking spaces.

979
01:36:14,404 --> 01:36:15,945
So the 247 that are proposed

980
01:36:23,029 --> 01:36:26,331
does meet that recommendation from ITE.

981
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:38,858
Then to go along with what Peter had said earlier, it does provide some additional parking to ensure that if people have visitors, there's parking available for them.

982
01:36:38,898 --> 01:36:50,844
They're not parking out on the street and taking up that valuable parking that is used along Ninth Street by many of the neighbors, as well as for some of that snow parking.

983
01:36:51,684 --> 01:36:57,529
um, that can be used by the area residents when they need to get off the streets, uh, during snowstorms.

984
01:36:58,650 --> 01:36:58,910
Okay.

985
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,031
That makes a lot of sense.

986
01:37:00,711 --> 01:37:20,467
I'm trying to figure out how that meshes with the predicted number of, uh, rush hour, early morning rush hour departures, which you use to, to, uh, estimate the impact on traffic in the area.

987
01:37:22,373 --> 01:37:23,574
Do you understand my question?

988
01:37:25,074 --> 01:37:33,117
Yeah, John, did you have, or maybe TransOM can provide the slide, but I believe there was a quoted number of people leaving.

989
01:37:33,337 --> 01:37:35,498
Yeah, I think it was 50, maybe it was 75.

990
01:37:38,315 --> 01:37:42,979
I think Rebecca, I think Rebecca inadvertently muted herself again, so she just needs permission to unmute.

991
01:37:45,081 --> 01:37:47,163
Yep, sorry, I was muted again.

992
01:37:47,183 --> 01:37:51,628
I'll make sure I don't mute myself again, so that way that won't keep happening.

993
01:37:52,849 --> 01:37:55,531
Yes, so if you want to go to, it's slide number 25.

994
01:37:56,512 --> 01:38:01,593
in our slide deck shows what the projected morning and afternoon trips are.

995
01:38:01,713 --> 01:38:07,295
So in the morning, we are anticipating about 50 trips that would be exiting.

996
01:38:07,855 --> 01:38:11,336
And that's really just during the peak one-hour time period.

997
01:38:11,796 --> 01:38:15,677
Now obviously, not everyone leaves within a one-hour time period.

998
01:38:18,298 --> 01:38:26,403
The morning peak generally ranges from about six o'clock in the morning till nine o'clock in the morning, at which point people will come and go throughout.

999
01:38:26,643 --> 01:38:36,770
Then there's some people that don't work your typical eight to five jobs that will be living here, so they won't leave during that morning time period.

1000
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:44,054
The numbers that we're showing here are pretty consistent with what you would anticipate, but based on the parking demand.

1001
01:38:44,074 --> 01:38:45,896
Okay.

1002
01:38:48,074 --> 01:38:51,556
One other question or perhaps an observation.

1003
01:38:52,216 --> 01:38:57,698
I noticed the entrance and exit onto Revere Beach Parkway.

1004
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:08,463
It's a right-hand turn from that rightmost lane as you head towards the turn for Middlesex Avenue.

1005
01:39:10,887 --> 01:39:22,612
And I use that lane a lot myself because sometimes I'm coming, I'm headed west and I usually go up either Middlesex or the Felsway there.

1006
01:39:23,772 --> 01:39:36,077
And people tend to zip along in that right lane because when the traffic gets backed up for the straight ahead, oftentimes that lane is quite open and people zoop along there.

1007
01:39:36,858 --> 01:39:44,125
And I'm wondering if we should have any concerns about, you know, once a minute, somebody is trying to pull out of the site.

1008
01:39:45,267 --> 01:39:45,507
Sure.

1009
01:39:46,177 --> 01:39:49,340
Yeah, and that won't be the only egress point for people.

1010
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:59,748
So we expect people who want to head out towards the Felsway and Middlesex Avenue to the north, they may very well likely come out that driveway.

1011
01:39:59,868 --> 01:40:07,233
Some people who want to head kind of straight through to the west on Revere Beach Parkway will likely come out that driveway.

1012
01:40:07,814 --> 01:40:11,577
But for those people who want to be taking the left,

1013
01:40:13,998 --> 01:40:32,203
Those people are probably more likely to come out onto 9th Street and make the loop around to Brainerd Avenue and back at Revere Beach Parkway so that they can come out and join sort of at the back of the queue to get across all of those lanes to be able to take that left-hand turn.

1014
01:40:32,223 --> 01:40:33,383
Otherwise, it's a little bit more difficult.

1015
01:40:33,984 --> 01:40:44,855
several lanes that they're trying to cross plus that, as you described it, that zip lane or that channelized right turn lane that heads towards Middlesex Avenue and Fells Way.

1016
01:40:44,875 --> 01:40:47,658
Okay.

1017
01:40:47,698 --> 01:40:51,042
Now, how did the 9th Street residents feel about this?

1018
01:40:53,511 --> 01:41:01,158
So I think that's a good question for the 9th Street residents probably to answer and I think several of them are here tonight that I've begun conversations with.

1019
01:41:01,958 --> 01:41:10,106
But let me kind of share how I feel about it based on the conversations with our design team, but really with the conversations with the 9th Street residents.

1020
01:41:11,787 --> 01:41:23,892
Look, they've had a long simmering issue with, not because of this property, just because of 9th Street being a pass-through street a few years ago.

1021
01:41:24,933 --> 01:41:25,213
Thanks.

1022
01:41:25,493 --> 01:41:28,794
And again, I'm sharing information that the neighbors have shared with me.

1023
01:41:28,834 --> 01:41:34,837
A few years ago, coming off of Revere Beach Parkway, MassDOT did a right-hand turn lane onto Brainerd Avenue.

1024
01:41:38,193 --> 01:41:43,659
I don't know if we have a slide that shows that better, but Ryan, perhaps we do a right hand turn on to Brainerd Avenue.

1025
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:54,512
And what that would do is allow people to that wanted to take a right hand turn at the intersection to avoid the intersection altogether avoid traffic altogether.

1026
01:41:55,132 --> 01:41:59,096
and go on Brainerd Avenue and then left onto 9th Street.

1027
01:41:59,176 --> 01:42:00,537
So it's a real pass-through.

1028
01:42:00,577 --> 01:42:02,579
That problem exists today and exacerbates.

1029
01:42:02,619 --> 01:42:04,180
In the morning, traffic is backed up.

1030
01:42:05,421 --> 01:42:07,703
So it's a significant concern, and it's a narrow street.

1031
01:42:10,085 --> 01:42:17,831
So in our conversations internally, we feel as though we need to balance the access and egress from the site.

1032
01:42:18,551 --> 01:42:26,657
And one, for the reasons that you just articulated, Revere Beach Parkway alone isn't the right site to put 100% of that.

1033
01:42:27,018 --> 01:42:32,702
And so I think that it's really important to have the multiple access points to the garage.

1034
01:42:32,842 --> 01:42:35,524
Secondarily, we really think it's important to separate

1035
01:42:35,884 --> 01:42:38,648
The ride share into delivery vehicles, just because of the chaos.

1036
01:42:38,788 --> 01:42:45,356
I think we all intuitively know if we haven't experienced ourselves happens in that situation.

1037
01:42:46,698 --> 01:42:48,000
The last thing I'll say is we're.

1038
01:42:50,271 --> 01:43:10,769
We're, we're, we're now a stakeholder in the conversation about ninth street as as one of the butters and one of the, you know, many owners of ninth street, it being a private way and so I hope and again I want to give space for the neighbors to really express their concerns, their ideas, but we're in the midst of a conversation which is complicated because there's lots of different

1039
01:43:11,389 --> 01:43:28,372
owners, if you will, of 9th Street about things we can do that are traffic calming measures that will deter that pass-through from Brainerd and 9th Street, that will slow traffic, make it more inconvenient such that people aren't going to want to take that turn.

1040
01:43:29,313 --> 01:43:35,994
And secondarily, they're asking us to consider things like not allowing our tenants and guests to park on 9th Street.

1041
01:43:36,554 --> 01:43:38,996
to allow snow parking in the garage.

1042
01:43:40,157 --> 01:43:45,761
And frankly, to contribute to these traffic common things that we're talking about here.

1043
01:43:45,801 --> 01:43:52,285
And I feel like every one of those things that they're asking of us are really fair and reasonable things.

1044
01:43:52,586 --> 01:43:59,170
As a major property owner in the neighborhood, things that we should continue the conversations, we're going to continue that conversation.

1045
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:01,412
It's complicated just because there's so many parties involved.

1046
01:44:02,434 --> 01:44:07,645
And so, therefore, we need to make sure we're including all the parties in that conversation.

1047
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:10,922
Um, but I think we've had a productive start.

1048
01:44:11,442 --> 01:44:16,085
Um, but look at we still have, um, this project or not.

1049
01:44:16,105 --> 01:44:21,348
This project 9th Street is an issue that seems to have been long and brewing that needs a resolution.

1050
01:44:21,408 --> 01:44:28,633
And I frankly hope that one of the things that comes out of this is that we can be an impetus to help kind of bring that conversation to fruition.

1051
01:44:28,653 --> 01:44:35,778
Um, and and help with the resources as well to do these things to change the reality that has been in this.

1052
01:44:36,658 --> 01:44:40,361
small side street as in many small side streets in Medford.

1053
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:43,903
Thanks, Peter.

1054
01:44:44,104 --> 01:44:50,168
Just so that I can piece it together from the visual, the entry and exit from the parking garage is on 9th Street.

1055
01:44:50,308 --> 01:44:53,591
And then is there a second one on Revere Parkway?

1056
01:44:54,832 --> 01:45:00,676
And then the Uber lift is from the Felsway.

1057
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:01,637
OK.

1058
01:45:01,757 --> 01:45:02,597
It's on Middlesex.

1059
01:45:03,138 --> 01:45:03,358
Yep.

1060
01:45:03,498 --> 01:45:03,738
Correct.

1061
01:45:03,838 --> 01:45:04,058
OK.

1062
01:45:04,439 --> 01:45:04,639
Great.

1063
01:45:04,659 --> 01:45:04,799
Yeah.

1064
01:45:06,112 --> 01:45:07,053
Thank you.

1065
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:16,720
The other thing before I forget, I do want to, and I know we're going to get to public comment, I do want to invite, I think Daniel and Alicia have it, but I would, we've sent out a lot of letters.

1066
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:21,364
We've met with a lot of people over the last couple of months and more than once with many.

1067
01:45:22,185 --> 01:45:27,949
I do want to welcome you to put my contact information, my email into the chat for people.

1068
01:45:28,189 --> 01:45:34,514
And to the extent I haven't talked with people and people do have questions that they may not get fully answered tonight, I welcome it.

1069
01:45:35,775 --> 01:45:41,257
If staff's comfortable doing it, putting my email in the chat is perfectly acceptable and I look forward to people reaching out.

1070
01:45:43,258 --> 01:45:54,062
Just to make sure I understand, if I were coming, if I were eastbound on Revere Beach Parkway, wanting to enter the building, what would my choices be?

1071
01:45:57,388 --> 01:46:07,621
So if you're eastbound coming on Revere Beaks Parkway, you're going to be most likely finding your way towards the 9th Street entrance.

1072
01:46:09,244 --> 01:46:13,870
Rebecca, do you want to kind of go through the circulation and just articulate it better than I'm going to do directionally and otherwise?

1073
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:20,727
she may be muted again.

1074
01:46:21,048 --> 01:46:30,459
I just yeah actually if you can go back to the traffic slide you can kind of see the intersection to see where people would go it's slide 25 there.

1075
01:46:32,021 --> 01:46:39,670
So if you're coming along Revere Beach Parkway headed eastbound you can see that there's kind of those two left turn lanes

1076
01:46:40,290 --> 01:46:43,673
that cross over and up to Middlesex and Felsway.

1077
01:46:44,293 --> 01:46:52,559
You would take those two lanes and come in to Ninth Street in that back access way into the parking garage.

1078
01:46:55,221 --> 01:46:55,641
Okay.

1079
01:46:56,421 --> 01:46:56,882
Thank you.

1080
01:46:58,363 --> 01:47:02,065
My last question is about what you folks call the walk shed.

1081
01:47:04,147 --> 01:47:05,908
I just want to make sure I've got this straight.

1082
01:47:05,928 --> 01:47:08,810
The two ways you would go from the site

1083
01:47:09,955 --> 01:47:15,759
to the T Station, one would be to take that crosswalk that we've talked about.

1084
01:47:17,561 --> 01:47:21,444
Well, I don't know how dangerous it is, but it certainly feels dangerous.

1085
01:47:23,645 --> 01:47:30,070
The other would be to stay on the north side of Revere Beach Parkway, go across the railroad bridge,

1086
01:47:31,178 --> 01:47:37,020
then you go down a flight of steps and there's a narrow sidewalk in that tunnel.

1087
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:39,841
Is that the alternate path?

1088
01:47:42,462 --> 01:47:44,003
Yeah, that's correct.

1089
01:47:44,743 --> 01:47:45,984
You've described it correctly.

1090
01:47:46,844 --> 01:47:48,084
Okay.

1091
01:47:49,665 --> 01:47:50,525
That's it for me.

1092
01:47:50,926 --> 01:47:51,746
Thank you very much.

1093
01:47:52,386 --> 01:47:52,746
Thank you.

1094
01:47:54,727 --> 01:47:55,587
Thank you.

1095
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:59,949
I think Sean is the last member from the board of the San Andreas, so we'll pass it to Sean.

1096
01:48:00,709 --> 01:48:01,169
Thank you.

1097
01:48:01,790 --> 01:48:09,213
Just a couple questions in regards to the mill work and overlay on 9th Street.

1098
01:48:09,373 --> 01:48:14,856
Are you proposing to do just the section that encompasses runs along your property?

1099
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,918
Are you talking about the entire length of 9th Street?

1100
01:48:20,156 --> 01:48:25,639
We're talking about the portion that was identified in the presentation adjacent to our property.

1101
01:48:26,019 --> 01:48:28,981
And that's really only because that portion hasn't been done a few years back.

1102
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:29,762
It's my understanding.

1103
01:48:29,782 --> 01:48:35,466
If you go down the street today, you'll see there's a marked difference between the condition of the two.

1104
01:48:35,786 --> 01:48:39,909
There was, I guess, a water main break a number of years ago, a couple of years ago.

1105
01:48:39,969 --> 01:48:44,472
And so the rest of the ninth street was milled and overlaid just a couple of years ago.

1106
01:48:44,512 --> 01:48:47,874
So it's in much better condition than the portion which we would be milling and overlaying.

1107
01:48:48,762 --> 01:48:54,078
Okay, and in regards to the development incentive bonuses.

1108
01:48:55,013 --> 01:49:00,037
Could you speak to how you came to choose the bonuses that you chose?

1109
01:49:00,757 --> 01:49:12,206
I for one was hoping that on our first project under this ordinance that we maybe see a deeper, a more and deeper affordable housing units.

1110
01:49:12,687 --> 01:49:14,528
That's a huge issue in Medford.

1111
01:49:14,628 --> 01:49:21,673
One of the biggest talking points I think in the city is the issue of affordable housing.

1112
01:49:22,734 --> 01:49:23,715
And I'm wondering if you would,

1113
01:49:24,668 --> 01:49:35,835
maybe discuss how you arrived at the incentive bonuses you chose and whether you'd consider increasing the, going to the 30% on the 65% AMI units.

1114
01:49:41,523 --> 01:49:42,444
Yeah, thanks for the question.

1115
01:49:43,064 --> 01:49:48,307
Not an easy decision, but one that was made based on a couple of considerations.

1116
01:49:49,808 --> 01:49:52,590
Number one, we care deeply as well about the affordability.

1117
01:49:52,730 --> 01:49:58,554
We actually, again, in our background, we do a tremendous amount of pure affordable.

1118
01:49:59,354 --> 01:49:59,715
housing.

1119
01:49:59,775 --> 01:50:01,376
So we also do market rate.

1120
01:50:02,076 --> 01:50:03,397
So we care deeply about it as well.

1121
01:50:04,178 --> 01:50:11,122
There are certain financial realities about the cost and the cost structures that go with it.

1122
01:50:11,182 --> 01:50:18,607
So I would not be genuine if I didn't acknowledge just the financial realities of increasing those.

1123
01:50:18,747 --> 01:50:22,910
We felt, frankly, the city of Medford did a really good job with structuring its bonuses.

1124
01:50:23,470 --> 01:50:27,331
in that, number one, you start at a higher percentage than most communities.

1125
01:50:27,351 --> 01:50:30,192
Yes, Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, you're on par.

1126
01:50:31,072 --> 01:50:33,333
Cambridge is obviously on its own.

1127
01:50:33,473 --> 01:50:41,555
But beyond that, 15% is a very significant percentage and something that the city, I'm sure, is proud of.

1128
01:50:41,895 --> 01:50:47,437
That increased affordability is also an expensive thing that projects have to do.

1129
01:50:47,637 --> 01:50:49,578
But candidly, we think it's a really important one.

1130
01:50:49,618 --> 01:50:54,260
So I share with you the import of that increased affordability.

1131
01:50:54,900 --> 01:51:02,003
When you look at the numbers and you look at what levels and what income levels that gets to, that really starts getting to the heart of the problem.

1132
01:51:03,183 --> 01:51:04,824
So financial realities.

1133
01:51:04,884 --> 01:51:09,106
And secondarily, we feel passionately about the sustainability elements here.

1134
01:51:10,347 --> 01:51:27,106
It is a significant cost as well, and so I think as though we're putting money to work in two good ways here, as opposed to putting maybe more in one bucket as opposed to another, by balancing the sustainability and doing lead platinum.

1135
01:51:27,967 --> 01:51:28,768
which is significant.

1136
01:51:29,268 --> 01:51:37,411
There are very few LEED Platinum buildings, residential buildings in the Commonwealth still, and also doing the increased affordability.

1137
01:51:37,451 --> 01:51:41,333
So understand that people could come to different ideas about it.

1138
01:51:41,553 --> 01:51:47,536
It's not an easy discussion, but it feels like the right balance for us, just given some of the realities.

1139
01:51:49,156 --> 01:51:49,497
Thank you.

1140
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,200
Great.

1141
01:51:58,447 --> 01:52:05,053
So, if there aren't any other questions or comments from the board, I think now we will open it up for public comment.

1142
01:52:06,314 --> 01:52:15,683
Let me see if there's anything in particular that I need to preface public comment with for those that joined the zoning public comment period.

1143
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:17,992
We will keep a timer.

1144
01:52:18,672 --> 01:52:20,073
We'll set that to two minutes.

1145
01:52:21,775 --> 01:52:38,429
The intention is not to, you know, limit the public's ability to give a voice, and there will likely be another public comment period, but it's really just to make sure that we balance giving everybody enough time while making sure that we don't keep people, you know, until 10 or 11 p.m.

1146
01:52:40,528 --> 01:52:48,730
So those that wish to provide public comment can use the raise hand feature, which seems like a lot of people are aware of.

1147
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:53,732
So that's under the reactions button on Zoom.

1148
01:52:54,552 --> 01:52:58,013
If you're dialed in to phone, you can use nine to raise your hand.

1149
01:52:59,173 --> 01:53:01,894
If you have any issues, you can message Alicia in the chat.

1150
01:53:03,175 --> 01:53:07,596
And then before providing comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1151
01:53:08,494 --> 01:53:20,199
And a reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat to message any comments to the city staff or board purely because it's not part of the public record.

1152
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:30,604
So the exception is if you're having any difficulties with audio or anything else, you can message Alicia or the staff to get help.

1153
01:53:31,905 --> 01:53:32,865
So I think with that,

1154
01:53:34,986 --> 01:53:43,491
Alicia or Danielle will kind of keep me honest here with the timer, and then I'll just call folks kind of as I see them in order.

1155
01:53:43,511 --> 01:53:47,153
And we appreciate all the public comments, and we appreciate for the patience.

1156
01:53:47,733 --> 01:53:51,635
We know that there's a lot of information to go through and to digest.

1157
01:53:52,656 --> 01:53:59,180
So we'll start with Michelle Wright, if you could state your name and address for the record.

1158
01:54:02,622 --> 01:54:03,844
Oh, am I unmuted?

1159
01:54:04,064 --> 01:54:04,284
Okay.

1160
01:54:04,785 --> 01:54:05,946
Hi, Michelle, right?

1161
01:54:06,607 --> 01:54:12,594
I am a representative for the carpenter's union for Cambridge, Medford and Somerville area.

1162
01:54:12,614 --> 01:54:16,219
I actually represent two hundred represent.

1163
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:30,693
Residents that live in the medford area this question is actually for peter i was just wondering if you are planning to use a responsible contractor meaning a contractor that is not going to.

1164
01:54:30,713 --> 01:54:34,637
Basically have tax fraud or anything of that sort.

1165
01:54:35,538 --> 01:54:50,495
this is a big issue amongst the residential and due to the fact we have a residential rate that is very competitive to work with the residential side so we just want to make sure that you know that us the carpenters are definitely willing to talk to you.

1166
01:54:50,895 --> 01:54:54,659
We've definitely reached out and we haven't gotten anything back from you so we were just wondering

1167
01:54:56,461 --> 01:55:07,427
If there is anything that we can do, my partner Greg Poole has reached out to you and Jimmy Burrows have reached out to you, but we haven't gotten anything back.

1168
01:55:07,467 --> 01:55:08,288
So we're just wondering.

1169
01:55:08,308 --> 01:55:12,911
Mr. Chairman, do you want me to respond?

1170
01:55:13,938 --> 01:55:14,578
Yes, sorry.

1171
01:55:14,939 --> 01:55:15,139
Great.

1172
01:55:15,179 --> 01:55:15,719
Thanks, Michelle.

1173
01:55:16,019 --> 01:55:17,700
I'm happy to continue this conversation.

1174
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:22,382
We've made no commitments on kind of the construction.

1175
01:55:22,742 --> 01:55:26,543
We've been really heads down, focused on the community conversation and whatnot.

1176
01:55:27,364 --> 01:55:29,325
We care deeply about who we partner with.

1177
01:55:29,885 --> 01:55:37,268
It is, as you well know, really important who we partner with and make sure that we're partnered with the right general contractor.

1178
01:55:37,308 --> 01:55:41,630
So happy to continue those conversations and appreciate your thoughts.

1179
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,530
Thank you.

1180
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:45,971
I will definitely be emailing.

1181
01:55:46,071 --> 01:55:48,411
I hope your email does go back into the chat.

1182
01:55:48,771 --> 01:55:57,013
I will definitely email you tomorrow morning and so that you and I can have a great conversation and see if we can come to some kind of decent agreement.

1183
01:55:57,754 --> 01:55:59,854
I think I've seen it in the chat already posted.

1184
01:55:59,874 --> 01:56:00,554
Okay.

1185
01:56:00,594 --> 01:56:01,775
Look forward to it.

1186
01:56:02,415 --> 01:56:02,655
Great.

1187
01:56:02,775 --> 01:56:03,175
Thank you.

1188
01:56:06,347 --> 01:56:07,168
Awesome, thank you.

1189
01:56:08,328 --> 01:56:10,149
We'll now go to Jane Baldwin.

1190
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:14,152
Please state your name and address for the record, and we'll start the timer for two minutes.

1191
01:56:16,553 --> 01:56:18,255
Thank you, Jane Baldwin.

1192
01:56:19,015 --> 01:56:20,536
I live at 12 9th Street.

1193
01:56:21,477 --> 01:56:25,019
I have been a resident at 12 9th Street for 34 years.

1194
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:29,662
I don't know when the traffic study was done.

1195
01:56:29,862 --> 01:56:34,825
However, I would venture to guess that the reason that there is a decreased

1196
01:56:35,363 --> 01:56:44,217
Crash rate in that area is because it is totally gridlock 90% of the time I leave in the morning.

1197
01:56:44,417 --> 01:56:47,703
And if I thank goodness, I'm an early person.

1198
01:56:47,983 --> 01:56:49,165
If I don't leave.

1199
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:59,757
By 630, it takes me from the end of Brainerd Ave to get out to Middlesex Ave probably a good 25 minutes.

1200
01:57:00,417 --> 01:57:01,518
It becomes gridlock.

1201
01:57:01,858 --> 01:57:03,039
People get frustrated.

1202
01:57:06,742 --> 01:57:10,724
How I understand the sign, you either have to take a right or a left.

1203
01:57:11,044 --> 01:57:17,888
People try to go straight across to the Felsway, it's gridlocked, it backs up, and that is even before buses happen.

1204
01:57:19,169 --> 01:57:25,232
The question about if you're heading eastbound on Route 16,

1205
01:57:26,439 --> 01:57:34,761
and you want to take a left to come in, that light usually allows two cars to get through at a change of the light.

1206
01:57:35,121 --> 01:57:36,442
Two cars, two.

1207
01:57:37,342 --> 01:57:45,884
So there is going to need to be significant traffic engineering, especially about lights at Wellington.

1208
01:57:46,204 --> 01:57:49,485
And as a matter of fact, it's even worse on the weekends.

1209
01:57:51,346 --> 01:57:59,111
You probably have to sit on Middlesex Ave if you want to go towards Charlestown, towards 93.

1210
01:57:59,151 --> 01:58:05,115
And I would say, average, you have to wait 3, 4, 5 light changes to get through the lights.

1211
01:58:07,802 --> 01:58:16,008
And it has really decreased, I think, the quality of life of the people that live on 9th Street.

1212
01:58:16,428 --> 01:58:17,749
I applaud this building.

1213
01:58:17,889 --> 01:58:22,672
It looks beautiful, but the traffic is my biggest concern.

1214
01:58:23,013 --> 01:58:23,353
Thank you.

1215
01:58:24,997 --> 01:58:25,617
Thank you, Jane.

1216
01:58:25,797 --> 01:58:30,540
We appreciate the comments and also seconded that thought.

1217
01:58:32,121 --> 01:58:32,281
Great.

1218
01:58:32,301 --> 01:58:34,662
We'll now pass it to Linda Lennox.

1219
01:58:35,402 --> 01:58:39,204
Please state your name and your address for the record, and we'll start a timer for two minutes.

1220
01:58:44,587 --> 01:58:46,088
And we'll get you unmuted here.

1221
01:59:00,138 --> 01:59:05,902
Alicia, Danielle, do you know if we're able to unmute Linda or is that something that she'll need to do?

1222
01:59:09,284 --> 01:59:11,986
We don't have the ability to do it for her.

1223
01:59:12,186 --> 01:59:12,947
Just send her.

1224
01:59:13,543 --> 01:59:14,344
Oh, there we go.

1225
01:59:14,404 --> 01:59:14,985
There she is.

1226
01:59:15,505 --> 01:59:16,366
Okay, thank you.

1227
01:59:17,047 --> 01:59:19,449
I live at 22 9th Street.

1228
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:22,072
I've known Jane for many years.

1229
01:59:22,132 --> 01:59:25,796
We're neighbors, and she is not lying.

1230
01:59:26,396 --> 01:59:29,039
My unit faces 9th Street.

1231
01:59:29,139 --> 01:59:30,280
I'm on the first floor.

1232
01:59:31,239 --> 01:59:37,667
Saturday afternoon, I knew that there was a lot of traffic on the Revere Beach Parkway westbound.

1233
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:49,061
No fewer than 40 to 50 cars drove up the street from the Revere Beach Parkway to avoid that intersection.

1234
01:59:50,257 --> 01:59:57,664
I don't know where you and there's so many thoughts running through my head in the morning school buses come up the street.

1235
01:59:58,545 --> 02:00:03,730
All the trucks for Bianco sausages come down the street, 18 wheelers.

1236
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:09,736
We've had to call the police to help them maneuver the corner because they don't know how they got there.

1237
02:00:09,776 --> 02:00:10,757
There's no room.

1238
02:00:11,237 --> 02:00:11,938
I don't know what.

1239
02:00:13,558 --> 02:00:23,463
studies you guys looked at, but if this is going to be a major traffic problem for this street, that's all I have to say.

1240
02:00:23,683 --> 02:00:24,803
It's going to be a mess.

1241
02:00:26,264 --> 02:00:26,764
Thank you.

1242
02:00:27,865 --> 02:00:30,746
Appreciate it, Linda.

1243
02:00:31,006 --> 02:00:31,346
All right.

1244
02:00:31,466 --> 02:00:35,428
We will now call on Garan.

1245
02:00:36,468 --> 02:00:39,790
Please state your name and address, and we'll start the timer for two minutes.

1246
02:00:40,974 --> 02:00:42,455
Hi guys, thank you for your time.

1247
02:00:44,756 --> 02:00:46,216
We are at 89th Street.

1248
02:00:46,897 --> 02:00:51,639
We also share the same concerns regarding traffic, so we won't talk about that.

1249
02:00:51,939 --> 02:00:53,080
I have two questions.

1250
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:55,461
One is regarding schools.

1251
02:00:57,142 --> 02:00:58,883
I didn't hear, I joined a little late.

1252
02:00:59,324 --> 02:01:06,309
Has there been any study or look into how this new development will impact the local schools?

1253
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:10,032
What are the predictions of how many students will be joining?

1254
02:01:10,953 --> 02:01:12,174
It's a pretty large unit.

1255
02:01:12,414 --> 02:01:16,278
You are looking at some multiple room units.

1256
02:01:16,318 --> 02:01:17,839
You're looking at affordable housing.

1257
02:01:18,059 --> 02:01:22,523
That is going to definitely have some school-aged children.

1258
02:01:23,657 --> 02:01:26,279
And the other question is about visitor parking spots.

1259
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:33,664
The two visitor parking spots that are visible in the plans outside are definitely not going to be sufficient.

1260
02:01:33,764 --> 02:01:34,925
So what is the plan?

1261
02:01:35,025 --> 02:01:38,147
I think our fear, obviously, is that we are the building right across.

1262
02:01:38,708 --> 02:01:42,210
So then everyone from your building might be coming into ours to park.

1263
02:01:42,731 --> 02:01:44,412
So what is the plan for parking?

1264
02:01:44,592 --> 02:01:48,535
And then what is the plan for the impact this will have on local schools?

1265
02:01:48,935 --> 02:01:49,175
Thank you.

1266
02:01:52,090 --> 02:01:54,331
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1267
02:01:55,291 --> 02:01:58,151
All right, we'll pass it to Adam.

1268
02:01:59,972 --> 02:02:00,732
Good first name.

1269
02:02:01,192 --> 02:02:06,093
If you could say your name and your address for the record, we'll start a timer for two minutes.

1270
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:17,796
We're having a little trouble hearing, so maybe just a microphone.

1271
02:02:19,829 --> 02:02:20,410
Sorry about that.

1272
02:02:20,650 --> 02:02:22,673
Adam Lozier-McCanty, 2293 Unit 105.

1273
02:02:22,793 --> 02:02:25,978
Could you please pull up slide 16?

1274
02:02:26,018 --> 02:02:34,049
I'd like to thank the Community Development Board for considering the neighbors and butters concerns in this and welcome Peter to the neighborhood.

1275
02:02:35,611 --> 02:02:40,854
I just noticed that in this slide that 50 Beard Beach Parkway is kind of missing.

1276
02:02:42,215 --> 02:02:48,299
The building that's going to be built is considerably larger than the other character of the neighborhood.

1277
02:02:48,939 --> 02:02:53,482
And this particular building is going to be almost three times wider.

1278
02:02:53,502 --> 02:02:57,044
It's going to block a lot of sunlight for our neighbors across the street.

1279
02:02:57,164 --> 02:02:58,945
So I was just a little concerned about that.

1280
02:02:59,986 --> 02:03:00,266
Thank you.

1281
02:03:04,812 --> 02:03:05,532
Thank you for the comments.

1282
02:03:06,893 --> 02:03:10,135
I will now call on the 9th Street committee.

1283
02:03:11,276 --> 02:03:29,708
Maybe just a question for either Daniela or Alicia, just what the protocol is for kind of a joint, a joint comment, or if there's one person in particular that wants to state your name or state your name and address.

1284
02:03:31,575 --> 02:03:33,415
I think there are a couple people.

1285
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,776
We are in one of our meeting committee rooms.

1286
02:03:35,796 --> 02:03:36,576
So is that OK?

1287
02:03:37,576 --> 02:03:37,956
Yeah, it's OK.

1288
02:03:38,076 --> 02:03:42,177
Just if you want to state your name or whoever wants to speak can state their name and address.

1289
02:03:42,357 --> 02:03:42,837
That'd be great.

1290
02:03:43,917 --> 02:03:51,739
And if there's multiple folks, we can maybe go through the line and then come back to the next person in the room if there's multiple.

1291
02:03:52,519 --> 02:03:54,099
Actually, my name is Patricia Murray.

1292
02:03:54,119 --> 02:03:55,519
I live at 89th Street.

1293
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:58,860
And the traffic situation was already brought up.

1294
02:03:59,648 --> 02:04:06,814
But a gentleman asked about going from, if you were going on the Riviera Beach Parkway East, how would you get into this building?

1295
02:04:08,135 --> 02:04:18,543
There's going to have to be another study done, a traffic study done, because like at four o'clock in the afternoon, there is one lane that would go into your building where your residents would go.

1296
02:04:19,524 --> 02:04:28,711
And all the traffic is backed up all the way through Malden, Highland Ave, all the way back to Middlesex, and you cause gridlock sometimes in Wellington Circle.

1297
02:04:29,081 --> 02:04:32,144
So there's one lane that would take you to this new building.

1298
02:04:32,684 --> 02:04:35,347
So the traffic study would have to be looked at again.

1299
02:04:35,367 --> 02:04:38,350
And maybe they should look at different times.

1300
02:04:39,951 --> 02:04:43,374
Obviously, they probably have done that, but that's just my concern.

1301
02:04:44,035 --> 02:04:45,977
It's horrible, the traffic around here.

1302
02:04:48,082 --> 02:04:49,443
Yeah, I think it's a great concern.

1303
02:04:50,143 --> 02:05:10,676
And maybe just to interpret the comments, maybe when we have our board discussion, we can discuss if there's any additional things that we want to ask for Trantham to address or to maybe come back at the next hearing with.

1304
02:05:11,256 --> 02:05:14,198
Maybe, yeah, if there's a second person that wants to speak, state your name and address.

1305
02:05:14,978 --> 02:05:17,380
My name is Slava Sidorova, 8 9th Street,

1306
02:05:18,234 --> 02:05:19,695
one of the abutting buildings.

1307
02:05:20,595 --> 02:05:33,298
I just wanted to add to the comment about the traffic study and wanted to mention the response by the city's director of traffic and transportation, Todd Blake.

1308
02:05:33,918 --> 02:05:42,861
In his memo from September 2nd, 2025, he actually mentioned that the data overstated the current traffic

1309
02:05:43,951 --> 02:05:53,478
levels due to the collection methods and acknowledge that the project's actual impact on the area is yet to be determined.

1310
02:05:54,159 --> 02:06:11,251
So by approving this project and using 250 cars and 250 bicycles to this area, the city would be ignoring the neighbors' challenge, all of us living along 9th Street and adding insult to injury.

1311
02:06:11,782 --> 02:06:22,447
So we encourage you to carefully study the area and perhaps do another traffic study just to investigate what the actual impact will be.

1312
02:06:22,467 --> 02:06:24,928
Thank you.

1313
02:06:26,188 --> 02:06:27,009
Great, thank you.

1314
02:06:28,589 --> 02:06:30,970
All right, we'll now move on to Sachin.

1315
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:34,412
State your name and address for the record, and then we'll start a timer for two minutes.

1316
02:06:35,092 --> 02:06:52,022
I search in here 12 9th Street, people have brought up traffic already I think my so maybe one comment I agree that traffic study, I think was mentioned correct me if I'm wrong, was more of like a national level something done with an institute, I don't really think that's indicative or representative of

1317
02:06:53,215 --> 02:06:58,438
a unique area like Boston where public transport is available, but it's not very well connected.

1318
02:06:58,718 --> 02:07:03,961
I can tell you right now, most people who work in Cambridge are not able to get into Cambridge unless they drive.

1319
02:07:04,121 --> 02:07:06,042
And that's just one industry, right?

1320
02:07:06,082 --> 02:07:07,282
Biotech, which is very heavy.

1321
02:07:07,783 --> 02:07:08,703
So that's just a comment.

1322
02:07:10,344 --> 02:07:15,627
My question was more so around how people, I think someone had mentioned that

1323
02:07:16,547 --> 02:07:24,571
there was discussion about curbing efforts of people cutting in from Revere Beach Parkway on the brainer.

1324
02:07:24,971 --> 02:07:30,473
Curious to hear what those are because it's a state highway.

1325
02:07:30,553 --> 02:07:38,397
I don't know what the ideas are on how to combat that, but it's very difficult and it's actually just very dangerous.

1326
02:07:38,577 --> 02:07:40,257
Forget about traffic, it's very dangerous.

1327
02:07:40,377 --> 02:07:41,758
People are speeding down that way.

1328
02:07:42,178 --> 02:07:46,200
So curious to hear what types of discussions have already happened around that.

1329
02:07:51,804 --> 02:07:52,784
Um, great.

1330
02:07:52,824 --> 02:07:59,586
Maybe we'll take a note, um, and then kind of collect all these questions for transom to respond to at the end of comment.

1331
02:08:00,706 --> 02:08:09,989
Um, uh, I will call on, I think Alicia had mentioned, uh, that someone was having difficulty with unmuting.

1332
02:08:10,109 --> 02:08:15,210
So, uh, we'll have Alicia read, uh, the person's name and address and the comment that they wanted to share.

1333
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:17,151
Great.

1334
02:08:17,251 --> 02:08:18,131
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1335
02:08:18,863 --> 02:08:23,667
Um, I'm afraid I'm going to mispronounce the name, but I do have it for our records.

1336
02:08:24,067 --> 02:08:29,652
Um, for the minutes, a con Harvey at G I live at 30 Revere beach parkway.

1337
02:08:30,293 --> 02:08:40,201
I apologize if I am mistaken about the number, but based on my understanding, there are 251 parking spots with 248 designated for residents.

1338
02:08:40,661 --> 02:08:42,883
This leaves only three spots for guest parking.

1339
02:08:43,387 --> 02:08:46,990
My question is, will this parking area be exclusively for residents?

1340
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:49,912
Will it also be used for paid public parking?

1341
02:08:50,292 --> 02:08:52,113
Where will guests be expected to park?

1342
02:08:56,837 --> 02:08:57,417
Thanks, Alicia.

1343
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:05,463
Monaha and Emily Palmer, please state your name and address, and we'll start a timer for two minutes.

1344
02:09:07,456 --> 02:09:08,376
Hi, thank you so much.

1345
02:09:08,776 --> 02:09:09,477
Emily Palmer.

1346
02:09:09,537 --> 02:09:11,657
I live at 28 Brainerd Avenue.

1347
02:09:11,677 --> 02:09:14,518
I have two questions and comments.

1348
02:09:15,178 --> 02:09:19,060
I appreciate the care and attention that has been focused on 9th Street.

1349
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:22,761
Obviously, that is a key channel of this new building development.

1350
02:09:23,461 --> 02:09:29,303
But I would like to just call attention to Brainerd Ave as well, which faces similar private way issues.

1351
02:09:30,023 --> 02:09:31,444
that 9th Street does as well.

1352
02:09:32,285 --> 02:09:44,251
And it's also a key channel to a local business, Bianco's, which is very active in the community and a very important industrial business in our neighborhood.

1353
02:09:45,612 --> 02:09:52,716
I live towards the end of Brainerd Avenue and we're oftentimes one of the last streets in Medford to get plowed when there is a storm.

1354
02:09:52,776 --> 02:09:58,680
So I do fear that future residents of this building will also face the challenges of the private way

1355
02:09:59,413 --> 02:10:01,014
limitations of Brainerd Ave as well.

1356
02:10:01,034 --> 02:10:03,995
So thank you for taking the same care and attention.

1357
02:10:04,015 --> 02:10:07,277
You're focusing on 9th Street on Brainerd Ave as well.

1358
02:10:07,777 --> 02:10:28,648
And then my second question is, I don't believe I saw these in the plans, but I'm curious if you did consider having any room for commercial spaces in this building, such as for a local coffee shop or something else, knowing that this would take place, this would remove Cappy's and Monroe.

1359
02:10:29,062 --> 02:10:31,983
two businesses that I am active customers of.

1360
02:10:32,403 --> 02:10:37,444
I'm just trying to think of any way to increase another business footprint in the neighborhood.

1361
02:10:37,905 --> 02:10:38,625
Thank you so much.

1362
02:10:41,005 --> 02:10:41,205
Great.

1363
02:10:41,245 --> 02:10:41,746
Thank you, Emily.

1364
02:10:41,766 --> 02:10:49,968
We'll now let Rebecca Brown look at the floor, state your name and address, and we'll start a timer for two minutes.

1365
02:10:50,952 --> 02:11:11,125
Oh, actually, I had raised my hand a little while ago to respond to another comment from one of the residents that brought up the letter from Todd Blake, where he had stated that the counts of the existing trip generation may be overstated because we counted all of the driveways.

1366
02:11:12,106 --> 02:11:18,250
Although we did count all the driveways, including the barbershop driveways, we provided a response to Todd's

1367
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:30,544
Comments that explain that even though we counted all the driveways, the trip generation that was included and summarized in the table did not include all of the driveways.

1368
02:11:30,624 --> 02:11:33,428
So we only included the traffic that was going to and from.

1369
02:11:34,649 --> 02:11:54,006
The cappies and the Monroe site and Mr. Blake did also ask us to provide a comparison to ITE data, which we did do that and ITE data actually came out a little bit higher than what was actually counted on the site, which verifies that the.

1370
02:11:54,686 --> 02:12:04,890
The counts at the driveways appear to be accurate, and although they may include some cut through, that volume is probably not a heavy volume based on the counts.

1371
02:12:07,151 --> 02:12:08,111
Thank you, Rebecca.

1372
02:12:09,532 --> 02:12:12,533
We'll now have Tony, please state your name and address.

1373
02:12:13,981 --> 02:12:17,222
Hi, Tony Piscardi, 28 9th Street.

1374
02:12:18,442 --> 02:12:36,668
And so in addition to reiterating whatever else says that the traffic is a major problem here, and I don't know if the answer is to block Brainerd Ave during the morning rush hour or to open up the gates to allow people to go to 7th Street, 6th Street, 5th Street, 4th Street, and not all Jam and 9th.

1375
02:12:39,457 --> 02:12:42,119
One issue that hasn't, I don't think it's been addressed yet.

1376
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:54,727
Right now, I'm glad you're repaving, but right now our system of painting the lines consists of random residents going out at midnight with spray paint cans to repaint the lines.

1377
02:12:55,147 --> 02:12:57,468
This is not a sustainable or safe system.

1378
02:12:58,269 --> 02:13:00,430
Who is going to repaint the lines?

1379
02:13:01,131 --> 02:13:07,755
And in 10 years, when the road deteriorates because of all the traffic going down it, who's going to repave it in 10 years?

1380
02:13:09,584 --> 02:13:09,884
Thank you.

1381
02:13:11,145 --> 02:13:11,626
Thanks, Tony.

1382
02:13:15,510 --> 02:13:21,856
Sudeep, we'll now give you the floor if you want to state your name, address, and then we'll start a timer for two minutes.

1383
02:13:22,595 --> 02:13:23,255
Thank you so much.

1384
02:13:24,136 --> 02:13:25,116
My name is Sudeep Mehrotra.

1385
02:13:25,136 --> 02:13:26,897
I live here at 8th 9th Street as well.

1386
02:13:28,717 --> 02:13:30,018
Some of the questions have already been raised.

1387
02:13:30,078 --> 02:13:33,739
I just want to point out some little facts which I have also observed.

1388
02:13:34,799 --> 02:13:35,960
Traffic isn't one of them.

1389
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:43,703
And I remember seeing a gauge counter which was put near the visitor's parking at 8th 9th Street.

1390
02:13:44,843 --> 02:13:46,684
I think it was something to do with the traffic.

1391
02:13:47,464 --> 02:13:53,467
It was interesting to see that it was put around the long weekend, which means traffic is already low.

1392
02:13:53,827 --> 02:13:56,088
If you're looking at those numbers, well, please don't trust them.

1393
02:13:57,008 --> 02:14:08,453
B, you are projecting something in here which you assume when building will be put up, there will be that many parking, that many people coming, well, population is going to grow.

1394
02:14:09,655 --> 02:14:18,121
I don't think we are projecting how many actual traffic will be costly following through here if something has not been done correctly, which is already a big problem which everybody has raised.

1395
02:14:19,562 --> 02:14:24,305
But trust me, I tell you that those 15 numbers which you are looking for is not 50.

1396
02:14:25,486 --> 02:14:29,128
People come at heavily used street.

1397
02:14:29,728 --> 02:14:36,493
People who are living here, all our residents suffer when we have to go to outside out of 9th Street.

1398
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:40,701
So that's a very big concern and you have to really revise those numbers.

1399
02:14:41,562 --> 02:14:50,665
Then other comment is, which was brought about, I forgot, it was how you should go to River Beach Park way going through Baynard.

1400
02:14:50,725 --> 02:14:54,867
Well, you know, there is something which should be done and there is something that people do.

1401
02:14:55,107 --> 02:14:56,107
There are two different things.

1402
02:14:56,828 --> 02:14:58,628
People don't follow rules all the time.

1403
02:14:59,249 --> 02:15:04,090
And technically there is a big sign says, do not enter this street from 7 a.m., 6 a.m.

1404
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:04,591
to 9 a.m.

1405
02:15:04,611 --> 02:15:05,231
Well, people do.

1406
02:15:06,218 --> 02:15:16,486
So, you know, assuming people will follow the rule or if there is no gate system or something, you are putting yourself in a ditch.

1407
02:15:16,967 --> 02:15:25,453
So I really hope that you pay attention to these small facts and really look at the facts and really make some changes out of that.

1408
02:15:25,713 --> 02:15:26,254
Thank you so much.

1409
02:15:27,895 --> 02:15:28,376
Thank you, Siddhit.

1410
02:15:30,473 --> 02:15:33,836
All right, we'll now have David take the floor.

1411
02:15:33,916 --> 02:15:36,879
If you want to state your name and address, and we'll start a timer for 2 minutes.

1412
02:15:39,662 --> 02:15:40,683
And unmute yourself.

1413
02:15:43,546 --> 02:15:44,827
There we go.

1414
02:15:44,847 --> 02:15:45,287
Can you hear me?

1415
02:15:45,307 --> 02:15:46,368
Yep.

1416
02:15:46,909 --> 02:15:47,109
Great.

1417
02:15:47,209 --> 02:15:47,389
All right.

1418
02:15:47,409 --> 02:15:48,350
My name is David Hayes.

1419
02:15:48,410 --> 02:15:49,011
I live at 28 9th street.

1420
02:15:50,712 --> 02:15:52,574
I've been living here since the complex opened 1984.

1421
02:15:53,295 --> 02:15:55,317
I don't know how many years that was.

1422
02:15:55,337 --> 02:16:00,343
But I am on the 9th Street Committee representing the Wellington 187 units.

1423
02:16:00,663 --> 02:16:06,970
The three condo complexes over here represent over 400 units, families, 400 families.

1424
02:16:08,611 --> 02:16:13,873
And then we also have Wellington Place, which is another, I believe it's 190 families over there.

1425
02:16:14,333 --> 02:16:24,116
So as everybody mentioned about the street and the traffic, unless you experience it and come here and go look at it, you're not going to appreciate what people are saying.

1426
02:16:25,057 --> 02:16:31,519
One gentleman did bring up about when they measured the traffic, I saw the equipment go in, it was July 4th week.

1427
02:16:32,403 --> 02:16:36,906
Of course, the traffic is going to be a lot lower over the holiday and the kids are not in school.

1428
02:16:37,427 --> 02:16:41,530
But now when the kids are back in school, the traffic is unbearable.

1429
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:43,471
So we're actually stuck.

1430
02:16:43,551 --> 02:16:47,134
We're stuck in our homes because we can't drive down the street.

1431
02:16:48,074 --> 02:16:58,241
And we're in really good talks with Peter, and we're trying to work around that we're going to meet with his engineers so we actually have a list of a couple of dozen items that we've already sent to the city.

1432
02:16:58,261 --> 02:17:02,784
I don't know when this board is going to discuss those items.

1433
02:17:03,304 --> 02:17:07,387
The mayor said it was going to be done at the meeting, I haven't heard many of them or any of them come up.

1434
02:17:09,129 --> 02:17:11,431
But another issue that we have is snow.

1435
02:17:12,052 --> 02:17:18,760
So the people that live here now, and we haven't had a major snowstorm since like 2015, 16, thank God.

1436
02:17:19,581 --> 02:17:26,389
But when even a medium snowstorm, 9th Street, which is already jammed with cars, goes down to one lane.

1437
02:17:27,090 --> 02:17:30,112
So, one car comes down, one car goes out.

1438
02:17:30,312 --> 02:17:40,480
So, somebody has to sit at the end of the street, the eastern end of the street, by Brandon Ave, and wait for somebody down by the Cappy's end of the street to let them pass, and then the other car comes, and you pass.

1439
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:43,482
So, it's one lane, and we're trying to pass each other.

1440
02:17:43,962 --> 02:17:54,090
Now, with the city allowing the state, because we feel abandoned by the city, the mayor's office, we were promised a lot when Wellington Place was built, a lot.

1441
02:17:54,110 --> 02:17:56,351
They said those lines were going to be taken care of every year.

1442
02:17:56,392 --> 02:17:57,452
We didn't need to worry about it.

1443
02:17:57,472 --> 02:18:00,755
They're going to monitor the traffic for us and work on it.

1444
02:18:00,835 --> 02:18:02,256
And of course, that all disappeared.

1445
02:18:02,276 --> 02:18:03,637
I don't know why, but it did.

1446
02:18:04,838 --> 02:18:07,760
So we have the snow and the people that live here.

1447
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:09,902
Thanks, David.

1448
02:18:09,922 --> 02:18:10,422
The time's up.

1449
02:18:10,482 --> 02:18:12,764
I don't mean to cut you off.

1450
02:18:15,886 --> 02:18:23,233
I'll now open it up if there's any other comments from the public, if there's anything additional.

1451
02:18:23,453 --> 02:18:24,594
I don't see any hand raised.

1452
02:18:26,156 --> 02:18:28,097
But, oh, OK.

1453
02:18:28,318 --> 02:18:36,165
AP, if you want to state your name and address, and then we'll start a timer for two minutes.

1454
02:18:37,106 --> 02:18:38,867
Hi, can you hear me?

1455
02:18:38,907 --> 02:18:39,388
Yes, we can.

1456
02:18:40,003 --> 02:18:41,625
All right, so this is Shibha Gupta.

1457
02:18:41,825 --> 02:18:43,987
That's my husband's profile.

1458
02:18:44,408 --> 02:18:47,251
We live at 28 9th Street in Medford.

1459
02:18:47,771 --> 02:18:52,656
So a lot of our, you know, community members already mentioned about the traffic issue.

1460
02:18:53,037 --> 02:18:56,340
But I want to bring up a personal issue which happened a few years back.

1461
02:18:56,721 --> 02:18:59,403
We actually had a flat tire because of the roads condition.

1462
02:19:00,324 --> 02:19:03,805
And they try to repair it a little bit here and there on the 9th Street.

1463
02:19:04,025 --> 02:19:05,665
But it is awful.

1464
02:19:05,745 --> 02:19:08,066
I don't know if this has been mentioned before or not.

1465
02:19:08,666 --> 02:19:16,368
But I just want you to consider this part as well, that the roads you mentioned in the project that only a certain part would be taken care of.

1466
02:19:16,948 --> 02:19:20,089
But I think a complete revamp is required.

1467
02:19:20,109 --> 02:19:24,350
Great.

1468
02:19:24,630 --> 02:19:25,770
Thank you for the comments.

1469
02:19:27,438 --> 02:19:31,981
I've also experienced a flat tire, not in Medford, but I understand how frustrating it is.

1470
02:19:32,001 --> 02:19:45,988
If there's no other public comments, I took some notes about issues that folks had questions about.

1471
02:19:49,140 --> 02:19:50,521
things that people wanted addressed.

1472
02:19:51,161 --> 02:19:53,922
So I did want to give room for Transom to respond to some of them.

1473
02:19:55,462 --> 02:19:58,643
But I do see Sudeep.

1474
02:20:00,264 --> 02:20:02,645
Is there an additional comment that you'd like to add?

1475
02:20:03,645 --> 02:20:10,748
Actually, I was just going to say if there is some time, why not, David, let finish his comments.

1476
02:20:11,388 --> 02:20:17,590
Sure, I will let you cede your two minutes, David, if you had anything else you wanted to say.

1477
02:20:18,506 --> 02:20:19,628
Thank you, Sudeep.

1478
02:20:19,668 --> 02:20:20,349
I appreciate it.

1479
02:20:20,369 --> 02:20:21,350
Yes, I have a lot to say.

1480
02:20:23,573 --> 02:20:31,863
So the snow, so the cars now that are coming off Revere Beach Parkway do not know you have to wait for one car to pass so the other car can come down the street.

1481
02:20:31,943 --> 02:20:36,890
So the first time we have a major snowstorm, even without the building, we're going to have a mess over here.

1482
02:20:37,310 --> 02:20:41,992
with the building is going to be so many more cars on the street, so many more people trying to enter down here.

1483
02:20:42,433 --> 02:20:47,015
So what is the plan for the city to clear the snow off the street?

1484
02:20:47,395 --> 02:20:48,776
I mean, they need to take it away.

1485
02:20:48,816 --> 02:20:51,897
It's a very narrow street, parking on one side.

1486
02:20:53,098 --> 02:21:01,863
And if they don't clear the snow away, we're down to one lane, a single lane on this street where we're going to have over 800 families living on it.

1487
02:21:06,505 --> 02:21:06,625
Great.

1488
02:21:07,244 --> 02:21:08,445
Uh, thank you, David.

1489
02:21:10,207 --> 02:21:17,613
Um, I maybe, uh, I guess if there's no other public comments, uh, we will, uh, try and some respond to some of the comments here.

1490
02:21:17,633 --> 02:21:24,179
Uh, we will then open it up for the board to, uh, uh, have any additional discussion.

1491
02:21:25,496 --> 02:21:31,258
I guess Akan is maybe you'll get the last word in if you want to state your name and address.

1492
02:21:31,839 --> 02:21:32,439
We'll give it to you.

1493
02:21:32,459 --> 02:21:32,999
Thank you.

1494
02:21:33,279 --> 02:21:34,540
My name is Akan Harbiji.

1495
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:36,621
I live at 30 River Beach Parkway.

1496
02:21:37,221 --> 02:21:39,202
Alicia, thank you for reading my first question.

1497
02:21:39,222 --> 02:21:44,764
Actually, the plan, why so wide?

1498
02:21:44,784 --> 02:21:46,645
Why is this plan so wide?

1499
02:21:47,065 --> 02:21:50,766
The building is so wide and it's not like other buildings.

1500
02:21:50,806 --> 02:21:54,768
There's not enough green space around the building.

1501
02:21:55,567 --> 02:21:57,088
Why they are building to the line?

1502
02:21:58,068 --> 02:22:01,929
Why they are not leaving enough space for the residents?

1503
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:04,370
So that's all.

1504
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:04,790
Thank you.

1505
02:22:05,550 --> 02:22:05,730
Great.

1506
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:06,370
Thank you, Ekan.

1507
02:22:07,871 --> 02:22:14,433
Yeah, we can ask Transom about the architectural choice between outer space versus maybe inner space.

1508
02:22:15,914 --> 02:22:20,195
I had one question, maybe a point of clarification, maybe just to help me understand.

1509
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:49,906
uh probably for danielle or alicia um just given that ninth street is a private way and then given that the fells way or the parkway is a state road um what specifically is the involvement of the city or the involvement of the particular property with the concerns that

1510
02:22:51,177 --> 02:22:56,942
uh, the residents raised and then also recognizing that this is a by right development proposal.

1511
02:23:00,244 --> 02:23:09,511
I just want to make clear that, uh, that, um, we'd sort of kind of properly contextualize, uh, sort of who's responsible for the different pieces here.

1512
02:23:09,531 --> 02:23:11,412
Right.

1513
02:23:11,612 --> 02:23:14,515
Um, yeah, I can, uh, address that.

1514
02:23:14,555 --> 02:23:14,715
So,

1515
02:23:15,803 --> 02:23:19,046
One of the comments I heard was the condition of the road.

1516
02:23:20,227 --> 02:23:30,556
Unfortunately, private ways are completely maintained by the abutting residents.

1517
02:23:31,277 --> 02:23:42,807
The city does not maintain them, pave them, build sidewalks, because private ways, my understanding is they can't expend public monies.

1518
02:23:43,542 --> 02:23:44,722
on private ways.

1519
02:23:45,262 --> 02:23:52,804
So it is possible to bring it up to the standard of a public road and ask for the city to accept it.

1520
02:23:53,404 --> 02:24:00,946
And then the city could assume maintenance and control of that, which is on a schedule.

1521
02:24:01,046 --> 02:24:02,386
It's not magic.

1522
02:24:02,446 --> 02:24:05,607
It's kept meticulous.

1523
02:24:07,848 --> 02:24:08,408
So that's one.

1524
02:24:09,487 --> 02:24:22,772
But my understanding also, talking to the DPW commissioner, is that if there is a public safety hazard, they'll fill deep potholes if it is considered dangerous.

1525
02:24:23,372 --> 02:24:29,554
But in general, public funds can't be spent on private ways.

1526
02:24:29,614 --> 02:24:34,496
And that's why you'll see that the private ways are often in deplorable condition.

1527
02:24:34,896 --> 02:24:36,877
I live on a private way in Medford.

1528
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:39,000
It's not fun to live apart.

1529
02:24:39,020 --> 02:24:40,701
They sound fancy, but they are not.

1530
02:24:41,041 --> 02:24:48,184
They're basically just forgotten about roads.

1531
02:24:48,944 --> 02:25:02,649
And then in terms of routing of traffic from the state kind of jurisdiction of the parkway, what relationship does the city have with those concerns?

1532
02:25:04,274 --> 02:25:04,894
Commissioner Greenwood.

1533
02:25:04,914 --> 02:25:09,875
Mr chair, if I might, I think some of this question for you also is about what is the authority of the board here?

1534
02:25:10,516 --> 02:25:10,816
Yes.

1535
02:25:11,236 --> 02:25:20,818
So the board cannot require them to do something on a private way unless the other butters of the private way agree to it.

1536
02:25:23,443 --> 02:25:35,768
If they come to an agreement and transom says, we're going to do X, say they say that they're going to repave this section or put in a raised, a speed hump, right?

1537
02:25:36,388 --> 02:25:39,089
And the abutters are saying, yes, we agree to that.

1538
02:25:40,309 --> 02:25:45,992
Then the board could put it in as a condition, and then we could hold transom accountable to do it.

1539
02:25:46,852 --> 02:25:51,894
What we can't do is say, we don't care what the other abutters want, you have to do it whether they want it or not.

1540
02:25:53,153 --> 02:25:57,377
And so that's where the owner is having some negotiations with them.

1541
02:25:57,817 --> 02:26:11,308
But if they come to an agreement and they can sort of provide us that the other condo associations agree that this is what should happen on the private way, then we can put that in the conditions and then the city can hold them to that.

1542
02:26:12,429 --> 02:26:21,657
On the state road, it is much harder because you will never get the state to agree to or commit to anything in the timeline of weeks to a couple,

1543
02:26:22,589 --> 02:26:25,701
In a short time frame, we would need

1544
02:26:26,907 --> 02:26:30,950
a long time for that, and I don't know that you could get the state to agree to anything.

1545
02:26:31,990 --> 02:26:35,633
So anything that's on the state property is much, much harder.

1546
02:26:38,034 --> 02:26:49,522
But what wouldn't hurt is recommend that the applicant negotiate this, discuss this with the state, attempt to do this, do this if the state will allow it.

1547
02:26:50,283 --> 02:26:52,044
Those types of things can be put in.

1548
02:26:52,931 --> 02:27:03,934
And then they have to show us like for one applicant, we had them send us copies of their emails back and forth with the state that showed that they tried.

1549
02:27:04,454 --> 02:27:08,155
And the state, in fact, said no or said you had to do something different.

1550
02:27:08,535 --> 02:27:08,715
Right.

1551
02:27:08,755 --> 02:27:11,496
So we had proof that they tried and proof that it didn't work.

1552
02:27:11,943 --> 02:27:14,625
In some cases, the state says yes to things.

1553
02:27:16,065 --> 02:27:23,750
So you can put it in, but if it's on a state road, it really needs to be more of a, you have to make some sort of best effort.

1554
02:27:24,798 --> 02:27:24,978
Yeah.

1555
02:27:25,258 --> 02:27:25,499
Okay.

1556
02:27:25,599 --> 02:27:25,899
Thank you.

1557
02:27:26,660 --> 02:27:38,309
Um, so then, yeah, maybe I'll, uh, give the floor back to transom, uh, just some of the call outs that I heard from the community were, um, maybe skepticism about the traffic study.

1558
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:51,200
Um, and so it'd be good to just give a bit of voiceover, um, to maybe those concerns or if there's, um, just any thoughts to, um, maybe how to kind of end it.

1559
02:27:52,133 --> 02:28:00,920
from a data-driven way address the concerns about doing it during the July holiday week versus when school is in session.

1560
02:28:01,580 --> 02:28:02,761
We're all back in September now.

1561
02:28:04,102 --> 02:28:11,447
I think there was a good question around consideration for commercial space or coffee shops, if that was ever considered.

1562
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:20,424
maybe a question of how the group thought about public space and green space.

1563
02:28:22,224 --> 02:28:30,549
And then I do think it would be interesting to just hear a little bit more detail of the conversations that you're having with the abutters on 9th Street.

1564
02:28:30,569 --> 02:28:41,214
And I'm sure the board would like to know a little bit more about the things that are being discussed, the line repainting, the snow.

1565
02:28:43,395 --> 02:28:46,017
and maybe potentially conversations with the state.

1566
02:28:46,477 --> 02:28:49,879
So I guess I'll give it to Rebecca.

1567
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:52,200
Thank you.

1568
02:28:52,861 --> 02:28:58,124
So yeah, I can respond to the first question that you raised about the timing of when the traffic counts were done.

1569
02:28:58,184 --> 02:29:00,785
So they were not done over 4th of July.

1570
02:29:00,805 --> 02:29:04,447
I'm not sure where people got that impression from.

1571
02:29:05,188 --> 02:29:08,690
But we did actually do the counts during the third week of June.

1572
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:11,371
They were done June 19th to the 21st.

1573
02:29:13,292 --> 02:29:15,713
and not over the July 4th weekend.

1574
02:29:16,873 --> 02:29:29,658
I do not know that school was actually in session at that time, but the counts included just the driveways themselves and not traffic along Revere Beach Parkway.

1575
02:29:30,338 --> 02:29:40,302
They were just done for trip generation purposes only, and the type of uses that are on the site right now would not be heavily impacted by school traffic.

1576
02:29:46,059 --> 02:29:47,288
Great, thank you.

1577
02:29:49,285 --> 02:29:59,872
Just because I don't know everybody's name on the team, I will let you guys kind of hand it off between you if there's specific questions that you want to answer or if there's things that I missed.

1578
02:30:00,132 --> 02:30:04,055
Yes, I want to I'll jump in on a couple of the points that you raised.

1579
02:30:04,215 --> 02:30:11,020
I'll start with the easier one about why the building is designed the way that it is.

1580
02:30:11,620 --> 02:30:15,623
The zoning has maximum setback provisions in it.

1581
02:30:16,083 --> 02:30:18,185
So there are limits on how far back

1582
02:30:18,485 --> 02:30:21,026
we can go from the road, we've complied with that.

1583
02:30:23,327 --> 02:30:34,791
So with that, our architecture team can certainly add on to that if they would like to, but we did have to design around the constraints in the zoning.

1584
02:30:34,831 --> 02:30:43,314
And one of them really requires us to provide that street frontage and where we do have frontage on multiple ways, we are required to do that.

1585
02:30:45,095 --> 02:30:59,850
With respect to 9th Street, I think we can perhaps suggest some language for a draft decision concerning what we can and can't commit to.

1586
02:31:01,372 --> 02:31:12,183
With private ways, it is very difficult as a new owner coming in to make commitments because they require coordination with many, many different parties.

1587
02:31:12,764 --> 02:31:19,732
We only own a very limited portion of the way and we can't take responsibility for fixing

1588
02:31:23,107 --> 02:31:27,930
problems that extend far beyond our ownership of that way.

1589
02:31:27,950 --> 02:31:30,832
We are very limited in what we can agree to.

1590
02:31:30,852 --> 02:31:38,816
And certainly any decision where we commit to making any improvements to that way is going to have to be

1591
02:31:39,857 --> 02:31:49,306
constrained as directly as exactly as Director Hunt indicated by getting the assent of all required parties.

1592
02:31:51,007 --> 02:31:59,795
But then we'll have to have some further limitations on that because ultimately, particularly if there are improvements that extend beyond where we own,

1593
02:32:00,616 --> 02:32:03,220
We can't control what those parties do with that in the future.

1594
02:32:03,661 --> 02:32:13,857
So it wouldn't be right to have a decision that requires us to maintain an improvement that we can't preclude the owners of that area from removing in the future.

1595
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:20,424
So we will continue to work with our abutters.

1596
02:32:20,584 --> 02:32:29,953
We certainly understand and respect their concerns, and I think the fact that we've continued to engage with them extensively reflects that.

1597
02:32:31,214 --> 02:32:38,020
We are planning to make significant improvements to the condition of 9th Street, just repaving a loan in the area that

1598
02:32:39,322 --> 02:32:49,714
extends along the site frontage will be a significant improvement over what exists today and the addition of sidewalks where there currently are none will be again a significant improvement over what exists today.

1599
02:32:49,734 --> 02:32:57,023
But we do want to make sure that any decision really reflects what we can do and what we can commit to.

1600
02:32:58,145 --> 02:32:59,926
So we will work to do that.

1601
02:33:01,167 --> 02:33:09,515
With respect to your questions concerning commercial space consideration, I'll turn that over to Peter to respond to.

1602
02:33:11,023 --> 02:33:11,603
Great.

1603
02:33:11,663 --> 02:33:12,764
Valerie, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1604
02:33:12,784 --> 02:33:13,144
Thank you.

1605
02:33:13,824 --> 02:33:29,970
I just want to add a little bit to what Valerie just said about 9th Street, and specifically if, OK, Mr. Chairman, speaking to the 9th Street neighbors that are here and the ones that I've already started conversations with, please don't mistake that as backpedaling on our conversations.

1606
02:33:30,610 --> 02:33:39,173
Look, I'm serious when I have said to you the biggest mistake that developers do is to deny an undeniable truth.

1607
02:33:40,053 --> 02:33:52,624
and 9th Street going well back beyond any of our time and exacerbated most recently it seems by MassDOT's slip lane onto Brainerd needs addressing.

1608
02:33:52,845 --> 02:34:04,295
And so I just it would we are going to we're scheduled to meet so the board knows as well we've our Rebecca Brown is actually going to be joining us and the 9th Street neighbors

1609
02:34:05,035 --> 02:34:16,401
the representatives of the condos associations to explore all the possibilities for 9th Street and what is possible and what are the pros and cons.

1610
02:34:17,181 --> 02:34:18,782
It is complicated.

1611
02:34:18,842 --> 02:34:24,285
If it was easy, it probably would have been done by now and the neighbors would have gotten together because I don't know that it's

1612
02:34:24,825 --> 02:34:27,408
Expensive more so than it's difficult, right?

1613
02:34:27,448 --> 02:34:33,915
You have so many different parties and there's pros and cons and people have different interests based on where they live relative to others.

1614
02:34:34,715 --> 02:34:39,000
But, but to the 9th street neighbors in particular, I've committed to continue that conversation.

1615
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:40,802
I think to the, to the board.

1616
02:34:42,883 --> 02:35:01,268
We're obviously not concluding tonight, so between now and when we do reconvene, if you'll take Valerie up on her suggestion to draft something, but even more importantly, we're going to continue these conversations, and I genuinely want to come back and share detail, and I want the 9th Street neighbors to have voice.

1617
02:35:02,348 --> 02:35:05,231
and agency to make sure that you're hearing from them directly.

1618
02:35:05,851 --> 02:35:07,332
We're not going to be able to solve it all.

1619
02:35:07,472 --> 02:35:15,619
We're not going to be able to change the fundamental reality of it being a difficult area to traverse.

1620
02:35:15,839 --> 02:35:18,681
But I do believe fundamentally we can make it better.

1621
02:35:20,262 --> 02:35:22,723
And that's my goal.

1622
02:35:22,843 --> 02:35:23,804
My goal is to make it better.

1623
02:35:23,864 --> 02:35:24,724
And I think we can do it.

1624
02:35:25,444 --> 02:35:32,007
And I say that because I've now sat across from the 9th Street neighbors and then the representatives of the condo associations.

1625
02:35:32,567 --> 02:35:33,108
And you know what?

1626
02:35:33,228 --> 02:35:34,748
They're really serious, earnest.

1627
02:35:35,289 --> 02:35:36,189
They don't mix words.

1628
02:35:37,209 --> 02:35:39,090
They're telling me exactly what they're telling you.

1629
02:35:40,291 --> 02:35:43,772
But they're rolling up their sleeves and, I think, recognizing some of the challenges.

1630
02:35:44,552 --> 02:35:46,393
And so we're going to continue those dialogues.

1631
02:35:49,448 --> 02:35:50,729
We're going to be a beneficiary of that.

1632
02:35:50,769 --> 02:35:52,290
We're not here just to build a building.

1633
02:35:52,330 --> 02:35:55,632
We're here to build a building and have it be successful for all its residents.

1634
02:35:56,272 --> 02:36:02,496
So we too care about traffic, because if the traffic is so horrendous, residents aren't going to want to lease here.

1635
02:36:03,377 --> 02:36:13,743
And so we are a vested stakeholder, and we are committed to working with, understanding that there is a tremendous amount of stakeholders and a long history here.

1636
02:36:14,604 --> 02:36:18,006
But I do believe that we can leave it better than we find it.

1637
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:20,340
Thanks, Peter.

1638
02:36:21,942 --> 02:36:26,765
Maybe just a point of procedural clarification, either for Daniel or Alicia.

1639
02:36:27,185 --> 02:36:31,308
I think there's a hand raised from the Ninth Street Committee.

1640
02:36:31,328 --> 02:36:47,180
I have not yet closed public comments, but I also want to be mindful of maybe not reopening too much public comment, given the clock right now.

1641
02:36:48,606 --> 02:36:50,967
but is it okay to call on the two raised hands?

1642
02:36:52,168 --> 02:36:53,628
So you can call on them.

1643
02:36:53,768 --> 02:36:59,111
You can also ask them to email their comments in and then we can forward them to the board and to Peter.

1644
02:36:59,131 --> 02:37:06,554
And I do want to clarify that when you close it, I assume that you're meaning that you would close it for this evening.

1645
02:37:06,574 --> 02:37:16,078
And that I expect that the board expects to reopen public comment when, because clearly again, you're not closing this hearing tonight at the continued hearing.

1646
02:37:16,098 --> 02:37:17,119
Yeah, correct.

1647
02:37:18,372 --> 02:37:25,856
Yes, through the chair, you can definitely close a public comment period for this meeting just to keep.

1648
02:37:26,596 --> 02:37:34,541
Things you can't just keep, you know, if someone comes on and wants to pipe up, there's order to things and I can leave in the chat that.

1649
02:37:35,101 --> 02:37:36,542
Please email any comments.

1650
02:37:37,452 --> 02:37:41,614
To staff and we'll get it to the board and the.

1651
02:37:42,254 --> 02:37:47,116
Applicant, if you have a lot more to say that you couldn't get through in 2 minutes.

1652
02:37:47,657 --> 02:37:50,298
Okay, so I think.

1653
02:37:52,919 --> 02:37:59,962
Keep it quick committee, you'll be the last ones and then we'll close public comment for tonight and then we'll open it up for board discussion.

1654
02:37:59,982 --> 02:38:02,183
Thank you.

1655
02:38:02,203 --> 02:38:03,244
So name is memo.

1656
02:38:03,644 --> 02:38:06,225
I'm on the 9th street on the 8th 9th street.

1657
02:38:07,127 --> 02:38:08,510
And yeah, let's see.

1658
02:38:08,530 --> 02:38:11,115
As Peter said, he did reach out to us.

1659
02:38:11,155 --> 02:38:13,039
We've been having dialogue and it's been very.

1660
02:38:15,353 --> 02:38:19,235
sharing his knowledge, expertise, very helpful conversations.

1661
02:38:19,255 --> 02:38:28,220
So we're looking forward to continuing that dialogue and like the idea of maybe potentially putting some of these things in writing as suggested today.

1662
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:31,322
So we can continue that conversation as well.

1663
02:38:32,582 --> 02:38:42,928
Finally, I also wanted to echo one of Dave's comments from Wellington next stage, next door neighbors that we had

1664
02:38:44,243 --> 02:38:54,331
emailed some of our questions and many of them are actually to the, not just to Peter, but to the city or the state, whoever can answer them.

1665
02:38:54,931 --> 02:38:58,834
So we would appreciate their discussion acknowledgement as well at some point.

1666
02:39:02,177 --> 02:39:03,057
Okay, great.

1667
02:39:03,077 --> 02:39:03,438
Thank you.

1668
02:39:03,458 --> 02:39:08,902
I think I have it, the document pulled up.

1669
02:39:09,877 --> 02:39:13,960
Um, so I guess with that, we will close public comments.

1670
02:39:14,401 --> 02:39:17,843
Um, I will open it up for now the board discussion.

1671
02:39:17,863 --> 02:39:28,932
Um, if there's any discussion that the board wants to have any questions, um, anything that was kind of sparked from the public comments, raise your hand.

1672
02:39:34,757 --> 02:39:35,097
Uh, Dina.

1673
02:39:38,352 --> 02:39:38,692
Here I am.

1674
02:39:39,293 --> 02:39:46,757
One of the things I heard from the public comments, in addition to the concerns of traffic, is a study on the impact to local schools.

1675
02:39:47,137 --> 02:39:48,358
I think I heard somebody say that.

1676
02:39:48,958 --> 02:39:59,684
To see with the increase, especially with the affordable housing, that there would definitely be an impact to the students, the impact to the neighboring schools on that.

1677
02:39:59,784 --> 02:40:02,706
So we'll have to get that in the notes as well.

1678
02:40:03,946 --> 02:40:04,687
That's a good call out.

1679
02:40:06,578 --> 02:40:07,718
And then, of course, traffic.

1680
02:40:07,778 --> 02:40:19,503
And I think one of the things I'll do is I'm going to take a ride down to 9th Street and take a look at all that, because I'm going to become even more familiar with the area.

1681
02:40:24,326 --> 02:40:28,928
Prepare to be attentive.

1682
02:40:34,445 --> 02:40:52,318
Yeah, there's clearly a lot of neighborhood context issues that need to be resolved, and I feel like this is the first of, I imagine, a couple of different meetings to try to resolve this, and it's going to take a lot of effort by the city and the state and the stakeholders here to try to bring this one over the finish line.

1683
02:40:52,358 --> 02:40:53,679
I assume we can get there.

1684
02:40:56,120 --> 02:41:20,472
I do agree with what someone commented earlier that it seemed like the standards of looking at proximity to transit for generating cars doesn't seem to be, in my opinion, as valuable data as what we have right around us that are comparable projects that are virtually the same walking distance to Wellington and have been around for years.

1685
02:41:20,712 --> 02:41:22,573
And I think that goes true for also the

1686
02:41:23,573 --> 02:41:24,374
the school impact.

1687
02:41:24,474 --> 02:41:34,379
You know, I've been hearing this for many decades that there are people concerned that they're going to be, Memphis is going to be building new schools because we built, because we've added so many apartments.

1688
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:35,920
It never happens.

1689
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:36,921
It just doesn't.

1690
02:41:37,121 --> 02:41:49,568
The demographics are just different and more diverse and they're not, you know, just, but I'll leave that to Peter and to the, again, for the surrounding impacts and the historical data.

1691
02:41:50,588 --> 02:41:56,955
of the literally two or three thousand apartments that have been built at a half mile of this to prove that out.

1692
02:41:58,596 --> 02:42:12,790
I think there's a lot of questions out there and I would like to understand my first time on this board, my first meeting, how we can continue this dialogue with Peter and the design team at MBAR so that we come to the next meeting

1693
02:42:13,992 --> 02:42:23,963
narrowing the issues as much as possible, trying to solve things as we can, and still making sure the public is heard, especially the neighbors on 9th Street and the surrounding neighborhood.

1694
02:42:29,068 --> 02:42:31,191
Would you like us to respond at this point?

1695
02:42:32,053 --> 02:42:33,495
Yeah, if you want to.

1696
02:42:34,035 --> 02:42:35,136
Sure.

1697
02:42:35,557 --> 02:42:43,605
So first, with respect to the request for an estimate of the number of school children, we're happy to provide that for informational purposes.

1698
02:42:43,665 --> 02:42:53,976
We didn't provide that previously because it's not one of the site plan review criteria that Medford has established, but for your informational purposes, we're happy to provide that.

1699
02:42:55,901 --> 02:43:13,511
You know, I certainly understand that everyone is looking for more information on traffic and, you know, the city traffic engineer has coordinated with our traffic engineer and did provide input into how the traffic study was approached.

1700
02:43:13,831 --> 02:43:19,355
And we did receive his comments and have responded to them.

1701
02:43:20,375 --> 02:43:30,443
where those responses were submitted today and I didn't see them added to the sort of publicly available document file this afternoon.

1702
02:43:30,463 --> 02:43:43,473
I certainly understand not everybody has had a chance to review those at this point, but I do think that some of the information that was provided will be helpful in addressing some of the comments and questions that were raised.

1703
02:43:45,754 --> 02:43:54,519
I did hear a suggestion from the 9th street committee that it be helpful to start thinking about how we put some of this in writing.

1704
02:43:54,539 --> 02:43:59,901
I think that can be a useful way to start narrowing the issues.

1705
02:43:59,981 --> 02:44:02,863
So, if it's acceptable to the board.

1706
02:44:03,544 --> 02:44:17,160
we would propose to submit a draft decision for your consideration so that you can start to think about conditions at your next continued meeting, which I understand would be October 15th, if that's right?

1707
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:18,462
Correct.

1708
02:44:21,366 --> 02:44:21,566
Great.

1709
02:44:23,267 --> 02:44:40,713
Um, and then a point of clarification, Alicia, Danielle, uh, just for the board, uh, just so that we're aware of the types of things that we can be either requesting, um, or the types of changes that can be imposed on a project like this.

1710
02:44:42,074 --> 02:44:48,016
Um, could you just maybe restate those and then so the public also has an understanding of that?

1711
02:44:49,387 --> 02:44:57,390
Yeah, so there's specific criteria outlined in the ordinance of what you take into account.

1712
02:44:58,150 --> 02:45:00,091
School-age children is not one of them.

1713
02:45:01,771 --> 02:45:09,934
In fact, we can't limit the bedroom sizes or discourage children from coming to these, living in these developments.

1714
02:45:10,674 --> 02:45:18,437
The state specifically put in language in 3A that you can't age restrict and that you have to be able to allow

1715
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:24,445
developments that are suitable for families, and they specifically use that language.

1716
02:45:24,505 --> 02:45:33,993
So having three bedrooms or more, so there's no asking to reduce bedroom sizes to discourage children, nothing like that.

1717
02:45:34,073 --> 02:45:35,374
That would be completely illegal.

1718
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:44,706
But as Doug mentioned, these developments tend not to actually generate that many kids.

1719
02:45:45,987 --> 02:45:53,633
And as a city, it is our obligation to educate any students that come to Medford.

1720
02:45:54,413 --> 02:45:57,216
And we will make it work, whether it's

1721
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:04,062
adjusting the boundaries of which schools go where.

1722
02:46:04,102 --> 02:46:10,364
We do have two elementary schools that are under enrolled and the high school is also under enrolled.

1723
02:46:10,404 --> 02:46:11,444
They're not at capacity.

1724
02:46:11,484 --> 02:46:16,125
We just, we have two schools that are crowded, but that's going to be addressed.

1725
02:46:16,185 --> 02:46:25,348
So I wouldn't really go down the road too much of impacts on schools because it's not something you can take into consideration.

1726
02:46:26,150 --> 02:46:27,752
All right, thank you.

1727
02:46:27,792 --> 02:46:28,072
Sean?

1728
02:46:29,273 --> 02:46:30,514
Yeah, question.

1729
02:46:30,534 --> 02:46:41,645
So I think every single public comment had to do with 9th Street and traffic on 9th Street and what's going to be done with 9th Street.

1730
02:46:41,745 --> 02:46:43,747
And I totally understand that.

1731
02:46:44,208 --> 02:46:47,571
Has there been any discussion with the abutters

1732
02:46:49,780 --> 02:47:06,886
about perhaps bringing that street up to public spec and then petitioning the city to make that a public way and perhaps gaining some more control over traffic once it's a public way using the powers that the city might have available to them?

1733
02:47:13,269 --> 02:47:17,010
I'll let the developer answer.

1734
02:47:17,912 --> 02:47:18,112
Peter.

1735
02:47:18,132 --> 02:47:20,573
Chairman, I'm happy to respond to that.

1736
02:47:20,713 --> 02:47:25,195
And again, I want to be perfectly clear, I don't speak for the 9th Street neighbors by any means.

1737
02:47:25,696 --> 02:47:27,616
But we have had conversations.

1738
02:47:27,656 --> 02:47:46,125
We've actually, what I want to refer to is the conversation back with the city traffic engineer, which I think, just for this reference point tonight, who had, during our discussions with our design team, talked about the pros and cons.

1739
02:47:46,965 --> 02:47:52,189
of bringing a road up to certain levels and then have it be accepted.

1740
02:47:52,209 --> 02:47:55,871
The pros being the city now owns repaving.

1741
02:47:55,911 --> 02:48:00,354
The pros being maybe there's more enforcement.

1742
02:48:01,695 --> 02:48:09,980
The cons being that the private stakeholders now are at the whim of the city in terms of paving, when they pave, when they don't pave, and what they do.

1743
02:48:11,041 --> 02:48:17,103
And probably even more specifically traffic calming measures and the ability to do traffic calming measures.

1744
02:48:17,123 --> 02:48:25,606
1 of the pros of it being a private way, and I'm not advocating either, but 1 of the pros is that the, the, the owners of the private way.

1745
02:48:27,106 --> 02:48:38,669
have within their ability to do traffic calming measures that perhaps the city wouldn't do, or wouldn't get around to, or wouldn't want to do, or any number of things the private owners do.

1746
02:48:38,709 --> 02:48:40,870
So I think there's pros and cons to that conversation.

1747
02:48:40,890 --> 02:48:45,251
Again, I don't take a position on that for the purposes of this conversation here.

1748
02:48:45,831 --> 02:49:04,430
I think, just to give you a little color, and I don't want to speak out of school, the conversations we're having are about traffic calming, about things candidly to bring the street to a better condition, but also the true condition being lessen the impact of the cut through.

1749
02:49:05,452 --> 02:49:12,402
And that being a major source of concern, I've heard questions about guest parking and where that's going to happen.

1750
02:49:12,422 --> 02:49:20,914
I think if okay with the chair and the board, I think the suggestion of drafting a decision for you to see, we'll start to see types of things that we.

1751
02:49:21,655 --> 02:49:31,407
As to what we can control ourselves and what we can do in our building, we want you to see affirmatively language to make you comfortable with the fact I'm going to use guest parking as an example about making.

1752
02:49:31,828 --> 02:49:33,209
It's not just the 2 spaces.

1753
02:49:33,229 --> 02:49:40,739
As a matter of fact, the 2 spaces on middle sex are actually more marketing for people coming to the place to look at the, but there's guest parking in the garage and.

1754
02:49:41,279 --> 02:49:42,661
and to play some of that stuff out.

1755
02:49:42,781 --> 02:49:50,308
In the interim, we're going to continue the conversations with the 9th Street neighbors and figure out ways that work for everybody.

1756
02:49:50,889 --> 02:50:00,958
Again, this hasn't happened to date, going back decades and decades and decades of private ownership, so we're corralling, if you will,

1757
02:50:01,619 --> 02:50:09,621
Decades of relationships and things here and trying to come to a conclusion, or at least a better place.

1758
02:50:09,981 --> 02:50:10,802
And I think we will.

1759
02:50:11,962 --> 02:50:18,124
But I demur as to the ultimate question about private-public way.

1760
02:50:18,684 --> 02:50:18,864
Yeah.

1761
02:50:18,884 --> 02:50:20,504
I appreciate it, Peter.

1762
02:50:22,865 --> 02:50:28,507
And yeah, I think the board sees a lot of proposals in front of it, and I think

1763
02:50:30,658 --> 02:50:37,795
There's an obvious demonstration of intention that you guys are putting forward that.

1764
02:50:39,908 --> 02:50:42,830
takes into account, I think, the concerns of 9th Street.

1765
02:50:42,930 --> 02:50:46,071
And I think it's good to see from a board perspective.

1766
02:50:46,111 --> 02:50:57,897
And I think I would personally be excited to try to help support that collaboration in ways that we could build mutual trust.

1767
02:50:58,098 --> 02:51:08,043
And if that's helping put forward a good faith agreement between the residents of the community.

1768
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:13,553
which it sounds like you guys have been doing some thinking and thinking too and discussions with.

1769
02:51:14,754 --> 02:51:16,275
John, do you have anything additional?

1770
02:51:19,857 --> 02:51:28,322
Yes, I would just appreciate it if someone could, I've never been on a site review plan before.

1771
02:51:28,942 --> 02:51:34,785
So I would appreciate and perhaps some of the other new members would as well, how this usually plays out.

1772
02:51:34,946 --> 02:51:36,867
I mean, we're gonna get more public comments

1773
02:51:38,063 --> 02:51:41,224
You know, typically, how long does this go on?

1774
02:51:41,284 --> 02:51:42,104
How many meetings?

1775
02:51:43,044 --> 02:51:45,085
Just some idea of.

1776
02:51:46,645 --> 02:51:57,949
And I guess the ultimately what happens is we can request some changes or can we put specific conditions on our approval?

1777
02:51:58,129 --> 02:51:59,809
I mean, you know, how does this play out?

1778
02:52:01,089 --> 02:52:03,010
I think Danielle can probably speak to that.

1779
02:52:04,005 --> 02:52:04,865
Yes, I'm sure.

1780
02:52:05,746 --> 02:52:06,326
Yes, John.

1781
02:52:06,606 --> 02:52:09,107
I'm also happy to chat with you offline.

1782
02:52:09,127 --> 02:52:15,028
Yeah, because this is the 1st site plan review we've had in a while.

1783
02:52:15,048 --> 02:52:18,870
We've been living and breathing zoning amendments for so long.

1784
02:52:18,890 --> 02:52:19,590
This is a nice.

1785
02:52:19,670 --> 02:52:19,910
I know.

1786
02:52:20,517 --> 02:52:23,959
I almost forgot that this was part of the work.

1787
02:52:24,139 --> 02:52:29,843
I mean, there are other new members too, who I would imagine.

1788
02:52:29,923 --> 02:52:30,283
Yeah.

1789
02:52:31,724 --> 02:52:33,265
Every project is different.

1790
02:52:33,325 --> 02:52:35,266
It depends on the scale.

1791
02:52:35,946 --> 02:52:45,932
Some projects are less complicated, don't have a lot of issues and could

1792
02:52:46,468 --> 02:52:57,735
You can conceivably get through in one meeting and not even need to add many conditions because you're satisfied with what they propose initially.

1793
02:52:57,755 --> 02:53:01,277
It could take several.

1794
02:53:01,377 --> 02:53:14,544
I fully expected that this would take at least two, so I did not draft any draft conditions or try to make any recommended findings.

1795
02:53:16,714 --> 02:53:18,536
I plan to do that for the next meeting.

1796
02:53:18,576 --> 02:53:30,165
I also like to hear from the residents and, um, you know, the applicant presentation, because that also, you know, brings up issues that maybe we weren't aware of.

1797
02:53:30,826 --> 02:53:42,195
So, um, this is like the listening meeting and then, um, you know, kind of, you know, sitting with it and thinking about it and seeing what the changes are and then, um,

1798
02:53:46,528 --> 02:53:49,757
Ultimately, it's up to the board how many meetings you need.

1799
02:53:52,198 --> 02:54:02,924
I might also add what's helpful is that the department head comments, those typically frequently will get incorporated as conditions of the project, but it's not.

1800
02:54:03,325 --> 02:54:05,606
So this project is considered by right.

1801
02:54:05,966 --> 02:54:17,593
So this board cannot deny this project and they cannot unreasonably condition it to the point where it is like a financially infeasible project, because that would be effectively denying it.

1802
02:54:18,713 --> 02:54:29,439
But what has happened, and I apologize that it went up quite late this evening, but the department had sent concerns and conditions to the applicant.

1803
02:54:30,519 --> 02:54:36,142
They actually, so those you were able to see, the applicant's responses went up late this evening.

1804
02:54:37,203 --> 02:54:41,245
They're in your packet now, but they weren't there before six o'clock tonight.

1805
02:54:41,265 --> 02:54:45,487
We received them today, and I can't do thinking instantaneously.

1806
02:54:45,825 --> 02:54:46,025
Right.

1807
02:54:46,085 --> 02:54:51,207
But you'll be able to see them and where they say, yes, we're going to do this.

1808
02:54:51,728 --> 02:54:55,209
Then this board will or should I should put it that way.

1809
02:54:55,249 --> 02:55:02,132
I don't tell you what to do, but should just incorporate those as conditions, because that will allow city staff to hold them to those comments.

1810
02:55:02,212 --> 02:55:02,472
Right.

1811
02:55:02,752 --> 02:55:05,233
This is a situation of trust, but verify.

1812
02:55:05,713 --> 02:55:09,195
And the verify part is that once it's in a condition, then it's legally binding.

1813
02:55:10,235 --> 02:55:19,584
But if something is very expensive and they say that's not possible, like if you told them to cut their building in half, that would be something that they just couldn't do.

1814
02:55:20,044 --> 02:55:26,289
And they would say that you're ruining, you're killing the project, and you don't actually have the authority to kill the project.

1815
02:55:26,309 --> 02:55:27,711
Just to give you a sense of scale.

1816
02:55:30,002 --> 02:55:36,266
And Danielle will help, as she mentioned, help draft recommended conditions.

1817
02:55:36,627 --> 02:55:43,531
But this board can always come up with other conditions that are off the department, that are not on the department head list and not on Danielle's list.

1818
02:55:43,912 --> 02:55:49,215
And then the applicant and staff can guide you as to whether that's a reasonable condition.

1819
02:55:51,077 --> 02:55:52,758
Planting a tree might be reasonable.

1820
02:55:53,378 --> 02:55:57,341
Reconfiguring Revere Beach Parkway is not reasonable.

1821
02:55:57,861 --> 02:55:58,082
Yeah.

1822
02:55:58,102 --> 02:55:58,502
Thank you.

1823
02:55:59,545 --> 02:56:00,205
Thank you, Alicia.

1824
02:56:04,286 --> 02:56:08,027
I know it's getting late and I want to be mindful of time.

1825
02:56:08,047 --> 02:56:10,887
Sean, did you have anything else?

1826
02:56:11,927 --> 02:56:23,110
If none of the other board members have any comments, I would like to make a motion that we continue this hearing to the next scheduled meeting date.

1827
02:56:23,250 --> 02:56:24,250
I like the sound of that.

1828
02:56:25,515 --> 02:56:35,581
Um, uh, and then I, I'm also excited, I think for the next meeting, um, you know, the board reads all of the public comments.

1829
02:56:35,621 --> 02:56:41,644
So if you have additional things you want to email, um, do send them to us, uh, especially from the ninth street committee.

1830
02:56:41,865 --> 02:56:44,446
If there's just, you know, if you give more thought to, um,

1831
02:56:47,984 --> 02:56:54,807
the proposal and considerations that you want the board to make that will give us breathing time to digest it and think about it.

1832
02:56:54,827 --> 02:57:03,051
And we're looking forward also to the information from Peter and his team with the conversations with 9th Street.

1833
02:57:03,071 --> 02:57:08,774
So I like the motion to continue to a date certain.

1834
02:57:09,174 --> 02:57:12,776
The next meeting will be the 15th of October.

1835
02:57:14,476 --> 02:57:15,477
Is there a second?

1836
02:57:16,445 --> 02:57:16,985
for that motion?

1837
02:57:17,906 --> 02:57:20,868
Seconded.

1838
02:57:20,928 --> 02:57:22,069
Great, John seconded.

1839
02:57:22,509 --> 02:57:27,312
So I will do roll call vote, or not roll call vote, but I'll call folks for vote.

1840
02:57:28,453 --> 02:57:28,933
John?

1841
02:57:28,953 --> 02:57:29,013
Aye.

1842
02:57:29,033 --> 02:57:33,736
All right, Guffman Fishman is not present.

1843
02:57:34,477 --> 02:57:35,397
Dina Calagaro?

1844
02:57:36,158 --> 02:57:36,418
Yes.

1845
02:57:37,779 --> 02:57:38,359
Doug Carr?

1846
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:40,761
Yes.

1847
02:57:40,961 --> 02:57:41,642
Sean Began?

1848
02:57:42,082 --> 02:57:42,402
Yes.

1849
02:57:43,283 --> 02:57:44,824
And myself, Adam Behrens, is a yes.

1850
02:57:46,117 --> 02:57:48,761
And so we will continue the discussion in October.

1851
02:57:48,781 --> 02:57:54,507
And we're looking forward to seeing the turnout from the community.

1852
02:57:54,527 --> 02:58:00,775
And then hopefully we can kind of quickly get to any conditions and clarity on the project.

1853
02:58:04,276 --> 02:58:08,838
If that is, I guess that is the end of the agenda.

1854
02:58:10,679 --> 02:58:14,020
And so there are no additional items on the agenda for tonight.

1855
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:16,521
Wasn't there approving the minutes?

1856
02:58:17,581 --> 02:58:20,222
Yes, I just meant for the public.

1857
02:58:20,322 --> 02:58:25,104
And so we will now turn to the minutes.

1858
02:58:25,685 --> 02:58:28,105
I believe there are no minutes from the previous meeting.

1859
02:58:29,857 --> 02:58:30,858
So there's no action there.

1860
02:58:31,598 --> 02:58:35,381
So the only remaining item is a motion adjournment.

1861
02:58:35,841 --> 02:58:36,061
Yeah.

1862
02:58:36,542 --> 02:58:37,863
I make a motion to adjourn.

1863
02:58:38,843 --> 02:58:39,204
Great.

1864
02:58:39,284 --> 02:58:39,884
Thank you, Dina.

1865
02:58:40,364 --> 02:58:40,825
Second.

1866
02:58:41,665 --> 02:58:42,086
Thanks, Sean.

1867
02:58:42,106 --> 02:58:44,647
So I'll do a vote.

1868
02:58:45,548 --> 02:58:46,208
John Anderson.

1869
02:58:46,649 --> 02:58:46,969
Yes.

1870
02:58:48,650 --> 02:58:49,471
Dina Caliguero.

1871
02:58:49,751 --> 02:58:50,131
Oh, yes.

1872
02:58:51,332 --> 02:58:51,732
Doug Carr.

1873
02:58:52,853 --> 02:58:53,193
Yes.

1874
02:58:54,894 --> 02:58:55,435
Sean Began.

1875
02:58:55,855 --> 02:58:56,976
Yes.

1876
02:58:57,016 --> 02:58:58,197
Myself, Adam Behrens is a yes.

1877
02:59:00,258 --> 02:59:01,879
So we are adjourned for tonight.

1878
02:59:01,899 --> 02:59:02,619
Thank you, Adam.

1879
02:59:04,219 --> 02:59:05,920
Great job, Adam.

1880
02:59:08,320 --> 02:59:08,720
Good job.

1881
02:59:09,020 --> 02:59:10,001
My pleasure.

1882
02:59:10,621 --> 02:59:11,041
Thank you.

1883
02:59:11,121 --> 02:59:22,084
And board members, don't forget that we do actually need to elect chair, vice chair, and clerk, which we are happy to discuss with any of you offline if you would like to discuss that further.

1884
02:59:22,684 --> 02:59:22,984
OK.

1885
02:59:24,485 --> 02:59:25,505
Recording stopped.

1886
02:59:26,805 --> 02:59:27,586
Good night.

1887
02:59:28,026 --> 02:59:28,446
Good night.

1888
02:59:28,906 --> 02:59:29,226
Thank you.
