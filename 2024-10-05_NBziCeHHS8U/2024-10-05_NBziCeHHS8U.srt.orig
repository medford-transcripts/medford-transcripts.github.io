17
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:27,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you to my fellow colleagues for co-sponsoring this resolution or lead sponsoring it, President Morrell.

18
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,885
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had the robotics team up here a few weeks ago.

19
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,366
[SPEAKER_11]: They were heading off to this championship.

20
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:42,231
[SPEAKER_11]: They were raising money and just wanted to congratulate them on their great success and wish them even more luck in the future.

00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:42,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:43,271

[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Sang.

24
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:45,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

25
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:51,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having Councilor Bares and I on this resolution.

26
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:57,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great opportunity to showcase the great work that's happening at Medford High.

27
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:04,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sometimes it goes a little understated, but the students and teachers up there are up to some really great work.

28
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:09,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the robotics team is a great way to highlight that, and it's truly a pride of our community.

29
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:32,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was fortunate to be able to visit the high school a few weeks ago, and it's truly, there's so much stuff up there that's happening that doesn't get enough attention, and it really behooves us to bring more attention to great, really, I think, really great stuff that's happening like this.

30
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:34,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

31
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:34,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kerrio.

32
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:35,746
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

33
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:38,847
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was able to actually see the robot,

34
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:44,488
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was built by these young students.

35
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:49,610
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know, the scary part was they're all freshmen and sophomores.

36
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,371
[SPEAKER_20]: Just imagine the work they're going to do when they get to be juniors and seniors.

37
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:56,452
[SPEAKER_20]: So congratulations on their work.

38
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:59,313
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's a real bright spot for our high school.

39
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

40
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:22,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, if I could just add, really want to congratulate them and you know thank them for the many hours they spent in the council chambers when we first recognized them so they performed excellent so hopefully it didn't impact them too much those hours spent with us, and they did note on their GoFundMe page that this placing in the top 50% was a huge jump from last year, their first year competing where they placed in the bottom 10%.

41
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Councilor Carvillo said,

42
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:28,439
[SPEAKER_02]: all returning students, and they have some exciting things ahead of them.

43
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations to the team once again.

44
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

45
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,163
[SPEAKER_02]: As I'm jumping ahead.

46
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:43,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, Madam President, I think that when the students did come up, you could see the excitement.

47
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:51,689
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm proud of is really we sent a challenge out there and how everybody rallied financially to support

48
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:56,672
[SPEAKER_04]: this group so they can go and represent Netrid at that championship level.

49
00:03:56,712 --> 00:04:07,041
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that, you know, they deserve all the credit they received from us, but it's glad to see that this community really supports our kids.

50
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:07,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

51
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:08,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Fevella.

52
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:13,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

53
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:20,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Behrs.

54
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:22,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

55
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:22,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

56
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:23,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

57
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:23,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

58
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:23,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

59
00:04:23,684 --> 00:04:24,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

60
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:24,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

61
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:25,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

62
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:25,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

63
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:26,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

64
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:59,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send a special thank you to the recreation director Kevin Bailey his lifeguard staff at school Medford fire and Armstrong ambulance for their quick response and saving the life of a drowning youth at Tufts pool.

65
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:03,457
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, I can approach the podium.

66
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:22,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

67
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a few friends here tonight and I'm glad they can make it.

68
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:42,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was a few weeks ago, we had a very scary and horrific situation and dangerous situation occur over at the Tufts pool.

69
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:54,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And something that would have really put our community, I think, in a real tailspin, and it would have affected so many lives in a negative manner, especially the young person that was drowning.

70
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:04,575
[SPEAKER_04]: When I heard this situation, I was fortunate that my daughter is a lifeguard and she's trained by the best.

71
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:18,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always thought, as the assistant recreation director, I have 40 lifeguards, I have two pools, and wanted to make sure that our staff is trained the correct way.

72
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:25,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny, because when I called Kevin and I said, Kevin, I'm going to put this up, he says, don't put our names on this.

73
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:27,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about us, it's about the kids.

74
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But it wouldn't be fair.

75
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:38,425
[SPEAKER_04]: if we didn't acknowledge yourself, Kevin, and Danny, folks, for your leadership in what you do for our kids.

76
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:46,008
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't know, I asked Kevin to come over and train my lifeguards in Somerville a few weeks ago, and I appreciate he did that.

77
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:47,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a reason for it.

78
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:50,470
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the best in the state at what he does.

79
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And for what happened that day,

80
00:06:55,865 --> 00:07:03,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I had a great conversation with my friend Osman and said, you know, what happened and how graphic the whole situation was.

81
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:08,097
[SPEAKER_04]: When you hear a kid drown, a kid who's drowning, what do you think?

82
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:11,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, he was flailing his, no.

83
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,462
[SPEAKER_04]: To hear the whole description of,

84
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,384
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, getting the call and the lifeguards all running into action.

85
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:22,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and Osmond seeing the young person at the bottom of the pool and how, how was it called?

86
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:29,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, uh, he was pinned, I guess, face first on the, on the floor of the pool and everybody went into action.

87
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:30,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And

88
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:40,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that needs to be told, and it needs to be elevated, and our lifeguards and our staff need to be congratulated.

89
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:44,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the whole story, it's phenomenal.

90
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:49,026
[SPEAKER_04]: The buzz went around within 15 minutes around Medford, how Osmond went right in the water.

91
00:07:50,290 --> 00:08:14,117
[SPEAKER_04]: did exactly what he was trained to do, bring him to the top, turn, the backboard was on site, staff was there, they took the person, the young person on the deck, everybody's in action, everybody, I know that the pool manager right away knew her role, the fire department was called, and in typical fashion, Osmond said to me, he says, no, Mr. Scapelli says, the firemen were amazing.

92
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:17,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what the whole team, they all knew what to do.

93
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:26,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I talked to the fire department, they said, no, no, it's a young person who jumped in and brought, all we had to do was get there and then do what we're trained for.

94
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:27,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's save a life on the deck.

95
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:35,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So between Armstrong ambulance and the fire department and Kevin's training,

96
00:08:36,915 --> 00:09:04,792
[SPEAKER_04]: What I really wanted to do tonight is just acknowledge you as quickly as we can, because I know a lot of you young people off to college and we won't see you for a few months, but we contacted the clerk and he put together a citation for you that, you know, this is probably, I've given out a thousand citations, champions in sports, academic awards, music awards, right, drama club,

97
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:09,722
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the most amazing citation that we're giving out tonight.

98
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:12,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so I'm so happy for that.

99
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:16,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what you people did, right?

100
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:23,535
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know chief chief just walked in, I said, I know, you know, give him kudos and his staff for what the fire department chief

101
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:33,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you don't like the accolades and that's your job, but the fact that the firefighters and the lifeguards work together to save a life.

102
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:38,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we did is we put a citation together.

103
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:48,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It reads, the Memphis City Council takes great pleasure in presenting this council accommodation to, this is our manager at the pool.

104
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,172
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I'm told, she's like,

105
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:54,215
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like the den mother, and she's taking care of everything at the pool.

106
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Danielle DelBene.

107
00:09:56,317 --> 00:10:02,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And for your quick and heroic response and saving the life of a drowning youth at Tufts Pool.

108
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,484
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can come on up and take a citation, Danielle.

109
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:14,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on here.

110
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:20,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you can, everybody knows how Zach likes to be taking pictures with everybody.

111
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to take a big picture with everybody.

112
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:24,265
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

113
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:30,068
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.

114
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:31,548
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like this.

00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:03,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

145
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:04,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

146
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:04,445
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

147
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:05,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

148
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:16,882
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to take this opportunity to thank the lifeguards and every and the staff at the pool for just attention to detail, being alert and doing their job.

149
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:26,644
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason this rescue happened was because the team came together, starting with them being alert, realizing there was a problem.

150
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:29,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody jumped into action.

151
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:32,905
[SPEAKER_17]: The fire crews got on scene under two minutes.

152
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:33,745
[SPEAKER_17]: I checked the CAD.

153
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:36,326
[SPEAKER_17]: We had EMS on scene.

154
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:39,906
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm definitely going to put these crews in for an accommodation.

155
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Just haven't got around to it yet, been really busy.

156
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:47,008
[SPEAKER_17]: But when I looked into this, obviously,

157
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:52,066
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the team came together at the perfect time and the outcome is a life was saved.

158
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:54,428
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what we like to see.

159
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:59,651
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not always how it goes, but this particular incident went that way, starting with the lifeguards.

160
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:03,114
[SPEAKER_17]: They had the patient out of the water on the board.

161
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:08,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Engine five gets there and they realize, you know, there's an obstruction there.

162
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:15,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Get the patient on his side, you know, remove that obstruction and then rescue breathing.

163
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:23,345
[SPEAKER_17]: ambulance gets on scene, patient transported, and the end result is the patient is released from the hospital and doing well.

164
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:31,694
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to take this opportunity to quickly to just again thank everybody and thank the council for recognizing them.

165
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:33,075
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

166
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:34,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Chief.

167
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:35,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you again.

168
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other councillors would like to speak on this resolution?

169
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:46,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Sang.

170
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:51,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be brief since I think Councillor Scarpelli did such a great job telling us about everything.

171
00:16:51,806 --> 00:17:04,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what really stands out to me and what Councillor Scarpelli said was that all the teamwork and the coordination and the heroism that came through in this story.

172
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:16,982
[SPEAKER_03]: and the humility from everyone here and even accepting the awards and accepting the accolades today, the humility really shines through.

173
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:25,527
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a community, I think it's really important that we take this moment and both reflect on the heroism that you all showed.

174
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:31,511
[SPEAKER_03]: but also celebrate all the work that you all have been up to.

175
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:37,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys really are, this is the star, the shining star of Medford.

176
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all so much.

177
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:41,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Sen.

178
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:44,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor and Councilors.

179
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:51,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just again speak briefly I know Councilor Scarpelli covered all but thank you so much Councilor Scarpelli for introducing this.

180
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent years in high school as a pool lifeguard, and I probably spent most of my hours just telling people not to run.

181
00:17:57,533 --> 00:18:06,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never had this challenging moment where all of your training comes into action and it's you know it's, it's, it's everything changes in a matter of seconds.

182
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:09,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so proud of you all and so impressed with you all.

183
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:17,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an incredible thing that you all did with Metro Fire, with Armstrong Ambulance, but it's so much for young people to do something like this.

184
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:21,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really proud that you guys call Medford home and work in Medford.

185
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for your service.

186
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:35,568
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to add just a few extra things in there as well.

187
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:44,917
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I also think this is really an important time to not only acknowledge the lifeguards for the skills that they did, but all of the lifeguards that work both at the pond and the pool.

188
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:49,902
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that we talk about a lot in our lifeguard class is that you're part of a lifeguard team.

189
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:52,204
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's not just an individual person.

190
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:57,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a perfect example that you can see in an incident that we had

191
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:01,378
[SPEAKER_13]: team itself was able to quickly act.

192
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:12,887
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just one person who performed the rescue, but it's everyone knowing exactly what needed to happen with the removal, with rescue breathing, with getting the BVM out there, with clearing the pool.

193
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:15,169
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is a team.

194
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:19,152
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things that I think a lot of people don't realize is that

195
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:26,378
[SPEAKER_13]: This wasn't just this didn't happen because of a miracle, or we got lucky.

196
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:27,659
[SPEAKER_13]: This is through training.

197
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:35,245
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is something that the lifeguard spent a lot of time and not only during the academic year taking the lifeguard in class, but the month of June.

198
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:40,131
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a very, very busy month because we spend weekends doing orientation.

199
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:49,820
[SPEAKER_13]: We practice specifically, not just in a lifeguard class, but at the pool, how to handle that emergency or when we're at right spot, how to handle it, how to handle a missing child.

200
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:51,762
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot of extra hours.

201
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:53,403
[SPEAKER_13]: These kids are in the water.

202
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:58,728
[SPEAKER_13]: As you remember, in the beginning of the season, we're in the pool right when it fails, it's freezing out.

203
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:09,850
[SPEAKER_13]: they're in there, they're practicing, and it's not just the lifeguards here, but the rest of the lifeguard team, the extra work, the hard work that goes into getting the pool ready for the season and being prepared.

204
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:21,232
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, I want to thank the lifeguards, and I really want to thank the rest of our lifeguard team, because it is really remarkable what happened, and again, the amount of training that they do to prepare for it.

205
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:22,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

206
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Director Bailey.

207
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:23,693
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can.

208
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

209
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:32,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, to that point, I know that I see it firsthand.

210
00:20:32,186 --> 00:20:43,277
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it's pouring outside, and Gianna asked my wife to get eight beach towels, because they have training and we said it's pouring, and it's 52 degrees out.

211
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:45,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And we said, What is Kevin thinking?

212
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:45,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

213
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: And I take that all back, have whatever I was going to publicly tell you.

214
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the reason why.

215
00:20:52,365 --> 00:21:02,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And Janet, just like probably the rest of the lifeguards, they go gladly because situations like this because and people don't realize it's just not a it's just not a clean, safe pool all the time.

216
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:02,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

217
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:07,165
[SPEAKER_04]: all of our lifeguards also train with your staff and yourself at the pond.

218
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:10,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a difficult, especially with bad weather.

219
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:15,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and it's two different types of positions.

220
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So these kids really commit themselves and your staff.

221
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we appreciate what you guys have done and you made us look really, really good in this community.

222
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's one family that's very, very happy today.

223
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:27,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

224
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:27,924

[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

365
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:51,670
[SPEAKER_12]: I mostly wanted to so you do have a memo from the CD board with their recommendation that they recommend.

[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the applicant is here.

371
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:20,045
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like to just for we did get that memo at just about five today in email.

372
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:24,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And this originally came before the council, I believe on May 23, was referred to refer to the CD board.

373
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:25,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's back before us.

374
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:27,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, just for clarification.

375
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:30,871
[SPEAKER_04]: This was just for at the time was for over 300 units.

376
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:32,052
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't mixed use correct.

377
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:33,973
[SPEAKER_04]: My refresh my memory.

378
00:32:34,472 --> 00:32:40,134
[SPEAKER_12]: On the details of the project, the applicant is here and they are prepared to present on it if you would like them to.

379
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:54,460
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a residential building with one commercial unit on the first floor with the idea that it's right next to the T stop, but it's a large number of residential units and I wouldn't want to say how many without.

380
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,701
[SPEAKER_12]: checking my notes.

381
00:32:56,041 --> 00:33:00,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate that you're here, because I think this is the question that I had back then.

382
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:05,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, especially with that area and getting a lot of feedback on what's happening there.

383
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:16,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And what the T's interpretation of what their wishes are, and the rumors that what they want to do with that space and the airspace of that area.

384
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of variables that are in place there.

385
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:25,622
[SPEAKER_04]: miss out they said so I'm, I'm just a little concerned that what question I had back then was, what is our vision.

386
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:35,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you can share something with us because when you look at neighboring communities, and you know look at Linfield look at assembly row, look at station landing when that was done.

387
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:40,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done with a comprehensive plan of what that whole area was going to look like.

388
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:55,321
[SPEAKER_04]: In essence, we're looking at one piece of what else and I think that's what, you know, people are asking for and personally myself as a gateway entrance to our community exit to our community, you know what, what do we see there what we envision.

389
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:55,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

390
00:33:56,065 --> 00:34:12,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that is something that we have talked about, we've talked about with the public, if we could do whatever we wanted, because I want to acknowledge the rumors it for the MBTA has an interest in putting a an electric bus depot and repair facility there.

391
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:16,087
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have concerns with the ability to put

392
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:25,631
[SPEAKER_12]: because we would still have the right to put residential, commercial, mixed-use life science above that, about how strong the building would have to be, et cetera.

393
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:35,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I have significant concerns about putting a critical facility, like an electric bus facility, right there next to the Amelia Earhart Dam, where there's high risk of flooding.

394
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:39,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Where on the other hand, we're not going to not develop these areas.

395
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,820
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll build the buildings with the understanding that there's a potential for flood,

396
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:52,315
[SPEAKER_12]: But the buildings would not be critical infrastructure facilities designed for electric vehicles.

397
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:57,577
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have been trying to work with the MBTA to try and identify a different location for that.

398
00:34:58,017 --> 00:35:05,840
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know the mayor is also working with other layers of DOT about how do we find a different location for their electric bus facility.

399
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,001
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's sort of like the elephant in the room.

400
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:13,482
[SPEAKER_12]: In a big picture way, what we envision there

401
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:29,904
[SPEAKER_12]: is a mixed use facility with restaurants and commercial entities, stores, shops on the first floor, some sort of parking garage, because we do need parking there for the people who would live and work there, as well as people would get on the train.

402
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:41,669
[SPEAKER_12]: But one would assume that the people living there would be less likely, on average, to own vehicles, because you would literally be living one to two minute walk from a train station.

403
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,764
[SPEAKER_12]: and where buses do come through.

404
00:35:44,265 --> 00:36:05,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what we have, we did the RFI, we got a lot of proposals, I think it was nine, and they all envisioned a mix of residential and commercial life science spaces in that, so that it would be a mix of different buildings, people, it would be a live work kind of community, like we see directly across the river at Assembly Row.

405
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:10,386
[SPEAKER_12]: We know there is demand for this kind of facility gathered around a T stop.

406
00:36:10,803 --> 00:36:12,444
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is what we are looking at.

407
00:36:13,164 --> 00:36:21,768
[SPEAKER_12]: We are working on the MBTA communities rule, and this is the area that it looks like we need to use as our district for that.

408
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:25,729
[SPEAKER_12]: We are getting ready to do some public meetings around that.

409
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:29,111
[SPEAKER_12]: We're hoping to roll some of that out in say August, September.

410
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:38,335
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we have been contemplating with the consultant is something where what we would recommend is gonna be on the order of

411
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:44,905
[SPEAKER_12]: three stories by right, because that's the density that is required to meet MBTA communities.

412
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:56,690
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're not allowed to require mixed use, we're not allowed to require additional affordable housing, and we're not allowed to require more energy efficient buildings than the code allows.

413
00:36:57,191 --> 00:36:59,311
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we can incentivize those things.

414
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:02,973
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we're planning to put forward in front of the community for this area

415
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:08,958
[SPEAKER_12]: is that they could get up to six stories if they layered in those additional things that we want.

416
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:15,544
[SPEAKER_12]: So the zoning would allow three by right six under this with these additional things.

417
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:19,607
[SPEAKER_12]: The Muzz district is the other side of the T station.

418
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:30,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will say that our office contemplated asking you to also rezone the MBTA parcel that is between this parcel under consideration tonight and

419
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:34,164
[SPEAKER_12]: station landing, station landing is the Muzz zone.

420
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:41,866
[SPEAKER_12]: And to include that in this, and then it would be one large continuous area that would allow, that would be for this.

421
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:48,647
[SPEAKER_12]: MBTA is not bound by our zoning, so it doesn't actually impact what they wanna do there.

422
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:58,630
[SPEAKER_12]: And as long as it's owned there and we need to do some larger RFP process on the air rights, we need to do the MBTA rezoning,

423
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:04,074
[SPEAKER_12]: we decided that it would complicate matters if we were to ask you to also rezone that parcel.

424
00:38:04,474 --> 00:38:08,835
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you look at the map that you were provided, it would actually make a nice contiguous area.

425
00:38:09,296 --> 00:38:18,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is the only parcel that's not part of the MBTA property that's not already part of the Muzz zone on that side of Revert Beach Parkway.

426
00:38:18,538 --> 00:38:22,139
[SPEAKER_12]: So in that sense, this makes a lot of logical sense to go on.

427
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,259
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where we sort of see this in a vision.

428
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:27,500
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that I think I mentioned at that meeting

429
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:47,139
[SPEAKER_12]: is that when a developer is ready to build a building and it's something that you know is going to be in demand and that your community wants, if you say to them, wait 18 months or 12 months and you'll be able like and we'll change the zoning, they don't like that and they go develop their building somewhere else and they go build it elsewhere.

430
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:53,705
[SPEAKER_12]: So we see Criterion as an excellent partner, a developer that has done further work up the river.

431
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,046
[SPEAKER_12]: They own the

432
00:38:55,425 --> 00:39:03,410
[SPEAKER_12]: or they've developed the property on River's Edge, some of the residential buildings there they're developer of, and they do very excellent work.

433
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:16,938
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that they wanna build here right now, we said, this is a good way to move this forward quickly and allow them to do something that will set the stage for what we're looking for and would fit in with a larger development at that location.

434
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,739
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where we're coming from on this.

435
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:20,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I appreciate the answer.

436
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the biggest concern that I'm hearing from the neighbors

437
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:38,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And personally, I think that, you know, I was fortunate being a member of a municipality that was actually directly involved as we talked about with this new zoning consultant coming in plus the team that will be going out to each neighborhood.

438
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:43,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to get, you know, as recreation, I was in all meetings as well.

439
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go represent recreation at the different neighborhood meetings to talk about the vision of that area.

440
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:52,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it's nice that

441
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:58,183
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you explained it perfectly and I completely understand, but if we keep doing the spot zoning.

442
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:05,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not a big comprehensive, you know, master plan that everybody wants to share.

443
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that you get the word out as best you can.

444
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:19,613
[SPEAKER_04]: neighbors from that area, when you're talking about that area, they really, when we talk about this project after we voted the last time and they said 300 some odd units, what are we going to do with that neighborhood?

445
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:29,817
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing to calm them to understand what, you know, you're talking about Rivers Edge, you're talking about what's happening down the street in Everett, and now we're adding 300 more units.

446
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:51,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I think having the community input, that's why I implore the city, the administration, to really, and I can make this form of motion, to give us an update where we are with the hiring of our consultants as well as partners so we can work together to get this done because, like you said, waiting a year and a half

447
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:53,368
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not gonna wait.

448
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:58,870
[SPEAKER_04]: But imagine what we've already lost because we don't have a comprehensive plan, because we don't have the tools in place.

449
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can get that going, if we can put that out, we'd appreciate it, Mr. Clerk, Madam President, and thank you for your answers.

450
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:05,232
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.

451
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:15,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam President, the CD board meeting was a public hearing, which was duly noticed, and we did not get any public comment at that meeting.

452
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:17,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to share, I appreciate that, but again.

453
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:20,785
[SPEAKER_04]: when it's affecting neighbor direct neighborhoods.

454
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand we post and we do that.

455
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:23,989
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds great.

456
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:32,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, as well as I do, unless people are directly impacted, and they know what's going on, that they really don't know what's going until all of a sudden shovels in the ground, like no one told us.

457
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:39,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not true, but it's what's then promoted.

458
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:58,989
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanna make sure that it's mentioned, it's not your fault, I know you do what you're supposed to do, but I think having this piece in place, and as we talked about, putting that piece with the zoning and having the team that's gonna go out to the neighborhoods and really get what everybody's input, I think that's what a true partnership is with the community and our zoning.

459
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate that.

460
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:03,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

461
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:11,013
[SPEAKER_20]: Not that I don't support this, just a little, I'd like to see where this fits into the big plan in that area.

462
00:42:11,053 --> 00:42:20,902
[SPEAKER_20]: That's, I mean, I, and I think what we're doing, I mean, this is, this is really, with spot zoning, it was just something that we've haven't done in the past and we really

463
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:42,035
[SPEAKER_20]: never liked doing that's that's I think we're sitting a little bit of a bad precedent there by doing this but it's another I'm not I am going to support it but I'd like to see where this fits in the plan overall because right now all I'm looking at is a building in the corner and you know and I don't see the vision that goes with it but that's where the concern is if

464
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:50,312
[SPEAKER_20]: If there's some type of plan, even some kind of conceptual plan, share with us so we know how this is going to fit in with everything else.

465
00:42:50,352 --> 00:42:52,614
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I've heard the same thing from T people.

466
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:57,099
[SPEAKER_20]: This is going to tease, you know, not happy about what's happening over there with the air rights.

467
00:42:59,361 --> 00:42:59,561
Thank you.

468
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:00,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Collins.

469
00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:01,902
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

470
00:43:02,422 --> 00:43:06,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Director Hunt for presenting on this and giving us all the context around it.

471
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:14,747
[SPEAKER_19]: I certainly hear my fellow councilors observation about, you know, observations around doing things piece by piece.

472
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:16,247
[SPEAKER_19]: I completely empathize with that.

473
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:17,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that we're all, you know,

474
00:43:19,237 --> 00:43:22,998
[SPEAKER_19]: think that this mechanism is kind of a bridge between what we have now and where we know we're going.

475
00:43:23,038 --> 00:43:24,299
[SPEAKER_19]: We have the comprehensive plan.

476
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:26,159
[SPEAKER_19]: We have the existing character of the neighborhood.

477
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,440
[SPEAKER_19]: We know what there's demand for.

478
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,401
[SPEAKER_19]: We know what's currently there.

479
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:36,563
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have plans to do a comprehensive rezoning and make sure that all of our neighborhoods are kind of brought into alignment with our comprehensive plan.

480
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:44,306
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that this PDD mechanism is a way to make sure that we don't miss out on these opportunities while we're still ramping up for that comprehensive

481
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:45,486
[SPEAKER_19]: project.

482
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:46,387
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm really glad that we have it.

483
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:49,488
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think any of us want to bypass these opportunities while they're on the table.

484
00:43:50,149 --> 00:44:01,374
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, at the same time, very much looking forward to when we can do this within the structure of a comprehensive, you know, no or very few exceptions needed kind of zoning paradigm.

485
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:06,297
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would motion for approval after many of my fellow councillors additional comments.

486
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:07,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

487
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:08,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Councillor Seng.

488
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:14,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Director Hunt, for presenting to us and telling us a little bit more about the area.

489
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:25,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read through the RFPs that we've seen, the nine that you talked about, read through this administration's press releases about it, and looked through the comprehensive plan and things like that.

490
00:44:25,638 --> 00:44:32,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And between all of those documents and what you're saying today, which completely corroborates everything there, I do

491
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:38,428
[SPEAKER_03]: see the picture for the Wellington area.

492
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:59,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a picture I think that because I think a lot of most of your decisions as a department is taken from that, the public input process that's gone into the comprehensive plan and the housing plan and all of that, I think is one that aligns particularly well with the goals of the city and the goals of our residents.

493
00:44:59,364 --> 00:44:59,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I spend like

494
00:45:01,137 --> 00:45:06,279
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit less than two or three days in Wellington a week.

495
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:19,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a lot of, especially younger folks, but there's a lot of momentum on the ground for making Wellington a more interesting place, a place where people can afford to buy houses.

496
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:28,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And even with wealthier residents, a lot of wealthier residents, maybe a little bit older than me, they want a chance to buy

497
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,611
[SPEAKER_03]: what buy units here too.

498
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:36,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And even for the units they could theoretically afford in Medford, it's a whole competition to buy them.

499
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And this would, you know, increasing housing stock is a really, really important way of tackling our housing crisis.

500
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:54,784
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in another world, I definitely hear my colleagues in that we prefer not to spot them or not, not to focus on individual parcels of land.

501
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:56,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But

502
00:45:56,265 --> 00:46:11,857
[SPEAKER_03]: that given the urgent nature of urgent nature of the housing crisis, given the vision that I think we generally have in our city for transit oriented development and multi and mixed mixed use development.

503
00:46:12,678 --> 00:46:14,559
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, this is a project I think

504
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,720
[SPEAKER_03]: is promising for our city.

505
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you made the excellent point that waiting is shooting ourselves in the foot.

506
00:46:23,362 --> 00:46:29,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen this time and time again with housing, with development in Medford, with a lot of projects.

507
00:46:31,604 --> 00:46:33,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a mistake in the past.

508
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:36,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to make sure that we're not giving into it.

509
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:41,467
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not accidentally shooting ourselves in the foot now.

510
00:46:41,587 --> 00:46:43,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's really, really important to hear.

511
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:59,275
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, I really do look forward to working more with your department and with the zoning consultants on implementing the shared vision I think all of us behind the rail have for the area and for the city.

512
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:08,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, I'm a very big fan of what you said about incentivizing affordable housing and energy efficiency and all of that.

513
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:12,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would second Councilor Collins' motion.

514
00:47:12,894 --> 00:47:39,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And Madam President, I do just want to make sure that everybody is aware that this approves the zoning that would allow this project to be built, but the project would then need to go through site plan review, which is when it goes under another round of public meetings and the CD board would weigh in on a lot of the details of the design, as well as any mitigation that would be anticipated from this project.

515
00:47:40,029 --> 00:47:43,051
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want you to know that that piece of it, it's just another step.

516
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:50,936
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want anybody to think that they would get a building permit and be able to start building next week, but we would think they would apply and move through the process quickly.

517
00:47:51,196 --> 00:47:53,537
[SPEAKER_12]: But there is another chance to weigh in on this.

518
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:54,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Director.

519
00:47:54,298 --> 00:47:55,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Two things before I go to Vice President Behrs.

520
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:57,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost the first one.

521
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Second one, Councilor Scarpelli.

522
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is a public hearing, so I do need to open it up.

523
00:48:01,983 --> 00:48:02,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

524
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:03,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

525
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,067
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's my fault.

526
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:14,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I did so we did get a response actually, I think it was last week right after the holiday that we didn't get a response to our RFP for the zoning consultant.

527
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:22,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Director Hunt has offered to have some folks in her department reach out and call folks who normally submitted proposals and ask why they didn't and how we can update that.

528
00:48:23,408 --> 00:48:27,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy to take that as a B paper, but that's something I'm trying to get to deliver to the council.

529
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:31,312
[SPEAKER_11]: The last day was June 29th or 30th.

530
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:33,593
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was right before the holiday.

531
00:48:33,673 --> 00:48:39,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there were 15 or so who had pulled the thing, but did not submit an application.

532
00:48:39,957 --> 00:48:43,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have names of people who were maybe interested, but then didn't actually apply.

533
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:49,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just to remind us of the process, because I forgot to, we did also, we had a committee of the whole where we talked about what we wanted in that RFP.

534
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:51,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what we get back.

535
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:53,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

536
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:57,147
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm also happy to take that as a paper ticket, you know, have a paper trail on it.

537
00:48:57,227 --> 00:49:05,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So as this is a public hearing, to open a public hearing for people who would like to speak in favor of the petition, I assume the applicant is here.

538
00:49:05,472 --> 00:49:07,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume he would like to speak in favor.

539
00:49:07,514 --> 00:49:10,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of the petition before us?

540
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:14,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Please come up to the mic and folks can raise their hands on Zoom as well.

541
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can simply say, yes, I'm in favor, or you can say a little bit more.

542
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam President and members of the council.

543
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,524
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight.

544
00:49:25,044 --> 00:49:30,809
[SPEAKER_16]: You know it's funny to speak in favor of Jack Englert 37 Walnut Street Wellesley.

545
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:39,816
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the first step, and we did start to reach out to the community to understand the needs of the community and we want to focus on that.

546
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:41,813
[SPEAKER_16]: But we are just the first step.

547
00:49:41,893 --> 00:49:49,337
[SPEAKER_16]: And once it if it we're lucky enough to have it rezone, we can then start the formal processes as missing mentioned.

548
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:56,042
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that our jump starting the area over there at Wellington would be a good thing.

549
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:58,663
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have only one commercial space on the first floor.

550
00:49:58,683 --> 00:49:59,824
[SPEAKER_16]: We're contemplating another

551
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:09,236
[SPEAKER_16]: was spoken to the MWR Mr. River Watershed Association about possibly moving in there to try to really open up this area to the community.

552
00:50:09,276 --> 00:50:10,358
[SPEAKER_16]: And so while it is

553
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:14,347
[SPEAKER_16]: at the infancy stage of getting that all redeveloped.

554
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:27,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I think having a jumpstart with one project like ours and having the access to the river and all the things we're gonna try to do in completing the path, I think it will prove beneficial to the overall vision for the area.

555
00:50:27,336 --> 00:50:33,179
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm hoping that you'd consider this as a step in the right direction and one that we could move forward with.

556
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

557
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the petition?

558
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:43,779
[SPEAKER_00]: William Navar, 108, Medford Street, apartment 1B.

559
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:46,380
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say I'm in favor of the petition.

560
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:56,043
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, it's gonna add more housing, including the affordable housing under the inclusionary zoning ordinance, and we need more housing.

561
00:50:57,023 --> 00:51:09,054
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of sense, in particular, to put the housing near the transit, both because that's where it makes most sense, but housing, but also because of the MBTA zoning law, as Director Hunt noted.

562
00:51:10,415 --> 00:51:17,941
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it'd be good if you approve this, so that way that can happen and we don't have to wait needlessly.

563
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:18,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

564
00:51:18,862 --> 00:51:19,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

565
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:22,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

566
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:27,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

567
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:32,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the petition before us, either on Zoom or in person?

568
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:40,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

569
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:46,381
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a motion from Councilor Collins to, sorry, I'm just embarrassed.

570
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:47,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

571
00:51:48,598 --> 00:51:55,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think on this specific parcel if you look at the zoning map and you look at the district and you look at the developments around the area.

572
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:59,723
[SPEAKER_11]: it's already beyond spot zone that already doesn't make any sense.

573
00:52:00,043 --> 00:52:12,772
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually brings this parcel in alignment with the neighboring parcels, certainly with the MUZ zone across the MBTA parcel, but also with Modera across the street and the apartments and the condos on ninth.

574
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:20,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's all a jumble over there and there's a ton of apartments that are on I districts right now that got approved through variances.

575
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:26,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And we don't have to have the debate about variances again, but this basically is taking a parcel that's currently

576
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:46,387
[SPEAKER_11]: basically being used as a private parking lot by I think we operated by lazy parking and doing something with it, opening up access to the river, and it is falling under inclusionary zoning and as director noted, this is just a change to the zoning district for the

577
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:56,805
[SPEAKER_11]: area, they still have to, it's going to be a major project subject to site plan review, so it still has to go through all of the standard permitting and development processes.

578
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:03,528
[SPEAKER_11]: given that it's certainly not, I don't know what, I don't see anyone building a factory there.

579
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:06,289
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's basically all that we're gonna let them do under the I zoning.

580
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:09,010
[SPEAKER_11]: This seems reasonable to me.

581
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:16,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have some questions that I won't ask you now that I'll ask you later about the other zoning that we're talking about and the incentives.

582
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:25,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I just have some questions about that, but separate from this project and the whole Wellington air rights is adjacent to, but separate process from this project.

583
00:53:26,585 --> 00:53:27,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Barris.

584
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:42,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we take Councilor Collins motion, yeah, I also just want to add I think Director Hunt for, you know, talking about the potential flooding in the area that proposed or theorized electric bus charging station, understanding the challenge that would be there.

585
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:49,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing that this is a first step of how it might help us meet some of the requirements of the MBTA communities, of course, housing that we absolutely need.

586
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: the inclusionary zoning approach, and just this being, as Vice Mayor Behrs pointed out, just a really underutilized lot, it's a surface parking lot, largely.

587
00:53:57,343 --> 00:54:05,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is a real opportunity to open it up and hopefully bring some great transit-oriented things to the area with step one, with updating the zoning in this area.

588
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:17,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a motion from, oh, sorry, we have a beat paper from Councilor Scarpelli to get an update from the administration on the zoning consultant process, seconded by,

589
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:24,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Carviello, Councilor Nye has dropped off due to technical issues, so I will take that as a voice vote.

590
00:54:24,818 --> 00:54:25,438
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

591
00:54:26,678 --> 00:54:27,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

592
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:28,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

593
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:31,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the main paper, which is zoning paper, so it's five votes to pass.

594
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a motion by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

595
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,701
[SPEAKER_02]: To approve, do you want to approve pending the six-day public comment period?

596
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:44,842
[SPEAKER_19]: I would motion to waive the comment period.

597
00:54:44,862 --> 00:54:46,522
[SPEAKER_19]: I motion to approve waiving the comment period.

598
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:54,450
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a motion from Councilor Collins to approve and waive the 60 public comment period, seconded by Councilor Sang.

599
00:54:54,850 --> 00:55:04,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

600
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:18,041
[SPEAKER_08]: President Morrell.

601
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:22,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

602
00:55:24,345 --> 00:55:25,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to 23-339.

603
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:40,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Legal notice of a public hearing, petition for grant of location, the trustees of Tufts College, electrical ducting, conduits for future data cabling, sleeves for future heating, cooling pipes, Medford masks, city clerk's office.

[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of this petition is to connect the Tufts University athletic fields to the Tufts University Fitness Center's electrical power supply.

00:56:49,669 --> 00:56:59,440
[SPEAKER_02]: The properties are located at 161 College Avenue and 0 Andover Street in Medford, part of the Medford Assessors Parcels T----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

610
00:57:05,185 --> 00:57:06,565
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed, motion passes.

611
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:10,206
[SPEAKER_02]: We have petitioners here, and I think we probably have folks on Zoom as well.

612
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:13,207
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can just tell us a little bit about the grant application before us.

613
00:57:14,028 --> 00:57:14,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

614
00:57:15,128 --> 00:57:19,029
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm attorney Adam Dasch from Adam Dasch & Associates, 48 Grove Street in Somerville.

615
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:24,451
[SPEAKER_15]: With me via Zoom is Ruth Bennett, Senior Director for Capital Programs from Tufts University.

616
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:26,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Also with me is Jack DeMello.

617
00:57:27,091 --> 00:57:32,573
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a request by Tufts for a grant application at College Avenue to dig and lay certain utilities and other things

618
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:39,356
[SPEAKER_15]: as stated in the application for the purpose of connecting the Tufts athletic fields to the Tufts Fitness Center electrical power supply.

619
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:43,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Plans are filed with the grant petition showing the details.

620
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Our team is here to answer any questions that you may have about that.

621
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:50,707
[SPEAKER_15]: And we respectfully request that the grant application petition be approved.

622
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:52,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

623
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:53,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

624
00:57:53,147 --> 00:58:02,269
[SPEAKER_20]: I had a chance to read this and I know in the past, we've received a lot of complaints from neighbors because currently Tufts is not running generators to run those lights.

625
00:58:03,249 --> 00:58:08,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Once this is in, there'll be no need for them to run generators to power up those lights.

626
00:58:09,411 --> 00:58:10,951
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll quiet down the neighborhood there.

627
00:58:11,211 --> 00:58:12,251
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think this is a good thing.

628
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:13,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

629
00:58:14,552 --> 00:58:15,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other discussion from Councilors?

630
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:21,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, do we open up?

631
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:22,132
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a petition.

632
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

633
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:24,573
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's a petition.

634
00:58:24,613 --> 00:58:24,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

635
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:26,254
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's a public hearing.

636
00:58:26,274 --> 00:58:26,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

637
00:58:27,054 --> 00:58:27,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Again.

638
00:58:29,075 --> 00:58:34,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas this is a public hearing, I need to open up the portion of public hearing for anyone who would like to speak in favor of the petition.

639
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:38,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone here who would like to speak in favor of the petition assuming you vote?

640
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack Tamello with Leg McCall Properties.

641
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,202
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in favor.

642
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:45,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

643
00:58:45,718 --> 00:58:47,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

644
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:50,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none.

645
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:52,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a representative of Tufts on?

646
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

647
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, go.

648
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:54,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

649
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:59,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, I'm Ruthie Bennett, senior director of capital programs with Tufts University.

650
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Clearly I'm in favor of it.

651
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:10,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually the generators have been removed because permanent power has been brought to the baseball field where the lights were needing the generator.

652
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:13,185
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're progressing along and getting permanent power.

653
00:59:13,565 --> 00:59:13,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

654
00:59:15,323 --> 00:59:16,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

655
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:18,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

656
00:59:21,165 --> 00:59:23,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

657
00:59:23,445 --> 00:59:29,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this petition, either on Zoom or in person?

658
00:59:32,047 --> 00:59:34,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

659
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:37,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other questions from the council?

660
00:59:38,448 --> 00:59:39,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

661
00:59:39,629 --> 00:59:41,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, if you have a question, go ahead, Councilor Sviprok.

662
00:59:42,691 --> 00:59:48,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that looking at the map, it looks like really the only public interruption is going to be on College Ave.

663
00:59:49,737 --> 00:59:56,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see that everything's been signed off and everything's approved by the engineer and the city electrical department.

664
00:59:56,642 --> 01:00:02,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't see anything that will prohibit this council from voting, so I'll move to approve.

665
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:03,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

666
01:00:03,551 --> 01:00:10,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I was going to do the same, just move to approve subject to the conditions outlined by the city engineer.

667
01:00:10,475 --> 01:00:11,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

668
01:00:11,456 --> 01:00:12,196
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just have one question.

669
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:14,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the length of time for this amount of work?

670
01:00:15,038 --> 01:00:15,798
[SPEAKER_07]: The length of time?

671
01:00:15,858 --> 01:00:16,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack?

672
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:20,641
[SPEAKER_07]: The electrical until data portion would be about four weeks.

673
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:25,783
[SPEAKER_07]: The portion associated with the future

674
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:32,638
[SPEAKER_07]: but the future heating and cooling pipes would be approximately three months.

675
01:00:33,078 --> 01:00:36,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and would that be back-to-back, or would there be a pause in between?

676
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:56,650
[SPEAKER_07]: At the moment, we're planning the electrical and until data for this summer, trying to wrap that up prior to students returning, and then deferring the heating and cooling component until next summer when traffic is reduced in the area.

677
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

678
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:05,562
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion from Councillor Scarpelli to approve with the conditions set by the engineering office, seconded by the vice of affairs.

679
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:16,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

680
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:17,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

681
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:17,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

682
01:01:17,426 --> 01:01:17,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

683
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:32,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

684
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:33,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

685
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:33,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

686
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:34,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

687
01:01:34,051 --> 01:01:34,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

688
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

689
01:01:38,355 --> 01:01:40,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

690
01:01:40,237 --> 01:01:50,067
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-370, offered by Councilor Carvalho, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council contact the DCR to clean and mow the grass at Route 16, especially in the Main Street Bridge area.

691
01:01:50,127 --> 01:01:50,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Carvalho.

692
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:52,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

693
01:01:52,243 --> 01:01:53,664
[SPEAKER_20]: It's something that I put up many times.

694
01:01:54,524 --> 01:02:03,987
[SPEAKER_20]: The DCI is very lax in cleaning up Route 16, especially from along the river, right through the Main Street Bridge.

695
01:02:04,007 --> 01:02:06,208
[SPEAKER_20]: You can see there's rubbish all over the road.

696
01:02:06,428 --> 01:02:08,129
[SPEAKER_20]: The grass is now four feet high again.

697
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:16,372
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something that we shouldn't have to be asking for every year, something that should be done on that whole strip of road.

698
01:02:16,772 --> 01:02:18,832
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, we get it done as soon as possible.

699
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:25,659
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, you know, the curb appeal in our city is poor residents, and that makes it look even worse.

700
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:29,243
[SPEAKER_20]: But like I said, there's rubbish all over the place, and the grass has just grown crazy.

701
01:02:29,263 --> 01:02:34,028
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I'll reach out to our state delegation if we have to get it done.

702
01:02:34,328 --> 01:02:34,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

703
01:02:35,249 --> 01:02:35,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Sang.

704
01:02:36,395 --> 01:02:42,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Councilor Caravello, for putting this on agenda, I walk across that bridge before every city council meeting.

705
01:02:43,682 --> 01:02:49,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you're right that we shouldn't have to ask about any of this.

706
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:50,908
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that they should be on top of.

707
01:02:51,628 --> 01:02:59,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I know councillors, you've been on top of, really on top of it, councillors, other councillors too have,

708
01:03:01,997 --> 01:03:12,742
[SPEAKER_03]: also, you know, brought up the need for DCR to be more on top of it when it comes to Medford to, to talk to people from their office for them to reach out to us as well to have that clear channel communication.

709
01:03:12,782 --> 01:03:19,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I do wish that, do wish that happens, but I think, I think Councilor Kerrio will put this on agenda.

710
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:23,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other discussion from the Council?

711
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:27,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Mr. Castagnetti with his hand up.

712
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:41,360
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank councillors.

713
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, and again for many years bringing up the situation.

714
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,407
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the most dangerous intersection in the city.

715
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:53,150
[SPEAKER_18]: It's still pretty dangerous, especially when you have four foot weeds.

716
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:54,612
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an obstruction of view.

717
01:03:55,578 --> 01:04:05,626
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may, I ask and I request to the council if you can add a second location, and that would be Roosevelt Circle.

718
01:04:06,087 --> 01:04:12,632
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're in Memphis Square and you get on 93 North, your first exit is at Roosevelt Circle.

719
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:19,217
[SPEAKER_18]: You will notice weeds that are probably five feet high on the left, and these cars coming around.

720
01:04:19,237 --> 01:04:21,639
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a bad intersection on a good day.

721
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:22,640
[SPEAKER_18]: Many accidents there.

722
01:04:23,374 --> 01:04:26,196
[SPEAKER_18]: And as of last week, the weeds were five feet high.

723
01:04:26,216 --> 01:04:27,997
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an obstruction of view.

724
01:04:28,377 --> 01:04:33,641
[SPEAKER_18]: If one of you would please attach this location for the DCR to cut it down, please.

725
01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:35,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

726
01:04:35,582 --> 01:04:38,724
[SPEAKER_02]: The clerk is telling me that that's DOT.

727
01:04:38,864 --> 01:04:42,947
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll call someone for you.

728
01:04:43,787 --> 01:04:44,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

729
01:04:44,868 --> 01:04:47,530
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, what was the answer?

730
01:04:48,811 --> 01:04:52,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually MassDOT and the clerk will call since he has

731
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:54,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Long history.

732
01:04:54,137 --> 01:04:55,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

733
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:56,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

734
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

735
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,741
[SPEAKER_18]: You take that exit also.

736
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:08,369
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Kerrio, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

737
01:05:08,429 --> 01:05:09,210
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

738
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:09,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

739
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:20,969
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-371 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

740
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:30,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council get a response from the Mayor and School Department dealing with the special permission for school committee members being allowed to park their recreation vehicle on the school property.

741
01:05:30,853 --> 01:05:33,555
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get a response from the Superintendent earlier today.

742
01:05:33,575 --> 01:05:35,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I will turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli.

743
01:05:35,576 --> 01:05:36,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

744
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:46,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I received many phone calls about a recreational vehicle that was parked at Medford High School for some days.

745
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:52,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And I quickly called the superintendent and we had a great discussion.

746
01:05:52,763 --> 01:06:05,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And the understanding was that the word was that it was the registration came back to a school team member and the questions and the concerns of the neighbors saying that

747
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:11,664
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there was special treatment, that this isn't right, this is a problem.

748
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:14,191
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of...

749
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:19,658
[SPEAKER_04]: continue with the back and forth.

750
01:06:19,738 --> 01:06:24,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I contacted the superintendent and what she said in her response, she sent this today.

751
01:06:24,702 --> 01:06:26,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read it if I can, Madam President.

752
01:06:27,724 --> 01:06:42,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for clarification, the superintendent did say that I am providing the following information in response to the listing of a motion on tonight's city council agenda offered by city council, George Scappelli, regarding the use of parking facilities in the grounds of Memphis High School.

753
01:06:42,895 --> 01:06:54,684
[SPEAKER_04]: The owner of the recreational vehicle currently parked in Method High School received permission after making a request to the high school principal who has full and appropriate authority over the use of school grounds, including parking.

754
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:59,849
[SPEAKER_04]: The vehicle is set to be moved from the school grounds on or about July 14th.

755
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:00,929
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past,

756
01:07:02,042 --> 01:07:26,192
[SPEAKER_04]: With the explicit permission of the school department and buildings principal, school parking has been made available for use by individual Medford residents, other city departments, including the Department of Public Works and Public Safety Department, public and private contractors for temporary parking of construction machinery and other entities and organizations, including film crews working in the city of Medford.

757
01:07:26,952 --> 01:07:27,753
[SPEAKER_04]: In each case,

758
01:07:28,633 --> 01:07:40,719
[SPEAKER_04]: the school parking space will not in any way impede or interfere with student employee or public access to school facilities.

759
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:44,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Please feel free to contact me additional information.

760
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is exactly what the superintendent did say.

761
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:51,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, that's all it just clarification that.

762
01:07:52,044 --> 01:07:57,968
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is the case, then it's given permission, then I think that's a new point.

763
01:07:58,028 --> 01:08:00,470
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make sure that I shared that.

764
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:04,452
[SPEAKER_04]: People have their own opinions one way or the other.

765
01:08:05,072 --> 01:08:11,957
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, if residents are seeking permission to park a vehicle at the high school, there is an avenue.

766
01:08:11,977 --> 01:08:13,458
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was asking for policy.

767
01:08:13,938 --> 01:08:16,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's probably the biggest

768
01:08:20,518 --> 01:08:45,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I get out of this conversation and this resolution is if we can, just if this is common practice, which I don't disagree, we've seen commercial vehicles, we've seen other vehicles parked there, that the policy be made public because if this is an option, because we do have residents that from time to time have a very difficult time parking their boats or recreational vehicles or

769
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:51,181
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and sometimes during, you know, during for months now, this isn't again, this isn't all summer.

770
01:08:51,762 --> 01:09:00,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, as long as the policies, it's written, it's it's in, it's transparent, and I have no problem with it.

771
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:01,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Madam President.

772
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the discussion.

773
01:09:06,746 --> 01:09:12,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President, motion received in place on file on the motion of vices and affairs to receive a place on file.

774
01:09:15,044 --> 01:09:16,445
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed motion passes.

775
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:22,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Communications from the mayor 23-333 June 7 2023 motion to waive the reading.

776
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:25,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is table from our last meeting.

777
01:09:25,974 --> 01:09:27,895
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the request.

778
01:09:28,055 --> 01:09:34,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go to a further this is a request from the mayor to request to recommend the honorable body approve the appropriation of retained earnings the amount of 500,000

779
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,319
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars and zero cents.

780
01:09:37,379 --> 01:09:42,463
[SPEAKER_02]: This amount is being requested to subsidize the fiscal year 2024 Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund budget.

781
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:45,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Retained earnings are reserves of the Water and Sewer Fund.

782
01:09:45,025 --> 01:09:55,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Reserves can be used for any lawful purpose and can serve to provide financial security in cases of unforeseen events or to reduce the need for additional revenue from the increased water and sewer rates.

783
01:09:55,814 --> 01:10:05,142
[SPEAKER_02]: At our previous meeting, Councilor Knight invoked Rule 22 regarding the appropriation, which says any money papers can be laid on the table when they're first introduced.

784
01:10:06,837 --> 01:10:09,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have any discussion from the council?

785
01:10:09,098 --> 01:10:18,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a vote to, this is a vote to be able to use their earnings of $500,000 to provide financial security, I'm sorry, to subsidize the fiscal year 2024 water and sewer enterprise fund.

786
01:10:28,745 --> 01:10:31,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam President, if I can, thank you.

787
01:10:31,907 --> 01:10:51,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I was a strong, I was against the budget and anything dealing with funding for the city, especially after our hearing a month ago and the discussions of understanding that the numbers that were in the budget that were given to us weren't correct.

788
01:10:52,139 --> 01:11:02,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And until I see otherwise, I know Councilor Carviello did his due diligence by reaching out to the company that provided those numbers to the city.

789
01:11:03,063 --> 01:11:14,547
[SPEAKER_04]: They were very clear that the numbers that the financial director mentioned that this company was fraudulent in putting the numbers out, they were wrong.

790
01:11:15,207 --> 01:11:16,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Councilor Carviello can speak to it.

791
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:22,753
[SPEAKER_04]: They told us that those are the exact numbers that the city of Medford gave to them.

792
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:36,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I will not support any money paper dealing with this year's budget because we still have many questions and many concerns of where this funding is coming from.

793
01:11:36,903 --> 01:11:37,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

794
01:11:37,804 --> 01:11:38,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

795
01:11:38,604 --> 01:11:39,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice Mayor Behrs.

796
01:11:39,785 --> 01:11:40,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

797
01:11:43,227 --> 01:12:05,078
[SPEAKER_11]: given what we heard in our discussions about the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund in our budget meetings last month, and given what discussion we were able to have prior to the invocation of the rule on the 20th, it seems very clear to me, and it would seem pretty clear from what the Water Sewer Superintendent and the DPW Commissioner were saying, is that the

798
01:12:05,893 --> 01:12:09,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Water and sewer infrastructure is basically aging out.

799
01:12:09,176 --> 01:12:13,200
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hitting, for much of it, it was installed 100 plus years ago.

800
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,881
[SPEAKER_11]: That's basically the life of the pipes.

801
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:30,776
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's significant need for large investments in repairing our water and sewer infrastructure, given that it says right here, reserves can be used for any lawful purpose and can serve to provide financial security in cases of unforeseen events.

802
01:12:32,177 --> 01:12:43,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should keep this money in the water and sewer budget for the use of addressing any emergencies or for the use of investing in capital improvements, the water and sewer system.

803
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:49,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe before this was tabled that

804
01:12:52,225 --> 01:12:54,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember, maybe it was DPW Commissioner McGivern.

805
01:12:54,486 --> 01:13:06,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to put words in his mouth because it was three weeks ago, but he said something to the effect of that this would be like a dollar a month for the average consumer if this retained earnings was put on reducing the rate.

806
01:13:07,211 --> 01:13:14,034
[SPEAKER_11]: So versus this could be used to make $500,000 of investments and repairs in the water and sewer system.

807
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:14,994
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't support it.

808
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:15,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

809
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:16,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Mr. Ferris.

810
01:13:18,736 --> 01:13:19,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President moral.

811
01:13:20,157 --> 01:13:21,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I also don't support it.

812
01:13:21,738 --> 01:13:22,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, Councilor beers.

813
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:34,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think it summarizes my, my point, I think it was pretty clear from the, from the comments from the water and sewer superintendent and the Commissioner public works.

814
01:13:35,349 --> 01:13:48,792
[SPEAKER_03]: at the budget meetings and also in conversations before, that it wouldn't be unrealistic to say that we are fast approaching potential catastrophe with our water and sewer infrastructure.

815
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:56,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I don't want people to get too worried because we're planning it out, we're managing it, but this is part of

816
01:13:57,234 --> 01:14:00,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Voting this down, I believe, is one of the steps to planning it out.

817
01:14:01,259 --> 01:14:04,684
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the steps to preventing that from happening.

818
01:14:05,925 --> 01:14:09,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We also heard from them that there are a number of challenges with

819
01:14:11,999 --> 01:14:15,640
[SPEAKER_03]: not even just the age of our infrastructure, but the lead and the materials.

820
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:24,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be not only health punishments for our city going forward, but fiscal punishments as well.

821
01:14:24,842 --> 01:14:38,066
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I believe that in this case, it's the fiscally responsible choice to invest now in our city's infrastructure before we pay a bigger price down the road.

822
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:39,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

823
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:40,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Carvalho.

824
01:14:41,001 --> 01:14:51,467
[SPEAKER_20]: So if I understand this right, so my fellow councilor is saying to put the $500,000 back into the water and sewer and not give any rate relief to the residents, correct?

825
01:14:52,407 --> 01:14:54,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's what, yeah, what Vice Mayor is saying.

826
01:14:54,368 --> 01:14:59,331
[SPEAKER_20]: But for those who don't know, the Water Commission voted an 8% increase in the water bill tonight.

827
01:15:00,572 --> 01:15:05,835
[SPEAKER_20]: So I know $500,000 doesn't go a long way, but it does help somewhat.

828
01:15:07,782 --> 01:15:14,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's probably all I believe the reason that the water and sewers voting such an increase is because of the maintenance needs going up.

829
01:15:14,629 --> 01:15:22,757
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of six to one half of this and the other we've, my understanding is that we've been using retained earnings for a long time to keep rates down, instead of investing in the system.

830
01:15:24,408 --> 01:15:27,751
[SPEAKER_11]: or with money that could have been invested in the system additionally.

831
01:15:27,831 --> 01:15:35,036
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, and if we're talking about a lot of needs to replace a lot of the system going forward, it's going to be more rate hikes.

832
01:15:35,257 --> 01:15:40,881
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there needs to be public education campaign more about that than just us talking about it here.

833
01:15:43,313 --> 01:15:55,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, I mean it's going to be it's significant and there's significant need and it's in the, I believe, in our budget meeting, Dan Stonking said it was in the 10s of millions of dollars, so of capital need for the water sewer system.

834
01:15:56,625 --> 01:16:00,268
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we spent some of that too right already.

835
01:16:00,448 --> 01:16:01,229
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

836
01:16:05,164 --> 01:16:05,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor comments.

837
01:16:06,506 --> 01:16:19,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you President role I appreciate this discussion and I think, in terms of my perspective on this to try to put it into a, you know, analogize it to something that most Medford residents, you know, perceive every day or drive over every day I would.

838
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:28,762
[SPEAKER_19]: hate for our water and sewer infrastructure to take a similar trajectory to what we see on our roads and sidewalks, where we don't invest when we could.

839
01:16:28,902 --> 01:16:41,366
[SPEAKER_19]: And that deferred maintenance becomes more and more and more expensive, more so than if we had invested earlier on and tried to prevent some of those increased costs of fixing depreciated infrastructure.

840
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:48,728
[SPEAKER_19]: So trying to think about what's the more meaningful help to the constituency, trying to mitigate a short term

841
01:16:49,728 --> 01:17:03,334
[SPEAKER_19]: to mitigate a rate increase in the short term, a small amount, or trying to sock away a fairly significant amount of money to deal with the backlog that's going to keep increasing towards doing some truly necessary repairs.

842
01:17:03,634 --> 01:17:03,954
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

843
01:17:04,555 --> 01:17:05,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Ponce.

844
01:17:06,275 --> 01:17:07,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the Council?

845
01:17:09,685 --> 01:17:32,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I think counselors for the discussion around this I think by Susan bears really gives a lot to think about I know what was one of the more jarring things to come out of the budget discussion was when I asked Mr. Stone King if you know, assuming that Medford surely isn't any worse than any other city in the state that's facing these, you know, aging sewer systems and he said no, it's it's Medford Melrose Malden I believe are known as being the three worst in the state as far as lead.

846
01:17:33,102 --> 01:17:49,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand the financial impacts of this, but I think, you know, if you are, I know asking my neighbors, you know, would you rather have a more dependable updated, you know, avoiding catastrophe source system or a small, you know, a small discount on your rate?

847
01:17:49,268 --> 01:17:59,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure maybe it's 50-50, but as a counselor, as a representative, I have to make the decision that I think we need to invest in this system and, you know, take this 500,000 and keep it in the account

848
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,101
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than using it to subsidize bills at this point.

849
01:18:05,062 --> 01:18:07,723
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes up every year, it may be a different decision next year.

850
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:21,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think just hearing what we heard from Mr. Stone King and Commissioner McGivern, it's really important that we have these funds to invest in an aging system that is, you know, as the city grows, more and more people tie into.

851
01:18:21,749 --> 01:18:30,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe we have do I have a motion to from Vice President Harris or someone made a motion to catch?

852
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to.

853
01:18:32,977 --> 01:18:36,998
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to make, I thought someone, I thought someone made a motion.

854
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:37,378
Okay.

855
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:55,026
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello to approve, and again, this is a vote to approve the request to subsidize the amount of $500,000 to subsidize the fiscal year 2024 Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund budget.

856
01:18:55,906 --> 01:18:58,567
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello to approve, seconded by.

857
01:18:58,587 --> 01:19:00,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

858
01:19:00,897 --> 01:19:02,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Behrs, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

859
01:19:02,999 --> 01:19:05,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Behrs.

860
01:19:05,801 --> 01:19:06,001
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

861
01:19:06,061 --> 01:19:08,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Kerrio.

862
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:08,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

863
01:19:08,764 --> 01:19:10,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

864
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:11,606
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

865
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:15,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Naitis, absent because of technical difficulties.

866
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:16,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Kellogg.

867
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:17,271
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

868
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:21,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Sang.

869
01:19:21,534 --> 01:19:21,855
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

870
01:19:22,475 --> 01:19:23,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Morales.

871
01:19:23,776 --> 01:19:23,976
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

872
01:19:24,857 --> 01:19:29,421
[SPEAKER_02]: One in the affirmative, five in the negative, one absent, the motion fails.

873
01:19:30,788 --> 01:19:33,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So the retained earnings will stay in the Water and Sewer Enterprise account.

874
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:38,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to, I believe, public participation.

875
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:53,746
[SPEAKER_02]: To Honorable City Council, the undersigners respectfully pray for every trucking all day and nights, all day long and night, 24 seven last 20 years from John Sardone, 197 Spring Street, Medford.

876
01:19:55,027 --> 01:19:55,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Sardone?

877
01:19:56,628 --> 01:19:57,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please come up.

878
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,123
[SPEAKER_01]: and the floor is yours.

879
01:20:03,243 --> 01:20:06,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, my name is John Sardone, 197 Spring Street Method.

880
01:20:06,964 --> 01:20:11,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come before you tonight on the heavy trucking that's been coming down Spring Street.

881
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:14,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It's seven days a week.

882
01:20:15,326 --> 01:20:25,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't cease, like I say, and they just keep coming down and there's no supervision of traffic on that street at all.

883
01:20:26,628 --> 01:20:28,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a list of,

884
01:20:29,682 --> 01:20:31,163
[SPEAKER_01]: All the trucks have been coming down.

885
01:20:31,684 --> 01:20:33,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I got pictures also on my phone.

886
01:20:34,346 --> 01:20:38,049
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just the idea is they keep going.

887
01:20:38,069 --> 01:20:40,572
[SPEAKER_01]: We got sloppy shop trucks that come down Spring Street.

888
01:20:41,192 --> 01:20:44,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy shop is down off Riverside Avenue for number one.

889
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:49,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Wegmans is off Riverside Avenue, not Spring Street, okay?

890
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:52,317
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are tractor trailers that are coming down.

891
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:56,481
[SPEAKER_01]: MBTA buses have been coming down Spring Street, okay?

892
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:58,623
[SPEAKER_01]: We never had buses coming down Spring Street.

893
01:20:58,643 --> 01:21:00,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been living there for 72 years.

894
01:21:00,864 --> 01:21:02,806
[SPEAKER_01]: We never had buses coming down Spring Street.

895
01:21:03,355 --> 01:21:03,655
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?

896
01:21:04,176 --> 01:21:07,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Tractor trailers, all right, that are carrying heavy equipment.

897
01:21:08,018 --> 01:21:09,399
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not working in this city.

898
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:18,006
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working in other cities, but they're coming down Spring Street or probably cross over the Riverside Ave or coming over to Salem Street, okay?

899
01:21:21,992 --> 01:21:25,174
[SPEAKER_01]: We got bread trucks that are coming down every single morning.

900
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a good friend of mine, George's Bakery.

901
01:21:28,415 --> 01:21:32,978
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just the idea is they're coming down three o'clock in the morning to gas up their trucks.

902
01:21:33,358 --> 01:21:34,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got numerous trucks.

903
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:37,440
[SPEAKER_01]: They're back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

904
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,502
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit a small manhole or something like that, it's waking up the whole household.

905
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,603
[SPEAKER_01]: It's waking up the whole street.

906
01:21:43,043 --> 01:21:44,864
[SPEAKER_01]: People are complaining, okay?

907
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:48,666
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the Penske trucks that are coming down.

908
01:21:49,714 --> 01:21:53,936
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got those big, large carriers that carry the brand new cars.

909
01:21:54,096 --> 01:21:56,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have no car dealerships up over here.

910
01:21:57,157 --> 01:21:59,999
[SPEAKER_01]: All car dealerships are down on Mystic Avenue.

911
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:01,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they coming down Spring Street?

912
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,721
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I can't understand.

913
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:06,522
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is all hours of the day, okay?

914
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:11,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're hitting telephone poles, they're knocking trees down.

915
01:22:11,485 --> 01:22:15,909
[SPEAKER_01]: The sets of lights at carnivals of Central and Spring have been knocked off so many times.

916
01:22:16,369 --> 01:22:23,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask the electricians that work for the city how many times they put up those lights in the last 10 or 12 years.

917
01:22:24,635 --> 01:22:26,156
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot make those turns.

918
01:22:26,616 --> 01:22:29,078
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot make the turns onto Central Avenue.

919
01:22:29,518 --> 01:22:32,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a truck, if somebody wants to take a look at it right now,

920
01:22:35,442 --> 01:22:37,864
[SPEAKER_01]: that was trying to get down Hooker Street.

921
01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:47,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Hooker's a double... Let me get the big picture.

922
01:22:47,353 --> 01:22:54,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna get the... All right, well, there's three pictures if you slide them over.

923
01:22:55,241 --> 01:22:57,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Hooker Street is a double-sided street.

924
01:22:58,165 --> 01:23:00,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes from Spring to Chevrolet.

925
01:23:00,626 --> 01:23:01,967
[SPEAKER_01]: There's cars on both sides.

926
01:23:02,508 --> 01:23:03,788
[SPEAKER_01]: This truck was enormous.

927
01:23:04,629 --> 01:23:06,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this was an oversized truck.

928
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:09,232
[SPEAKER_01]: They hit the telephone pole, cracked it.

929
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:12,013
[SPEAKER_01]: They also cracked the telephone pole in front of my house.

930
01:23:12,073 --> 01:23:13,654
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to replace it, okay?

931
01:23:14,335 --> 01:23:17,837
[SPEAKER_01]: The street's not wide enough for these heavy, heavy trucks.

932
01:23:18,537 --> 01:23:19,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it did.

933
01:23:20,278 --> 01:23:24,439
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, I mean, it's, it's unbelievable the size of these trucks that are coming down.

934
01:23:24,819 --> 01:23:26,340
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only that, we got young children.

935
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:31,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And years ago, we had a lumber company and a steel company right off of Spring Street.

936
01:23:32,562 --> 01:23:37,203
[SPEAKER_01]: The understanding, the understanding for those trucks were to

937
01:23:38,338 --> 01:23:40,560
[SPEAKER_01]: were to go down towards Riverside Avenue.

938
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:45,624
[SPEAKER_01]: The simple reason they had a school at the corner of a spring in Bradshaw.

939
01:23:45,905 --> 01:23:47,706
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a grammar school there.

940
01:23:48,187 --> 01:24:00,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the trucks came up, they would head down that way instead of going all the way down to Spring Street towards Salem Street because the children were waiting for school buses to go to school at the corners, okay?

941
01:24:01,218 --> 01:24:03,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was always an understanding on that street.

942
01:24:03,899 --> 01:24:07,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the chief of police would and could do something about it.

943
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:10,502
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had more staffing, but they're understaffed.

944
01:24:10,622 --> 01:24:11,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

945
01:24:11,842 --> 01:24:14,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do as much as they can monitor that street.

946
01:24:14,563 --> 01:24:21,526
[SPEAKER_01]: But years ago, we had motorcycle police sit on that corner of hookah street and bag the guys, right?

947
01:24:22,026 --> 01:24:23,167
[SPEAKER_01]: What I can't understand

948
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:27,748
[SPEAKER_01]: is the state police are stopping these trucks on the Fells Way.

949
01:24:28,249 --> 01:24:30,470
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay state and federal road tax.

950
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:35,051
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are they stopping them so they have to come down Spring Street?

951
01:24:35,211 --> 01:24:37,252
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not beneficial, like I say.

952
01:24:37,732 --> 01:24:44,035
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of damage, and it's the taxpayers that are paying for these lights and these telephone poles that are being locked down.

953
01:24:44,735 --> 01:24:46,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's coming out of our pockets.

954
01:24:46,696 --> 01:24:50,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just the idea something has to be done, like I say.

955
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:53,950
[SPEAKER_01]: If it can be done, fine.

956
01:24:54,391 --> 01:24:58,052
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the chief, his hands are tied because he's understaffed.

957
01:24:58,432 --> 01:25:04,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, there's more important things with the things that are going on in the city, with rapes and robberies and stuff like that.

958
01:25:05,274 --> 01:25:07,915
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the police are really needed, okay?

959
01:25:08,495 --> 01:25:11,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for the town for years, 44 years in the city.

960
01:25:12,096 --> 01:25:18,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also a police officer and a park police officer for 14 years in the city when I came back from overseas, okay?

961
01:25:19,018 --> 01:25:21,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know the city like the back of my hand.

962
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:27,503
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I'm just trying to improve the city, not downgrade the city, okay?

963
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:29,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your time.

964
01:25:29,564 --> 01:25:30,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for your time.

965
01:25:31,766 --> 01:25:32,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

966
01:25:32,619 --> 01:25:33,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Carville.

967
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,683
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President, and I understand the sideburns concerns I seem to try to go by there.

968
01:25:38,683 --> 01:25:50,732
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm afraid you might be seeing even more coming down there with with the new traffic configuration on on Salem Street, because that's not for me.

969
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:56,135
[SPEAKER_20]: But you're probably going to see a little bit more because some of those stores are going to have a problem getting their deliveries.

970
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:58,077
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're going to have to come up

971
01:25:58,757 --> 01:26:02,360
[SPEAKER_20]: Spring Street to make deliveries on the liquor store and some of those other stores.

972
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:05,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are delivery trucks, but not these big, big, big, big, big trucks.

973
01:26:05,242 --> 01:26:07,543
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to get the trailers there too.

974
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:09,224
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't be coming down Spring Street.

975
01:26:09,244 --> 01:26:13,107
[SPEAKER_20]: That's supposed to be Norby Trucking Industry in any ways, correct?

976
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:17,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you've got Riverside Avenue, you've got Salem Street, you've got the Fellsway to come down.

977
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:19,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, you've got the Parkway to come down.

978
01:26:19,772 --> 01:26:21,353
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't be coming down Spring Street.

979
01:26:22,153 --> 01:26:23,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're coming down early in the morning.

980
01:26:23,694 --> 01:26:24,734
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not coming down late.

981
01:26:24,794 --> 01:26:29,656
[SPEAKER_01]: And these big oil tankers, there's only one gas station on the Fellsway, right?

982
01:26:29,716 --> 01:26:34,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are they coming down Spring Street to gas up the station when it's on the Fellsway?

983
01:26:35,038 --> 01:26:35,958
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense.

984
01:26:36,338 --> 01:26:38,419
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make sense, like I say.

985
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:40,520
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're coming down all hours of the day.

986
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:46,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Sundays, the large day is supposed to be, but not anymore, the way things are going, okay?

987
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:48,103
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the idea is,

988
01:26:49,363 --> 01:26:52,324
[SPEAKER_01]: The trucking is there every single day, like they say.

989
01:26:52,945 --> 01:26:57,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have no, like you said, we have no dealerships down on that side of the city.

990
01:26:57,807 --> 01:27:02,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Years ago, we did at the corner of the Fellsway, where the gas station was.

991
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:06,090
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Subaru dealer there, but that was 45 years ago, all right?

992
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:11,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell you everything that happened in this city in probably the last 72 years, because I've been around.

993
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:12,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in the city.

994
01:27:13,533 --> 01:27:16,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an officer in the city, so I know what goes on.

995
01:27:16,694 --> 01:27:20,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, like I say, I just hope something could be done about it.

996
01:27:21,155 --> 01:27:22,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a lot of young children on the street.

997
01:27:22,835 --> 01:27:24,016
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighborhoods are changing.

998
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:26,996
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of young couples that are moving into the neighborhood.

999
01:27:27,316 --> 01:27:29,857
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not too many of us old-timers still left over there.

1000
01:27:30,237 --> 01:27:32,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is what has to be done.

1001
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:39,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if somebody can put the word into the chief, I know the chief will do it.

1002
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:43,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty good friends with him, like I say, but it's just the idea is he's understaffed.

1003
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,701
[SPEAKER_01]: hire more people.

1004
01:27:45,721 --> 01:27:49,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Years ago, we used to, we used to pay to get onto civil service.

1005
01:27:50,025 --> 01:27:50,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1006
01:27:50,745 --> 01:27:57,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a low number when I, I, my number was like 41, 49 or something like that to get onto civil service.

1007
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:59,312
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother sent it in because I was overseas.

1008
01:28:00,093 --> 01:28:05,177
[SPEAKER_01]: When I came back, I got called, took the physical and got on.

1009
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:05,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1010
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:10,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they had the police at night, the, uh,

1011
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:15,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief Keating and a few of the other guys said, look, we got a good guy here.

1012
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Let him be a park police officer.

1013
01:28:18,035 --> 01:28:18,515
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did.

1014
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:23,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just turning 21, because you have to be 21 to get a license to carry a firearm.

1015
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:28,639
[SPEAKER_01]: But the chief signed for me, and that's when I went on to the park police for 14 years.

1016
01:28:29,339 --> 01:28:33,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did a lot through the parks and stuff like that.

1017
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:36,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, like I say, I don't want to take up much of your time.

1018
01:28:36,942 --> 01:28:39,423
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably got some other people out here that want to speak also.

1019
01:28:39,925 --> 01:28:41,586
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just appreciate your time.

1020
01:28:42,127 --> 01:28:45,149
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can do something about it, I would appreciate it.

1021
01:28:45,349 --> 01:28:45,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1022
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:46,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

1023
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:46,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1024
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:47,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay healthy, everybody.

1025
01:28:47,991 --> 01:28:48,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1026
01:28:51,253 --> 01:28:52,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Costa, thank you.

1027
01:28:53,835 --> 01:28:58,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I thank the resident for coming forward to raise the issue.

1028
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:04,223
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the council had the benefit of seeing some of the photos that the gentleman had took on his phone and I was picturing

1029
01:29:05,896 --> 01:29:06,556
[SPEAKER_19]: delivery trucks.

1030
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:08,136
[SPEAKER_19]: We saw a gigantic 18-wheeler.

1031
01:29:08,156 --> 01:29:16,258
[SPEAKER_19]: It is, you know, shocking and ludicrous to see such a ludicrously sized truck for a residential street.

1032
01:29:16,378 --> 01:29:21,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, one of the services that the MPD does perform is traffic patrol, traffic enforcement.

1033
01:29:21,559 --> 01:29:22,739
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, this is a safety issue.

1034
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:34,902
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of the city to cover, but I think it would be, you know, if we know there are these priority areas that these huge trucks are taking advantage of, I'd like to see some increased enforcement around there just so we can

1035
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:37,540
[SPEAKER_19]: change the change the norms around that.

1036
01:29:38,741 --> 01:29:43,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys are constantly saying, um, yeah, it's it.

1037
01:29:43,725 --> 01:29:48,989
[SPEAKER_03]: The photo is jarring to see that 18 wheeler just in a residential residential neighborhoods like that.

1038
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:52,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where I live, there's trucks coming down all the time, too.

1039
01:29:52,712 --> 01:29:54,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's super, super loud.

1040
01:29:54,073 --> 01:29:55,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um,

1041
01:29:56,405 --> 01:30:04,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's not, it's not great when when when you expect it, it's even worse when it hasn't happened in this sort of only started happening last decade.

1042
01:30:05,628 --> 01:30:17,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for in the interest of fairness to our residents, it would be it would behoove our city to reach out to some of these companies and design a plan to redistribute some of the truck traffic.

1043
01:30:18,692 --> 01:30:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know there's nothing that we can

1044
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:24,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, by by law really say you can't drive down this road.

1045
01:30:24,374 --> 01:30:39,399
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, if someone from the city, um, if we could work together, get someone from the city to reach out to some of these companies or these stores, find out who who's who which truck companies are doing the driving and say, you know, why?

1046
01:30:39,839 --> 01:30:42,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you take Salem Street instead of spring?

1047
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:46,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you take this road and instead of that one redistributed a little bit?

1048
01:30:46,882 --> 01:30:48,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little fair on our residents.

1049
01:30:49,714 --> 01:30:58,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Harris, did did the gentleman Mr. Did he say it's a truck or the chief said it's a truck or so we can't ban trucks Did he say that.

1050
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:02,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1051
01:31:03,942 --> 01:31:04,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, exactly.

1052
01:31:04,402 --> 01:31:15,128
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I was gonna say that this could go to the traffic commission and either you could go no trucks or you could go tonnage limit and you can only have the smaller trucks that would be I'm just

1053
01:31:16,524 --> 01:31:17,484
[SPEAKER_11]: chiefs on the traffic commission.

1054
01:31:17,504 --> 01:31:34,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that would be the way to go on this one, we have some streets like that around the city, where you have kind of this, you know, because we have these parkways that are no trucks, you end up having weird, you know, they don't want to do it, but they could drive down back towards 93 down Riverside and back up Salem Street.

1055
01:31:34,168 --> 01:31:37,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's a little bit longer for them to drive, but they don't even need to go down Spring Street.

1056
01:31:37,968 --> 01:31:45,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So unless there's, I know Harvard Ave is like the one we can't touch, or Harvard Street is the one that we can't touch, because that's actually a trucking route.

1057
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:46,150
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's some sort of

1058
01:31:47,917 --> 01:31:51,779
[SPEAKER_11]: that's not there for Spring Street, that's what I would suggest.

1059
01:31:51,879 --> 01:31:57,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe we could suggest that on our next agenda, submit something to the Traffic Commission suggesting that.

1060
01:31:58,201 --> 01:31:58,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1061
01:31:59,221 --> 01:31:59,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor Sang.

1062
01:31:59,762 --> 01:32:04,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be also nice if we could get that list of companies from him.

1063
01:32:05,584 --> 01:32:08,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we could, but... Yeah, we can reach out.

1064
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:08,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1065
01:32:10,103 --> 01:32:11,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you gentlemen for bringing it up.

1066
01:32:11,204 --> 01:32:19,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think something that goes on set too is, and thankfully we don't have it around here a lot, but vehicles jump curbs all the time unintentionally.

1067
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:22,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you may think that, oh, there's a big truck, at least I'm on the sidewalk.

1068
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:23,851
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff happens all the time.

1069
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:26,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, it's just a nuts level of danger.

1070
01:32:26,532 --> 01:32:32,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, yeah, what everyone said to see an 18 wheeler on what is essentially, what's a residential street is incredibly jarring.

1071
01:32:32,415 --> 01:32:35,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed to be doing some sort of like three point turn as well.

1072
01:32:35,297 --> 01:32:36,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all pretty,

1073
01:32:37,338 --> 01:32:37,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrifying.

1074
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:38,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1075
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, we'll see if Council would like to submit something for our next agenda.

1076
01:32:44,303 --> 01:32:46,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there anyone else would like to speak for public participation?

1077
01:32:50,467 --> 01:32:51,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none.

1078
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:56,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have papers in the hands of the clerk.

1079
01:32:56,511 --> 01:33:04,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli, I would ask you to submit for the next agenda or I'm going to perhaps rule out of order just because this is an emergency situation for

1080
01:33:05,075 --> 01:33:05,335
[SPEAKER_02]: this.

1081
01:33:05,975 --> 01:33:09,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I can read it off, but I just know this might be something that people are interested in.

1082
01:33:10,077 --> 01:33:12,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not having the notice for such a topic.

1083
01:33:15,518 --> 01:33:20,420
[SPEAKER_02]: You already have the answer?

1084
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:20,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1085
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:21,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1086
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:31,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so 23-373 offered under suspension by Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved the Mayor, School Committee, and Superintendent explain the policy changes involving possible coaching changes for our high school student-athletes at Medford High School.

1087
01:33:31,622 --> 01:33:32,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1088
01:33:32,082 --> 01:33:37,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to speak on this because I did talk to the superintendent and I want to read.

1089
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:45,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that one of the one of the students, Stevie Rayner, he's who contacted me directly, wanted me to say say hi to him.

1090
01:33:45,434 --> 01:33:49,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, you know, and answer these the concerns that

1091
01:33:50,138 --> 01:33:58,441
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's funny when things go out, and the discussion was that they're opening all the coaching positions for Medford High School.

1092
01:33:58,741 --> 01:34:12,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this isn't a privy of the city council, but this is a forum that, unfortunately, as quickly as the word can get out, because this is an important topic, I talked to the superintendent.

1093
01:34:12,826 --> 01:34:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: The word was on the street, and the superintendent and I discussed it in depth, that

1094
01:34:19,467 --> 01:34:40,348
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now putting in a policy in the middle of the summer that will now open up all the coaching positions and the athletic director, the big question was the athletic directors were not involved in the hiring, that the process is skewed and this is, you know, witch hunts.

1095
01:34:41,641 --> 01:34:50,524
[SPEAKER_04]: talk to the superintendent, the superintendent reassured me that the athletic directors are in full involvement with this process.

1096
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:53,585
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be on top of the situation.

1097
01:34:54,125 --> 01:35:04,508
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that and I shared my own personal opinion as a 32 year coach and athletic director and understanding the process that I shared my concerns that

1098
01:35:05,308 --> 01:35:10,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where we've got some phone calls that during the fall season, the fall season starts in a few weeks.

1099
01:35:10,795 --> 01:35:12,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And the process is in place right now to

1100
01:35:14,934 --> 01:35:16,255
[SPEAKER_04]: have a committee put together.

1101
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:22,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rumor was that it was gonna be just parents and kids hiring coaches, not true.

1102
01:35:23,821 --> 01:35:34,150
[SPEAKER_04]: The superintendent and I shared what we do in neighbor community where I'm part of that as a former coach, I'm also involved in the hiring team.

1103
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:37,132
[SPEAKER_04]: That's between six to eight individuals.

1104
01:35:37,192 --> 01:35:38,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not two or three people.

1105
01:35:38,914 --> 01:35:43,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not people that are on there that don't like a coach that's sitting in the position right now.

1106
01:35:44,458 --> 01:36:00,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a position where we have the athletic directors, the assistant assistant athletic director, the the athletic trainer, you have two sitting seniors or captains that are coming back that season, and alumni that played that sport.

1107
01:36:00,943 --> 01:36:08,145
[SPEAKER_04]: You also have a parent and you have either a teacher in the school or a coach that's in the system.

1108
01:36:08,991 --> 01:36:10,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's a whole, it's a whole committee.

1109
01:36:10,853 --> 01:36:11,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a true committee.

1110
01:36:12,154 --> 01:36:15,617
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, um, you know, that's, that's what we do.

1111
01:36:15,917 --> 01:36:19,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's very important that every school in the greater Boston league does that.

1112
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:24,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that I talked to, uh, athletic director Maloney, he met with the superintendent.

1113
01:36:24,604 --> 01:36:31,630
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a great discussion when I was told that the process is exactly what, what I just said, that that's the hope.

1114
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:37,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, let's, let's, you know, not jump ahead of it, not,

1115
01:36:38,337 --> 01:36:47,802
[SPEAKER_04]: it, you know, because kids are nervous, and I expressed the superintendent in this way, because of the fall season is what I'm a little concerned about.

1116
01:36:48,423 --> 01:36:57,708
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time the committee's put together, by the time the interviews are done, you're looking probably the middle of August, the season starts the third week of August.

1117
01:36:59,025 --> 01:37:11,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Using football, for example, if the football coach is let go and a new coach comes in, you are giving the student athletes that have been involved with this coach the last three years.

1118
01:37:12,062 --> 01:37:15,747
[SPEAKER_04]: This is every sport, girls' soccer, boys' soccer, golf, volleyball.

1119
01:37:16,951 --> 01:37:23,738
[SPEAKER_04]: coaches that involved last two months with the student athletes working camps, giving back to the community, kids getting in shape.

1120
01:37:23,778 --> 01:37:33,567
[SPEAKER_04]: The other piece that was was brought forth is you have coaches from colleges that are talking to student athletes, and they're discussing the possibility of being recruited and

1121
01:37:34,328 --> 01:37:37,829
[SPEAKER_04]: to make a coaching change this quick might be detrimental for their future.

1122
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:41,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So the superintendent understood, we agreed to disagree.

1123
01:37:42,689 --> 01:37:47,310
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that, you know, I think the process in place is a fair and open process.

1124
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:52,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, like she said, it's an anomaly, because you have to start somehow, you have to start sometime.

1125
01:37:53,471 --> 01:37:58,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So my wish was starting for the winter season, if this is a process we move to.

1126
01:37:58,972 --> 01:38:02,113
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I think the answer is very simple.

1127
01:38:02,853 --> 01:38:03,313
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not

1128
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:05,686
[SPEAKER_04]: The athletic director is involved.

1129
01:38:06,026 --> 01:38:11,550
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a true committee, from what I was told by the superintendent, of a varied amount of people.

1130
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:15,693
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just two people, a parent that doesn't like a coach, or a kid that doesn't like a coach.

1131
01:38:15,754 --> 01:38:19,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate letting me discuss.

1132
01:38:19,376 --> 01:38:28,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I think publicly it needed to be said, because I don't think there's a forum, as we get closer to the season, that I think the kids wanted me to give an answer.

1133
01:38:28,383 --> 01:38:29,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Their parents had reached out.

1134
01:38:31,645 --> 01:38:32,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it, Madam President.

1135
01:38:32,846 --> 01:38:33,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1136
01:38:33,127 --> 01:38:34,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that clarification.

1137
01:38:34,828 --> 01:38:38,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion on the motion?

1138
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:40,352
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the end of our agenda.

1139
01:38:40,693 --> 01:38:42,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not believe we have any papers that need to be taken off the table.

1140
01:38:42,895 --> 01:38:43,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins?

1141
01:38:43,975 --> 01:38:44,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to adjourn.

1142
01:38:45,136 --> 01:38:48,079
[SPEAKER_02]: On a motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Singh.

1143
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:48,759
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1144
01:38:48,779 --> 01:38:49,140
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1145
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,181
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1146
01:38:50,241 --> 01:38:51,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes, meeting adjourned.
