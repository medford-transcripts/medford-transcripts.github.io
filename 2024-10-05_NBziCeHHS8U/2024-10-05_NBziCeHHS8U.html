    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=299.475s">If</a>  I can, I can approach the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=321.402s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=324.449s">I</a>  see a few friends here tonight and I'm glad they can make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=331.685s">I</a>  think it was a few weeks ago, we had a very scary and horrific situation and dangerous situation occur over at the Tufts pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=342.85s">And</a>  something that would have really put our community, I think, in a real tailspin, and it would have affected so many lives in a negative manner, especially the young person that was drowning. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=357.595s">When</a>  I heard this situation, I was fortunate that my daughter is a lifeguard and she's trained by the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=365.558s">And</a>  I always thought, as the assistant recreation director, I have 40 lifeguards, I have two pools, and wanted to make sure that our staff is trained the correct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=379.191s">And</a>  it's funny, because when I called Kevin and I said, Kevin, I'm going to put this up, he says, don't put our names on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=385.497s">It's</a>  not about us, it's about the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=387.879s">But</a>  it wouldn't be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=390.602s">if</a>  we didn't acknowledge yourself, Kevin, and Danny, folks, for your leadership in what you do for our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=399.226s">People</a>  don't know, I asked Kevin to come over and train my lifeguards in Somerville a few weeks ago, and I appreciate he did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=406.588s">And</a>  there's a reason for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=408.369s">He's</a>  the best in the state at what he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=411.31s">And</a>  for what happened that day, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=415.865s">You</a>  know, I had a great conversation with my friend Osman and said, you know, what happened and how graphic the whole situation was. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=424.293s">When</a>  you hear a kid drown, a kid who's drowning, what do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=428.157s">It's</a>  like, oh, he was flailing his, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=431.48s">To</a>  hear the whole description of, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=434.38s">you</a>  know, getting the call and the lifeguards all running into action. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=437.604s">And,</a>  and Osmond seeing the young person at the bottom of the pool and how, how was it called? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=442.331s">It</a>  was, uh, he was pinned, I guess, face first on the, on the floor of the pool and everybody went into action. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=450.542s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=451.543s">It's</a>  something that needs to be told, and it needs to be elevated, and our lifeguards and our staff need to be congratulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=461.677s">I</a>  know the whole story, it's phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=464.821s">The</a>  buzz went around within 15 minutes around Medford, how Osmond went right in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=470.29s">did</a>  exactly what he was trained to do, bring him to the top, turn, the backboard was on site, staff was there, they took the person, the young person on the deck, everybody's in action, everybody, I know that the pool manager right away knew her role, the fire department was called, and in typical fashion, Osmond said to me, he says, no, Mr. Scapelli says, the firemen were amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=495.145s">And</a>  I think that's what the whole team, they all knew what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=497.867s">Because</a>  when I talked to the fire department, they said, no, no, it's a young person who jumped in and brought, all we had to do was get there and then do what we're trained for. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=506.634s">And</a>  that's save a life on the deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=508.475s">So</a>  between Armstrong ambulance and the fire department and Kevin's training, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=516.915s">What</a>  I really wanted to do tonight is just acknowledge you as quickly as we can, because I know a lot of you young people off to college and we won't see you for a few months, but we contacted the clerk and he put together a citation for you that, you know, this is probably, I've given out a thousand citations, champions in sports, academic awards, music awards, right, drama club, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=545.738s">this</a>  is the most amazing citation that we're giving out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=550.423s">And</a>  I'm so I'm so happy for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=552.805s">Because</a>  what you people did, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=556.649s">So</a>  I know chief chief just walked in, I said, I know, you know, give him kudos and his staff for what the fire department chief <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=564.655s">I</a>  know you don't like the accolades and that's your job, but the fact that the firefighters and the lifeguards work together to save a life. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=574.161s">And</a>  so what we did is we put a citation together. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=578.504s">It</a>  reads, the Medford City Council takes great pleasure in presenting this council accommodation to, this is our manager at the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=589.151s">From</a>  what I'm told, she's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=590.672s">She's</a>  like the den mother, and she's taking care of everything at the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=594.255s">That's</a>  Danielle DelBene. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=596.317s">And</a>  for your quick and heroic response and saving the life of a drowning youth at Tufts Pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=602.702s">If</a>  you can come on up and take a citation, Danielle.</p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=899.418s">Okay,</a>  it's a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=901.421s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=902.783s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=903.984s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=904.225s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=904.885s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=905.486s">I</a>  just want to take this opportunity to thank the lifeguards and every and the staff at the pool for just attention to detail, being alert and doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=918.282s">And</a>  the reason this rescue happened was because the team came together, starting with them being alert, realizing there was a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=927.464s">Everybody</a>  jumped into action. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=930.745s">The</a>  fire crews got on scene under two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=932.985s">I</a>  checked the CAD. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=934.945s">We</a>  had EMS on scene. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=936.346s">I'm</a>  definitely going to put these crews in for an accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=940.407s">Just</a>  haven't got around to it yet, been really busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=942.967s">But</a>  when I looked into this, obviously, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=947.943s">It</a>  was the team came together at the perfect time and the outcome is a life was saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=953.147s">And</a>  that's what we like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=954.468s">It's</a>  not always how it goes, but this particular incident went that way, starting with the lifeguards. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=960.512s">They</a>  had the patient out of the water on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=964.394s">Engine</a>  five gets there and they realize, you know, there's an obstruction there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=969.118s">Get</a>  the patient on his side, you know, remove that obstruction and then rescue breathing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=975.877s">ambulance</a>  gets on scene, patient transported, and the end result is the patient is released from the hospital and doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=984.266s">So</a>  I just want to take this opportunity to quickly to just again thank everybody and thank the council for recognizing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=991.714s">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=993.376s">Thanks,</a>  Chief.</p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=994.897s">Thank</a>  you again.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1002.54s">Any</a>  other councillors would like to speak on this resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1005.482s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1006.403s">I'll</a>  be brief since I think Councilor Scarpelli did such a great job telling us about everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1011.806s">I</a>  think what really stands out to me and what Councilor Scarpelli said was that all the teamwork and the coordination and the heroism that came through in this story. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1027.156s">and</a>  the humility from everyone here and even accepting the awards and accepting the accolades today, the humility really shines through. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1037.342s">But</a>  as a community, I think it's really important that we take this moment and both reflect on the heroism that you all showed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1046.868s">but</a>  also celebrate all the work that you all have been up to. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1051.531s">And</a>  you guys really are, this is the star, the shining star of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1057.474s">So</a>  thank you all so much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1060.215s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Sen. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1062.176s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor and Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1066.746s">I'll</a>  just again speak briefly I know Councilor Scarpelli covered all but thank you so much Councilor Scarpelli for introducing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1072.39s">I</a>  spent years in high school as a pool lifeguard, and I probably spent most of my hours just telling people not to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1077.533s">And</a>  I never had this challenging moment where all of your training comes into action and it's you know it's, it's, it's everything changes in a matter of seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1086.941s">I</a>  am so proud of you all and so impressed with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1089.962s">And</a>  it's an incredible thing that you all did with Metro Fire, with Armstrong Ambulance, but it's so much for young people to do something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1097.505s">And</a>  I'm really proud that you guys call Medford home and work in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1101.066s">So</a>  thank you for your service.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1112.385s">I</a>  just want to add just a few extra things in there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1115.588s">You</a>  know, I also think this is really an important time to not only acknowledge the lifeguards for the skills that they did, but all of the lifeguards that work both at the pond and the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1124.937s">One</a>  of the things that we talk about a lot in our lifeguard class is that you're part of a lifeguard team. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1130.402s">You</a>  know, it's not just an individual person. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1132.224s">I</a>  think this is a perfect example that you can see in an incident that we had <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1138.936s">team</a>  itself was able to quickly act. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1141.458s">It's</a>  not just one person who performed the rescue, but it's everyone knowing exactly what needed to happen with the removal, with rescue breathing, with getting the BVM out there, with clearing the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1153.968s">It</a>  really is a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1155.489s">And</a>  one of the things that I think a lot of people don't realize is that <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1159.752s">This</a>  wasn't just this didn't happen because of a miracle, or we got lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1166.778s">This</a>  is through training. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1168.099s">And</a>  this is something that the lifeguard spent a lot of time and not only during the academic year taking the lifeguard in class, but the month of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1175.927s">It</a>  is a very, very busy month because we spend weekends doing orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1180.231s">We</a>  practice specifically, not just in a lifeguard class, but at the pool, how to handle that emergency or when we're at right spot, how to handle it, how to handle a missing child. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1190.641s">It's</a>  a lot of extra hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1192.202s">These</a>  kids are in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1193.443s">As</a>  you remember, in the beginning of the season, we're in the pool right when it fails, it's freezing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1199.128s">they're</a>  in there, they're practicing, and it's not just the lifeguards here, but the rest of the lifeguard team, the extra work, the hard work that goes into getting the pool ready for the season and being prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1209.97s">So</a>  again, I want to thank the lifeguards, and I really want to thank the rest of our lifeguard team, because it is really remarkable what happened, and again, the amount of training that they do to prepare for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1221.892s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1222.512s">Thank</a>  you, Director Bailey. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1223.293s">If</a>  I can.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1227.261s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1228.502s">I,</a>  you know, to that point, I know that I see it firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1232.186s">So</a>  when it's pouring outside, and Gianna asked my wife to get eight beach towels, because they have training and we said it's pouring, and it's 52 degrees out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1243.678s">And</a>  we said, What is Kevin thinking? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1245.56s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1245.96s">And</a>  I take that all back, have whatever I was going to publicly tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1251.284s">And</a>  this is the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1252.365s">And</a>  Janet, just like probably the rest of the lifeguards, they go gladly because situations like this because and people don't realize it's just not a it's just not a clean, safe pool all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1262.371s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1263.441s">all</a>  of our lifeguards also train with your staff and yourself at the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1267.845s">And</a>  that's a difficult, especially with bad weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1270.408s">So,</a>  you know, and it's two different types of positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1275.732s">So</a>  these kids really commit themselves and your staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1278.655s">And</a>  again, we appreciate what you guys have done and you made us look really, really good in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1284.32s">And</a>  I know there's one family that's very, very happy today. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1286.582s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1287.623s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1904.444s">I</a>  mostly wanted to so you do have a memo from the CD board with their recommendation that they recommend. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1912.07s">They</a>  unanimously recommended that you approve this zoning map change. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1916.813s">Daniel</a>  Evans, senior planner, and I are here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1919.876s">If</a>  you had questions about that recommendation, and as well as our other planner, Amanda Centrello is on the Zoom, and Robin Stein, an attorney, is on the call if there are any legal questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1932.36s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1932.78s">Yeah,</a>  the applicant is here.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1934.521s">If</a>  you would like to just for we did get that memo at just about five today in email. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1940.085s">And</a>  this originally came before the council, I believe on May 23, was referred to refer to the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1944.487s">And</a>  now it's back before us.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1946.588s">Right,</a>  just for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1947.669s">This</a>  was just for at the time was for over 300 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1950.911s">It</a>  wasn't mixed use correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1952.672s">My</a>  refresh my memory.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1954.472s">On</a>  the details of the project, the applicant is here and they are prepared to present on it if you would like them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1960.274s">It</a>  is a residential building with one commercial unit on the first floor with the idea that it's right next to the T stop, but it's a large number of residential units and I wouldn't want to say how many without. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1974.9s">checking</a>  my notes.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1976.041s">So</a>  I appreciate that you're here, because I think this is the question that I had back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1980.325s">Yeah,</a>  especially with that area and getting a lot of feedback on what's happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1985.871s">And</a>  what the T's interpretation of what their wishes are, and the rumors that what they want to do with that space and the airspace of that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1996.1s">So</a>  there's a lot of variables that are in place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2000.318s">miss</a>  out they said so I'm, I'm just a little concerned that what question I had back then was, what is our vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2005.642s">I</a>  mean, if you can share something with us because when you look at neighboring communities, and you know look at Linfield look at assembly row, look at station landing when that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2015.569s">It</a>  was done with a comprehensive plan of what that whole area was going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2021.297s">In</a>  essence, we're looking at one piece of what else and I think that's what, you know, people are asking for and personally myself as a gateway entrance to our community exit to our community, you know what, what do we see there what we envision.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2035.705s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2036.065s">And</a>  so that is something that we have talked about, we've talked about with the public, if we could do whatever we wanted, because I want to acknowledge the rumors it for the MBTA has an interest in putting a an electric bus depot and repair facility there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2053.304s">And</a>  they have concerns with the ability to put <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2056.427s">because</a>  we would still have the right to put residential, commercial, mixed-use life science above that, about how strong the building would have to be, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2066.091s">I</a>  have significant concerns about putting a critical facility, like an electric bus facility, right there next to the Amelia Earhart Dam, where there's high risk of flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2076.036s">Where</a>  on the other hand, we're not going to not develop these areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2080.078s">We'll</a>  build the buildings with the understanding that there's a potential for flood, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2085.193s">But</a>  the buildings would not be critical infrastructure facilities designed for electric vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2093.075s">So</a>  I have been trying to work with the MBTA to try and identify a different location for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2098.017s">And</a>  I know the mayor is also working with other layers of DOT about how do we find a different location for their electric bus facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2106.76s">So</a>  that's sort of like the elephant in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2110.201s">In</a>  a big picture way, what we envision there <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2114.058s">is</a>  a mixed use facility with restaurants and commercial entities, stores, shops on the first floor, some sort of parking garage, because we do need parking there for the people who would live and work there, as well as people would get on the train. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2130.385s">But</a>  one would assume that the people living there would be less likely, on average, to own vehicles, because you would literally be living one to two minute walk from a train station. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2142.223s">and</a>  where buses do come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2144.265s">And</a>  so what we have, we did the RFI, we got a lot of proposals, I think it was nine, and they all envisioned a mix of residential and commercial life science spaces in that, so that it would be a mix of different buildings, people, it would be a live work kind of community, like we see directly across the river at Assembly Row. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2165.522s">We</a>  know there is demand for this kind of facility gathered around a T stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2170.803s">So</a>  that is what we are looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2173.164s">We</a>  are working on the MBTA communities rule, and this is the area that it looks like we need to use as our district for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2182.668s">We</a>  are getting ready to do some public meetings around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2185.79s">We're</a>  hoping to roll some of that out in say August, September. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2189.131s">And</a>  what we have been contemplating with the consultant is something where what we would recommend is gonna be on the order of <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2199.003s">three</a>  stories by right, because that's the density that is required to meet MBTA communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2205.466s">And</a>  we're not allowed to require mixed use, we're not allowed to require additional affordable housing, and we're not allowed to require more energy efficient buildings than the code allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2217.191s">However,</a>  we can incentivize those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2219.752s">So</a>  what we're planning to put forward in front of the community for this area <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2223.513s">is</a>  that they could get up to six stories if they layered in those additional things that we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2229.278s">So</a>  the zoning would allow three by right six under this with these additional things. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2236.084s">The</a>  Muzz district is the other side of the T station. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2239.687s">And</a>  I will say that our office contemplated asking you to also rezone the MBTA parcel that is between this parcel under consideration tonight and <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2251.323s">station</a>  landing, station landing is the Muzz zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2255.024s">And</a>  to include that in this, and then it would be one large continuous area that would allow, that would be for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2263.646s">MBTA</a>  is not bound by our zoning, so it doesn't actually impact what they wanna do there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2268.667s">And</a>  as long as it's owned there and we need to do some larger RFP process on the air rights, we need to do the MBTA rezoning, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2279.133s">we</a>  decided that it would complicate matters if we were to ask you to also rezone that parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2284.474s">But</a>  if you look at the map that you were provided, it would actually make a nice contiguous area. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2289.296s">And</a>  so this is the only parcel that's not part of the MBTA property that's not already part of the Muzz zone on that side of Revert Beach Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2298.538s">So</a>  in that sense, this makes a lot of logical sense to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2302.159s">And</a>  that's where we sort of see this in a vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2305.399s">One</a>  of the things that I think I mentioned at that meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2308.182s">is</a>  that when a developer is ready to build a building and it's something that you know is going to be in demand and that your community wants, if you say to them, wait 18 months or 12 months and you'll be able like and we'll change the zoning, they don't like that and they go develop their building somewhere else and they go build it elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2327.519s">So</a>  we see Criterion as an excellent partner, a developer that has done further work up the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2334.365s">They</a>  own the <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2335.425s">or</a>  they've developed the property on River's Edge, some of the residential buildings there they're developer of, and they do very excellent work. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2343.77s">The</a>  fact that they wanna build here right now, we said, this is a good way to move this forward quickly and allow them to do something that will set the stage for what we're looking for and would fit in with a larger development at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2357.398s">That's</a>  where we're coming from on this.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2358.779s">Okay,</a>  so I appreciate the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2360.92s">I</a>  think the biggest concern that I'm hearing from the neighbors <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2363.846s">And</a>  personally, I think that, you know, I was fortunate being a member of a municipality that was actually directly involved as we talked about with this new zoning consultant coming in plus the team that will be going out to each neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2378.951s">I</a>  think it's important to get, you know, as recreation, I was in all meetings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2383.612s">I</a>  have to go represent recreation at the different neighborhood meetings to talk about the vision of that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2390.414s">And</a>  I think that it's nice that <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2392.555s">You,</a>  you explained it perfectly and I completely understand, but if we keep doing the spot zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2399.285s">It's</a>  really not a big comprehensive, you know, master plan that everybody wants to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2405.533s">And</a>  I know that you get the word out as best you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2410.39s">neighbors</a>  from that area, when you're talking about that area, they really, when we talk about this project after we voted the last time and they said 300 some odd units, what are we going to do with that neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2419.873s">There</a>  was nothing to calm them to understand what, you know, you're talking about Rivers Edge, you're talking about what's happening down the street in Everett, and now we're adding 300 more units. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2431.157s">I</a>  think having the community input, that's why I implore the city, the administration, to really, and I can make this form of motion, to give us an update where we are with the hiring of our consultants as well as partners so we can work together to get this done because, like you said, waiting a year and a half <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2452.128s">They're</a>  not gonna wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2453.449s">But</a>  imagine what we've already lost because we don't have a comprehensive plan, because we don't have the tools in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2459.27s">So</a>  if we can get that going, if we can put that out, we'd appreciate it, Mr. Clerk, Madam President, and thank you for your answers.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2464.652s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2465.713s">Madam</a>  President, the CD board meeting was a public hearing, which was duly noticed, and we did not get any public comment at that meeting.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2475.916s">Just</a>  to share, I appreciate that, but again. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2478.823s">when</a>  it's affecting neighbor direct neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2481.566s">I</a>  understand we post and we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2483.328s">That</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2484.349s">But</a>  you know, as well as I do, unless people are directly impacted, and they know what's going on, that they really don't know what's going until all of a sudden shovels in the ground, like no one told us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2493.65s">And</a>  that's not true, but it's what's then promoted. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2499.214s">So</a>  I just wanna make sure that it's mentioned, it's not your fault, I know you do what you're supposed to do, but I think having this piece in place, and as we talked about, putting that piece with the zoning and having the team that's gonna go out to the neighborhoods and really get what everybody's input, I think that's what a true partnership is with the community and our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2519.049s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2521.564s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2524.727s">Not</a>  that I don't support this, just a little, I'd like to see where this fits into the big plan in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2531.053s">That's,</a>  I mean, I, and I think what we're doing, I mean, this is, this is really, with spot zoning, it was just something that we've haven't done in the past and we really <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2541.552s">never</a>  liked doing that's that's I think we're sitting a little bit of a bad precedent there by doing this but it's another I'm not I am going to support it but I'd like to see where this fits in the plan overall because right now all I'm looking at is a building in the corner and you know and I don't see the vision that goes with it but that's where the concern is if <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2562.985s">If</a>  there's some type of plan, even some kind of conceptual plan, share with us so we know how this is going to fit in with everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2570.352s">Because</a>  I've heard the same thing from T people. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2572.634s">This</a>  is going to tease, you know, not happy about what's happening over there with the air rights.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2580.201s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2581.602s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2582.422s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt for presenting on this and giving us all the context around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2587.164s">I</a>  certainly hear my fellow councilors observation about, you know, observations around doing things piece by piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2594.807s">I</a>  completely empathize with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2596.767s">I</a>  think that we're all, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2599.237s">think</a>  that this mechanism is kind of a bridge between what we have now and where we know we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2603.038s">We</a>  have the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2604.339s">We</a>  have the existing character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2607.28s">We</a>  know what there's demand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2608.48s">We</a>  know what's currently there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2609.441s">And</a>  then we have plans to do a comprehensive rezoning and make sure that all of our neighborhoods are kind of brought into alignment with our comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2616.583s">So</a>  I think that this PDD mechanism is a way to make sure that we don't miss out on these opportunities while we're still ramping up for that comprehensive <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2625.166s">project.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2625.506s">I'm</a>  really glad that we have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2626.407s">I</a>  don't think any of us want to bypass these opportunities while they're on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2630.149s">And,</a>  you know, at the same time, very much looking forward to when we can do this within the structure of a comprehensive, you know, no or very few exceptions needed kind of zoning paradigm. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2642.155s">So</a>  I would motion for approval after many of my fellow councillors additional comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2647.518s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2647.758s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2648.565s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt, for presenting to us and telling us a little bit more about the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2654.509s">I've</a>  read through the RFPs that we've seen, the nine that you talked about, read through this administration's press releases about it, and looked through the comprehensive plan and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2665.638s">And</a>  between all of those documents and what you're saying today, which completely corroborates everything there, I do <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2674.084s">see</a>  the picture for the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2678.448s">And</a>  it's a picture I think that because I think a lot of most of your decisions as a department is taken from that, the public input process that's gone into the comprehensive plan and the housing plan and all of that, I think is one that aligns particularly well with the goals of the city and the goals of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2699.364s">I</a>  spend like <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2701.137s">a</a>  little bit less than two or three days in Wellington a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2706.619s">And</a>  there is a lot of, especially younger folks, but there's a lot of momentum on the ground for making Wellington a more interesting place, a place where people can afford to buy houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2720.086s">And</a>  even with wealthier residents, a lot of wealthier residents, maybe a little bit older than me, they want a chance to buy <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2730.09s">what</a>  buy units here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2732.091s">And</a>  even for the units they could theoretically afford in Medford, it's a whole competition to buy them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2736.874s">And</a>  this would, you know, increasing housing stock is a really, really important way of tackling our housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2743.178s">And</a>  I think in another world, I definitely hear my colleagues in that we prefer not to spot them or not, not to focus on individual parcels of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2755.845s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2756.265s">that</a>  given the urgent nature of urgent nature of the housing crisis, given the vision that I think we generally have in our city for transit oriented development and multi and mixed mixed use development. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2772.678s">That's,</a>  this is a project I think <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2775.4s">is</a>  promising for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2776.84s">And</a>  I think you made the excellent point that waiting is shooting ourselves in the foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2783.362s">And</a>  we've seen this time and time again with housing, with development in Medford, with a lot of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2791.604s">It's</a>  been a mistake in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2793.485s">And</a>  I want to make sure that we're not giving into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2797.586s">We're</a>  not accidentally shooting ourselves in the foot now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2801.587s">And</a>  I think that's really, really important to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2805.451s">In</a>  general, I really do look forward to working more with your department and with the zoning consultants on implementing the shared vision I think all of us behind the rail have for the area and for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2820.435s">Especially,</a>  I'm a very big fan of what you said about incentivizing affordable housing and energy efficiency and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2828.577s">And</a>  so I would second Councilor Collins' motion.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2832.894s">And</a>  Madam President, I do just want to make sure that everybody is aware that this approves the zoning that would allow this project to be built, but the project would then need to go through site plan review, which is when it goes under another round of public meetings and the CD board would weigh in on a lot of the details of the design, as well as any mitigation that would be anticipated from this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2860.029s">So</a>  I just want you to know that that piece of it, it's just another step. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2863.451s">I</a>  don't want anybody to think that they would get a building permit and be able to start building next week, but we would think they would apply and move through the process quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2871.196s">But</a>  there is another chance to weigh in on this.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2873.697s">Thank</a>  you, Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2874.298s">Two</a>  things before I go to Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2876.959s">Lost</a>  the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2877.96s">Second</a>  one, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2880.041s">Oh,</a>  this is a public hearing, so I do need to open it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2881.983s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2882.783s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2884.925s">No,</a>  no, it's my fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2886.567s">I</a>  did so we did get a response actually, I think it was last week right after the holiday that we didn't get a response to our RFP for the zoning consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2894.476s">Director</a>  Hunt has offered to have some folks in her department reach out and call folks who normally submitted proposals and ask why they didn't and how we can update that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2903.408s">So</a>  happy to take that as a B paper, but that's something I'm trying to get to deliver to the council.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2908.691s">The</a>  last day was June 29th or 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2911.552s">So</a>  it was right before the holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2913.673s">I</a>  think there were 15 or so who had pulled the thing, but did not submit an application. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2919.957s">So</a>  we have names of people who were maybe interested, but then didn't actually apply.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2924.099s">Yeah,</a>  and just to remind us of the process, because I forgot to, we did also, we had a committee of the whole where we talked about what we wanted in that RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2930.862s">We'll</a>  see what we get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2931.703s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2933.564s">But</a>  I'm also happy to take that as a paper ticket, you know, have a paper trail on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2937.227s">So</a>  as this is a public hearing, to open a public hearing for people who would like to speak in favor of the petition, I assume the applicant is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2945.472s">I</a>  assume he would like to speak in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2947.514s">So</a>  is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of the petition before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2950.956s">Please</a>  come up to the mic and folks can raise their hands on Zoom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2956.46s">And</a>  you can simply say, yes, I'm in favor, or you can say a little bit more.</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2959.44s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President and members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2962.462s">I</a>  appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2965.044s">You</a>  know it's funny to speak in favor of Jack Englert 37 Walnut Street Wellesley. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2972.99s">This</a>  is the first step, and we did start to reach out to the community to understand the needs of the community and we want to focus on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2980.412s">But</a>  we are just the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2981.893s">And</a>  once it if it we're lucky enough to have it rezone, we can then start the formal processes as missing mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2989.898s">I</a>  think that our jump starting the area over there at Wellington would be a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2996.102s">We</a>  do have only one commercial space on the first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2998.683s">We're</a>  contemplating another <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3000.425s">was</a>  spoken to the MWR Mr. River Watershed Association about possibly moving in there to try to really open up this area to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3009.276s">And</a>  so while it is <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3010.965s">at</a>  the infancy stage of getting that all redeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3014.427s">I</a>  think having a jumpstart with one project like ours and having the access to the river and all the things we're gonna try to do in completing the path, I think it will prove beneficial to the overall vision for the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3027.336s">And</a>  I'm hoping that you'd consider this as a step in the right direction and one that we could move forward with.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3034.12s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3034.68s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the petition?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3756.395s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello, for putting this on agenda, I walk across that bridge before every city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3763.682s">It's,</a>  you're right that we shouldn't have to ask about any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3769.466s">This</a>  is something that they should be on top of. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3771.628s">I</a>  know councillors, you've been on top of, really on top of it, councillors, other councillors too have, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3781.997s">also,</a>  you know, brought up the need for DCR to be more on top of it when it comes to Medford to, to talk to people from their office for them to reach out to us as well to have that clear channel communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3792.782s">I</a>  do wish that, do wish that happens, but I think, I think Councilor Caraviello will put this on agenda.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3799.665s">Do</a>  you have any other discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3803.867s">I</a>  see Mr. Castagnetti with his hand up.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3815.935s">I</a>  want to thank councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3821.6s">Again,</a>  and again for many years bringing up the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3827.065s">That</a>  was the most dangerous intersection in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3829.667s">It's</a>  still pretty dangerous, especially when you have four foot weeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3833.491s">It's</a>  an obstruction of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3835.578s">If</a>  I may, I ask and I request to the council if you can add a second location, and that would be Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3846.087s">If</a>  you're in Medford Square and you get on 93 North, your first exit is at Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3853.132s">You</a>  will notice weeds that are probably five feet high on the left, and these cars coming around. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3859.237s">That's</a>  a bad intersection on a good day. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3861.699s">Many</a>  accidents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3863.374s">And</a>  as of last week, the weeds were five feet high. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3866.216s">It's</a>  an obstruction of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3868.377s">If</a>  one of you would please attach this location for the DCR to cut it down, please.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3874.701s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3875.582s">The</a>  clerk is telling me that that's DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3878.864s">He'll</a>  call someone for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3883.787s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3884.868s">I'm</a>  sorry, what was the answer?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3888.811s">That's</a>  actually MassDOT and the clerk will call since he has <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3893.697s">Long</a>  history.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3894.137s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3895.559s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3898.761s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3908.429s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3909.25s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3919.548s">23-371</a>  offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3921.049s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council get a response from the Mayor and School Department dealing with the special permission for school committee members being allowed to park their recreation vehicle on the school property. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3930.853s">We</a>  did get a response from the Superintendent earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3933.575s">I</a>  will turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3935.576s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3940.637s">I</a>  received many phone calls about a recreational vehicle that was parked at Medford High School for some days. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3947.14s">And</a>  I quickly called the superintendent and we had a great discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3952.763s">And</a>  the understanding was that the word was that it was the registration came back to a school team member and the questions and the concerns of the neighbors saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3966.791s">you</a>  know, there was special treatment, that this isn't right, this is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3972.847s">So</a>  instead of... <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3975.275s">continue</a>  with the back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3979.738s">I</a>  contacted the superintendent and what she said in her response, she sent this today. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3984.702s">I'll</a>  read it if I can, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3987.724s">Just</a>  for clarification, the superintendent did say that I am providing the following information in response to the listing of a motion on tonight's city council agenda offered by city council, George Scappelli, regarding the use of parking facilities in the grounds of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4002.895s">The</a>  owner of the recreational vehicle currently parked in Method High School received permission after making a request to the high school principal who has full and appropriate authority over the use of school grounds, including parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4015.185s">The</a>  vehicle is set to be moved from the school grounds on or about July 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4020.329s">In</a>  the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4022.042s">With</a>  the explicit permission of the school department and buildings principal, school parking has been made available for use by individual Medford residents, other city departments, including the Department of Public Works and Public Safety Department, public and private contractors for temporary parking of construction machinery and other entities and organizations, including film crews working in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4046.952s">In</a>  each case, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4048.633s">the</a>  school parking space will not in any way impede or interfere with student employee or public access to school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4061.159s">Please</a>  feel free to contact me additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4064.36s">So</a>  this is exactly what the superintendent did say. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4067.022s">And,</a>  um, that's all it just clarification that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4072.044s">If</a>  this is the case, then it's given permission, then I think that's a new point. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4078.028s">So</a>  I just wanted to make sure that I shared that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4081.97s">People</a>  have their own opinions one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4085.072s">But</a>  again, if residents are seeking permission to park a vehicle at the high school, there is an avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4091.977s">That's</a>  why I was asking for policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4093.938s">I</a>  think that that's probably the biggest <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4100.518s">I</a>  get out of this conversation and this resolution is if we can, just if this is common practice, which I don't disagree, we've seen commercial vehicles, we've seen other vehicles parked there, that the policy be made public because if this is an option, because we do have residents that from time to time have a very difficult time parking their boats or recreational vehicles or <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4126.42s">you</a>  know, and sometimes during, you know, during for months now, this isn't again, this isn't all summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4131.762s">So</a>  again, as long as the policies, it's written, it's it's in, it's transparent, and I have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4140.404s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4141.904s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4146.746s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, motion received in place on file on the motion of vices and affairs to receive a place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4155.044s">All</a>  those opposed motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4157.206s">Communications</a>  from the mayor 23-333 June 7 2023 motion to waive the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4163.151s">Okay,</a>  this is table from our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4165.974s">This</a>  is the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4168.055s">I'll</a>  go to a further this is a request from the mayor to request to recommend the honorable body approve the appropriation of retained earnings the amount of 500,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4176.158s">dollars</a>  and zero cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4177.379s">This</a>  amount is being requested to subsidize the fiscal year 2024 Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4182.803s">Retained</a>  earnings are reserves of the Water and Sewer Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4185.025s">Reserves</a>  can be used for any lawful purpose and can serve to provide financial security in cases of unforeseen events or to reduce the need for additional revenue from the increased water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4195.814s">At</a>  our previous meeting, Councilor Knight invoked Rule 22 regarding the appropriation, which says any money papers can be laid on the table when they're first introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4206.837s">Do</a>  I have any discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4209.098s">So</a>  this is a vote to, this is a vote to be able to use their earnings of $500,000 to provide financial security, I'm sorry, to subsidize the fiscal year 2024 water and sewer enterprise fund.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4228.745s">Madam</a>  President, if I can, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4231.907s">Again,</a>  I was a strong, I was against the budget and anything dealing with funding for the city, especially after our hearing a month ago and the discussions of understanding that the numbers that were in the budget that were given to us weren't correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4252.139s">And</a>  until I see otherwise, I know Councilor Caraviello did his due diligence by reaching out to the company that provided those numbers to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4263.063s">They</a>  were very clear that the numbers that the financial director mentioned that this company was fraudulent in putting the numbers out, they were wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4275.207s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello can speak to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4278.15s">They</a>  told us that those are the exact numbers that the city of Medford gave to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4283.113s">And</a>  again, I will not support any money paper dealing with this year's budget because we still have many questions and many concerns of where this funding is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4296.903s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4297.804s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4298.604s">Vice</a>  Mayor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4299.785s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4303.227s">given</a>  what we heard in our discussions about the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund in our budget meetings last month, and given what discussion we were able to have prior to the invocation of the rule on the 20th, it seems very clear to me, and it would seem pretty clear from what the Water Sewer Superintendent and the DPW Commissioner were saying, is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4325.893s">Water</a>  and sewer infrastructure is basically aging out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4329.176s">We're</a>  hitting, for much of it, it was installed 100 plus years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4333.22s">That's</a>  basically the life of the pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4335.542s">And</a>  there's significant need for large investments in repairing our water and sewer infrastructure, given that it says right here, reserves can be used for any lawful purpose and can serve to provide financial security in cases of unforeseen events. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4352.177s">I</a>  think we should keep this money in the water and sewer budget for the use of addressing any emergencies or for the use of investing in capital improvements, the water and sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4364.988s">And</a>  I believe before this was tabled that <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4372.225s">I</a>  can't remember, maybe it was DPW Commissioner McGivern. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4374.486s">I</a>  don't want to put words in his mouth because it was three weeks ago, but he said something to the effect of that this would be like a dollar a month for the average consumer if this retained earnings was put on reducing the rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4387.211s">So</a>  versus this could be used to make $500,000 of investments and repairs in the water and sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4394.054s">So</a>  I don't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4395.394s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4395.974s">Thank</a>  you Mr. Ferris.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4398.736s">Thank</a>  you, President moral. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4400.157s">I</a>  also don't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4401.738s">I</a>  think, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4403.36s">Um,</a>  I think it summarizes my, my point, I think it was pretty clear from the, from the comments from the water and sewer superintendent and the Commissioner public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4415.349s">at</a>  the budget meetings and also in conversations before, that it wouldn't be unrealistic to say that we are fast approaching potential catastrophe with our water and sewer infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4429.992s">Now,</a>  I don't want people to get too worried because we're planning it out, we're managing it, but this is part of <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4437.234s">Voting</a>  this down, I believe, is one of the steps to planning it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4441.259s">One</a>  of the steps to preventing that from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4445.925s">We</a>  also heard from them that there are a number of challenges with <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4451.999s">not</a>  even just the age of our infrastructure, but the lead and the materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4455.72s">And</a>  there's going to be not only health punishments for our city going forward, but fiscal punishments as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4464.842s">And</a>  so I believe that in this case, it's the fiscally responsible choice to invest now in our city's infrastructure before we pay a bigger price down the road.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4479.3s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4480.16s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4481.001s">So</a>  if I understand this right, so my fellow councilor is saying to put the $500,000 back into the water and sewer and not give any rate relief to the residents, correct?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4492.407s">I</a>  believe that's what, yeah, what Vice Mayor is saying.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4494.368s">But</a>  for those who don't know, the Water Commission voted an 8% increase in the water bill tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4500.572s">So</a>  I know $500,000 doesn't go a long way, but it does help somewhat.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4507.782s">I</a>  think that's probably all I believe the reason that the water and sewers voting such an increase is because of the maintenance needs going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4514.629s">So</a>  it's kind of six to one half of this and the other we've, my understanding is that we've been using retained earnings for a long time to keep rates down, instead of investing in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4524.408s">or</a>  with money that could have been invested in the system additionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4527.831s">So,</a>  you know, and if we're talking about a lot of needs to replace a lot of the system going forward, it's going to be more rate hikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4535.257s">And</a>  I think there needs to be public education campaign more about that than just us talking about it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4543.313s">Yeah,</a>  no, I mean it's going to be it's significant and there's significant need and it's in the, I believe, in our budget meeting, Dan Stonking said it was in the 10s of millions of dollars, so of capital need for the water sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4556.625s">I</a>  think we spent some of that too right already. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4560.448s">So,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4565.164s">Councilor</a>  comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4566.506s">Thank</a>  you President role I appreciate this discussion and I think, in terms of my perspective on this to try to put it into a, you know, analogize it to something that most Medford residents, you know, perceive every day or drive over every day I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4581.44s">hate</a>  for our water and sewer infrastructure to take a similar trajectory to what we see on our roads and sidewalks, where we don't invest when we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4588.902s">And</a>  that deferred maintenance becomes more and more and more expensive, more so than if we had invested earlier on and tried to prevent some of those increased costs of fixing depreciated infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4602.186s">So</a>  trying to think about what's the more meaningful help to the constituency, trying to mitigate a short term <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4609.728s">to</a>  mitigate a rate increase in the short term, a small amount, or trying to sock away a fairly significant amount of money to deal with the backlog that's going to keep increasing towards doing some truly necessary repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4623.634s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4624.555s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Ponce. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4626.275s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4629.685s">I</a>  think Councilors for the discussion around this I think by Susan bears really gives a lot to think about I know what was one of the more jarring things to come out of the budget discussion was when I asked Mr. Stone King if you know, assuming that Medford surely isn't any worse than any other city in the state that's facing these, you know, aging sewer systems and he said no, it's it's Medford Melrose Malden I believe are known as being the three worst in the state as far as lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4653.102s">So</a>  I understand the financial impacts of this, but I think, you know, if you are, I know asking my neighbors, you know, would you rather have a more dependable updated, you know, avoiding catastrophe source system or a small, you know, a small discount on your rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4669.268s">I</a>  mean, I'm sure maybe it's 50-50, but as a Councilor, as a representative, I have to make the decision that I think we need to invest in this system and, you know, take this 500,000 and keep it in the account <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4681.5s">rather</a>  than using it to subsidize bills at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4685.062s">This</a>  comes up every year, it may be a different decision next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4688.143s">But</a>  I think just hearing what we heard from Mr. Stone King and Commissioner McGivern, it's really important that we have these funds to invest in an aging system that is, you know, as the city grows, more and more people tie into. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4701.749s">So</a>  I believe we have do I have a motion to from Vice President Harris or someone made a motion to catch?</p>

Let me get the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4967.353s">I</a>  wanna get the... All right, well, there's three pictures if you slide them over. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4975.241s">Now,</a>  Hooker Street is a double-sided street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4978.165s">It</a>  goes from Spring to Chevrolet. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4980.626s">There's</a>  cars on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4982.508s">This</a>  truck was enormous. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4984.629s">I</a>  mean, this was an oversized truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4987.11s">They</a>  hit the telephone pole, cracked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4989.632s">They</a>  also cracked the telephone pole in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4992.073s">They</a>  had to replace it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4994.335s">The</a>  street's not wide enough for these heavy, heavy trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4998.537s">I</a>  mean, it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5000.278s">This</a>  is, I mean, it's, it's unbelievable the size of these trucks that are coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5004.819s">But</a>  not only that, we got young children. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5006.82s">And</a>  years ago, we had a lumber company and a steel company right off of Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5012.562s">The</a>  understanding, the understanding for those trucks were to <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5018.338s">were</a>  to go down towards Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5020.98s">The</a>  simple reason they had a school at the corner of a spring in Bradshaw. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5025.905s">There</a>  was a grammar school there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5028.187s">So</a>  when the trucks came up, they would head down that way instead of going all the way down to Spring Street towards Salem Street because the children were waiting for school buses to go to school at the corners, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5041.218s">So</a>  there was always an understanding on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5043.899s">I</a>  know the chief of police would and could do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5047.541s">If</a>  you had more staffing, but they're understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5050.622s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5051.842s">And</a>  they do as much as they can monitor that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5054.563s">But</a>  years ago, we had motorcycle police sit on that corner of hookah street and bag the guys, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5062.026s">What</a>  I can't understand <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5064.007s">is</a>  the state police are stopping these trucks on the Fells Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5068.249s">They</a>  pay state and federal road tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5070.83s">So</a>  why are they stopping them so they have to come down Spring Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5075.211s">It's</a>  not beneficial, like I say. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5077.732s">But</a>  there's a lot of damage, and it's the taxpayers that are paying for these lights and these telephone poles that are being locked down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5084.735s">So</a>  it's coming out of our pockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5086.696s">So</a>  it's just the idea something has to be done, like I say. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5092.75s">If</a>  it can be done, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5094.391s">But</a>  again, the chief, his hands are tied because he's understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5098.432s">Like</a>  I say, there's more important things with the things that are going on in the city, with rapes and robberies and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5105.274s">That's</a>  where the police are really needed, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5108.495s">I</a>  worked for the town for years, 44 years in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5112.096s">I</a>  was also a police officer and a park police officer for 14 years in the city when I came back from overseas, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5119.018s">So</a>  I know the city like the back of my hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5121.859s">All</a>  right, so I'm just trying to improve the city, not downgrade the city, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5127.923s">I</a>  appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5129.564s">Thank</a>  you very much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5131.766s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5132.619s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[John Sardone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5162.38s">Those</a>  are delivery trucks, but not these big, big, big, big, big trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5165.242s">But</a>  you're going to get the trailers there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5167.583s">They</a>  shouldn't be coming down Spring Street.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5169.244s">That's</a>  supposed to be Norby Trucking Industry in any ways, correct?</p>

    <p>[John Sardone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5173.127s">Well,</a>  I mean, you've got Riverside Avenue, you've got Salem Street, you've got the Fellsway to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5177.49s">Like</a>  I say, you've got the Parkway to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5179.772s">They</a>  shouldn't be coming down Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5182.153s">And</a>  they're coming down early in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5183.694s">They're</a>  not coming down late. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5184.794s">And</a>  these big oil tankers, there's only one gas station on the Fellsway, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5189.716s">And</a>  why are they coming down Spring Street to gas up the station when it's on the Fellsway? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5195.038s">It</a>  doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5196.338s">It</a>  just doesn't make sense, like I say. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5198.699s">But</a>  they're coming down all hours of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5201.14s">I</a>  mean, Sundays, the large day is supposed to be, but not anymore, the way things are going, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5207.102s">It's</a>  just the idea is, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5209.363s">The</a>  trucking is there every single day, like they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5212.945s">And</a>  we have no, like you said, we have no dealerships down on that side of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5217.807s">Years</a>  ago, we did at the corner of the Fellsway, where the gas station was. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5222.208s">There</a>  was a Subaru dealer there, but that was 45 years ago, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5226.61s">I</a>  could tell you everything that happened in this city in probably the last 72 years, because I've been around. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5231.852s">I</a>  worked in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5233.533s">I</a>  was an officer in the city, so I know what goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5236.694s">Okay,</a>  like I say, I just hope something could be done about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5241.155s">And</a>  we got a lot of young children on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5242.835s">The</a>  neighborhoods are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5244.256s">There's</a>  a lot of young couples that are moving into the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5247.316s">There's</a>  not too many of us old-timers still left over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5250.237s">Okay,</a>  so this is what has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5252.958s">I</a>  mean, if somebody can put the word into the chief, I know the chief will do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5259.239s">I'm</a>  pretty good friends with him, like I say, but it's just the idea is he's understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5264.76s">hire</a>  more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5265.721s">Years</a>  ago, we used to, we used to pay to get onto civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5270.025s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5270.745s">I</a>  had a low number when I, I, my number was like 41, 49 or something like that to get onto civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5277.07s">My</a>  mother sent it in because I was overseas. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5280.093s">When</a>  I came back, I got called, took the physical and got on. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5285.197s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5286.578s">And</a>  then when they had the police at night, the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5291.632s">Chief</a>  Keating and a few of the other guys said, look, we got a good guy here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5295.874s">Let</a>  him be a park police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5298.035s">And</a>  I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5298.875s">And</a>  I was just turning 21, because you have to be 21 to get a license to carry a firearm. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5304.217s">But</a>  the chief signed for me, and that's when I went on to the park police for 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5309.339s">And</a>  I did a lot through the parks and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5313.821s">Again,</a>  like I say, I don't want to take up much of your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5316.942s">You</a>  probably got some other people out here that want to speak also. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5319.925s">but</a>  I just appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5322.127s">So</a>  if you can do something about it, I would appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5325.349s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5325.989s">Take</a>  care. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5326.39s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5326.77s">Stay</a>  healthy, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5327.991s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5331.253s">Councilor</a>  Costa, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5333.835s">Well,</a>  I thank the resident for coming forward to raise the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5338.979s">I</a>  think the council had the benefit of seeing some of the photos that the gentleman had took on his phone and I was picturing <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5345.896s">delivery</a>  trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5346.716s">We</a>  saw a gigantic 18-wheeler. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5348.156s">It</a>  is, you know, shocking and ludicrous to see such a ludicrously sized truck for a residential street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5356.378s">Obviously,</a>  one of the services that the MPD does perform is traffic patrol, traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5361.559s">You</a>  know, this is a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5363.74s">There's</a>  a lot of the city to cover, but I think it would be, you know, if we know there are these priority areas that these huge trucks are taking advantage of, I'd like to see some increased enforcement around there just so we can <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5376.159s">change</a>  the change the norms around that.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5378.741s">Thank</a>  you guys are constantly saying, um, yeah, it's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5383.725s">The</a>  photo is jarring to see that 18 wheeler just in a residential residential neighborhoods like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5389.69s">Um,</a>  where I live, there's trucks coming down all the time, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5392.712s">And</a>  it's super, super loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5394.073s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5396.405s">It's,</a>  it's, it's not, it's not great when when when you expect it, it's even worse when it hasn't happened in this sort of only started happening last decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5405.628s">I</a>  think for in the interest of fairness to our residents, it would be it would behoove our city to reach out to some of these companies and design a plan to redistribute some of the truck traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5418.692s">And</a>  you know there's nothing that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5420.792s">Um,</a>  you know, by by law really say you can't drive down this road. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5424.374s">But,</a>  um, if someone from the city, um, if we could work together, get someone from the city to reach out to some of these companies or these stores, find out who who's who which truck companies are doing the driving and say, you know, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5439.839s">Why</a>  don't you take Salem Street instead of spring? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5442.12s">Why</a>  don't you take this road and instead of that one redistributed a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5446.882s">So</a>  it's a little fair on our residents.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5449.714s">Thank</a>  you, President Harris, did did the gentleman Mr. Did he say it's a truck or the chief said it's a truck or so we can't ban trucks Did he say that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5461.18s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5463.942s">Right,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5464.402s">That's</a>  what I was gonna say that this could go to the traffic commission and either you could go no trucks or you could go tonnage limit and you can only have the smaller trucks that would be I'm just <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5476.524s">chiefs</a>  on the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5477.504s">So</a>  I think that would be the way to go on this one, we have some streets like that around the city, where you have kind of this, you know, because we have these parkways that are no trucks, you end up having weird, you know, they don't want to do it, but they could drive down back towards 93 down Riverside and back up Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5494.168s">I</a>  know it's a little bit longer for them to drive, but they don't even need to go down Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5497.968s">So</a>  unless there's, I know Harvard Ave is like the one we can't touch, or Harvard Street is the one that we can't touch, because that's actually a trucking route. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5505.39s">And</a>  there's some sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5507.917s">that's</a>  not there for Spring Street, that's what I would suggest. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5511.879s">And</a>  maybe we could suggest that on our next agenda, submit something to the Traffic Commission suggesting that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5518.201s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5519.221s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5519.762s">It'd</a>  be also nice if we could get that list of companies from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5525.584s">I</a>  don't know if we could, but... Yeah, we can reach out.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5528.565s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5530.103s">Thank</a>  you gentlemen for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5531.204s">And</a>  I think something that goes on set too is, and thankfully we don't have it around here a lot, but vehicles jump curbs all the time unintentionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5539.188s">So,</a>  you know, you may think that, oh, there's a big truck, at least I'm on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5542.71s">This</a>  stuff happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5543.911s">So</a>  it's really, it's just a nuts level of danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5546.532s">So</a>  again, yeah, what everyone said to see an 18 wheeler on what is essentially, what's a residential street is incredibly jarring. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5552.415s">And</a>  it seemed to be doing some sort of like three point turn as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5555.297s">So</a>  that's all pretty, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5557.338s">Terrifying.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5558.319s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5559.039s">So,</a>  yeah, we'll see if Council would like to submit something for our next agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5564.303s">So</a>  is there anyone else would like to speak for public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5570.467s">Seeing</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5572.569s">We</a>  do have papers in the hands of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5576.511s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, I would ask you to submit for the next agenda or I'm going to perhaps rule out of order just because this is an emergency situation for <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5585.075s">this.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5585.975s">I</a>  can read it off, but I just know this might be something that people are interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5590.077s">I'm</a>  just not having the notice for such a topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5595.518s">You</a>  already have the answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5600.56s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5600.98s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5601.44s">Sure,</a>  so 23-373 offered under suspension by Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved the Mayor, School Committee, and Superintendent explain the policy changes involving possible coaching changes for our high school student-athletes at Medford High School.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5611.622s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5612.082s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, for allowing me to speak on this because I did talk to the superintendent and I want to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5617.367s">I</a>  know that one of the one of the students, Stevie Rayner, he's who contacted me directly, wanted me to say say hi to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5625.434s">And</a>  he said, you know, and answer these the concerns that <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5630.138s">You</a>  know, it's funny when things go out, and the discussion was that they're opening all the coaching positions for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5638.741s">And</a>  I know this isn't a privy of the city council, but this is a forum that, unfortunately, as quickly as the word can get out, because this is an important topic, I talked to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5652.826s">The</a>  word was on the street, and the superintendent and I discussed it in depth, that <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5659.467s">We</a>  are now putting in a policy in the middle of the summer that will now open up all the coaching positions and the athletic director, the big question was the athletic directors were not involved in the hiring, that the process is skewed and this is, you know, witch hunts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5681.641s">talk</a>  to the superintendent, the superintendent reassured me that the athletic directors are in full involvement with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5691.144s">They</a>  will be on top of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5694.125s">This</a>  is something that and I shared my own personal opinion as a 32 year coach and athletic director and understanding the process that I shared my concerns that <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5705.308s">And</a>  that's where we've got some phone calls that during the fall season, the fall season starts in a few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5710.795s">And</a>  the process is in place right now to <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5714.934s">have</a>  a committee put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5716.475s">And</a>  the rumor was that it was gonna be just parents and kids hiring coaches, not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5723.821s">The</a>  superintendent and I shared what we do in neighbor community where I'm part of that as a former coach, I'm also involved in the hiring team. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5734.63s">That's</a>  between six to eight individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5737.192s">It's</a>  not two or three people. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5738.914s">It's</a>  not people that are on there that don't like a coach that's sitting in the position right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5744.458s">It's</a>  a position where we have the athletic directors, the assistant assistant athletic director, the the athletic trainer, you have two sitting seniors or captains that are coming back that season, and alumni that played that sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5760.943s">You</a>  also have a parent and you have either a teacher in the school or a coach that's in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5768.991s">And</a>  so it's a whole, it's a whole committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5770.853s">It's</a>  a true committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5772.154s">And</a>  I think that, um, you know, that's, that's what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5775.917s">It's,</a>  it's very important that every school in the greater Boston league does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5780.12s">I</a>  know that I talked to, uh, athletic director Maloney, he met with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5784.604s">They</a>  had a great discussion when I was told that the process is exactly what, what I just said, that that's the hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5792.19s">So</a>  again, let's, let's, you know, not jump ahead of it, not, <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5798.337s">it,</a>  you know, because kids are nervous, and I expressed the superintendent in this way, because of the fall season is what I'm a little concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5808.423s">By</a>  the time the committee's put together, by the time the interviews are done, you're looking probably the middle of August, the season starts the third week of August. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5819.025s">Using</a>  football, for example, if the football coach is let go and a new coach comes in, you are giving the student athletes that have been involved with this coach the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5832.062s">This</a>  is every sport, girls' soccer, boys' soccer, golf, volleyball. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5836.951s">coaches</a>  that involved last two months with the student athletes working camps, giving back to the community, kids getting in shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5843.778s">The</a>  other piece that was was brought forth is you have coaches from colleges that are talking to student athletes, and they're discussing the possibility of being recruited and <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5854.328s">to</a>  make a coaching change this quick might be detrimental for their future. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5858.269s">So</a>  the superintendent understood, we agreed to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5862.689s">But</a>  I think that, you know, I think the process in place is a fair and open process. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5867.75s">It's</a>  just like, like she said, it's an anomaly, because you have to start somehow, you have to start sometime. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5873.471s">So</a>  my wish was starting for the winter season, if this is a process we move to. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5878.972s">But</a>  again, I think the answer is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5882.853s">It's</a>  not <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5884.245s">The</a>  athletic director is involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5886.026s">It's</a>  a true committee, from what I was told by the superintendent, of a varied amount of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5891.59s">It's</a>  not just two people, a parent that doesn't like a coach, or a kid that doesn't like a coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5895.754s">So</a>  I appreciate letting me discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5899.376s">I</a>  think publicly it needed to be said, because I don't think there's a forum, as we get closer to the season, that I think the kids wanted me to give an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5908.383s">Their</a>  parents had reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5911.645s">I</a>  appreciate it, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5912.846s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5913.127s">I</a>  appreciate that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5914.828s">Any</a>  further discussion on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5919.252s">That</a>  is the end of our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5920.693s">I</a>  do not believe we have any papers that need to be taken off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5922.895s">Councilor</a>  Collins?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5923.975s">Motion</a>  to adjourn.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5925.136s">On</a>  a motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5928.119s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5928.779s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5929.44s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5930.241s">Motion</a>  passes, meeting adjourned.</p>
