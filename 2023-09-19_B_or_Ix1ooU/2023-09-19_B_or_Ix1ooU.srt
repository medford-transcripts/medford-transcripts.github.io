141
00:54:32,725 --> 00:54:39,751

[SPEAKER_06]: I started my role as principal at Medford High School on July 1st and I spent the entirety of the month reviewing operations, structures, policies that were presently in place and former policies that were in place along with the program of studies.

145
00:55:04,778 --> 00:55:08,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I held various listening sessions throughout the summer months.

146
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:27,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I had, I would say, about 50 caregivers that came in, along with students and several staff members that came in that wanted to have discussions about the past couple years at Medford High School, along with welcoming me and along with providing suggestions and feedback for moving forward.

147
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:41,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we're going to review today is really three shifts that we implemented at the high school this year with a lens of providing a restorative approach while still holding students accountable.

148
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:51,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So the three shifts that we're looking at are the attendance policy, as well as the cell phone policy and the backpack policy.

149
00:55:52,659 --> 00:56:01,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Following that, we'll review different activities and how we are going to collect feedback throughout the year from both students and faculty and staff.

150
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:07,466
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first one that we're going to review is the attendance policy, which is really small.

151
00:56:07,586 --> 00:56:10,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I had a copy of it.

152
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:11,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

153
00:56:13,724 --> 00:56:21,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so the attendance of unexcused absences per y that has been formally in did is we wanted to have approach to that because

154
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:35,282
[SPEAKER_06]: 13th unexcused absence, you would receive no credit for that course.

155
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:39,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And that could happen in quarter one or happen in quarter two.

156
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:49,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we wanted to do is really break that up so that students were, yes, still held accountable, but also with a lens of being restorative and being able to earn it back.

157
00:56:50,071 --> 00:56:53,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's three unexcused absences per quarter.

158
00:56:53,894 --> 00:56:56,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look on the next slide, which I did have a lot of

159
00:56:57,577 --> 00:57:04,464
[SPEAKER_06]: questions and clarified that what constitutes an unexcused absence.

160
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:11,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So an illness medical note that's the line in there on the second slide that what's excused and unexcused.

161
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:14,334
[SPEAKER_06]: So a parent or caregiver would need to call in

162
00:57:14,861 --> 00:57:17,942
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to excuse their student from an illness.

163
00:57:18,222 --> 00:57:30,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I know previously it had been with a medical note, but we really wanted to look at it as an equity, through an equity lens that not everyone can go to the doctors immediately or get a doctor's appointment.

164
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:31,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So a call-in will do.

165
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:38,848
[SPEAKER_06]: If we see that there's a pattern, then we may have further discussions with caregivers and with students regarding the absences.

166
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:42,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's three unexcused absences per quarter.

167
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:52,559
[SPEAKER_06]: On the fourth, instead of no credit received, the earned grade, so these are students that have earned over a 59, will be dropped to a 59.

168
00:57:53,279 --> 00:58:07,408
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, they're able to earn it back quarter two and quarter three and quarter four as to being put on an attendance contract, meaning that they're not going to exceed those three excused absences the next quarter.

169
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:08,529
[SPEAKER_06]: If they do not,

170
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:12,537
[SPEAKER_06]: then they will be able to get their earned grade back.

171
00:58:12,577 --> 00:58:16,040
[SPEAKER_06]: We will go back in and we will provide them their earned grade.

172
00:58:17,422 --> 00:58:20,605
[SPEAKER_06]: We also want students to be able to self advocate for themselves.

173
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:23,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have the attendance appeal process.

174
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:29,695
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a student has more than three unexcused absences at the end of the quarter, we will hold an attendance appeal.

175
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:38,609
[SPEAKER_06]: the people listed in the slide, the house assistant principal to that student, assistant principal of operations and engagement.

176
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:54,965
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted one person that will be the same across all houses to be part of the appeal, a school Councilor for the house and the engagement specialist as well to be able to support that student in a supportive lens to get them back on track for attendance.

177
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:16,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I created a kind of flowchart for students to be able to easily look at it to say Okay, I have three unexcused absences what constitutes an unexcused absence and then go through the process of being able to attend an appeals board and what what that looks like.

178
00:59:21,744 --> 00:59:40,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I put an example of what the attendance improvement contract looks like, and it's really just having check-ins so that school Councilors, engagement specialists, and assistant principals are able to support them throughout the month in any challenges that they may be encountering with being able to arrive to school.

179
00:59:45,135 --> 00:59:46,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want any?

180
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:50,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to do questions after each, or do you want me to continue with the

181
00:59:51,277 --> 00:59:52,038
[SPEAKER_06]: different policies.

182
00:59:52,638 --> 00:59:55,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they're kind of three separate buckets.

183
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So, after each bucket will questions, member.

184
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:00,183
[SPEAKER_13]: So, thank you.

185
01:00:00,604 --> 01:00:05,327
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate the clarity of all of this, I especially want to say I'm.

186
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:10,569
[SPEAKER_13]: The foresight about having one individual who's present across the houses.

187
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:20,803
[SPEAKER_13]: You know we've had issues where the same thing implemented across the houses hasn't been implemented in the same way so having that person there who will.

188
01:00:21,944 --> 01:00:33,512
[SPEAKER_13]: have the experience of having done it in the other houses is fabulous will save us from the, the challenge we were certainly going to face in the future so I appreciate that.

189
01:00:33,772 --> 01:00:39,936
[SPEAKER_13]: I also appreciate that this was actually, you know, the, the, the losing credit.

190
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:41,097
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not new.

191
01:00:42,618 --> 01:00:57,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't even remember but I think that's actually even more strict than this but I, so I appreciate that that is that the goal of this is not, you know, to penalize anybody it's to recognize that.

192
01:00:58,047 --> 01:01:06,213
[SPEAKER_13]: you're not actually in the classroom, even if you're a high-performing student and you're not in the classroom, you will come to class and not know what was just spoken about.

193
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:17,621
[SPEAKER_13]: And just like with out-of-school suspensions, when we did that, the students who are not there, when they come back to class, diminish the education of every student in that room.

194
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:20,623
[SPEAKER_13]: And it doesn't matter if they were A students,

195
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:26,247
[SPEAKER_13]: They still don't know what happened, and they're going to use up those very important minutes to find out what did they miss.

196
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:30,309
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate your approach to this.

197
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:30,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

198
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

199
01:01:34,972 --> 01:01:35,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin?

200
01:01:35,933 --> 01:01:36,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

201
01:01:37,854 --> 01:01:38,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the presentation.

202
01:01:38,915 --> 01:01:39,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

203
01:01:39,715 --> 01:01:49,021
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to ask how this policy is going to be differentiated for our other populations, for our English learners, our students with disabilities.

204
01:01:49,548 --> 01:01:58,556
[SPEAKER_16]: For the appeals process in particular, I don't see any representation from those departments, and I'm wondering if that's been thought of or how that's gonna be handled.

205
01:01:59,536 --> 01:02:06,723
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I should add in here is that a student can bring a staff member that they choose.

206
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:16,391
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they have a staff member or a teacher that they have a trusting relationship with and want them to be part of the appeals process that will be shared with them,

207
01:02:18,929 --> 01:02:21,952
[SPEAKER_06]: the four that I stated in there will be no matter what.

208
01:02:22,832 --> 01:02:32,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will make sure to communicate that with all of our students, that if they do have a particular person that they would like to go to the appeals board with, that they can bring.

209
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:47,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with translation services, we'll make sure that they have that so that they're able to communicate with us in the language that they're most comfortable with, because we want them to be able to express themselves and to share what the barriers were

210
01:02:48,882 --> 01:02:58,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And not just say okay no you're not you're getting in you're not getting the attendance appeal you're getting the 59 and you're going on the improvement contract but like we really want this to be a wraparound approach.

211
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:10,440
[SPEAKER_06]: So, making sure that they can communicate in their in their home language is very important to me, and I know to my team as well, and then also there are going to be situations that there's going to be students that.

212
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:39,715
[SPEAKER_06]: are gonna have extenuating circumstances, are students that have already been identified as having challenges with attendance, and that's where we're really bringing in the engagement specialists that we've been working really hard to kind of relook at what their role is at the high school and looking at it as a support and not just as an extra person in the building and bringing them on board quickly into some cases that we've often seen that it starts with tardies

213
01:03:40,174 --> 01:03:41,534
[SPEAKER_06]: instead of with absences.

214
01:03:41,555 --> 01:03:46,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we're students seeing students really slip with tardies, then we're getting the engagement specialist quickly.

215
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:53,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have a new form and a new kind of protocol of how to engage an engagement specialist.

216
01:03:53,539 --> 01:04:06,503
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not just going to be a house AP that's engaging them because sometimes it doesn't take them and it'll take them a couple of weeks where a teacher will be like, Oh, I've noticed that Marta was out of class or that, you know, they're 30 minutes late to class every day.

217
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:09,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So being able to get the engagement specialist

218
01:04:09,951 --> 01:04:14,355
[SPEAKER_06]: more quickly to be able to support the student as well.

219
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:15,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

220
01:04:15,256 --> 01:04:30,128
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I guess I'm wondering, what is the process of collaboration with like the Director of Pupil Services and the EL Director around making sure that this information, particularly the policy, but also the appeals process is appropriately communicated to those populations?

221
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:48,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we have the house, the house assistant principals have house meetings that happen weekly where they bring in people to those house meetings that can be the liaisons that may be of the particular student that is struggling the EL director or.

222
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:51,139
[SPEAKER_06]: an EL teacher that may have the students.

223
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're actually brought into the house meetings that happen weekly.

224
01:04:55,383 --> 01:05:06,831
[SPEAKER_06]: They might not be called into each and every one of them, but when they have the identified list of students, they'll be able to call in people that will be able to support them on the exterior as well in the classrooms and so forth.

225
01:05:07,392 --> 01:05:11,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really ran by the house APs and done weekly.

226
01:05:11,295 --> 01:05:14,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not every single time that that whole group will come together.

227
01:05:15,201 --> 01:05:17,243
[SPEAKER_06]: when needed so that everyone is informed.

228
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:22,086
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, we're all in the loop of being able to support the student as quick.

229
01:05:22,726 --> 01:05:24,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the time is of the essence with this.

230
01:05:24,948 --> 01:05:28,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we do not want to get to the point that they're already past it.

231
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:35,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are looking at data every other day, pretty much at this point as to what the attendance is.

232
01:05:35,574 --> 01:05:40,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, that's our real focus right now because we don't have the grades to too much yet because we're only in day 12.

233
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:52,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So really kind of honing in that and seeing any patterns that we're already identifying to be able to get the people, to your point, that we need to help support students.

234
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

235
01:05:53,010 --> 01:06:04,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to know about in terms of the disproportionality, like the data collection and making sure that we're looking at any incidents of disproportionality, particularly for these populations, but also in our credit recovery programs.

236
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:06,253
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, because they lead

237
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:14,739
[SPEAKER_16]: one can lead to the other for the absence policy, and then you're going into the credit recovery, and there's some work that we have to do around there as well.

238
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:26,048
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that I'd be really interested in hearing, I know it's day 12 or 13, you said, I would love to hear maybe mid-year, just sort of what you're seeing in terms of the data.

239
01:06:26,288 --> 01:06:26,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

240
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:28,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that'd be great.

241
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:35,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're very eager to start looking at the data and start seeing more trends as time goes on, and then implementing interventions

242
01:06:36,224 --> 01:06:43,208
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout and not waiting until the very end where we're then trying to think about, okay, what are we going to do for next year?

243
01:06:43,268 --> 01:06:54,795
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of interventions can we immediately put in place seeing that we do have engagement specialists and so forth that, like I said, we're trying to like, what else can we do with these people that are so important?

244
01:06:54,815 --> 01:07:00,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I was gonna say, honestly, you had me at wraparound services.

245
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:01,139
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

246
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:01,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

247
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:02,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

248
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:03,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

249
01:07:05,202 --> 01:07:05,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

250
01:07:06,124 --> 01:07:19,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The question I had was more around what happens when students go to class and then leave to use the restroom or mill around or whatever, whatever might be happening.

251
01:07:19,507 --> 01:07:26,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, what's the difference between I'm here and I just went to the bathroom and I'm absent from class.

252
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:33,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there like, and is there like, how are you sort of driving at consistency so that all the teachers

253
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:40,635
[SPEAKER_02]: are taking the same approach to that question, particularly about what happens in the classroom.

254
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:50,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think the other thing that we had concerns about last year was we heard like pretty clearly from teachers, like I don't even bother doing that.

255
01:07:51,857 --> 01:08:00,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even bother like reporting kids who are absent to class or who spend a lot of time out of class because nothing happens.

256
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the other question I have is

257
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:07,334
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you know it's actually happening, like with any sort of fidelity in the classroom?

258
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:10,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise you can't, you don't have good data if it's not being reported.

259
01:08:10,577 --> 01:08:21,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think those are both questions that are less about like, did you come to school and more about like what happened while you were in school that I would love to hear a little more about.

260
01:08:21,766 --> 01:08:23,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have the E-Haul Pass data.

261
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:29,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're having students when they're leaving the classroom have the lanyard so it's easily identifiable that they're

262
01:08:30,188 --> 01:08:34,150
[SPEAKER_06]: were in class at one point to be able to have the lanyard to be out in the hall.

263
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:41,973
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kind of put a tricky little stamp on there so they're not able to take any lanyard or buy them off of Amazon.

264
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:49,937
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually now tied to a classroom because they're pretty savvy with those sort of things when they want to try to get around to being in the hallways.

265
01:08:50,407 --> 01:09:00,135
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the eHaul pass system that I actually, this time, instead of students doing it on their own Chromebooks, there's kiosks in every single classroom.

266
01:09:00,155 --> 01:09:08,742
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a student leaves, they stop at the kiosk that's right at the door where they're creating a pass so we can actually track their data.

267
01:09:09,221 --> 01:09:12,363
[SPEAKER_06]: as to how many minutes they've been out of the classroom.

268
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:29,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been starting to look at that because we've already seen some repeated offenders in the hallway and being like, OK, let's see how many minutes that you've been out of the classroom and having conversations with the students first before bringing in the caregiver so that we can hopefully try to rectify or change that behavior immediately.

269
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:39,717
[SPEAKER_06]: As to the attendance, that was not something that was consistently done, I think, in the past by staff.

270
01:09:40,617 --> 01:09:52,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are now pulling period attendance at the end of each day to make sure that staff is submitting period attendance and that we're actually looking it over and accounting for every student in the building.

271
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:59,624
[SPEAKER_06]: We did put in, when it came to kind of the accountability of students being outside of the classroom,

272
01:10:00,683 --> 01:10:10,950
[SPEAKER_06]: My team has created a tiered intervention discipline, what did I call it?

273
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:11,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I was savvy.

274
01:10:12,131 --> 01:10:28,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We were savvy in how we called it, but it's basically a intervention discipline grid to help both teachers for tier one, what are they doing in the classroom, to then when it gets to tier two, to the AP, and when it gets to tier three, then the principal gets involved.

275
01:10:29,349 --> 01:10:39,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of this is in conversation as like, yes, we need to account for the student, we're collecting data, then if they're not in class, where does that go and how is that referred to?

276
01:10:39,453 --> 01:10:52,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So operationally, we've implemented a lot and we're trying to support teachers because it was a lot of information to put out in the beginning and we're providing PD around it and so forth.

277
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:57,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we're really trying to do, long answer, short answer to a long,

278
01:10:59,323 --> 01:11:17,440
[SPEAKER_06]: answer is to put in systems and structures, review data, hold students accountable, but also provide support to them so that we're helping them for, you know, post-secondary or careers after.

279
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:23,066
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're really trying to do and the lens that we're trying to take with these restorative approaches to this.

280
01:11:24,602 --> 01:11:33,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it seems like a lot and I've got a lot of feedback because it's just a lot to put out in the beginning and caregivers and students alone are like, what is happening?

281
01:11:33,545 --> 01:11:37,747
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really just pretty basic is we want you in the classroom.

282
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:42,889
[SPEAKER_06]: We want you to be with your teachers and getting the most instruction as possible.

283
01:11:46,391 --> 01:11:46,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

284
01:11:46,711 --> 01:11:47,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

285
01:11:47,111 --> 01:11:48,312
[SPEAKER_05]: We can move on to the next.

286
01:11:48,552 --> 01:11:49,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

287
01:11:49,313 --> 01:11:50,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Cell phones.

288
01:11:50,113 --> 01:11:51,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought that this was going to be.

289
01:11:51,814 --> 01:11:53,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, was there anyone else?

290
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:54,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I have one.

291
01:11:54,756 --> 01:11:56,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.

292
01:11:57,398 --> 01:11:59,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.

293
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:00,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

294
01:12:00,339 --> 01:12:01,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the presentation.

295
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just had a quick question, um, about tardiness, like, um, and.

296
01:12:06,843 --> 01:12:10,906
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if a bus is late, will the student be mock tardy?

297
01:12:11,246 --> 01:12:12,627
[SPEAKER_00]: How could you explain that?

298
01:12:13,035 --> 01:12:16,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so I've had many conversations with the MBTA.

299
01:12:16,618 --> 01:12:21,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I know a lot about the MBTA in my two months being here in Medford.

300
01:12:22,462 --> 01:12:25,665
[SPEAKER_06]: We are, that is a great question and it's come up a lot.

301
01:12:25,785 --> 01:12:27,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've had lots of discussions.

302
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:32,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that a lot of caregivers have reached out to the mayor's office as well as to the MBTA.

303
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:35,451
[SPEAKER_06]: regarding concerns getting to school.

304
01:12:35,871 --> 01:12:38,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I really have no control over that.

305
01:12:38,212 --> 01:12:43,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I tried to do and what I'm trying to do, and this started last week, is I need to collect data on it.

306
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:50,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have started an attendance code that says Tardy and VTA.

307
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:51,896
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a code.

308
01:12:52,216 --> 01:12:59,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the end, we can pull actually the data of the first and second bus, because the third bus is really the late bus.

309
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:02,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And thankfully, we have that for students that missed the first and second bus.

310
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:09,127
[SPEAKER_06]: but collecting data on those first two buses that really should be there before the 740 warning bell.

311
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:17,252
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, we're having them sign in because it's a way to be able to track the arrival times of the MBTA at this point.

312
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:26,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that when they're coming to attendance appeals or having conversations with their house principals, we can actually see like this is a student that comes on the bus.

313
01:13:27,859 --> 01:13:28,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

314
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:31,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

315
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:32,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We can move on.

316
01:13:32,222 --> 01:13:32,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

317
01:13:32,836 --> 01:13:34,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cell phones.

318
01:13:35,317 --> 01:13:48,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to note that we did receive a grant from Desi to help support resources or policy around cell phones in the classrooms.

319
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:54,929
[SPEAKER_06]: We are working with a small committee right now of teachers, we're going to bring it to a larger community along with talking to students.

320
01:13:55,416 --> 01:14:02,181
[SPEAKER_06]: about what we can do with this allotted set of funds that DESE has put forward to us.

321
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:10,146
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be in the very near future because we want to use the funds as soon as possible as they're going to hopefully come in at any point.

322
01:14:10,766 --> 01:14:13,669
[SPEAKER_06]: So cell phone policy, it's really out of sight.

323
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:20,774
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of conversations about these new yonder pouches, you might have seen that you kind of lock it in there.

324
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:22,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what a lot of schools are moving to.

325
01:14:23,316 --> 01:14:24,537
[SPEAKER_06]: We really wanted to do the.

326
01:14:26,759 --> 01:14:32,605
[SPEAKER_06]: approach as to teaching them how to self-regulate with their cell phone.

327
01:14:33,006 --> 01:14:47,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, there is a policy, there are different infractions that we go down and it's kind of tiered where the first one's the teacher, the second one's the AP, then the caregiver comes in, and then we're removing the cell phone during the school day.

328
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:50,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of a gradual tiered approach to that.

329
01:14:51,035 --> 01:14:56,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we want to teach them if you have a job, you can't be on your phone.

330
01:14:56,718 --> 01:15:01,660
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going into the career world after high school, you can't be on your cell phone the whole time.

331
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:06,723
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of completely removing it from them, we're trying to teach them that you can have your cell phone.

332
01:15:07,063 --> 01:15:16,014
[SPEAKER_06]: and be responsible for it while still holding them accountable if they're getting to the point of not complying with the policy.

333
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:20,179
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you can see, we just don't want the cell phones out.

334
01:15:20,259 --> 01:15:23,643
[SPEAKER_06]: They're provided a Chromebook if they don't have their Chromebook because they miss their Chromebook.

335
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:34,253
[SPEAKER_06]: They can get a loaner Chromebook that we've moved to the house offices so it's closer so they're not traveling, you know, all the way down to the library and we're losing them for 20 minutes.

336
01:15:34,273 --> 01:15:42,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should never be a barrier as to being able to engage with anything that's instructional on a device.

337
01:15:43,642 --> 01:15:46,165
[SPEAKER_06]: We really just want the cell phones put away for

338
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:49,231
[SPEAKER_06]: the class period.

339
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,952
[SPEAKER_06]: They are allowed to use it in the hallways.

340
01:15:51,032 --> 01:15:53,413
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a thing that we had lots of discussion about.

341
01:15:53,733 --> 01:15:55,893
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be able to use it on their breaks, right?

342
01:15:55,993 --> 01:15:59,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And then be able to put it away and move on to the next class.

343
01:15:59,994 --> 01:16:01,134
[SPEAKER_06]: They can use it at lunch.

344
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:04,155
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really just not allowed to use it in the classroom.

345
01:16:04,695 --> 01:16:14,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have the different infractions that, like I said, get to the reminders in the classroom all the way to, you know, if this is becoming repeated behavior,

346
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:19,202
[SPEAKER_06]: then you need to drop it off at your house AP office for two weeks, and then you can earn it back.

347
01:16:21,262 --> 01:16:22,423
[SPEAKER_05]: May I ask a question from the chair?

348
01:16:22,643 --> 01:16:22,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

349
01:16:22,963 --> 01:16:25,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you explain a bit about the grant and how much it was for?

350
01:16:26,364 --> 01:16:26,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So the grant was $25,000.

351
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:35,988
[SPEAKER_06]: We just received the word right after the start of school, I want to say like a week and a half ago, maybe two weeks now.

352
01:16:37,862 --> 01:16:44,366
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've met with a committee of teachers that are volunteering to kind of strategize because they've already implemented this policy.

353
01:16:44,426 --> 01:16:47,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So what can we use the funds for now?

354
01:16:47,588 --> 01:16:50,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Teachers are liking the cell phone policy there.

355
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:53,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have a lot of teachers on board.

356
01:16:53,571 --> 01:16:59,614
[SPEAKER_06]: We have students that were grumbling about it and now they're like, wow, I can actually have my phone away for, you know, 50 minutes.

357
01:16:59,674 --> 01:17:01,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really wasn't that big of a deal.

358
01:17:01,736 --> 01:17:04,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a little bit of muscle memory for them.

359
01:17:05,507 --> 01:17:15,449
[SPEAKER_06]: To be able to do that, so I can say i've walked the halls a lot these past couple weeks and that we, I have not seen any cell phones out during instruction.

360
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:27,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Could there be some yes, but for the most part it's been it's been very bought into by faculty and staff and they're already seeing the difference in.

361
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:32,294
[SPEAKER_06]: when I had conversations with them and student engagement and actually like talking to their peers.

362
01:17:32,334 --> 01:17:39,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they're doing turn in talks, they're actually talking and not looking at a cell phone, which is really the whole goal of why we wanna put away the cell phones.

363
01:17:40,357 --> 01:17:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 25,000 is for the cell phone policy initiative.

364
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:44,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for that, yes.

365
01:17:45,559 --> 01:17:55,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you say out of sight, it can come into the classroom, but it needs to either be in a pocket or a coat pocket or in a purse, something like that.

366
01:17:55,592 --> 01:18:01,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what is the data showing in the last 12 days for reports of cell phone use in the classroom?

367
01:18:01,634 --> 01:18:07,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So we haven't had any, I would have to check with my house APs.

368
01:18:07,337 --> 01:18:14,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in totality in the 12 days, just for the day, we've had five in total.

369
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've had no student not willing to hand it over.

370
01:18:19,182 --> 01:18:22,643
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you have people like yourself looking in windows to make sure it's being in here too.

371
01:18:22,663 --> 01:18:23,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, constantly.

372
01:18:23,163 --> 01:18:24,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

373
01:18:24,912 --> 01:18:26,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the committee.

374
01:18:27,614 --> 01:18:34,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think once we start, you know, getting into classrooms more and doing observations will actually be able to see inside the classroom.

375
01:18:34,498 --> 01:18:41,001
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just like quick, you know, poking my head in saying hello, introducing myself and doing the walkthroughs in the hallways.

376
01:18:43,163 --> 01:18:43,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

377
01:18:44,406 --> 01:18:46,427
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very excited about the grant.

378
01:18:47,427 --> 01:18:58,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, this morning was reviewing our policies on our website, and our current policy DD does not reference this even though we passed a policy.

379
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Last year that are two years ago.

380
01:19:01,511 --> 01:19:13,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Requiring that we approve grants, because we were concerned about some strings attached to grants in the past, obviously this is not that case, but just kind of a heads up in the future that grants have to be approved here.

381
01:19:14,456 --> 01:19:22,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And obviously you don't have to get approved because it's already done and the money's coming but just in the future like we want to.

382
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:36,016
[SPEAKER_13]: make sure we, you know, the situation in particular was when we got the abstinence only grant from many years ago, which tied the district from teaching our students what they should have been taught.

383
01:19:36,937 --> 01:19:39,940
[SPEAKER_13]: So clearly, this is not that kind of situation.

384
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,824
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just want to make sure there's a heads up that like, if you

385
01:19:43,322 --> 01:19:54,311
[SPEAKER_13]: find more money to apply for grants for which we're obviously very happy to find money that we do need to have a say to make sure we agree that it's not something wacky.

386
01:19:54,451 --> 01:19:59,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't expect Desi to actually be putting out grants that are going to be concerning.

387
01:19:59,615 --> 01:20:03,978
[SPEAKER_13]: This was a grant from some private institution.

388
01:20:04,338 --> 01:20:05,980
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but just a heads up.

389
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's noted on my end.

390
01:20:12,364 --> 01:20:17,829
[SPEAKER_06]: are moving on alright so backpacks is the third one.

391
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:33,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I have had lots of conversations about backpacks the past couple months I have heard a lot i've received a lot of feedback which will definitely be used to inform for the 2024 2025 school year.

392
01:20:36,473 --> 01:20:52,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Backpacks in lieu of what happened last year and some incidences it was very staff felt very strongly about bringing the no policy for backpacks back, it had previously been a policy for many, many years.

393
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:54,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I think after coven it.

394
01:20:55,029 --> 01:20:56,010
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of fizzled.

395
01:20:57,231 --> 01:21:00,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are no backpacks currently at NHS.

396
01:21:00,614 --> 01:21:06,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It is something that we will look at for the following year as to if we will allow backpacks or not.

397
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:11,865
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, there's been a lots of concerns that have come up with students and with caregivers.

398
01:21:12,358 --> 01:21:17,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So MHS has received the feedback regarding the no backpack policy.

399
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:26,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And in response, we're going to strategize with faculty and staff ways to reduce the burden of textbooks, binders, and notebooks, especially with the use of Chromebooks.

400
01:21:27,144 --> 01:21:39,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a professional development coming up where I will use some of that time as to how can we strategize that students are not carrying five binders, water, Chromebook down the hallways.

401
01:21:41,414 --> 01:21:50,539
[SPEAKER_06]: school site council, which we'll talk a little bit more along with the student advisory where we can collect feedback and a more formalized way to inform decision.

402
01:21:51,059 --> 01:21:59,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as well as feedback from students, staff and caregivers about the impact of the policy as well.

403
01:21:59,944 --> 01:22:06,547
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how we're gonna kind of go through this year to be able to inform our decision for the 24-25 school year.

404
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:09,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, just a quick question.

405
01:22:09,709 --> 01:22:09,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

406
01:22:11,397 --> 01:22:17,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I ate by 12 by what I'm confused by a two dimensional already thought of that.

407
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:23,335
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the that was the the dimensions that were put out previously.

408
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:23,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

409
01:22:24,196 --> 01:22:26,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've already been told that the third dimension isn't out there.

410
01:22:28,228 --> 01:22:32,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I will put something out there on the third dimension because they're already now like we can do it so tall.

411
01:22:33,593 --> 01:22:42,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, right, because I mean there's some really cool backpacks that are in fact very tall, and have a very small footprint to get around the airport security but

412
01:22:46,786 --> 01:22:50,348
[SPEAKER_13]: The issue of, you know, we have three minutes between classes, correct?

413
01:22:51,609 --> 01:22:56,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Which must be, is there any school with a smaller number than three minutes?

414
01:22:56,391 --> 01:22:57,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Three minutes is mighty quick.

415
01:22:57,992 --> 01:23:04,496
[SPEAKER_13]: My school was four growing up, a very large school, and four felt utterly impossible.

416
01:23:04,956 --> 01:23:10,859
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, last year we had many students without lockers.

417
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:14,861
[SPEAKER_13]: My own ninth grader at the time didn't have a locker because we had a,

418
01:23:16,883 --> 01:23:19,384
[SPEAKER_13]: environmental issue that closed the section of lockers.

419
01:23:20,644 --> 01:23:26,005
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, she was dragging around everything in her backpack because there were no lockers.

420
01:23:26,025 --> 01:23:31,127
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when she got another locker, it was not anywhere near where her classes were because all those lockers were gone.

421
01:23:31,527 --> 01:23:35,328
[SPEAKER_13]: So I, you know, based on this other stuff about, you know, kiosks for

422
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:50,090
[SPEAKER_13]: passes, like, you know, putting Chromebooks in the house, offices, instead of all centralized, like you're clearly capable of handling all of these, like, minutiae, which make things work or not work, frankly.

423
01:23:51,331 --> 01:24:05,053
[SPEAKER_13]: So I look forward to hearing about how we can find a way at changing the, you know, how much teachers are expecting kids to carry is, frankly, sounds like a harder

424
01:24:05,677 --> 01:24:06,398
[SPEAKER_13]: thing to do.

425
01:24:06,418 --> 01:24:16,458
[SPEAKER_13]: You know I mean teachers who taught for a long time like we have this, this is what we do and this is how it works and asking teachers to really redesign that.

426
01:24:17,634 --> 01:24:19,776
[SPEAKER_13]: in the middle of a school year sounds very hard.

427
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:21,437
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't want to be asked to do that.

428
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:34,646
[SPEAKER_13]: So figuring out, you know, the locations that I, you know, I did not go to Medford High and I've been there enough times over the last few years to know that it's quite large.

429
01:24:35,427 --> 01:24:40,430
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know whether students schedules have them running from one end of the building to the other.

430
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:43,993
[SPEAKER_13]: My reports from my 10th grader is that she in fact

431
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:48,793
[SPEAKER_13]: after lunch is impossible to get to class and locker room.

432
01:24:48,873 --> 01:25:02,242
[SPEAKER_13]: So before lunch has to plan to take everything to lunch that will be used after lunch, because it's not technically possible in her mind to get to her locker and get to class.

433
01:25:03,602 --> 01:25:07,425
[SPEAKER_13]: So working that out, I just hope that we're not being

434
01:25:10,212 --> 01:25:17,836
[SPEAKER_13]: She did say like some teachers don't let you leave everything in their classrooms, which I mean, if I had a classroom, I wouldn't want piles of stuff everywhere either.

435
01:25:18,317 --> 01:25:24,320
[SPEAKER_13]: But this feels like a very big problem with a thousand different scenarios.

436
01:25:26,061 --> 01:25:38,608
[SPEAKER_13]: And if no backpacks is causing all of those scenarios to kind of come out of the woodwork and not work, I think finding some other,

437
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:48,264
[SPEAKER_13]: finding another way around that or something because, you know, kids carrying around and essentially an entire day's worth of books.

438
01:25:48,684 --> 01:25:54,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I was a kid, I carried all of my books and binders for the whole day, all day long.

439
01:25:55,407 --> 01:25:58,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wasn't the bigger kid than I am now.

440
01:25:58,368 --> 01:26:00,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do remember it being ridiculous.

441
01:26:00,529 --> 01:26:03,551
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, my calculus book was, you know, inches thick, my

442
01:26:05,011 --> 01:26:08,472
[SPEAKER_13]: chemistry book, my bio, they were all massive textbooks.

443
01:26:09,672 --> 01:26:17,795
[SPEAKER_13]: And the one thing I haven't really heard is why do we care so much if they have their backpacks?

444
01:26:17,935 --> 01:26:22,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Because at college, you can bring your luggage with you, frankly, to classes.

445
01:26:22,596 --> 01:26:26,557
[SPEAKER_13]: And I remember that from when I first went to college, kids brought luggage.

446
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I just thought it was weird.

447
01:26:29,571 --> 01:26:30,551
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, whatever.

448
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:36,793
[SPEAKER_13]: So what's the sort of concern about them having backpacks?

449
01:26:38,634 --> 01:26:42,876
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it's an uncomfortable thing to just say out loud, I'm happy to do it in an email.

450
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:43,256
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

451
01:26:44,796 --> 01:26:49,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, faculty and staff felt very strongly after

452
01:26:50,336 --> 01:26:53,697
[SPEAKER_06]: the incidences that happened last year to bring back backpacks.

453
01:26:53,737 --> 01:27:18,366
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was something that they wanted to reinstate for this year asked and feel more comfortable with not having them in the classrooms along with the space of passageways for them to be able to go through and help students at their desks.

454
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:22,120
[SPEAKER_13]: You said something just now, if I may.

455
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:30,089
[SPEAKER_13]: The incidents that have risen to this body's concern, I don't recall ever having to do with anything related to backpacks.

456
01:27:30,349 --> 01:27:34,754
[SPEAKER_13]: So there may have been lots of other incidences that we don't hear about.

457
01:27:34,774 --> 01:27:38,358
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess I need clarification how backpacks are involved.

458
01:27:39,079 --> 01:28:03,031
[SPEAKER_13]: the incidents we've heard about are frankly cell phone video cameras and you know and tiktok challenges and stupid things like that that frankly a backpack isn't relevant because that fits in the palm of your hand so what are the kinds of things where backpacks are a concern that are incidents that we're not hearing about for safety things that can be carried in them um i don't know you mean the concern the students are walking around with guns

459
01:28:05,174 --> 01:28:17,844
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

460
01:28:30,063 --> 01:28:44,711
[SPEAKER_06]: by several staff that they feel more comfortable with backpacks not being in the classroom and to re-estating the previous backpack policy that had been in place previous to COVID, as well as the space constraints in the classroom.

461
01:28:45,072 --> 01:28:53,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it's something that I want to very much look at this year to make an informed decision for the 24-25 school year.

462
01:28:53,556 --> 01:28:57,959
[SPEAKER_06]: It is definitely at the forefront of that list of things.

463
01:28:58,612 --> 01:28:58,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

464
01:28:59,453 --> 01:29:13,541
[SPEAKER_13]: I would really love to hear more details maybe from staff about what are these incidences and concerns, but looking at our students as being potential dangers concerns me that staff would look at students as if they are a danger to them.

465
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:18,484
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sets up a relationship that is not healthy.

466
01:29:19,631 --> 01:29:34,241
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not saying that there aren't staff that see students that way and I'm not saying that no student has ever not been a danger that would be ridiculous to suggest, but if that's the kind of the mentality and culture like that's concerning.

467
01:29:35,001 --> 01:29:39,864
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, last year we heard an awful lot about we need metal detectors and, you know,

468
01:29:41,311 --> 01:29:49,637
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't say that if you think your students are all sitting around, you know, at a Boy Scout thing chanting, you know, telling ghost stories.

469
01:29:49,677 --> 01:29:52,599
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not the environment where you think you need metal detectors.

470
01:29:52,659 --> 01:30:05,249
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, this feels like a very concerning thing, because I've never heard yet a real reason why we don't want kids to have backpacks, when in every setting I can imagine, you carry what you need to carry.

471
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:14,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not about you, because you just started, but it just seems a bit draconian to mandate something like that.

472
01:30:14,997 --> 01:30:15,777
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

473
01:30:17,738 --> 01:30:18,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

474
01:30:18,138 --> 01:30:22,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, and then we're going to move on to the student voice opportunities at MHS.

475
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:22,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

476
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:23,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

477
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at

478
01:30:25,799 --> 01:30:43,554
[SPEAKER_02]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, she-her, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-

479
01:30:46,122 --> 01:30:50,323
[SPEAKER_02]: how we integrate the vocational and the high school schedule.

480
01:30:51,643 --> 01:31:00,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And my hope is that when we talk about like having only three minutes to pass, like I don't have any issue with there being no backpacks allowed to be like running around the hallways.

481
01:31:00,925 --> 01:31:06,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally fine with that, but then it has to be viable that kids can move around the building.

482
01:31:07,706 --> 01:31:13,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my daughter can't even get to class on time and she's not going to her locker because three minutes isn't,

483
01:31:13,749 --> 01:31:29,438
[SPEAKER_02]: feasibly enough for her to go from point A to point B. And I know that the other thing we're going to bump into, like we can't just arbitrarily give them more time to pass because we are dangerously short, maybe too short on instructional minutes to begin with.

484
01:31:30,202 --> 01:31:40,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that the scheduling consultant that you all are working with is going to look at the schedule for all of the problems that it provides us and presents us with.

485
01:31:40,864 --> 01:31:44,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should be able to go to your locker at some reasonable interval.

486
01:31:44,965 --> 01:31:52,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think you should never need to carry a three ring binder because I'd never want to hold one of those in my hands as long as I live, because they're huge and it's 2023.

487
01:31:52,727 --> 01:31:55,027
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there is some challenge around

488
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:06,497
[SPEAKER_02]: the practices that we're enforcing that drive the need for a backpack.

489
01:32:06,697 --> 01:32:12,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the reality of the schedule just not being sufficient, even in the perfect case scenario.

490
01:32:12,859 --> 01:32:15,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's a lot of things to like unravel.

491
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't think it's like, I think backpacks are the thing that are sort of flaring.

492
01:32:19,602 --> 01:32:24,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, I don't think backpacks are necessarily the problem.

493
01:32:24,864 --> 01:32:25,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think we have maybe

494
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:32,918
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of problems and backpacks sort of get lumped as like the thing that is happening that's really problematic.

495
01:32:32,998 --> 01:32:37,759
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am glad that people are thinking about what all the problems are.

496
01:32:37,939 --> 01:32:53,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that you're taking the feedback and you're listening to people and really and challenging everybody to really rethink the things that they say, because I heard that loud and clear like from you in multiple different settings.

497
01:32:54,083 --> 01:32:56,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm super appreciative of that because

498
01:32:56,567 --> 01:32:58,268
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't create any of these problems.

499
01:32:58,308 --> 01:33:02,010
[SPEAKER_02]: These problems all like were on your desk on the day you walked in.

500
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:09,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a real travesty for all of us that we allowed this to happen for as many years as we did.

501
01:33:10,273 --> 01:33:19,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for actually solving problems and doing so in a way that restores some order to the building, because I think that's super important.

502
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:28,778
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully when we talk about scheduling, we can be talking about all the things that are scheduling related, so we can move on from backpacks.

503
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:30,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

504
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Graham.

505
01:33:31,701 --> 01:33:32,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Edward-Vinson.

506
01:33:32,802 --> 01:33:41,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and I just wanted to just make a comment in regards or in support of not using the backpacks.

507
01:33:41,891 --> 01:33:43,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think about the backpacks in terms of

508
01:33:46,325 --> 01:34:04,291
[SPEAKER_08]: bringing weapons to school per se, but we do have some students that are very entrepreneurial, and they may have ideas about bringing maybe certain liquids to school, or, you know, using entrepreneurial skills.

509
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:23,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes they bring things to school and they bring them in their backpack so it may not necessarily be a weapon but they may want to bring certain beverages, or we were dealing with a little bit of vaping and at one point in time, I know that the assistant principals

510
01:34:24,714 --> 01:34:29,880
[SPEAKER_08]: and staff were confiscating a lot of vapes that should not be at schools.

511
01:34:30,421 --> 01:34:42,354
[SPEAKER_08]: So by them not having a big backpack that might have inventory, the teachers can really closely supervise and monitor and ensure that the students have

512
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,542
[SPEAKER_08]: their books or whatever is needed.

513
01:34:45,742 --> 01:34:54,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think it kind of creates an honor system, in case they were tempted, and no one has to worry about that.

514
01:34:55,331 --> 01:35:03,759
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I just wanted to present that as a possibility I know we have wonderful Mustangs but we do have a few that try to test limits.

515
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:16,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was thinking more of that in terms of if the backpacks are secure in their lockers, and they travel to class, we don't have to worry about that.

516
01:35:16,453 --> 01:35:24,121
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one less thing or something fewer to worry about than with a large backpack.

517
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:25,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

518
01:35:26,146 --> 01:35:27,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

519
01:35:27,407 --> 01:35:27,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

520
01:35:28,447 --> 01:35:30,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So student voice opportunities at MHS.

521
01:35:30,928 --> 01:35:34,830
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a short list of opportunities that we'll currently offer.

522
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:44,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I think coming off of my role as house principal at Malden High School, I'm missing the constant one-on-one with students.

523
01:35:45,014 --> 01:35:50,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to do as many opportunities for students to get involved and for student voice to be heard.

524
01:35:52,113 --> 01:36:17,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that being said, there's a list here of different opportunities that we've compiled, student advisory committee, school site council, which will involve parents, sorry, caregivers, teachers, as well as students, school committee representatives, which we would like to have a few of them to be able to rotate through the meetings, lunch with the principal where I will, you know,

525
01:36:17,853 --> 01:36:29,959
[SPEAKER_06]: or have lunch provided to them to attract them to come and want to meet with me and hear what's going really well at MHS and what are some feedback and suggestions that they have for the administration.

526
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:34,722
[SPEAKER_06]: One opportunity for after school, individual meetings with principals.

527
01:36:34,882 --> 01:36:36,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I have had, I want to say in the past,

528
01:36:38,432 --> 01:36:51,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week, I had five students that emailed me and that set up one-on-one meetings with me to sit down and to share some things like the backpack policy or the attendance policy, which is great.

529
01:36:51,199 --> 01:37:02,605
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're making sure that we log all of that so that we do have those conversations noted that we can refer back to when we're making decisions for the next year.

530
01:37:04,397 --> 01:37:06,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Extended advisory and advisory activities.

531
01:37:06,839 --> 01:37:28,495
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to really look at what advisories are like, what we're using the time for, and make sure that we're having student voice within this allotted amount of time that can be really used to hear students, hear staff as well, of how we can make MHS a great place to be.

532
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:38,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Along with surveys, surveys aren't the best way or the way that students like to share, but it's a way to collect quick and easy data from students.

533
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:46,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if we make it shorter and to the point, we can get some really good feedback to be able to inform decisions as well.

534
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:55,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I am always open for students to bring forth ideas of how they can get involved in order to hear their voice.

535
01:37:55,466 --> 01:38:00,670
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just an immediate list that will be sent out actually to students.

536
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:05,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's either being sent out by our AP either tonight or tomorrow morning.

537
01:38:05,633 --> 01:38:14,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll actually have this in their inboxes to be able to submit a form where then we can have conversations with them and select them for different

538
01:38:14,847 --> 01:38:16,510
[SPEAKER_06]: committees, and so forth.

539
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:22,301
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the work I'm really excited about, and really excited to get it started.

540
01:38:22,321 --> 01:38:26,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Dr. Edouard-Vincent and then member McLaughlin.

541
01:38:29,104 --> 01:38:38,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Miss Cabral, I just wanted to also say in terms of surveys I want to thank Miss Hayes member member Hays for communicating with me.

542
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:46,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year we completed this high school culture and climate survey, and at our very next meeting on that data.

543
01:38:47,896 --> 01:39:03,801
[SPEAKER_08]: was partially presented in the late spring and we want to be able to do a thorough presentation of what that data says, so we can have the data from the culture and climate survey that took place in the spring, and look at all of the changes and use it to continue to inform

544
01:39:04,697 --> 01:39:06,238
[SPEAKER_08]: the important changes that are happening.

545
01:39:06,258 --> 01:39:11,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to thank member Hays, who has been working with me patiently.

546
01:39:12,383 --> 01:39:13,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member Hays.

547
01:39:13,524 --> 01:39:20,849
[SPEAKER_08]: And at our next meeting on October 2nd, we will have a comprehensive presentation of that survey data.

548
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:21,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

549
01:39:22,671 --> 01:39:23,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

550
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:24,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

551
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:25,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

552
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:29,135
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really excited about the student outreach and engagement as well.

553
01:39:29,636 --> 01:39:33,959
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want to ask again for the data collection, but also in terms of the outreach and

554
01:39:34,488 --> 01:39:45,711
[SPEAKER_16]: other things that the team be proactive on really looking at the diversity of those groups and the representation of those groups, that translation and interpretation are provided.

555
01:39:45,851 --> 01:39:52,713
[SPEAKER_16]: So I love the idea of, you know, hanging out with the principal and, you know, we have our multilingual language line for third party conversations as well.

556
01:39:53,113 --> 01:40:01,716
[SPEAKER_16]: That can be super helpful, but working with the DELAC and the CPAC on those, on those things as well, so that we're really thinking about how we're diversifying.

557
01:40:02,256 --> 01:40:02,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

558
01:40:02,916 --> 01:40:03,256
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

559
01:40:05,828 --> 01:40:06,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

560
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:08,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Graham.

561
01:40:09,289 --> 01:40:10,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just ask one more question.

562
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:26,574
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we talked about when we pass this resolution was trying to get a feel from you all about the kind of data that you're going to be using to make sure that everything is working the way you're intending and you talked about that already tonight but I think the other variable that we talked about was.

563
01:40:27,867 --> 01:40:31,348
[SPEAKER_02]: when does it make sense for you to come and give us an update again?

564
01:40:31,368 --> 01:40:43,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want us to prescribe that necessarily, but more curious from your perspective about like, when even is there enough data for us to talk about a second time?

565
01:40:43,891 --> 01:40:44,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

566
01:40:45,132 --> 01:40:57,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say at least after quarter one to be able to collect enough data, if not in January when the semester turns, when it turns to semester two.

567
01:40:57,745 --> 01:40:58,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say.

568
01:40:59,025 --> 01:40:59,565
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds great.

569
01:40:59,605 --> 01:40:59,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

570
01:41:01,126 --> 01:41:08,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank you from the chair for not only your initiatives and trying to get some order at the high school.

571
01:41:08,487 --> 01:41:10,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Our kids appreciate it.

572
01:41:10,188 --> 01:41:12,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Our parents and teachers, I'm sure, appreciate it too.

573
01:41:12,788 --> 01:41:14,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We wish you the best of luck.

574
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:16,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And these policies are amazing.

575
01:41:16,229 --> 01:41:17,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And please lean on us for any support.

576
01:41:18,069 --> 01:41:19,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your support already.

577
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:20,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

578
01:41:23,571 --> 01:41:25,571
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our third report.

579
01:41:26,067 --> 01:41:31,653
[SPEAKER_05]: on the 2022-2023 DESE Comprehensive Review of Medford Public Schools, Ms.

580
01:41:31,673 --> 01:41:39,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Suzanne Galussi, Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction, and Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Operations, Enrichment, and Innovation.

581
01:41:39,801 --> 01:41:42,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have Ms.

582
01:41:42,364 --> 01:41:46,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Joan Bowen, Director of Student Services, and Mr. Paul Texera, Director of EL.

583
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:48,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.

584
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:51,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, before we start.

585
01:41:52,147 --> 01:41:54,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

586
01:41:54,809 --> 01:42:05,216
[SPEAKER_13]: We've asked this a number of times, and when the district gets long reports that we are going to have presented to us, could we please send them to the committee when you get them?

587
01:42:06,697 --> 01:42:12,741
[SPEAKER_13]: This is 83 pages, and I don't know if everybody else spent their whole weekend reading it, but I didn't.

588
01:42:13,382 --> 01:42:18,265
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would like the chance to really read it thoroughly and have good questions.

589
01:42:20,046 --> 01:42:22,307
[SPEAKER_13]: before you all do your work.

590
01:42:22,367 --> 01:42:25,767
[SPEAKER_13]: You all didn't get it on Friday to prepare for this meeting.

591
01:42:26,968 --> 01:42:32,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just, I feel like we get these long reports and 83 pages is probably on the shorter side.

592
01:42:33,209 --> 01:42:39,571
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's no harm in us getting it the moment you get it in your inbox from AIR.

593
01:42:39,751 --> 01:42:42,511
[SPEAKER_13]: So can we try to remember to do that in the future?

594
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:45,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's really a challenge for us to come.

595
01:42:46,252 --> 01:42:48,933
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to speak for everybody, but it's a challenge for me to come

596
01:42:49,454 --> 01:42:53,617
[SPEAKER_13]: and be fully prepared for a very dense report that's huge.

597
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:58,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was one of those kids that could barely read for a long time.

598
01:42:58,721 --> 01:43:00,263
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a very slow reader.

599
01:43:00,283 --> 01:43:05,587
[SPEAKER_13]: I cannot have gotten through this this weekend if my life was on the line.

600
01:43:05,707 --> 01:43:07,068
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

601
01:43:08,109 --> 01:43:11,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I care so much about what's in this report, but I didn't read it.

602
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:15,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Ruseau.

603
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:18,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

604
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:20,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much for having us here today.

605
01:43:20,771 --> 01:43:28,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Teixeira is joining us remotely, so he will be able to speak through the Zoom functionality.

606
01:43:29,252 --> 01:43:36,994
[SPEAKER_10]: So as I presented back, I believe it was in maybe December or January, the district was selected.

607
01:43:37,054 --> 01:43:44,115
[SPEAKER_10]: We were notified in September of last year that we were selected to take part in a comprehensive district review

608
01:43:44,707 --> 01:43:53,854
[SPEAKER_10]: The comprehensive district reviews process changed about five years ago with DESE contracting out with AIR, the American Institute of Research.

609
01:43:54,315 --> 01:44:01,320
[SPEAKER_10]: The American Institute of Research does comprehensive work in school districts and across the country, also at the state level.

610
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:13,870
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that they do among many with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is to contract out this work so that in a way DESE establishes

611
01:44:14,397 --> 01:44:19,840
[SPEAKER_10]: their protocols, what they're looking for, but the American Institute of Research conducts the entire process.

612
01:44:21,121 --> 01:44:32,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Throughout the process, the selection, so every year, 75% of the schools who are selected, the districts who are selected are underperforming districts in one way or another.

613
01:44:33,128 --> 01:44:40,973
[SPEAKER_10]: So those districts and schools generally are reviewed more frequently, whereas the last time that we were reviewed was 2014 under a previous

614
01:44:43,692 --> 01:44:47,095
[SPEAKER_10]: set of expectations and processes.

615
01:44:47,455 --> 01:44:53,740
[SPEAKER_10]: 25% are performing within the accordance with DESE standards, and we're part of that cohort.

616
01:44:55,221 --> 01:44:59,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, these are the broad areas that were shown to you.

617
01:45:00,765 --> 01:45:10,652
[SPEAKER_10]: There's first governance and administrative systems, which looks at leadership and governance, human resources and professional development, and financial and asset management.

618
01:45:11,153 --> 01:45:12,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the focus of tonight's

619
01:45:13,424 --> 01:45:18,807
[SPEAKER_10]: presentation is really on those student-centered systems that are really gonna help our student population.

620
01:45:19,247 --> 01:45:24,270
[SPEAKER_10]: So focusing on curriculum instruction, assessment, and student support.

621
01:45:25,711 --> 01:45:30,253
[SPEAKER_10]: At this time, I will now turn it over to the other members of our team to carry us forward.

622
01:45:30,493 --> 01:45:30,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

623
01:45:31,634 --> 01:45:32,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

624
01:45:34,055 --> 01:45:39,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Dr. Cushing mentioned, tonight we are going to present to you on student-centered systems.

625
01:45:40,278 --> 01:45:41,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going,

626
01:45:41,989 --> 01:45:42,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

627
01:45:42,149 --> 01:45:46,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowen and I are going to discuss curriculum and instruction, assessment, and student services.

628
01:45:48,492 --> 01:46:04,718
[SPEAKER_03]: For curriculum instruction, the three aspects that AIR looked at was our curriculum selection and use, classroom instruction, in which they did conduct several observations, and student access to coursework.

629
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:11,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the report,

630
01:46:11,363 --> 01:46:12,564
[SPEAKER_03]: They provide some narrative.

631
01:46:13,064 --> 01:46:15,245
[SPEAKER_03]: They also give the strengths of the district.

632
01:46:15,425 --> 01:46:21,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they give us recommendations for what they would like to see our work moving forward.

633
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:34,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So strengths in the area of curriculum and instruction for Medford Public Schools was that our district has a strong capacity to support instructional alignment across all schools through K to 12 curriculum directors.

634
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:42,222
[SPEAKER_03]: that teachers participate in curriculum selection processes and provide regular feedback throughout implementation.

635
01:46:42,902 --> 01:46:55,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you know, as evidenced by the elementary process, we do have a lot of stakeholder input throughout the entire process, and that is K to 12, and so that was recognized.

636
01:46:56,485 --> 01:47:03,807
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a clear alignment between the curriculum selection process and the district strategic plan, including an emphasis on

637
01:47:04,454 --> 01:47:06,115
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity, equity, and inclusion.

638
01:47:08,035 --> 01:47:22,380
[SPEAKER_03]: The instructional academic team, which is the IAT team, which is at the high school, that was a commendation that the structure brings together the school staff with the curriculum directors.

639
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:32,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And that the district has increased consistency of access to rigorous grade level curriculum and instruction at the elementary level.

640
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:44,297
[SPEAKER_03]: We are, I will cover the recommendations in a moment, which we will discuss kind of our path forward with all of the recommendations at the end of the slide deck.

641
01:47:44,898 --> 01:47:59,647
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think it's important to note that in terms of curriculum instruction and curriculum selection, the making sure that students have access to high quality materials, high quality instruction,

642
01:48:01,545 --> 01:48:09,450
[SPEAKER_03]: is very evident at the elementary level and it's something that we will look towards at the high school level because of the vetting process.

643
01:48:10,091 --> 01:48:26,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So the recommendations that within the area of curriculum instruction that the Department of Education suggests we look at is that the district should examine its support for English learners and students with disabilities across the district and ensure services are provided equitably to all learners.

644
01:48:28,138 --> 01:48:39,643
[SPEAKER_03]: and that the district should review the efficacy of its policy changes around improving access to advanced coursework, and based on the results of this review, make further adjustments to address gaps in access.

645
01:48:41,643 --> 01:48:50,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those are very loaded, but we're going to cover both of them at the end of the slide deck, along with some narrative components.

646
01:48:50,227 --> 01:48:53,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to make it seem like we're glossing over any of the recommendations.

647
01:48:57,583 --> 01:48:59,344
[SPEAKER_03]: The next is assessment.

648
01:49:00,045 --> 01:49:11,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they came out in terms of assessing us on our assessment within the district, they looked at data and assessment systems that are currently utilized within Medford Public Schools.

649
01:49:11,994 --> 01:49:16,878
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at how we're using that data, and then they looked at how we're sharing the results.

650
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:26,405
[SPEAKER_03]: So strengths for Medford Public Schools are that we have a strong capacity to support instructional alignment

651
01:49:26,877 --> 01:49:32,480
[SPEAKER_03]: across K to 12 with the positions of the curriculum directors.

652
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:39,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Teachers participate in curricular selection processes and provide regular feedback throughout the implementation.

653
01:49:40,563 --> 01:49:45,686
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a clear alignment between the curriculum selection process and the district's strategic plan.

654
01:49:48,347 --> 01:49:52,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And that the district has increased consistency of access to rigorous grade level.

655
01:49:53,209 --> 01:49:53,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, excuse me.

656
01:49:53,709 --> 01:49:54,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

657
01:49:57,455 --> 01:49:58,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Content, hold on.

658
01:50:00,076 --> 01:50:02,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me, hold on one second.

659
01:50:02,297 --> 01:50:04,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just double check that that's accurate.

660
01:50:07,419 --> 01:50:07,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

661
01:50:08,859 --> 01:50:12,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So my apologies, I will correct that, that's not accurate.

662
01:50:14,602 --> 01:50:25,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Strengths for us in terms of assessment are that the district collects multiple sources of data to provide a comprehensive picture of student, school, and district performance.

663
01:50:26,684 --> 01:50:32,266
[SPEAKER_03]: and that our formative assessment practices align across grade and subject areas.

664
01:50:35,027 --> 01:50:52,254
[SPEAKER_03]: The recommendations are the same, which is that we need to incorporate all student service providers, such as ESL specialists and interventionists in data team meetings, so that all staff working with a student can reflect on student data and align on strategy.

665
01:50:53,615 --> 01:51:01,621
[SPEAKER_03]: and that the district should set norms and clear expectations for schools around the frequency and quality of communications to families and student progress.

666
01:51:02,341 --> 01:51:18,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely one of the threads in this report for both buckets, but especially the student centered buckets was on consistency so that some districts are doing a great job, excuse me, some schools are doing a better job of communicating

667
01:51:18,789 --> 01:51:25,912
[SPEAKER_03]: than others, and so a lot of the feedback was around making sure that there is alignment district-wide around communication.

668
01:51:27,072 --> 01:51:31,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I do apologize for not having the accurate piece in this.

669
01:51:32,074 --> 01:51:35,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna fix that right now as Ms.

670
01:51:35,175 --> 01:51:39,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowen speaks about the students' systems and re-share the slide deck.

671
01:51:43,444 --> 01:51:47,366
[SPEAKER_14]: So the next section that was reviewed was the student support overview.

672
01:51:47,686 --> 01:51:57,892
[SPEAKER_14]: And this included our safe and supportive school climate and culture, tiered systems of support, family, student and community engagement and partnerships.

673
01:51:59,332 --> 01:52:09,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the strengths that the AIR report found for the district was the district strategic plan prioritizes safe and supportive learning environments.

674
01:52:10,643 --> 01:52:16,166
[SPEAKER_14]: The district adopted responsive classroom and nexus programming across all elementary schools.

675
01:52:17,127 --> 01:52:23,091
[SPEAKER_14]: The district has developed a district-wide vision for student support structures, including SSTs.

676
01:52:23,991 --> 01:52:32,476
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last strength was the district increased capacity to support two-way communication in families' home languages through talking points.

677
01:52:33,337 --> 01:52:38,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the recommendations in this same specific area was that the district should diagnose

678
01:52:38,993 --> 01:52:48,655
[SPEAKER_14]: and address issues around DEI and school climate and ensure that all students, no matter their background or home language, feel welcome in Medford Public Schools.

679
01:52:49,676 --> 01:53:00,038
[SPEAKER_14]: The district should identify inconsistencies around the SST procedures and make structural adjustments to ensure fidelity with the district vision.

680
01:53:01,038 --> 01:53:07,360
[SPEAKER_14]: And the district should consider hiring a communications director or other district level support to assist the district

681
01:53:07,768 --> 01:53:11,671
[SPEAKER_14]: in schools and creating quality, timely communication to families.

682
01:53:13,653 --> 01:53:14,414
[SPEAKER_14]: The next steps.

683
01:53:15,174 --> 01:53:21,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So the plan of Medford Public Schools to address these recommendations of the comprehensive report will be a multi-year approach.

684
01:53:24,963 --> 01:53:27,765
[SPEAKER_16]: We took a look at all of- Can I just do a point of information, sorry.

685
01:53:28,005 --> 01:53:30,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you just, for any acronyms, can you say them first?

686
01:53:31,248 --> 01:53:32,109
[SPEAKER_16]: So SSTs?

687
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:34,131
[SPEAKER_14]: The Student Support Teams.

688
01:53:35,987 --> 01:53:37,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, my apologies.

689
01:53:37,968 --> 01:53:51,952
[SPEAKER_14]: So the review and audit, when looking at the recommendations of the report, in regards to special education, we will be evaluating our special education programming and services across all levels of the district.

690
01:53:52,512 --> 01:53:58,454
[SPEAKER_14]: We will review schedules and caseloads of teachers in each respective building.

691
01:53:59,135 --> 01:54:02,856
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll identify any additional specialized supports that may be needed.

692
01:54:03,735 --> 01:54:08,619
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're also in the process of going through the tiered focus monitoring review this year with DESE.

693
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:17,226
[SPEAKER_14]: And that will take a look at our specialized programming services, and they'll take a look at it this school year.

694
01:54:17,266 --> 01:54:22,990
[SPEAKER_14]: They're actually coming in January, the end of January to conduct that review.

695
01:54:23,531 --> 01:54:32,418
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they will give us feedback on where our strengths are, where we continue to need work, and also in regards to compliance.

696
01:54:34,622 --> 01:54:37,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want me to do EL, or is Mr. Tisher?

697
01:54:38,083 --> 01:54:40,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

698
01:54:40,704 --> 01:54:41,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?

699
01:54:42,685 --> 01:54:42,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

700
01:54:44,705 --> 01:54:57,710
[SPEAKER_11]: So as part of DESE's coordinated program review, which is happening at the same time with special education, they will do a complete review of the EL programs and services in this school year.

701
01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:03,572
[SPEAKER_11]: The recommendation that was posted in the AIR report

702
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:09,944
[SPEAKER_11]: was about the fact that we have two middle schools right next to each other and only one has an EL program.

703
01:55:11,426 --> 01:55:16,310
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanna point out that that's equal services, it's not equity.

704
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:29,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite sure how it was interpreted that it wasn't equitable because if equity is giving every student what they need, the EL students at the McGlynn are getting what they need in terms of services.

705
01:55:31,135 --> 01:55:43,884
[SPEAKER_11]: That model and program was reviewed by DESE when we made the changes four years ago, and it was heralded as could be a model for the rest of the state.

706
01:55:44,245 --> 01:55:49,788
[SPEAKER_11]: But they'll re-examine it this year as part of the coordinated program review.

707
01:55:50,649 --> 01:55:54,912
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll continue to do professional development for teachers with SEI strategies.

708
01:55:55,893 --> 01:55:59,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Every year we offer a 15 PDP course.

709
01:55:59,525 --> 01:56:04,067
[SPEAKER_11]: so teachers can recertify for their licensure renewal.

710
01:56:04,407 --> 01:56:07,668
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to get 15 PDPs in special education and SEI.

711
01:56:07,748 --> 01:56:11,129
[SPEAKER_11]: And every year we've offered a 15 hour course in SEI.

712
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:14,671
[SPEAKER_16]: And then- Sorry, Mr. Chair, same point of information, SEI.

713
01:56:14,751 --> 01:56:16,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Community, please.

714
01:56:16,911 --> 01:56:19,432
[SPEAKER_11]: SEI is sheltered English instruction.

715
01:56:21,613 --> 01:56:28,916
[SPEAKER_11]: So anything, any classroom that has an English learner student in it is considered an SEI classroom, sheltered English instruction.

716
01:56:29,962 --> 01:56:37,188
[SPEAKER_11]: all teachers are responsible for meeting the needs of the English learners in their classroom, regardless of the grade level or the content.

717
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:55,181
[SPEAKER_11]: And then last, we wanna conduct a review to determine if creating a lower and upper middle school, lower middle school being grades five, six, and upper middle school, seven, eight, that will address the capacity issues that the teachers brought up in the,

718
01:56:56,351 --> 01:57:01,535
[SPEAKER_11]: in the report that said about the equity, you know, having the program only in one middle school, but not the other.

719
01:57:01,555 --> 01:57:16,768
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did run some numbers if anyone's interested, but our numbers have remained consistent at the McGlynn Middle School for EL students in both newcomer classrooms and ESL services per pullout.

720
01:57:21,192 --> 01:57:21,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

721
01:57:23,874 --> 01:57:24,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Page 14.

722
01:57:31,072 --> 01:57:38,538
[SPEAKER_14]: In continuing with the reviews and the audits, we wanted to take a look at the recommendations for the student support teams, the SST.

723
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:45,324
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a monitoring system that we implemented last year and will continue to implement this year.

724
01:57:45,924 --> 01:57:52,690
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also look at new leadership has provided an additional opportunity to calibrate the training across all levels.

725
01:57:53,817 --> 01:58:05,967
[SPEAKER_14]: In regards to the multi-tiered systems of support, we have supports in the areas of academics, behaviors, social-emotional, and connection to community supports as needed.

726
01:58:06,327 --> 01:58:13,553
[SPEAKER_14]: That could be Elliott Services, any agencies that we contract with or that help support students within the district.

727
01:58:14,934 --> 01:58:17,016
[SPEAKER_14]: In regards to advanced coursework,

728
01:58:17,994 --> 01:58:26,278
[SPEAKER_14]: During the 22-23 school year at Medford High School, 197 students were enrolled in advanced coursework.

729
01:58:27,058 --> 01:58:29,219
[SPEAKER_14]: There were 383 enrollments.

730
01:58:29,339 --> 01:58:37,302
[SPEAKER_14]: That means some students took several AP courses and that there were 19 advanced placement courses that were offered.

731
01:58:38,983 --> 01:58:43,385
[SPEAKER_14]: We continue to review the advanced placement process offerings and sections.

732
01:58:45,313 --> 01:58:57,163
[SPEAKER_14]: and also with the scheduling consultation this year to create an improved high school schedule, looking at dual enrollment with Bunker Hill Community College, as well as online world language offerings.

733
01:58:59,224 --> 01:59:06,610
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we advance to the next slide, I'm just gonna add like a... Oh, press it one more time.

734
01:59:07,111 --> 01:59:07,511
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

735
01:59:07,531 --> 01:59:08,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.

736
01:59:09,152 --> 01:59:11,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we advance to the next slide, I just wanted to add that

737
01:59:13,118 --> 01:59:36,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the feedback we received about the opportunities for advanced coursework, I think were centered around the vocational schedule, which is just to highlight, which is why this year, as you know, and it's already been stated, we're having the scheduling consultant come to finally create a schedule for Medford High School that is going to bridge both parts of the school into one aligned schedule.

738
01:59:37,127 --> 01:59:38,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now there's just a lot of

739
01:59:39,566 --> 01:59:57,973
[SPEAKER_03]: one-to-one handling of student schedules to ensure that just because they're enrolled in vocational programming, that they still have an opportunity to take a world language, which we've explained to this body in how we've created the online opportunities for them, which is not AP, but it's also honors.

740
01:59:58,773 --> 02:00:08,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dual enrollment with Bunker Hill has created some opportunities for vocational students to take AP courses in the summer or on their own time.

741
02:00:09,113 --> 02:00:10,214
[SPEAKER_03]: to maintain both.

742
02:00:12,095 --> 02:00:13,675
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we're gonna continue to review.

743
02:00:14,976 --> 02:00:15,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

744
02:00:15,856 --> 02:00:22,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so further updates for recommendations include the ILTs district-wide.

745
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:28,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a reference in there as the IAT being a strength at Medford High School.

746
02:00:31,124 --> 02:00:32,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, the instructional academic team.

747
02:00:33,465 --> 02:00:38,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to just highlight the difference between the instructional academic team and the instructional leadership team.

748
02:00:39,349 --> 02:00:43,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So the instructional academic team, which they called a strength, just included administrators.

749
02:00:44,913 --> 02:00:53,018
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a meeting with the principal, assistant principals, and curriculum directors, or department directors.

750
02:00:53,799 --> 02:01:07,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And the instructional leadership team, which all schools, K through 12 this year, are creating instructional leadership teams, which will also include teachers on the team.

751
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:18,465
[SPEAKER_03]: so that we're having conversations around the data, the instruction, and how we're adjusting our instruction based on the data that we're receiving.

752
02:01:19,406 --> 02:01:27,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Both data that is given to us in the form of assessments, in the form of observations, in the form of conversations.

753
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:35,114
[SPEAKER_03]: But aligning our instruction based on data is something that is going to be expanding this year.

754
02:01:35,194 --> 02:01:37,315
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just going to be at the high school level,

755
02:01:37,674 --> 02:01:40,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also going to be at the middle schools and the elementaries.

756
02:01:43,559 --> 02:01:47,582
[SPEAKER_03]: The communication for families is always something.

757
02:01:47,923 --> 02:02:01,114
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a suggestion, part of the recommendations in there was actually the hiring of Thomas Dalton, our communications director, which we have done and we're so happy.

758
02:02:02,859 --> 02:02:23,223
[SPEAKER_03]: He has already been working with all school leaders and curriculum protocols have already, excuse me, communication protocols have already been created from Thomas with the school leaders so that everyone is on the same page around consistent and regular communication cycles.

759
02:02:24,403 --> 02:02:29,124
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that will be happening, as well as how often we're updating the website.

760
02:02:30,619 --> 02:02:35,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Medford Public Schools has done a good job.

761
02:02:35,522 --> 02:02:44,366
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been inconsistent for sure, but a good job communicating with families around MCAS and NWEA assessment data.

762
02:02:46,427 --> 02:02:53,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are continuing to improve and Thomas is helping us do that.

763
02:02:53,611 --> 02:02:55,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Diversity, equity and inclusion.

764
02:02:56,012 --> 02:02:59,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the year that there's Medford Public Schools strategic plan.

765
02:03:00,975 --> 02:03:01,895
[SPEAKER_03]: will run its course.

766
02:03:02,156 --> 02:03:10,258
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of our work this year is that we're going to have to be updating the strategic plan because it only runs through this school year.

767
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:13,039
[SPEAKER_03]: That work will be coming.

768
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:17,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, we embedded a lot of professional development.

769
02:03:17,761 --> 02:03:27,324
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard from teachers, the superintendent has been very clear about how she wants to see professional development around the EIB.

770
02:03:29,122 --> 02:03:43,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And so last year, through the use of teacher surveys, a lot of teachers expressed that they wanted the professional development to be more school-based and not just district-wide.

771
02:03:43,766 --> 02:03:48,907
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to have meaningful conversations with their working colleagues at their schools.

772
02:03:49,427 --> 02:03:52,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of what we did last year was embedded PD series.

773
02:03:53,448 --> 02:03:56,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So we as the central team and with

774
02:03:56,550 --> 02:04:08,432
[SPEAKER_03]: the curriculum directors, we created content for the principals to give with their staff, and they were able to have more meaningful engagement around this topic.

775
02:04:09,092 --> 02:04:12,053
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to continue through this school year.

776
02:04:12,073 --> 02:04:21,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And also too, we've had a very strong and close partnership with Frances Nwaje, who's the director here of DEI.

777
02:04:24,326 --> 02:04:26,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if she has more to her title now.

778
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:28,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

779
02:04:28,990 --> 02:04:31,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Just diversity, equity, inclusion director.

780
02:04:31,192 --> 02:04:32,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

781
02:04:32,172 --> 02:04:32,973
[SPEAKER_05]: For the city of Method.

782
02:04:33,073 --> 02:04:33,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

783
02:04:33,313 --> 02:04:35,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But she supports the schools on a few levels.

784
02:04:35,275 --> 02:04:36,216
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot, yes.

785
02:04:36,656 --> 02:04:38,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We have appreciated her partnership.

786
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:51,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one of the things that we're going to talk about on the next slide, but I just wanna bring up here is that we had the wonderful opportunity this past summer

787
02:04:51,840 --> 02:05:07,948
[SPEAKER_03]: The Department of Education hosted its first Instructional Leadership Institute, and it was held at Tufts University, and we were able to bring a team to this institute with, I don't know, 20, 30, 35 other districts, and a lot of the work was around

788
02:05:13,829 --> 02:05:16,290
[SPEAKER_03]: equity centered educational opportunities for students.

789
02:05:16,991 --> 02:05:38,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a long inch around ensuring that we're creating environments, learning environments for students that have high expectations, grade level content, high quality materials, and that we're creating a sense of belonging for our students so that they feel that they are engaged in their own learning and they feel safe in their environment.

790
02:05:39,201 --> 02:05:41,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that really spoke to us

791
02:05:42,455 --> 02:05:50,439
[SPEAKER_03]: is this image right here that I think you will be seeing a lot for Medford Public Schools.

792
02:05:53,721 --> 02:05:57,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows the intersection of how we create belonging for our students.

793
02:05:58,403 --> 02:06:08,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we know that diversity is a fact, equity is a choice, inclusion is an action, and belonging is the outcome.

794
02:06:10,225 --> 02:06:19,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So this graphic was shared in a different format at this institute, but something that we are centering our work in this year.

795
02:06:21,252 --> 02:06:31,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So taking all of that, our instructional priorities are hyperlinked in this slide deck, which I just shared with everyone so that you have the updated slide deck.

796
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:37,163
[SPEAKER_03]: But our instructional priorities are to create these environments for our students.

797
02:06:37,748 --> 02:06:43,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what that looks like in a nutshell is we are going to be ensuring high quality instruction.

798
02:06:45,531 --> 02:06:49,713
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to take the superintendent's five core actions and dig deeper.

799
02:06:50,634 --> 02:07:05,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does that look like to make sure that students have evidence-based responses, they are productively struggling in their environment, they are using and able, we are hearing their voice, they're able to use their voice

800
02:07:06,453 --> 02:07:22,225
[SPEAKER_03]: The academic discourse within the classroom is grade appropriate, the vocabulary is applicable, and that we are creating access for all students and we are providing teachers and teachers are providing students with meaningful feedback.

801
02:07:24,627 --> 02:07:29,871
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to be making sure and starting to review that all of our materials are high quality.

802
02:07:30,487 --> 02:07:31,688
[SPEAKER_03]: and grade appropriate.

803
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:45,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the pieces of feedback that we got from the AIR report was that we do have to increase student voice in classrooms, less teacher voice, more student voice.

804
02:07:46,315 --> 02:08:00,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the professional development opportunities that we've already started with the administration and they've already started with their staff in their buildings is pushing students to own their thinking and putting

805
02:08:00,495 --> 02:08:05,079
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the cognitive lift off of themselves and putting it on the students.

806
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:16,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has already taken place in the first professional development staff meeting for teachers and something that we're going to be working on throughout the year.

807
02:08:18,149 --> 02:08:20,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The other piece is around the data.

808
02:08:21,252 --> 02:08:26,476
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have great systems in place, but our recommendations are now what?

809
02:08:27,357 --> 02:08:28,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we doing with them?

810
02:08:29,252 --> 02:08:58,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year we're going to have two consultants also come and work with us and the new position of our data manager so that we are using common planning time, ILTs, we are using this frequent opportunity to talk about student data, what we're learning about our students from that data and how we can shift our instruction to meet their needs.

811
02:08:59,417 --> 02:09:04,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So this data informed instruction is something that we're going to be working on all year.

812
02:09:05,081 --> 02:09:15,629
[SPEAKER_03]: We are bringing in two consultants to help us with that so that principals and directors will be coached through this process.

813
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:23,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will be continuing, but enhancing our learning walks.

814
02:09:24,535 --> 02:09:27,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So learning walks within the district were done

815
02:09:29,012 --> 02:09:30,793
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of pocketed, honestly.

816
02:09:32,775 --> 02:09:35,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul Teixeira, who's on the call, could speak.

817
02:09:35,918 --> 02:09:48,669
[SPEAKER_03]: He, with Nick Tucci and Faiza Khan, had regular, productive, and successful learning walks with staff, because that always included a debrief at the end.

818
02:09:49,209 --> 02:09:54,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we want to make sure that we are, with all of these priorities,

819
02:09:55,487 --> 02:10:03,956
[SPEAKER_03]: in classrooms and having conversations with teachers to provide the feedback and be support for this work.

820
02:10:06,838 --> 02:10:11,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much it in a nutshell.

821
02:10:12,404 --> 02:10:18,310
[SPEAKER_03]: The last slide is just a quote from the superintendent that talked about the instructional

822
02:10:19,195 --> 02:10:21,357
[SPEAKER_03]: vision and mission for the district this year.

823
02:10:23,378 --> 02:10:32,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We as United District are committed to follow core values, ensuring that every student has access to high quality learning opportunities and instructional materials, deep and lasting engagement.

824
02:10:33,626 --> 02:10:36,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Faculty and staff will challenge and help them grow.

825
02:10:36,708 --> 02:10:43,854
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not be able to fulfill these and other core values without the help and support of every Mustang staff member, no matter where you serve.

826
02:10:45,755 --> 02:10:46,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have any questions,

827
02:10:48,851 --> 02:10:49,491
[SPEAKER_04]: please let us know.

828
02:10:53,173 --> 02:10:53,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Hays.

829
02:10:55,073 --> 02:10:55,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

830
02:10:56,774 --> 02:11:00,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like this is kind of a gift to us.

831
02:11:01,056 --> 02:11:01,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

832
02:11:01,476 --> 02:11:05,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it was free and it's incredibly comprehensive.

833
02:11:09,619 --> 02:11:17,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things I took the time, not that I took the time because I know it was hard to read, I didn't mean it that way.

834
02:11:18,001 --> 02:11:21,943
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did read through the whole thing and actually probably read it a couple of times.

835
02:11:22,643 --> 02:11:27,145
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's so much more to it, obviously, than you were able to put in a slide deck.

836
02:11:29,245 --> 02:11:39,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I first started reading it, what came to mind immediately was when we had the report from Mike Welch.

837
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:45,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And what started ringing in my head actually was member Graham's voice.

838
02:11:46,107 --> 02:11:49,609
[SPEAKER_07]: saying our issue is issue of implementation.

839
02:11:51,430 --> 02:12:12,963
[SPEAKER_07]: There were many places throughout this report where it was noted that we have the right priorities, we have the capacity to do this and that, but it's not happening, or it's not happening across all buildings, or it's not happening consistently.

840
02:12:15,129 --> 02:12:36,839
[SPEAKER_07]: So as much as I appreciate the, and I believe in your intentions, again, intentions, I think we have the right intentions, but I feel like I've been in this place before where we've heard a presentation about, we've got all this information and now we're gonna do all this stuff.

841
02:12:38,359 --> 02:12:42,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we come back to another report that's still saying, but you're not really doing all this stuff.

842
02:12:46,812 --> 02:12:53,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, you know, I, I'm uncomfortable being in this position of being, of sounding so critical, but I'm worried.

843
02:12:53,995 --> 02:12:55,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've used that word before.

844
02:12:55,336 --> 02:13:01,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember using that word as a parent when I stood up in front of school committee once to talk about, I think, reading.

845
02:13:01,619 --> 02:13:06,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm worried because I do feel like we keep coming back to the same point.

846
02:13:07,161 --> 02:13:14,224
[SPEAKER_07]: We now have, in my short time here, less than two years now, we've had three reviews.

847
02:13:14,344 --> 02:13:16,145
[SPEAKER_07]: We've, we had Cindy Weeks Bradley.

848
02:13:16,584 --> 02:13:20,846
[SPEAKER_07]: do a pretty significant review of certain aspects of the district.

849
02:13:21,126 --> 02:13:24,108
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Mike Welch do a pretty thorough review of the high school.

850
02:13:24,568 --> 02:13:29,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we have this review that's comprehensive of the whole school system.

851
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:43,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like we need to sit down and take some more time to pull all three of those together and say, where are the major issues that we see?

852
02:13:43,737 --> 02:13:45,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And how are we going to?

853
02:13:47,711 --> 02:14:03,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to set real priorities and I think the school committee needs to be a part of setting those priorities, because I think what I've come to realize in my time on school committee is we can't do it all and too often I think we're trying to do it all and it's not all getting done.

854
02:14:03,678 --> 02:14:16,703
[SPEAKER_07]: it's all getting done and we're trying to do too much and there's so many in your report your list of things that everyone's going to try to do that's a lot of stuff.

855
02:14:17,623 --> 02:14:36,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and I am concerned that if we don't as a group really administration and school committees sit down, as I said, go through these three reports thoroughly look where the commonalities because there's a lot of commonalities and what these three different groups of people are three different reviewers saw.

856
02:14:37,227 --> 02:14:43,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And where are we really going to target our time and energy and we need to be on the same page about that because you know.

857
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:47,471
[SPEAKER_07]: This was concerning to me.

858
02:14:48,071 --> 02:14:49,811
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a lot of concerns in here.

859
02:14:49,831 --> 02:14:57,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just to pull out the data, the issue of data and how it's being used by teachers.

860
02:14:58,194 --> 02:15:01,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that was something I specifically asked about a couple of times with the map.

861
02:15:02,376 --> 02:15:10,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are quotes in here from teachers saying, we don't really have time to sit down and look at the data and think about how to use it in the classroom.

862
02:15:11,459 --> 02:15:13,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just one example.

863
02:15:13,519 --> 02:15:15,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciated that this report

864
02:15:16,226 --> 02:15:44,294
[SPEAKER_07]: did give us a lot of information from teachers, which is something I feel like we've been lacking as a group, really hearing from what the teachers are saying about what they're able to do, that the student support teams, that they don't have a lot of time for those, that they feel, whether accurate or not, that our multi-tiered systems of support aren't really doing much, that there isn't enough.

865
02:15:47,322 --> 02:15:50,725
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I'd like to make a motion, maybe, I guess.

866
02:15:50,785 --> 02:15:52,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I just clarify one thing before you do?

867
02:15:52,486 --> 02:15:52,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

868
02:15:52,927 --> 02:15:54,308
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Dr. Edwards, Ms.

869
02:15:54,328 --> 02:15:55,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Glucy, then Dr. Edwards.

870
02:15:55,809 --> 02:15:57,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me let you ask your question.

871
02:15:57,370 --> 02:15:57,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you sure?

872
02:15:57,810 --> 02:16:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just say, I hear you.

873
02:16:01,994 --> 02:16:05,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Those three reports that you mentioned are distinctly different.

874
02:16:05,997 --> 02:16:08,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I am sure that there is some overlap.

875
02:16:09,239 --> 02:16:10,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that for sure.

876
02:16:10,701 --> 02:16:16,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But the focus of those three reports had an entirely separate

877
02:16:17,222 --> 02:16:20,365
[SPEAKER_03]: agenda with with goals as a result.

878
02:16:21,386 --> 02:16:29,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we will get to where you're speaking of having all of it overlay when we work on updating the strategic plan.

879
02:16:30,013 --> 02:16:38,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that's when we collectively can talk about the goals for the district and the vision for the next three, five years.

880
02:16:39,081 --> 02:16:41,083
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we're going to write the strategic plan.

881
02:16:42,884 --> 02:16:43,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that

882
02:16:48,083 --> 02:16:50,004
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a way to do the work.

883
02:16:50,464 --> 02:16:53,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It is happening in a lot of the schools.

884
02:16:55,245 --> 02:16:58,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it happening at the level it needed to at some of the schools?

885
02:16:59,247 --> 02:17:00,687
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it wasn't.

886
02:17:00,767 --> 02:17:08,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what the report has stated, but it is able to get done.

887
02:17:09,730 --> 02:17:16,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Time will always be something that's mentioned as a constraint or a restriction, but there are ways in which

888
02:17:17,475 --> 02:17:27,758
[SPEAKER_03]: to work collaboratively with staff at each building and then ultimately district wide to move the work of the district and do what's best for students.

889
02:17:28,538 --> 02:17:42,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really energized and very positive and optimistic about where this district is going with the people we have on board.

890
02:17:46,670 --> 02:18:05,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess my response to that in part would be, if we're always dependent on which people we have on board, then the next time around, if someone leaves and we need to replace them, they might not be the same person of the same level of skills or investment that we have.

891
02:18:05,694 --> 02:18:15,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we, from my point of view, and what I'm hoping we can do is really dig deeper into this huge,

892
02:18:16,383 --> 02:18:36,681
[SPEAKER_07]: dense report, and I do think there were commonalities between the three that I, in my opinion, in my reading of all three of them, not, you're right, they did start with different goals in mind that we asked those people to look at, but there are definitely some common themes.

893
02:18:37,762 --> 02:18:39,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think if we

894
02:18:42,990 --> 02:18:48,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you're right that the strategic goals, the strategic plan is where we would need to do all this.

895
02:18:48,834 --> 02:18:58,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess my concern, again, is that we had a strategic plan, and yet by my reading of this, there were a lot of pieces of that plan that never came to fruition.

896
02:18:59,241 --> 02:19:09,148
[SPEAKER_07]: So the plan is only as good as the buy-in from everyone, is only as good as the understanding from all of us of what resources are needed.

897
02:19:11,525 --> 02:19:25,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if we don't sit down all together, and whether this happens with this team of people, this group of school committee, or whether, you know, in January with the new school committee, I, you know, that would maybe be up to those who are still running.

898
02:19:28,916 --> 02:19:31,198
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think school committee needs to be a part of this.

899
02:19:31,838 --> 02:19:37,462
[SPEAKER_07]: We get a report sent to us, as Member Ruseau said, you know, with very little time to read it.

900
02:19:38,437 --> 02:19:40,918
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have responsibility for some of this too.

901
02:19:41,418 --> 02:19:48,301
[SPEAKER_07]: We have responsibility for policies that would directly affect what can be done, budget decisions.

902
02:19:49,642 --> 02:19:49,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

903
02:19:50,362 --> 02:19:58,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So to the extent that this is just one part of one meeting, as opposed to like a real in-depth look together at this.

904
02:19:59,986 --> 02:20:00,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right.

905
02:20:00,586 --> 02:20:03,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were just presenting on half of the findings.

906
02:20:07,041 --> 02:20:09,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so I guess I was going to make a motion that we have.

907
02:20:09,824 --> 02:20:10,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

908
02:20:10,384 --> 02:20:11,766
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's okay.

909
02:20:13,327 --> 02:20:16,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it would be, whether it's a committee of the whole, whether it's a special meeting.

910
02:20:17,230 --> 02:20:21,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think there needs to be some meetings where we sit down and look at all of this together.

911
02:20:24,156 --> 02:20:33,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this is the future of our school system and it's, you know, there are some real issues that we need to look at that have been brought up again by all three reports.

912
02:20:34,449 --> 02:20:42,958
[SPEAKER_07]: certainly by this report, because this was the most comprehensive, to really get on the same page about what the priorities are.

913
02:20:44,519 --> 02:20:44,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

914
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:45,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

915
02:20:48,463 --> 02:20:49,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

916
02:20:52,427 --> 02:20:56,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I might offer a friendly amendment to that.

917
02:20:57,472 --> 02:20:58,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what

918
02:20:59,278 --> 02:21:07,227
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to do together is agree on the approach that we will take to create the next strategic plan.

919
02:21:07,347 --> 02:21:14,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I'm being perfectly honest, if you read our strategic plan, every last thing you could think of

920
02:21:15,032 --> 02:21:39,158
[SPEAKER_02]: could be like yep there it is yep there it is yep there it is so literally anything anybody wants to do like today if you read our strategic plan you'd be like yeah that's in here and it shouldn't be that's not to me that's not what a viable strategic plan looks like um because a strategic plan can't be all things to all people all at once to your point like it has to be focused and i think

921
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:41,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very broad right now.

922
02:21:41,902 --> 02:21:44,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's was the first one we ever had.

923
02:21:45,147 --> 02:21:46,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, okay.

924
02:21:47,369 --> 02:21:56,221
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think as we go forward, what we need to, I think what we all need to agree on is the approach we will take to strategic planning and what it will look like when it's done and who will do what.

925
02:21:56,441 --> 02:21:58,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, like

926
02:21:58,447 --> 02:22:03,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Our mission is like a mouthful it doesn't resonate with me at all it never has but like.

927
02:22:04,373 --> 02:22:17,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want the superintendent to just like go off in a closet and create like a new one on her own right because that's not the way to get an entire system of hundreds of people moving in the same direction, there has to be.

928
02:22:18,379 --> 02:22:20,701
[SPEAKER_02]: some collaboration and it's now the right time to do that.

929
02:22:21,142 --> 02:22:34,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it is maybe it isn't, but I think those are the kinds of things that we could talk about when we talk about how will we create this next strategic plan and where, where will the school committee be involved and how, how will we engage the community like

930
02:22:35,063 --> 02:22:42,271
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a chance for us to really think about like what that next strategic plan looks like so that we all know what's coming.

931
02:22:42,772 --> 02:22:55,386
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't think necessarily like us sitting around and trying to like dive deeper into like 85 pages really gets us there but instead to say like, what about the process of a broader strategic plan.

932
02:22:57,625 --> 02:23:03,368
[SPEAKER_02]: do we need to agree on in terms of its premise and how long it's going to take and how we will engage various people.

933
02:23:03,388 --> 02:23:14,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to me, that would actually be maybe more actionable than us sitting around and saying, like, we want to talk more about this.

934
02:23:14,394 --> 02:23:15,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody says, yes, we'll do that.

935
02:23:15,835 --> 02:23:17,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody says, yes, we'll do the next thing.

936
02:23:17,395 --> 02:23:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think it has to, like a strategic plan can't come together in a meeting like that.

937
02:23:21,818 --> 02:23:25,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to come together over a period of time and with a purpose.

938
02:23:26,764 --> 02:23:37,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if what we really should do is have a committee of the whole that addresses how we will create this next district strategic plan with this as obviously an important input.

939
02:23:37,433 --> 02:23:43,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and that was like a big mouthful and not exactly like an amendment, but that was what I was thinking about as we're talking.

940
02:23:44,238 --> 02:23:45,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor.

941
02:23:45,499 --> 02:23:46,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

942
02:23:47,181 --> 02:23:47,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

943
02:23:49,302 --> 02:23:56,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that, I'm thinking both and in terms of the amendment and the proposed motion,

944
02:23:57,192 --> 02:24:10,663
[SPEAKER_16]: in that, yes, a committee of the whole to discuss the strategic planning, but also some effort on our part and administration's part to look at the commonalities in these three reports and bring them to the table for that meeting.

945
02:24:10,783 --> 02:24:12,124
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's both and.

946
02:24:12,244 --> 02:24:13,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we need to go over that.

947
02:24:13,545 --> 02:24:18,509
[SPEAKER_16]: I would agree that going through an 83-page report and being like, hey, what's this?

948
02:24:18,790 --> 02:24:25,335
[SPEAKER_16]: But the broad strokes, the commonalities, the things that we're talking about that we're seeing repeated, we can identify.

949
02:24:26,308 --> 02:24:27,529
[SPEAKER_16]: and bring those to the table.

950
02:24:27,569 --> 02:24:34,075
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe we'll have different perspectives with seven different members and some of administration that could be healthy conversation as well.

951
02:24:34,555 --> 02:24:39,179
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think it could be the basis for talking about the process for the strategic plan.

952
02:24:44,042 --> 02:24:45,003
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a motion on the floor.

953
02:24:45,043 --> 02:24:46,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to amend it?

954
02:24:46,665 --> 02:24:47,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Edward-Vincent.

955
02:24:49,327 --> 02:24:50,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to comment.

956
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:56,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I too, in thinking about the three reports.

957
02:24:59,066 --> 02:25:02,890
[SPEAKER_08]: The three reports, all of them were valuable in different ways.

958
02:25:04,071 --> 02:25:13,161
[SPEAKER_08]: The first report by Cindy weeks was really a deep examination of human resources and the systems and structures that we actually

959
02:25:14,474 --> 02:25:25,626
[SPEAKER_08]: ended up being revealed we did not have in place that we needed to put in place as a district to ensure that we're bringing in and recruiting and maintaining dynamic staff.

960
02:25:26,708 --> 02:25:32,734
[SPEAKER_08]: The second report from Michael Welch in regards to the high school.

961
02:25:33,235 --> 02:25:35,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I do feel with that data being published.

962
02:25:36,823 --> 02:25:37,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

963
02:25:37,023 --> 02:25:50,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Cabral and her team and everyone within the district has had the opportunity to look at that report and see some of the key areas that definitely were identified as areas, growth areas.

964
02:25:51,354 --> 02:25:56,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of those areas have been addressed even in the presentation that Ms.

965
02:25:56,238 --> 02:26:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Cabral just gave to us this evening about a lot of the shifts and putting systems in place and having that consistency and accountability.

966
02:26:07,426 --> 02:26:18,829
[SPEAKER_08]: This DESE AIR report, prior to coming to Medford, I was getting DESE AIR reports a lot, especially when you're working with schools that are underperforming.

967
02:26:18,849 --> 02:26:23,050
[SPEAKER_08]: This report, I see it as the glass is half full.

968
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:33,333
[SPEAKER_08]: There are areas for growth for us as a district, but there were so many areas that DESE did identify that the district was doing well.

969
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:49,928
[SPEAKER_08]: This school year, the new calendar, the new schedule that is in place with early release happening for all schools K-12, allowing for greater, more meaningful professional development that used to not have happened K-12.

970
02:26:51,693 --> 02:26:53,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Only our secondary students were exposed to that.

971
02:26:54,915 --> 02:27:08,023
[SPEAKER_08]: And even working on the new schedule that's going to happen for the high school, because we still have the six day schedule of the comprehensive high school and the five day schedule of the vocational school.

972
02:27:08,963 --> 02:27:16,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Five and six, they don't talk to each other and it's like we've been force fitting for I believe eight years prior to my arrival.

973
02:27:16,694 --> 02:27:25,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's finally going to happen for the 2425 school year, and I was on one of the calls with the

974
02:27:25,888 --> 02:27:35,850
[SPEAKER_08]: consultants and the team, where they're going to be pulling in a lot of data to say, how are we going to make Medford High School function like seamlessly?

975
02:27:36,350 --> 02:27:46,612
[SPEAKER_08]: That yes, we still have a robust vocational program, but the comprehensive side of the school, that they will talk to each other and it will be a win-win for everyone.

976
02:27:47,372 --> 02:27:54,993
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I look at this data, it has been nine years since Medford Public Schools was reviewed at all in this

977
02:27:56,182 --> 02:27:57,262
[SPEAKER_08]: type of a capacity.

978
02:27:58,643 --> 02:28:09,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Even when we were doing instructional rounds, and some of you participated pre-pandemic, when we were just looking at the five core actions, the pandemic caused a lot of changes.

979
02:28:10,427 --> 02:28:14,988
[SPEAKER_08]: The pandemic did impact everyone in different ways, but we made shifts.

980
02:28:15,909 --> 02:28:20,890
[SPEAKER_08]: At the elementary level, we did not have weekly grade level team meetings.

981
02:28:21,571 --> 02:28:25,292
[SPEAKER_08]: And the team can tell you, I had been saying it to them for five years.

982
02:28:25,891 --> 02:28:33,176
[SPEAKER_08]: If we cannot get the teachers to meet at the lowest levels, progress is going to take significantly longer.

983
02:28:33,657 --> 02:28:45,785
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be the first year that all teachers will be able to meet with the new schedule and the added specialists, that that work is going to be able to happen.

984
02:28:46,366 --> 02:28:52,050
[SPEAKER_08]: So seeing Desi talk about what we can do with instructional leadership teams

985
02:28:52,777 --> 02:29:01,943
[SPEAKER_08]: what more we need to do with student support teams, I feel like the pieces of the puzzle are clearly laid out.

986
02:29:02,403 --> 02:29:10,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, it's a dense document, but what those 89 pages say are like, this is your roadmap.

987
02:29:11,329 --> 02:29:21,575
[SPEAKER_08]: If you implement these particular areas and maintain the things that are working well, the district's going to move forward at an accelerated rate.

988
02:29:22,367 --> 02:29:28,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we talk about change and changes sometimes difficult for people to wrap their heads around.

989
02:29:29,349 --> 02:29:32,210
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we talk about change we do have to pace it.

990
02:29:33,131 --> 02:29:35,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Desi came to see us after nine years.

991
02:29:36,012 --> 02:29:39,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the changes that are happening right now, we're basically.

992
02:29:40,831 --> 02:29:44,593
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our ground zero, we're starting with significant change.

993
02:29:45,353 --> 02:30:10,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do feel optimistic, like when we read this report and when I read it, I saw the areas that were identified as deltas, but I really left feeling reassured because I felt like it was attainable that the new systems, the new structures that are in place, the new schedule, K-12, that we're gonna see the benefits and reap the benefits

994
02:30:11,758 --> 02:30:13,179
[SPEAKER_08]: with the changes that are happening.

995
02:30:14,039 --> 02:30:21,143
[SPEAKER_08]: They talked earlier about whether it's the DEIB work, what's happening for our most vulnerable populations.

996
02:30:21,703 --> 02:30:29,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Tesheira talked about what they identified for EL and, you know, the whole thing of equality.

997
02:30:29,147 --> 02:30:32,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, we're meeting the needs of our students at the McGlynn School.

998
02:30:32,793 --> 02:30:38,035
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have that population currently at the Andrew school, and for us to look at other options.

999
02:30:38,675 --> 02:30:47,959
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't want people who haven't yet seen the full report to feel like the district's falling apart because it actually isn't.

1000
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:51,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And even in speaking with Jesse they're like, you know,

1001
02:30:52,728 --> 02:30:59,111
[SPEAKER_08]: This is it's it's a decent report in terms of like we know what we need to do as a next step.

1002
02:30:59,771 --> 02:31:08,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just don't want people to leave feeling like the district is failing and run pack up and run, because that's not what it's saying.

1003
02:31:08,962 --> 02:31:18,664
[SPEAKER_08]: It's saying, if you do these strategic things instructionally, meeting the needs of all of our diverse learners, the district will continue to move forward.

1004
02:31:19,424 --> 02:31:22,665
[SPEAKER_08]: And I felt that it was optimistic.

1005
02:31:23,325 --> 02:31:37,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the strategic plan, the feedback from member Graham, that first strategic plan, six years ago or five years ago, four years ago, right now the years are blurring together.

1006
02:31:38,066 --> 02:31:47,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But we spent like a year and a half just trying to get the entire administrative team together to say, these are all of the things that are happening in Medford.

1007
02:31:48,106 --> 02:31:53,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now that we have that plan, we're able to say, okay, it's true.

1008
02:31:53,431 --> 02:31:55,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't need to be as big as it is.

1009
02:31:55,693 --> 02:31:59,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's focus in and decide what are we gonna hone in on.

1010
02:32:00,617 --> 02:32:11,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And the instructional priorities, which was the second to last slide, that's going to be what's going to really be our driving force moving forward.

1011
02:32:12,369 --> 02:32:19,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just, I just wanted to provide that context because we should unpack it, we will continue to unpack it.

1012
02:32:20,636 --> 02:32:29,323
[SPEAKER_08]: But the data that we received from this really said to us, wow, we started earlier doing DEI work, and we're going to continue doing that.

1013
02:32:30,023 --> 02:32:34,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And this summer, with the 35 other districts at Tufts University.

1014
02:32:36,949 --> 02:32:47,497
[SPEAKER_08]: our team was able to see how much work they were actually doing that was in line with what was being presented at Tufts University with 35 other districts.

1015
02:32:47,997 --> 02:32:56,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And the question now is, how do we take this new data, this new information, and continue to propel the entire district forward?

1016
02:32:58,725 --> 02:32:59,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

1017
02:32:59,265 --> 02:33:02,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't, I certainly don't want to leave with the impression either that

1018
02:33:03,433 --> 02:33:06,777
[SPEAKER_07]: everything was negative or that the school system, as you said, it's falling apart.

1019
02:33:06,817 --> 02:33:09,621
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not at all how I read the report either.

1020
02:33:09,701 --> 02:33:13,146
[SPEAKER_07]: There definitely were a lot of positives and things to build on.

1021
02:33:13,166 --> 02:33:16,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I think then the motion would be

1022
02:33:17,577 --> 02:33:37,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I think with what Member Graham, if she wants to restate what she said, but with the idea that Member McLaughlin brought in of all of us coming in with kind of having really looked through the three reports, thinking about what the major areas of commonality were, major themes, and talking all together about the strategic plan.

1023
02:33:37,721 --> 02:33:43,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But you always have a nice wording for motions, so if you want to word yours.

1024
02:33:43,742 --> 02:33:45,823
[SPEAKER_02]: What would the motion be that we

1025
02:33:48,106 --> 02:34:04,838
[SPEAKER_02]: conduct a committee of the whole to share our collective thoughts about the common themes across these various reports as input to the process that we will embark on to update the strategic plan.

1026
02:34:05,959 --> 02:34:06,679
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great.

1027
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:07,940
Okay.

1028
02:34:08,921 --> 02:34:09,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get all of that?

1029
02:34:40,168 --> 02:34:41,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read you what I wrote.

1030
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:44,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see how far off I am.

1031
02:34:44,471 --> 02:34:53,337
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion is to schedule a committee of the whole on the several reports we have received to discuss the common themes to feed into our discussion of a successor strategic plan.

1032
02:34:55,118 --> 02:34:55,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds perfect.

1033
02:34:57,500 --> 02:35:00,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a motion on the floor from Member Hays, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1034
02:35:02,143 --> 02:35:02,823
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1035
02:35:03,944 --> 02:35:04,064
Aye.

1036
02:35:04,584 --> 02:35:05,185
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1037
02:35:06,005 --> 02:35:06,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1038
02:35:12,137 --> 02:35:17,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we have, are there any other questions for the group here?

1039
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1040
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:24,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1041
02:35:24,921 --> 02:35:30,903
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no presentations of the public scheduled for this evening and no continued business.

1042
02:35:32,403 --> 02:35:40,526
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have some new business resolution 2023-20 offered by member Rousseau, a resolution in support of the Rural Schools Bill.

1043
02:35:41,417 --> 02:35:42,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas rural districts.

1044
02:35:44,301 --> 02:35:47,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to waive the reading.

1045
02:35:48,085 --> 02:35:51,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to waive the reading, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1046
02:35:51,990 --> 02:35:52,631
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1047
02:35:52,651 --> 02:35:53,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1048
02:35:54,233 --> 02:35:54,853
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1049
02:35:55,835 --> 02:35:56,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1050
02:35:57,396 --> 02:35:57,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

1051
02:35:58,818 --> 02:35:59,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1052
02:35:59,739 --> 02:36:00,640
[SPEAKER_02]: One second.

1053
02:36:08,078 --> 02:36:21,745
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe, well, I believe we all get the emails from our association and I grew up in a rural school district of seven or nine districts, depending on my memory at the moment.

1054
02:36:23,286 --> 02:36:31,390
[SPEAKER_13]: And I lived the furthest from the school, my high school, which was a seven through 12, the entire time I went to seven through 12.

1055
02:36:32,391 --> 02:36:33,191
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was on a bus,

1056
02:36:34,392 --> 02:36:40,357
[SPEAKER_13]: when it was dark in the morning and I got off the bus when it was dark at night for a significant portion of the year.

1057
02:36:41,198 --> 02:36:48,764
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I remember very much the experiences of never participating in a single after school activity because there were no late buses.

1058
02:36:49,584 --> 02:37:02,275
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I certainly feel very akin ship to Earl to school districts, which, well, as a student, I certainly did not experience what the

1059
02:37:02,975 --> 02:37:07,636
[SPEAKER_13]: district in the administration we're going through or the towns trying to figure out how to fund it.

1060
02:37:08,737 --> 02:37:11,977
[SPEAKER_13]: But as a side becoming since becoming a school committee member.

1061
02:37:13,358 --> 02:37:25,741
[SPEAKER_13]: I've become very aware of how in rural districts there, there's their bill for schools can change to 300 400% every single school year I mean can you imagine if our,

1062
02:37:26,556 --> 02:37:33,140
[SPEAKER_13]: If we had to change the funding for Medford public schools, double triple a one year, and the next year was half.

1063
02:37:34,521 --> 02:37:37,503
[SPEAKER_13]: We conceptually can't even really wrap our heads around it.

1064
02:37:38,203 --> 02:37:47,149
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what it's like in some of our rural districts in Massachusetts, especially the regional districts, where a tiny town may send one kid to school this year.

1065
02:37:47,969 --> 02:37:50,371
[SPEAKER_13]: next year it's three, the next year it's zero.

1066
02:37:51,632 --> 02:38:10,045
[SPEAKER_13]: So aside from the funding that the individual towns have to figure out, the idea that you like, this year we have a chemistry teacher, next year we fire the chemistry teacher, next year we need, it's incomprehensible what they go through in the rural parts of our state.

1067
02:38:11,265 --> 02:38:14,287
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the Student Opportunity Act had a,

1068
02:38:15,628 --> 02:38:29,639
[SPEAKER_13]: portion of it, requiring or suggesting I guess that the rural school funding, the looked at and amend and updated to try and help those districts and communities, and it hasn't happened.

1069
02:38:30,639 --> 02:38:41,204
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a there there are several, two or three or pop out, it's the state house is probably 12, but there are several bills to to get this done this year.

1070
02:38:41,905 --> 02:38:55,932
[SPEAKER_13]: And this resolution is in support to push for this work to happen because these districts I mean, you can read about it it's truly heartbreaking, like can you imagine your property taxes oh they're doubling your property taxes this year.

1071
02:38:57,287 --> 02:38:59,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's really wild.

1072
02:38:59,468 --> 02:39:02,748
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on and right now so far from here a quick drive.

1073
02:39:03,789 --> 02:39:24,114
[SPEAKER_13]: So I this is a resolution to support pushing the state to get its button gear, because these, these students these school leaders, these teachers and these people that are paying the taxes in these communities are in just, it's just chaos, chaos, and

1074
02:39:24,754 --> 02:39:32,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything we can do to try and push on that I think we should do point of information point of information.

1075
02:39:33,541 --> 02:39:45,711
[SPEAKER_16]: So to clarify, you are asking that the school committee, write a letter to the joint committee on the education to support a particular bill.

1076
02:39:46,394 --> 02:39:51,636
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot that I did waive the reading, so that does, yes, thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1077
02:39:52,456 --> 02:39:55,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Without the reading, that was a little missing in that context, yes.

1078
02:39:55,457 --> 02:40:05,600
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is actually a resolution that we would send to the Joint Committee on Education to the Senate and the House, urging them to get this work done.

1079
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:06,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1080
02:40:07,261 --> 02:40:07,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1081
02:40:09,161 --> 02:40:12,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a motion on the floor by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1082
02:40:13,083 --> 02:40:14,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want a roll call vote?

1083
02:40:16,212 --> 02:40:16,892
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1084
02:40:17,513 --> 02:40:17,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1085
02:40:18,033 --> 02:40:18,713
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1086
02:40:19,834 --> 02:40:20,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1087
02:40:20,474 --> 02:40:20,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1088
02:40:23,816 --> 02:40:28,619
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not have any reports requested tonight or condolences.

1089
02:40:29,259 --> 02:40:35,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next meeting is on October 2nd in all the memorial chambers at Medford City Hall in addition to Zoom.

1090
02:40:35,983 --> 02:40:37,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1091
02:40:39,065 --> 02:40:43,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by
