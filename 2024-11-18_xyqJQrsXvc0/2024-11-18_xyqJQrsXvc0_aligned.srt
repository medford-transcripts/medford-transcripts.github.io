00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,958
I can hear you guys now.

38
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:23,241
I don't know what was said though.

39
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:31,789

Madam President, thank you very much.

47
00:04:54,949 --> 00:05:01,992
Just last month, Donald and Mary Bonner celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in Aruba, surrounded by their five.

48
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,222
digits were the grandchildren down there.

49
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:20,078
Mary Bonner was a traffic supervisor here in the city of Metro for a long time her husband Donald, a local auto body repairman, but they grew up on, they live on Hastings road lifelong Metro presidents, great people, great figures in the community.

50
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:22,260
That was one of the houses in the neighborhood we could always.

51
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:28,324
walk into the backyard, take a dip in the pool, get a drink off the hose, and use the bathroom if there's ever an emergency.

52
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:29,605
A very welcoming family.

53
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,387
They touch the lives of many in this community, and it's great to see them celebrate 50 years of wedded bliss.

54
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,068
I hope we can all be so lucky.

55
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:44,654
So with that being said, Madam President, I ask my council colleagues in joining me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion and also requesting the city clerk provide them with a citation doing the same.

59
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:48,737
Again, I want to send

61
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:09,721
I'm close.

62
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:11,661
Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

63
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:12,422
Any further discussion?

64
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:17,263
On the motion of Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor Carviello.

65

72
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:27,167
Councilor Knight.

73
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:27,628
Yes.

74
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,188
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

75
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:29,928

00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:33,409
President Morrell.

78
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:33,989
Yes.

79
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,690
16 in front of one absence here in the negative.

80
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,530
The motion passes.

81
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:48,994
22-446 offered by Vice President Behrs be resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate city solicitor Kimberly Scanlon on her over 20 years of service to the city of Medford and wish her a successful future in any new endeavors.

82
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:50,154
Vice President Behrs.

83
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:51,528
Thank you, Madam President.

84
00:06:51,808 --> 00:07:01,395
Um, I am, uh, obviously, this is a congratulatory resolution for someone who has served the city in an exemplary way for many years.

85
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:09,661
Um, Solicitor Scanlon has been solicitor basically as long as I've been on the council and was assistant

86
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:13,527
assistant city solicitor for many years before that.

87
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:20,433
We were notified that she's moving to a new opportunity and leaving the city after decades of service.

88
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,815
And I think that's a huge loss for our city.

89
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:33,243
We need a strong city solicitor and we were just able to finally to get the budget back for the assistant city solicitor position that had been gone for three years.

90
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:37,327
So I congratulate Kim on her

91
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:42,296
on her moving to a new position that she seems to be excited about.

92
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:50,578
And I hope that we can find someone of similar caliber to fill her shoes, and the big hole that she's leaving in our city.

93
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:51,118
Thank you.

94
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:52,178
Thank you.

95
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:52,478
Thank you.

96
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:01,935
Kimberly Scanlon for her years of service to this community.

97
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:04,497
I've known Kimberly since she was in high school.

98
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:10,900
Our families have traveled together to cheerleading things when our daughters cheered together.

99
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,381
And it's gonna be sad to see her go.

100
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:14,642
She has a picture of this building.

101
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:18,044
She worked here during high school as a summer intern too.

102
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:24,207
So again, I had the opportunity to talk to her in the fall and I wish her well on her new adventure.

103
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:25,127
Thank you.

104
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:29,486
further discussion tonight.

105
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,967
Madam President, thank you very much.

106
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:34,190
My two had the good opportunity of attending high school with Kimberly.

107
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,271
I've known her for a very long time.

108
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:39,075
She's a great person, very hard worker and someone that was very dedicated to this community.

109
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:42,398
Her presence in that law office is going to be sadly missed.

110
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,980
I've always found her to be someone that had the utmost of integrity.

111
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:47,659
and someone that came to work prepared every day.

112
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,282
So with that being said, Madam President, I hate to see her go.

113
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,885
She's a very close friend and someone I respect very much.

114
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,146
So congratulations, Kim.

115
00:08:55,266 --> 00:09:01,412
Wish you all the best in your future endeavors and hopefully you'll be able to help as many people as you have in a new job as you have in the past.

116
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:02,773
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

117
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:03,274
Councilor Sang.

118
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:08,478
I wanted to echo similar sentiments to my colleagues.

119
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:19,937
solicitors handling someone, you know, who, in my short time here on the city council, who has really helped me and understand the role.

120
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:28,213
how city government works and understand what we should do, what we shouldn't be doing.

121
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:39,176
And she's really an engine for helping us move forward our agenda and really helping our city deal with the problems it needs to deal with.

122
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:45,097
So truly a presence that will be missed in City Hall and I wish the best for her going forward.

123
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,958
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

124
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:48,758
Any further discussion?

125
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,391
I could also add, just really echo my colleagues and thank Solicitor Scanlon.

126
00:09:53,411 --> 00:10:00,592
She's done an incredible amount of work, really with a very small staff to no staff in the time I've been a city councilor.

127
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:06,613
And she's always made herself as available really to talk through any issue and help us sort things out.

128
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:11,934
So she will be sorely missed around these parts and I echo and wishing her all the best in her future endeavors.

129
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:16,135
So on the motion of vice-president Behrs, I was seconded by Councilor Carviello.

130
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:17,795
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

131
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,493

135
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:24,657
That's a Collins.

136
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:24,957
Yes.

137
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:25,778
That's a night.

138
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:26,378
Yes.

139
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,020
That's a Scott Kelly is absent.

140
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:29,681
That's the same.

141
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:30,502
Yes.

142
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:32,564
President Morrell.

143
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,347
Yes, six in the affirmative one absent.

144
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:37,829
Negative emotion passes.

145
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:43,594
Madam President, motion suspend the rule so members of the chamber can have a moment to speak.

146
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,663
So this would be to take public participation?

147
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:47,043
Yes.

148
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:52,647
So on the motion of Councilor Carvillo to suspend the rules, take public participation so we can hear from members of the chamber.

149
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:57,189
Second by... Second.

150
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,412
Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

151
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,309
Vice President bears.

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:17,530

The motion passes to take public participation to hear from members of the chambers.

158
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,538
Do you want to lead in at all, Councilor Kerrio?

159
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:47,600
The chamber had a paper on there, I think a couple of meetings ago during the budget in regards to a parking garage.

160
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,261
And they've asked if we give them a minute to speak.

161
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:54,883
And I think Mr. Carroll, the president of the chamber is here to speak on that.

162
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:57,884
Along with Dominic Camaro of the chamber.

163
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,543
Thank you for waiting several hours at previous meetings.

164
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,564
So give me a chance to speak now.

165

Yeah.

Name and address for the record.

167
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:10,507
Thank you for giving us an opportunity.

168
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:18,930
He had to try to discuss the possibility of bringing back a parking garage in the city of Medford in the downtown area.

169
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:26,793
We, you know, previously years ago, we had one behind Salvatore's and Colleen's area that collapsed, never been rebuilt.

170
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:31,564
The need for additional parking in this square is just enormous.

171
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,967
I'm hoping we have an opportunity to take a look at two.

172
00:12:35,027 --> 00:12:37,969
I think you need one on the east side of the square, as well as on the west side.

173
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,534
And a way of making these garages self-sufficient.

174
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:49,238
I don't know if anyone goes down to Assembly Square and see how their garages are operated.

175
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:50,519
They're all self-service.

176
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:59,011
there's an opportunity to put other businesses into the garages, maybe top floor, bottom floor, a little retail and so forth.

177
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:13,738
So, I mean, we're just hoping as a chamber that the need for parking, especially when Chevalier is there, as great as Chevalier is for the downtown area, which it is, the need for additional parking because it just creates gridlock and the whole square gets shut down.

178
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:15,559
So, I mean, I think,

179
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:21,729
I think now's the time to try to look at it and see where we can go from there.

180
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,652
So I appreciate any discussion and I'm trying to move this thing forward.

181
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:26,733
Thank you.

182
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:27,193
Thank you.

183
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:34,239
Any counselors, Madam President, just money papers come from the administration.

184
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,562
Historically, there was conversation relative to the construction or reconstruction of the

185
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:44,469
At that point in time, I don't think the mayor was too supportive of that paper or that initiative or endeavor.

186
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:48,050
Presently, we're looking at a financial situation here in the community.

187
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,031
We're looking at, what, $29 million in deficit spending over the past three years.

188
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:59,273
So from a financial standpoint, I think we're not in a great position right now.

189
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:06,154
The certain funds that were out there were available to us, whether or not they're still available to us is a whole different ball of wax and a whole different question.

190
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:17,117
I know that there was several million dollars that was dedicated to this community through the federal government's transportation bond bill, and I know that there was several million dollars dedicated to this community from the state's transportation bond bill in order to get those funds released.

191
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:22,038
It'd have to be an act of Congress, literally, and also an act of the governor at the state level.

192
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,630
It's certainly a worthwhile endeavor.

193
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,034
I know that we have some concerns about the traffic management in this community and the parking management in this community.

194
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:38,603
Councilor Caviello has a resolution on, coming up a little later, whether or not we have the capacity to handle this type of stuff, whether or not it's a good idea for the city to be in the business of parking, whether or not we should outsource it.

195
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:43,027
We looked at having outsourced parking in the previous administrations and

196
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:44,967
seem to generate revenue.

197
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:49,508
Now we seem to be spending quite a bit of money and not getting anything back and not getting a return on our investment.

198
00:14:50,489 --> 00:15:05,112
That coupled with a lot of the confusion that we're seeing in the neighborhoods related to tickets, appeals processes, being pushed to outside court for a day in court, filing fees and the like is creating a situation over here.

199
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:10,878
I certainly support anything that will bring business to our communities and revitalization of Memphis Square.

200
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,200
We've only been talking about that since the 80s.

201
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,763
So, you know, if anything will help, I think it would be if I could graduate in conjunction with the work that we're doing at Chevalier.

202
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:25,467
But I think we need a bit of a private partnership and a commitment in order to do that, as well as a commitment from the administration.

203
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:33,573
I was a member of this council when this came up, I think maybe about 10 years ago.

204
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,934
And I was supportive of it back then.

205
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:42,378
And I think back then we had a, as Councilor Leib mentioned, we had a $6 million from the transportation bond bill.

206
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,161
That's since long gone.

207
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:50,584
And then I think, then Congressman Maki got us another $2 million.

208
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:52,845
And I think that's since gone.

209
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,907
So there's $8 million that we kind of squandered

210
00:15:56,387 --> 00:16:02,710
for a garage that should have been put up right after it fell down, or got torn down.

211
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:08,033
And like Councilor Layton says, this is a money paper that would have to come from the mayor.

212
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:20,139
And you'll see right now, I think our budget is stretched to the max and the cost of putting up one garage, nevermind two, I think it's just,

213
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:31,829
I don't see where the funding is coming now, but like I said, I do support the garage, and if they're able to come up with a public-private partnership or some type of thing, I will be in support of it.

214
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:43,844
if I can, Councilor, I agree fully with both Councilor Ntuk and Chair Aviello, but I think a public private partnership is really the way to go.

215
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:47,486
The city has never really done much of that, if any at all.

216
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:57,133
And now it's time, I mean, you can, my guess is we could find opportunities with developers that would be interested in doing that.

217
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,242
that we have to start somewhere is what I'm saying.

218
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:06,509
And I'm not sure if you think it has to be a paper from the mayor or does it come from here to the mayor?

219
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,971
You have to tell me where it goes.

220
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:17,082
Okay, so you're saying for us to solicit the mayor to put a paper in front of the council and then go from there.

221
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:27,486
On that note, Madam President, if you look at the recodified zoning ordinance, what the council did was allow for the opportunity, for instance, is where we can have public-private partnerships and entities like this.

222
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:36,652
We have shared parking changes in our zoning ordinance, which allows an entity to have parking during the day for business and parking at night for residential or other uses, you know what I mean?

223
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,714
So I think that that's something that we've really set the stage for.

224
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:42,195
It's just a matter of putting a plan together and executing it.

225
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:42,796
Exactly.

226
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:45,938
The availability is there and the opportunity as well.

227
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:46,518
Thank you.

228
00:17:47,313 --> 00:18:02,066
And I think to that extent, I raised this during that conversation, has there ever been discussion with the Harvard Vanguard, because there's that garage there, you know, that's a nine to five business, and there would presumably be some- The city had a contract with them for 20 years, and they never renewed it.

229
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:06,690
When they built that part of the original agreement with the city was that it was going to be a parking available.

230
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,151
I don't know if anybody remembers that.

231
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,813
Well, you're older than I am.

232
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:10,814
I've reached out to them.

233
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:16,860
They don't want to rent it out because they're a liability.

234
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,143
So that's the question, is somebody getting written there and them getting sued.

235
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:26,746
I suggest the Chevalier people to go speak to them because of the previous arrangements.

236
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,149
But like you said, cop, there's a liability problem.

237
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,270
Thank you.

238
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,951
Councilor Scarpalli.

239
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:34,272
Thank you.

240
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:36,713
First, I apologize for my parents and my tightness.

241
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:42,037
I came from emergency work and either late for another 45 minutes to get here as fast as I can.

242
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:43,869
I apologize for that.

243
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:55,595
So on the note of our parking garage, I know I missed the beginning of it, but being creative, I think, is what's so important that we reach out.

244
00:18:55,795 --> 00:19:10,461
And you would think that looking at the different entities, bigger developments that are going on in the city, partnering with them, but even thinking outside the box, I brought this up years ago, that one thing Medford lacks is,

245
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:18,642
facilities for youth for outside activities.

246
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:32,012
And neighboring communities have used parking garages, the top floors, as indoor facilities and recreation facilities, where you would not only get the

247
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:43,522
the partnership to help build such a structure, but at the same time, also have the opportunity to create funding through

248
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:51,440
fees through parking from the participants from those programs during the evenings.

249
00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:03,806
If you look at Boston, right next to the Boston Garden, you have a good example that there's an indoor athletic facility, excuse me, basketball city that's right above.

250
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:04,887
So they have five

251
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:07,568
five stories of parking.

252
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:24,813
Top layer is a recreational facility that's utilized by its city, its recreation department throughout the day, and still leaves enough parking for businesses, merchants, for

253
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:32,078
for multiple uses, but at the same time, creating revenue with a partner and trickling down those funds to make that happen.

254
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:35,181
So there's different ways to be creative here.

255
00:20:35,421 --> 00:20:37,723
And it's something that's drastically needed.

256
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:44,048
I know that we've talked to many people and these are, what is it?

257
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:45,609
22 years of master planning for city

258
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:59,389
I would love to find a way that you now encompass both sides of our square as we start looking toward development, putting in, bringing in parking.

259
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:02,352
I think it's needed.

260
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:06,454
I think that it's one of the reasons why we can't further development in Meffitt Square.

261
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:12,336
So I think it's, you know, where do you put the cart in front of the horse?

262
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:13,976
We have to make a move.

263
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:18,758
I think that this is probably a very important step to move Meffitt Square forward.

264
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:27,061
And I thank you, my fellow Mustangs, that they keep fighting the fight.

265
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,681
So thank you for that.

266
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:35,854
All right, thank you so much.

267
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:41,259
Our next move will be, we'll approach the mayor and see where that goes, and hopefully we have a paper in front of you shortly.

268
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,781
All right, thank you.

269
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:43,341
Thank you.

270
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:43,842
Thank you.

271
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:45,283
Madam President.

272
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:46,825
Vice Mayor Behrs.

273
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:52,850
While we're under suspension, motion to take petitions, presentations, and similar papers, and communications from the mayor.

274
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:56,554
Did you have a vote on that?

275
00:21:56,574 --> 00:21:57,495
Since we're already on air.

276
00:21:59,656 --> 00:21:59,816
What?

277
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:01,276
You don't have to vote, sorry.

278
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:02,257
All right, so we're gonna do it.

279
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:11,698
So petitions, presentations on similar papers and communications from the mayor, unless there's any objection from the council, we'll move forward with that order.

280
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:20,120
22-447, petition for a common dealer's license from Nicholas Belytheau and Max Heineck for Medford Brewing Company, 30 Harvard Ave, Medford, Mass, 02155.

281
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:28,922
On file, business certificate, building department, fire department, police traffic impact, treasurer's department, health department, letter of compliance, workers' compensation, state tax ID petition.

282
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:35,103
Name and address for the record, please.

283
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:37,845
Max Hynek, 5 Arden Road, Medford, Mass.

284
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:44,170
I guess for those who are unfamiliar with the project, which is probably very few at this point, do you want to give us a brief overview?

285
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,150
Sure.

286
00:22:45,931 --> 00:23:02,743
So basically, I and Nick Belythe are looking to complete work renovating and building out 30 Harvard Ave to open up a tap room there where we will make beer and sell it.

287
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:08,528
And I'm here tonight also to talk a little bit about the food aspect.

288
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:14,189
For me, this has been the culmination of 15 years of brewing.

289
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:18,790
I'm about to start my 25th year of teaching in the Medford Public Schools.

290
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:30,252
It's my profound and sincere desire to create a community-oriented meeting space where a neighbor and friend and family can congregate.

291
00:23:32,637 --> 00:23:37,521
It's been a significant personal investment for both of us financially as well as time.

292
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:40,684
It's where I've been all today and where I'll be all tomorrow.

293
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:44,847
We're gonna be looking to as much as possible to hire local people.

294
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:58,538
And I would say that over the last seven years in our business, you can see that we've done a fair amount of whether it's donations or creating a reading series in conjunction with the Medford Historical Society.

295
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:00,867
This is where I live.

296
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,948
This is where my kids go to school.

297
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,770
My daughter just graduated and is about to go to college.

298
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,470
Weep, weep.

299
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:09,171
Sincere weep, weep, actually.

300
00:24:10,512 --> 00:24:12,853
So there's been a lot of support from the local neighborhood.

301
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:15,094
Everybody's coming by every day asking, when are we open?

302
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:21,557
And I'm not here tonight with a crystal clear date, because we're still building and sweeping.

303
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,580
But in short, this is a community meeting space.

304
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,400
And it's not very big.

305
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:27,840
It's 2,600 square feet.

306
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,248
you know, start small and dream big, I guess.

307
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:33,289
Thank you.

308
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,212
I'll go to the chair of the second and licensing Councilor Scarpelli.

309
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:38,013
Thank you, Madam President.

310
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:40,394
Um, documentation.

311
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:41,415
Everything is in order.

312
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:45,778
Um, this is something that we've all been waiting for.

313
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,022
I know that Mr Heineck is a cornerstone of our community, and, um,

314
00:24:51,042 --> 00:25:02,087
This is something we've been preaching about for years, bringing in small businesses that keep business out of Winchester and out of Somerville and right here in our own backyard.

315
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,429
And why not support one of our own?

316
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,430
So, as I said, everything's in order.

317
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,752
After my colleagues' comments, I move approval.

318
00:25:11,332 --> 00:25:11,672
Thank you.

319
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:12,913
Thank you, Congressman Scarpelli.

320
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:13,573
Advices and Affairs.

321
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:18,296
Madam President, thank you, Max.

322
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:25,799
And I don't know if Nick's on Zoom or listening in, or I know that he's probably excited for this to be voted on and approved.

323
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:27,379
I had two questions.

324
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:34,302
One of them was when do you open, so now I only have one, which is, is the lemon saison going to be on tap when you open?

325
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,248
Can I answer yes to both?

326
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:48,097
So we're still building, but we're hoping, you know, as soon as possible, we still need to put in the floors and bathroom partitions and stuff like that.

327
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:52,720
But we're trying to make the most of my ever dwindling summer vacation.

328
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:54,642
Okay, but I can

329
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:58,966
can say that I'm pretty confident that we'll be open in the fall.

330
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,548
Hopefully before the leaves change and it gets too chilly.

331
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:05,629
We'll be in an everlasting Elta Cuba situation.

332
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:11,292
All I'll say is that I hope we can expedite things that we're working on.

333
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:14,694
I spend a lot of time at Home Depot.

334
00:26:14,714 --> 00:26:15,434
They know my name.

335
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:16,414
They're now.

336
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:17,895
All right, awesome.

337
00:26:17,915 --> 00:26:18,856
I'm trying to be light here.

338
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:21,217
I'm trying to have a little fun with it.

339
00:26:21,317 --> 00:26:22,217
Thank you, Madam President.

340
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:23,098
Thank you.

341
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:28,341
Madam President, ultimately, a convictual license is a license to sell food.

342
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:30,965
By ordinance, we require the breweries to sell food.

343
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:32,248
So this is a no-brainer.

344
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:33,410
Move approval.

345
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:34,551
Second.

346
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:35,633
Any further discussion?

347
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:36,495
OIDC, sir.

348
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:36,996
Councilor Sang.

349
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:41,827
I just wanted to state how excited I am for this project.

350
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:48,312
I've known Mr. Heining since I was in high school, and all of us knew that he had a passion for this.

351
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:52,476
But it's not just a passion for brewing, it's a passion for Medford.

352
00:26:52,496 --> 00:27:04,306
Throughout the development of this project, I think we've really seen his commitment to Medford as a community and his desire to really make sure that this is a Medford business run for Medford.

353
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:08,628
in cooperation with different, you know, groups here.

354
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:14,830
And I think that's something, you know, I think this is a project that we can all be part of as a community here.

355
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,331
And I just know that so, so many people are so excited for this project.

356
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:29,914
I think a lot of your former students are going to be there on week one waiting to, you know, give you a high five as you, as this project goes into place.

357
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:31,895
Thank you, Jessica.

358
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,499
Thank you, Madam President, Max, thank you for coming down again for this.

359
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:49,023
Um, you know, a couple of months ago I put I sent out a resolution to the mayor to start a West Medford redevelopment committee, and we're still waiting for that to happen.

360
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:49,903
And I think,

361
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:56,404
This is one of the businesses that will help in the redevelopment of West Method Square.

362
00:27:57,104 --> 00:28:00,205
You've got three, four restaurants on there, this makes another one.

363
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:05,806
Hopefully your neighbor besides you will do something with that property.

364
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:14,148
I mean, I know people have been calling him to purchase the property for some kind of nice, that'd be a nice, make a nice development there, and that'll be great.

365
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:16,429
But I think, like Councilor Scott probably says,

366
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:25,460
We're taking a small business and bringing it into a small community, into a small pilot community, which is gonna help that pilot community grow.

367
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:27,741
And I thank you for your dedication.

368
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:28,601
Thank you.

369
00:28:29,302 --> 00:28:35,084
And I do just have one question that came from someone on Zoom, it's just asking if the building will be accessible and have accessible restrooms.

370
00:28:35,884 --> 00:28:36,104
Yes.

371
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:36,664
Okay.

372
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:37,524
We've already done that.

373
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,045
Yes, knowing the building and knowing requirements.

374
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:41,086
Yeah.

375
00:28:41,106 --> 00:28:42,026
Okay, any further discussion?

376
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:47,960
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

377
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,140
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

378
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:52,641
Vice President Behrs?

379
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:52,921
Yes.

380
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:54,441
Councilor Carviello?

381
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:54,881
Yes.

382
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:56,381
Councilor Collins?

383
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:56,722
Yes.

384
00:28:57,122 --> 00:28:57,662
Councilor Knight?

385
00:28:57,822 --> 00:28:58,062
Yes.

386
00:28:58,262 --> 00:28:58,882
Councilor Scarpelli?

387
00:28:58,902 --> 00:28:59,002
Yes.

388
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:00,082
Councilor Sang?

389
00:29:00,802 --> 00:29:00,982
Yes.

390
00:29:02,563 --> 00:29:03,083
President Morrell?

391
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:03,483
Yes.

392
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:05,803
Submitting the affirmative is there in the name of the motion passes.

393
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,164
Thank you so much.

394
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:12,665
Moving on to communications from the mayor.

395
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:22,884
22-461 to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding the Community Preservation Committee appropriation request.

396
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:36,078
Dear President Morrell and members of the Medford City Council, on behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following recommendations of the Community Preservation Committee requesting the appropriation of $5,000 from the CPA General Reserve

397
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:50,493
to Medford School Department for a small grant to replace playground elements at the Roberts Elementary School, requesting the appropriation of $5,000 from the CPA General Reserve to Medford School Department for a small grant to replace playground elements at the Brooks Elementary School.

398
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:54,517
The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category, General Reserve.

399
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:55,698
Thank you for your consideration.

400
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,620
Respectfully submitted, Mayor Brianna Landau-Kern.

401
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,583
I do see we have- Move approval, Madam President.

402
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:01,024
Move approval.

403
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,741
Before I do see we have Daniel Evans or Roberta Cameron from the CDA if you'd like to speak if not.

404
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:25,192
Thank you I'll just take a moment to say that the Community Preservation Committee created this small grant program so that we could provide an expedited way for small projects like this to be able to move through quickly and I'm really proud of actually how quickly Medford is able to turn money around

405
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:36,964
when little things like this crop up and it's going, it's really helpful in this situation because we'll be able to improve these playground elements before the school year starts.

406
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:40,126
So I thank you for your consideration of this.

407
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:41,126
Thank you.

408
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,227
President Behrs.

409
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:47,049
Just thank you for your hard work as a committee and Danielle for your hard work as coordinator.

410
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:47,529
Thank you.

411
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,672
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor Carvajal, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

412
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,881
Vice President Behrs?

413
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:56,961
Yes.

414
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,703
Councillor Karygiannis?

415
00:30:58,943 --> 00:30:59,163
Yes.

416
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:01,045
Councillor Collins?

417
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:01,345
Yes.

418
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:02,347
Councillor Knight?

419
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:02,767
Yes.

420
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:03,508
Councillor Scarpelli?

421
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:03,628
Yes.

422
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:04,629
Councillor Sang?

423
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:05,470
Yes.

424
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:07,452
President Morrell?

425
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:07,952
Yes.

426
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:09,174
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

427
00:31:09,194 --> 00:31:10,095
The motion passes.

428
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:13,365
Thank you.

429
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:17,128
22-462 to the Honorable President and members of the Metro City Council.

430
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:20,470
Water meter replacement project funding recommendation.

431
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:26,295
As you may be aware, the current meter system the city uses to measure and record water use is nearing its end of life.

432
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:30,678
We plan to replace the existing water meters in the city with new meters that meet the current needs.

433
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:34,501
This is a three-year project with a cost of an estimate of $8,500,000.

434
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:42,387
The Department of Public Works, DPW, prepared the following information in support of funding the water meter replacement project.

435
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:45,809
This information summarizes and documents the plan to fund this project.

436
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,572
The DPW recommends that this be funded from two sources.

437
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:56,658
The first is the MWRA Tier 2 Local Water Assistance Program, LWSAP, and the second is ARPA.

438
00:31:57,218 --> 00:32:01,502
The project is eligible for both sources and has been pre-coordinated with the MWRA program.

439
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:07,786
The MWRA program is typically used for water and sewer capital improvement projects and regulatory compliance programs.

440
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:13,090
However, these types of projects are eligible for other funding sources, including but not limited to ARPA and retained earnings.

441
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,893
The following is a recommendation funding breakdown.

442
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:19,876
The MWRA loan portion will require an approved loan order from the City Council.

443
00:32:20,476 --> 00:32:25,280
The purpose of this memo is to inform you further about the project and begin the process to obtain support from City Council.

444
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,922
$7,800,000 borrowed from the MWRA Tier 2 LWSAP program.

445
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:30,464
This is a 0% loan paid back over 10 years and $700,000 paid from ARPA.

446
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:41,392
MWRA local water system assistance program assistance program information.

447
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:45,994
This program is a 0% interest loan program that has paid off over 10 years.

448
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:49,035
The city currently has phase two and phase three funding available.

449
00:32:49,555 --> 00:32:51,516
Phase two will only be available through the end of 2023.

450
00:32:51,616 --> 00:33:00,160
The tier two portion of this project is a restricted amount of funding within each phase that can be spent on certain types of projects such as meter replacements.

451
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,904
The breakdowns of each phase and available restricted tier two funds are below.

452
00:33:05,044 --> 00:33:06,185
Phase two total available is $3,662,000.

453
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:07,567
Phase two tier two available is $2,518,006 of the total.

454
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:09,328
Phase three total available is $5,400,000.

455
00:33:09,368 --> 00:33:11,851
Phase three tier three available is $5,370,526 of the total.

456
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,625
Total available for a tier two restricted amount is $7,888,532.

457
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:36,509
This recommendation includes using most of the phase two tier two available funds leaving $1,143,994 available for other eligible projects and using $5,281,994 from the phase three tier two available funds leaving $88,532 for other eligible projects.

458
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,826
There are other projects we would typically target MWRA, LWSAP for funding.

459
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:59,788
However, they are also eligible for other available sources.

460
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:07,011
Due to the smaller size of these projects, they're more appropriate for either ARPA retained earnings or remaining funds from MWRA, potentially other sources.

461
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:13,375
Water and Soil Superintendent Dan Stoneking and Head Meteor Technician Ron Baker will be available to answer questions on this important project.

462
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:15,476
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

463
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:17,417
Respectfully submitted, Mayor Brianna Leno-Kirk.

464
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:19,458
President Paris.

465
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:20,739
Thank you, Madam President.

466
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:24,164
Thank you for being here.

467
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:26,965
Sounds like a big, exciting project.

468
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,926
A lot of work ahead of you.

469
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:33,928
I just want to confirm a couple things, just so I know exactly what we're talking about tonight.

470
00:34:35,428 --> 00:34:44,472
The letter says that there's the MWR loan portion will require an approved loan order from the city council, so that would be coming later that's not this paper tonight.

471
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:49,195
And then my only other question is related to that.

472
00:34:51,035 --> 00:35:00,558
Do we know how much this would increase the annual water sewer bond borrowing amount by like how much more we'd be paying a year after we took out that loan order?

473
00:35:00,638 --> 00:35:02,658
Is that a question that we'd want to answer at a later date?

474
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:04,659
We'd want to answer that at a later date.

475
00:35:05,632 --> 00:35:05,852
Okay.

476
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:06,852
Yeah, that's fine.

477
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:11,314
Just as we're starting the process, that's going to be a question I'll have down the road.

478
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:14,395
This seems like it's has to be done.

479
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:15,295
It has to happen.

480
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:21,197
So, you know, I have no objections, but those would be my questions just considering the financial transition of the city.

481
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:31,521
And I know this would be on the enterprise side, so it would be a little bit different, but just want to make sure we have everything in a needed place to actually fund everything over the 10 year period.

482
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:32,161
Thank you.

483
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:33,533
Thank you very much.

484
00:35:33,593 --> 00:35:35,914
If I could also just get name and address for the record for both of you.

485
00:35:36,554 --> 00:35:41,195
Yes, my name is Dan something the water superintendent and my address.

486
00:35:41,635 --> 00:35:44,696
I'm just your like your Medford City Hall.

487
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:47,317
Okay, great.

488
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:49,878
The water rates didn't come out yet.

489
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:53,459
I'm the water meter and billing specialist for the city.

490
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,719
I'm at 21 James Street.

491
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,220
Thank you both

492
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:04,179
Governor Kamara, the chair of the Water and Sewer Commission, I strongly support everything these two gentlemen are going to be proposing tonight.

493
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:05,981
Thank you.

494
00:36:06,341 --> 00:36:07,302
Thank you, Madam President.

495
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:09,785
Thank you for coming up here for this thing.

496
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:13,869
So the $8.5 million that does the whole city?

497
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,671
Yes, yes.

498
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:16,732
Even the commercial also?

499
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:17,753
Yes, yes.

500
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:20,136
And how long do we anticipate this?

501
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:20,957
When will it start?

502
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:23,365
How long do you think before we get done?

503
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:28,955
We would like to start sooner than later, just due to the age of the meters and the need.

504
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:38,058
we will start as soon as funding is available, which the funding will be available with the council's approval.

505
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:45,602
We need the MWRA loan, which is requesting your approval.

506
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:46,743
It's 0%, correct?

507
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:50,465
0%, 10 years, so it'd be about $780,000 per year annually that we would pay.

508
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:57,709
So is that the maximum that we could borrow, was it 78 in a row, 78, I'm sorry, 78 in a row?

509
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,610
Of the MWRA tier two?

510
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:00,670
That was the maximum?

511
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:00,851
Funding?

512
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,271
That's the max that can be used for meters in the system.

513
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:14,535
And is there any discussion about increasing the, maybe getting meters for the outside watering, for the outside meters for people to do outside watering?

514
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:22,710
I know some other cities and towns have different systems that they use.

515
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:32,559
I think someone in Revere told me that they have something that goes on their faucet outside and then you turn it into the air and they bill you for what you used all year.

516
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,909
We don't use that format.

517
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:43,730
We actually install the irrigation meters where the original meter is, so that anything going through that irrigation meter can go outside.

518
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:50,392
Anybody can apply if they have an in-ground irrigation system, and we separate it.

519
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:53,833
And again, let's say, you're right-handed to have an irrigation system, right?

520
00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:54,813
You can't just water your lawn.

521
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:55,373
Correct.

522
00:37:55,773 --> 00:38:01,895
So you'd have to put a $5,000 or $6,000 investment into your front lawn in order to get the benefit of the- That's the current rule, yes.

523
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:06,359
Again, I know there's something that's overdue and needed.

524
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,141
I support it 100%.

525
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:07,501
Thank you.

526
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:07,742
Thank you.

527
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:09,965
Councilor Collins.

528
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,081
Thank you, thank you so much for being here.

529
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,862
Councilor Kerrio already got to one of my questions.

530
00:38:15,922 --> 00:38:19,984
I was gonna ask, you know, with a 0% loan, why stop at $7.8 million?

531
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:24,626
But if that's the cap, as I understand it to be from your response, then that makes sense.

532
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:38,032
And then for my benefit, and perhaps for other less water meter savvy listeners at home, reading this, it sounds like phase refers to the phase of the project, tier refers to project specific

533
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:40,593
Buckets of funding, is that correct?

534
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:42,793
Is that the difference between phase two and tier two?

535
00:38:42,813 --> 00:38:45,734
It's the way that the MWRA gives out loans.

536
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:52,076
So they have different phases, which is time, year one, year two, year three.

537
00:38:53,156 --> 00:39:04,800
The tier two, phase two funding, which is a good portion of the $7.8 million, will be sunsetting at the end of fiscal 2023.

538
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,061
So it'll go away if the city does not use it.

539
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:11,529
So the tier represents when that particular bucket of money expires?

540
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,771
Tier two is what it can be used for.

541
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:15,994
The phase is the time.

542
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:16,835
I see.

543
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:17,656
Thank you.

544
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:19,037
Appreciate that clarification.

545
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:21,520
Councilor Knight.

546
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,021
A couple of questions.

547
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:27,186
I don't think either one of you gentlemen, we had the last time that we went through a meter replacement.

548
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:31,849
I came and was part of the cleanup.

549
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,710
I cleaned it up.

550
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,511
It was a mess, right?

551
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:35,953
I was brought in in 2007.

552
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:39,575
I actually finished the project, what was left over.

553
00:39:39,695 --> 00:39:43,919
There was quite a bit of, I guess, problems surrounding that.

554
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,601
Now, listen, I understand we need to get the work done.

555
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:51,264
I understand that we're getting 7.8 million bucks for free pretty much, right?

556
00:39:51,324 --> 00:39:53,226
I mean, we just have to pay it back, but we're getting it at 0%.

557
00:39:56,197 --> 00:40:00,880
What's the plan to make sure that what happened last time doesn't happen again when we go through this process?

558
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,141
Yeah, I would say.

559
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:07,843
So one of the big problems with the first go around.

560
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,485
Why don't we just explain that, what some of the big problems with the first go around.

561
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,286
The first go around was estimation.

562
00:40:13,026 --> 00:40:13,967
Estimation of accounts.

563
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:20,770
And the faster we can get started on this, the less estimations that we will have to send out.

564
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,932
And the reason for estimations was because of outdated equipment that was given less than accurate readings?

565
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:25,633
Correct.

566
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:34,312
Um, and we're running into that now and the maintenance is becoming a problem where we, we have a small staff.

567
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,494
We weren't meant to install the whole system.

568
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:45,901
So what we're trying to do is we're getting to a crossroads where we either do a big overhaul and we're not fit to do that.

569
00:40:46,762 --> 00:40:52,947
So we want to do the whole system at once, get everybody on it, you know, a hundred percent accurate playing field.

570
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:53,948
Um,

571
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:59,486
which will stabilize the enterprise accounts and the rates going forward.

572
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:04,328
And we're at a point now where there's so many to be changed.

573
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:10,569
We've been maintaining the whole time, but we were at a point where we wanted to decide.

574
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:11,970
I approached the mayor and said, Mayor,

575
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:16,024
you know, there's better systems out there that do more.

576
00:41:16,805 --> 00:41:21,248
So what we're looking into is what else can the meter systems give us?

577
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:24,150
Not only just read the meters.

578
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:24,991
Leak detection.

579
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:30,295
So the new meters that we're looking at right now have built in leak detection inside the meter.

580
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:35,038
So everybody's house will be helping monitor the community.

581
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:39,001
And if your house lights up and his house lights up and you guys are right side by side,

582
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:42,730
Dan will know to send his crew in between those two houses.

583
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,574
There may be a water main break or a service leak.

584
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:53,315
So we're just trying to improve what we have as we come to a crossroads because we have so much to change.

585
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:57,358
It's, do we stay with the system or do we go with what's out there now?

586
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,162
So last time, I think part of the problem that we ran into was that there was a lot of inaction, right?

587
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:02,643
We didn't make up our minds as to what we wanted to do.

588
00:42:02,663 --> 00:42:03,003
Correct.

589
00:42:03,163 --> 00:42:08,348
And then we fell into a spot where the meters were at the spot where they needed to be done and they needed to be done immediately.

590
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:08,628
Right.

591
00:42:08,808 --> 00:42:10,149
And we're not at that spot right now.

592
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:17,656
with some assurances that if we get this project done and we do it in a timely fashion, that we won't run into the same problems that we've had.

593
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:23,638
With the lifespan of the new meters, we're taking out a $7.8 million loan that's going to be paid back over 10 years.

594
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,700
The system that was put in place in 2005 was a mechanical meter.

595
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:38,345
The average lifespan before it should be replaced is like 11 years, because they start to lose function, lose calibration in favor of the customer.

596
00:42:39,212 --> 00:42:40,873
then the rates have to go up a little bit, right?

597
00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:41,894
To compensate.

598
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:45,296
The new meters that we're putting in are ultrasonic.

599
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,616
They have no moving parts.

600
00:42:47,217 --> 00:42:48,177
They don't break down.

601
00:42:49,038 --> 00:42:50,859
They're said to last 20 plus years.

602
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:57,623
So we're going to be getting leak detection, no breakdown of accuracy for 20 years.

603
00:42:57,963 --> 00:42:59,063
And then we're going to pay the loan off in 10.

604
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,524
So we're going to get 10 years for free.

605
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:01,285
Yeah.

606
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,366
So one of the goals was unaccounted for water.

607
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:19,254
And Dan came onto the committee when we were looking and researching the meters, and he found this meter really crucial to his operations, trying to keep the water in the pipes and finding leaks when they happen.

608
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:27,129
The paper that's before us this evening is nothing more than an informational paper, if I'm not understanding it.

609
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:28,169
Maybe that's what it looks like, right?

610
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:36,992
We wanted to come forward to you guys today and ask the council what questions you have from us before we approach you for signing off on the funding.

611
00:43:37,552 --> 00:43:40,654
Has the city applied for the loan and have they been deemed eligible for the loan?

612
00:43:41,134 --> 00:43:41,994
We are eligible.

613
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:45,435
I've been in queue for a while now with the MWRA.

614
00:43:45,476 --> 00:43:48,677
I've been going back and forth with the representative from the MWRA.

615
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:50,197
We're ready to go.

616
00:43:52,868 --> 00:43:56,529
it has to go through bond council and through city council with approval.

617
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:58,970
That's my next question.

618
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,391
So we need to approve you to put the application in?

619
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:02,991
Correct.

620
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:03,852
Okay.

621
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:05,552
That's what the MWRA wants from us.

622
00:44:05,692 --> 00:44:09,793
I can see why, because they're not going to give you the money and then have you come back here and then us not approve it.

623
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:10,574
That would make sense.

624
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:12,214
Okay.

625
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:12,894
Thank you.

626
00:44:14,055 --> 00:44:15,755
President Behrs and then back to Councilor Collins.

627
00:44:15,975 --> 00:44:16,416
Thank you.

628
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:18,396
You answered my question about the lifespan.

629
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:20,017
So that's helpful to understand.

630
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:22,795
Just to clarify what Councilor Knight said.

631
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:32,477
So you want us to approve this paper tonight and that'll initiate the process and then you'll come back with the loan order or we have to approve the loan order before you get- The next meeting.

632
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:40,519
We would like to be on the next meeting for the first hearing of the first three or four that it needs to go through for votes.

633
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,700
And after that, it's just bond council and you guys signing off.

634
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,581
Yeah, so that was kind of where I was going.

635
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:51,990
Our next meeting is September 13th.

636
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:59,054
So just make sure I work with the clerk and the mayor in advance to make sure papers on the agenda.

637
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:03,736
And if you guys have any further questions for us, you know, we'll come and answer.

638
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:04,296
Great.

639
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:06,838
Can we just offer that in the form of a motion that the mayor initiate the process?

640
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:07,658
Sure.

641
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,900
Do I have a second on that motion?

642
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:12,541
Second.

643
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:14,482
Second by Vice Mayor Behrs.

644
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:24,580
And then just to the point about our next meeting, if for whatever reason, the process, you do need it sooner, we can call it, we can call a special meeting if we need to, if you need to move that sooner.

645
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,481
So just work with the clerk on anything related to that.

646
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:29,382
Councilor Collins.

647
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:31,402
Thank you.

648
00:45:31,422 --> 00:45:40,826
Yeah, on the point of this being advanced notice ahead of the loan approval, I just wanted to say that from one councilor's perspective, you know, having the opportunity to ask questions before we vote on it is very helpful.

649
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:44,867
So I really appreciate the coming before us tonight, the foresight, it's very helpful.

650
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:45,783
Thank you.

651
00:45:46,863 --> 00:45:47,684
Any further discussion?

652
00:45:50,185 --> 00:46:00,828
So we have a motion from Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carviello, and the language on that is that the mayor initiate the process on a loan.

653
00:46:00,888 --> 00:46:03,609
Is that, represent your motion Councilor Knight?

654
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:04,529
Yes.

655
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:08,691
Great, so on the motion Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

656
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:10,991
Vice President Behrs?

00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:11,312
Yes.

658
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:12,472
Councilor Carviello?

659
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:12,912
Yes.

660
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:14,033

Councilor Knight?

663
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:16,507

664
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:16,727

Councilor Singh.

666
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:18,669
Yes.

667
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:20,691
President Morrell.

668
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:21,232
Yes.

669
00:46:21,472 --> 00:46:23,434
Senator Inferno is here on the negative, the motion passes.

670
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,696
Thank you all.

671
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:25,457
Thank you.

672
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:28,220
Do I, oh, sorry, we have one more.

673
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,024

676
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:02,455
seeks compensation for injuries suffered as a result of a street defect at 26 Harvard Avenue in Medford, Massachusetts.

677
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:10,021
As a result, the claimant suffered permanent injuries to her right shoulder, rendering her partially disabled, and injuries to her forehead, eyes, and nose.

678
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,602
The case was settled prior to trial.

679
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:13,604
The necessary lease has been obtained from the claimant.

680
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:15,466
Breakdown of amount requested.

681
00:47:15,526 --> 00:47:17,047

686

Councillor Knight.

687
00:47:24,188 --> 00:47:29,370
Madam President, it's my understanding that $5,000 is the maximum award an individual can receive on a slip and fall in a public way.

688
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:39,792
It also appears that the necessary releases were signed and that the city is now, I guess, making this individual whole pursuant to the claim that's before it.

689
00:47:39,832 --> 00:47:42,913
I've moved for approval to pay, but so let me close the matter out and get Ms.

690
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,974
Rooney the compensation that she deserves.

691
00:47:45,254 --> 00:47:45,874
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

692
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:46,774

President Morrell.

710
00:48:12,112 --> 00:48:12,292

712

713
00:48:20,454 --> 00:48:23,415
On the motion of Councilor Kerrio, to revert to regular order of business, seconded by

714
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:26,643

Yes.

717
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:38,191
Councilor Kerrio?

718
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:38,551

719
00:48:39,192 --> 00:48:39,832

00:48:41,173 --> 00:48:41,493
Yes.

723
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:42,954
Councilor Scarpelli?

724
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:43,395
Absent.

725
00:48:44,596 --> 00:48:45,136
Councilor Sang?

726
00:48:45,897 --> 00:48:46,117
Yes.

727
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:47,838
President Morrell?

728
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:47,918
Yes.

729
00:48:48,454 --> 00:48:51,615
Yes, 16 in front of one absent, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

730
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:54,116
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

731
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:55,596
22-416 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

732
00:48:56,356 --> 00:49:05,819
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Liquor Commission discuss the formula for bar seating at restaurants in Medford from a maximum of 25 to a higher number to be determined by the commission.

733
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:06,680
Councilor Carvalho.

734
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,820
Thank you, Madam President.

735
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:14,042
This is something that I was asked to do maybe about 20 plus years ago by then,

736
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:19,865
Mayor McGlynn, when the seating requirements for the city of Medford and no bars was 250.

737
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:26,128
And over the years, it's gotten all the way down to a reasonable number that everyone is so comfortable.

738
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:28,830
But over the years, times have changed again.

739
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,232
And I think some of the audiences need to change also.

740
00:49:32,852 --> 00:49:42,858
And we have a maximum seating at a bar, which if I'm not mistaken, it's 15% of your seating that doesn't count the bar in.

741
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:48,367
As times change, people like to sit at the bar and eat.

742
00:49:48,807 --> 00:49:52,308
Yes, they drink too, but if you're a single person, you sit at the bar and eat.

743
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:54,869
A lot of people don't like chairs, don't like sitting at tables.

744
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:56,569
They enjoy sitting at the bar watching TV.

745
00:49:57,029 --> 00:50:10,854
And I'd like the Liquor Commission to maybe come up with a new formula to increase bar seating for the restaurants in the city of Medford from 25 up to whatever number that they deem necessary.

746
00:50:12,032 --> 00:50:19,876
It's just the changing of the times, changing of people's dining habits and just an update of their ordinances.

747
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:22,317
So I would hope that something that they will look into.

748
00:50:22,337 --> 00:50:24,038
Thank you, Councilor Caraballo.

749
00:50:24,218 --> 00:50:24,878
Councilor Collins.

750
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:26,198
Thank you.

751
00:50:26,218 --> 00:50:29,240
Yeah, I just want to thank Councilor Caraballo for putting this on the agenda.

752
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,281
I think that it's really normal.

753
00:50:31,321 --> 00:50:36,463
It's really healthy for us to reevaluate the ordinances that guide what our hospitality industries can do.

754
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:40,645
And, you know, I've put things on the agenda in recent months to try and

755
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:51,086
see how we can work with the Liquor Commission, work with our economic development director to see what needs to change so that our bars and our restaurants specifically can thrive in our square.

756
00:50:51,186 --> 00:51:04,172
So I hope that we can collaborate with the Liquor Commission and other relevant departments to see what needs to be changed and then go about changing it so that our business owners can cater to what people are looking for and do even better.

757
00:51:04,492 --> 00:51:04,772
Thank you.

758
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:06,513
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

759
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:07,293
Councilor Nye.

760
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,735
Madam President, yes, thank you to Councilor Caviello for bringing this up.

761
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,723
You know, this request is really in line with what we're seeing around the community and in neighboring communities.

762
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:22,229
If you look at some of the newly opened establishments, my question as to whether or not the ratio is exactly what's been put out through way of ordinance.

763
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:22,689
You know what I mean?

764
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:25,171
If you look at some of the newer establishments, there's a lot of bar seating.

765
00:51:25,492 --> 00:51:26,713
That doesn't include outdoor seating.

766
00:51:27,073 --> 00:51:28,694
It only includes indoor seats.

767
00:51:29,175 --> 00:51:31,937
So I think this is something that's really in line with the practice.

768
00:51:32,677 --> 00:51:35,119
It's also in line with what we're seeing in neighboring communities.

769
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,081
Councilor Caviello makes a good point.

770
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:38,482
People like to sit at bars,

771
00:51:40,248 --> 00:51:44,230
Restaurants also like to have that model because it allows them to cut down the amount of staff that they have.

772
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,911
So they can have one person serves multiple day of multiple people from one location.

773
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:53,654
So it's also an operational issue and an operational efficiency.

774
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:57,235
So with that being said, I support the resolution or item we have a second motion.

775
00:51:57,955 --> 00:52:03,538
I also wanted to thank councilor Caraballo for putting this on the agenda.

776
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:16,195
This is straightforward, it's logical, it's a modernization update that if we want to revive our businesses, if we want to help our restaurant industry, this is one of the steps that we can take.

777
00:52:16,555 --> 00:52:29,240
And I think it will also make Medford a more attractive place for people to come if there's more seating, if there's more availability, if there's more of a feeling of liveliness in our restaurants.

778
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,260
and bars.

779
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:36,863
Um, you know, this is exactly the type of steps steps that I think we need to take in the city.

780
00:52:37,303 --> 00:52:39,844
So I want wanted to thank my colleague.

781
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:48,867
Thank you, Councillor say any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Carviello seconded by Councilor Knight.

782
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:50,068
Mr Clerk, please call the roll.

783
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:53,989
Vice President Bears.

784
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:55,490
Yes, Councilor Carviello.

785
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,110
Yes, Councilor Collins.

786
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,711
Yes, Councilor Knight.

787
00:52:59,344 --> 00:52:59,624
Yes.

788
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:04,326
Councilor Sang?

789
00:53:05,206 --> 00:53:05,406
Yes.

790
00:53:06,926 --> 00:53:07,547
President Morrell?

791
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:08,107
Yes.

792
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:10,087
Six in the affirmative, one absent, zero in the negative.

793
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:10,928
The motion passes.

794
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:20,170
22-421, offered by Councilor Carviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the parking director appear before the council to explain why parking kiosks are not accepting cash or credit cards.

795
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,411
Councilor Carviello.

796
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,091
Thank you, Madam President.

797
00:53:22,151 --> 00:53:28,313
I'm a little disappointed we don't have anybody from the parking commission here to discuss this, knowing this is on the agenda.

798
00:53:31,092 --> 00:53:32,793
Many of our machines don't take coins.

799
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:37,754
They don't take credit cards with signs on them saying, you know, find another kiosk.

800
00:53:38,274 --> 00:53:41,354
But I think most of them, they want you to go on the app.

801
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,295
Not everybody has the app to go onto.

802
00:53:46,655 --> 00:53:53,297
I think that this is something that wasn't very well thought out.

803
00:53:53,377 --> 00:53:55,157
These kiosks that we have, they're old.

804
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:57,296
and they need to be changed.

805
00:53:57,737 --> 00:54:03,643
And I know that's going down, that's in the plans to buy new meters.

806
00:54:03,683 --> 00:54:10,770
I think we just were taking about half a million dollars MAPA funds, which was questionable to me, to buy parking meters.

807
00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:19,228
These kiosks that we have, either shut them off or fix them so they work.

808
00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:23,492
Because right now we have a parking commission that's out of control in the city.

809
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:29,637
Tagging all over the place, tagging neighborhoods, tagging for 12 inches from the curb, tagging.

810
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:35,963
I mean, you're supposed to have plate readers on these cars to read the cars, so no one cars are registered, not registered.

811
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:37,064
People are just getting tickets.

812
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:41,948
Like I said, there's not a day that goes by that I don't get a phone call regarding a parking matter.

813
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:45,432
And I think my other councilors probably gave them too.

814
00:54:45,772 --> 00:54:59,855
So I mean, I think this is something, I don't know what subcommittee this would go to for further discussion going forward to talk about the parking departments and see what changes I think need to be made.

815
00:54:59,915 --> 00:55:07,676
I think it's been up and running and I feel that some things are working and some things aren't.

816
00:55:08,177 --> 00:55:10,117
So I'd like to refer this to

817
00:55:10,865 --> 00:55:19,252
If you want to refer to economic development, if you want to refer to me the whole I did speak with the director and she said she would be available in September.

818
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:21,814
If you want to refer to a community hold on the line, that'd be great.

819
00:55:21,934 --> 00:55:31,683
If we have a particular subcommittee you want to refer to but I think that um, I think we need to have a discussion with the department right now to discuss a lot of the issues that are happening.

820
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:37,167
Actually, I think I brought up one of the biggest problems is the appeal process.

821
00:55:38,223 --> 00:55:44,845
People are getting denied for a lot of times, not a good reason, and they're telling them, oh, don't appeal it to the state.

822
00:55:45,065 --> 00:55:50,946
Well, it's $200 and change to appeal a $25 ticket, whether you win or lose.

823
00:55:51,506 --> 00:55:53,987
So again, some of these things just don't make sense.

824
00:55:54,627 --> 00:55:56,408
And I think you're right.

825
00:55:57,348 --> 00:56:05,230
Whenever you're ready to call it to me, I think there's something that should be discussed and a suggestion made, maybe some change should be made.

826
00:56:06,313 --> 00:56:06,593
Thank you.

827
00:56:07,053 --> 00:56:08,874
President Behrs and Councilor Knight.

828
00:56:08,914 --> 00:56:09,754
Thank you, Madam President.

829
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,536
Considering that I'd be happy to make the motion to send this to Committee of the Whole.

830
00:56:15,616 --> 00:56:19,377
And if we're gonna have a committee discussion on this further, then I don't have any further comment at this time.

831
00:56:19,397 --> 00:56:19,857
Thank you.

832
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:21,838
Councilor Knight.

833
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:22,878
Madam President, thank you very much.

834
00:56:22,918 --> 00:56:32,141
I think the easiest answer to this question is, you know, why have the kiosk accepting change credit cards is because we don't have the capacity as a community time to take this endeavor at this point in time.

835
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:39,824
I think it was fully rolled out and it was not necessarily the best business decision the city could have made.

836
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:54,571
But one of my biggest concerns that I had said when we looked at the revenue forecast previous years was that I'd hate to see the revenue deficit being made up from the backs of the residents of this community through pocket tickets.

837
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:04,082
And if we're gonna have hypervigilant parking enforcement offices, we have to give the people in this community a chance to be able to pay when they want to.

838
00:57:04,162 --> 00:57:10,003
And I'd say walk 500 feet or 600 feet or 700 feet out of the business district that you're in to find another kiosk.

839
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:12,683
I don't think that makes a lot of sense.

840
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:16,364
And I really do think that this does focus around economic development and revenue.

841
00:57:17,504 --> 00:57:20,445
So this is something that definitely warrants a good hot book.

842
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,065
And I thank the council for bringing it up in the second motion.

843
00:57:24,585 --> 00:57:25,845
Thank you for the discussion.

844
00:57:27,686 --> 00:57:32,867
So on the motion of Councilor Carvillo to send us to agree the whole and seconded by Councilor Knight.

845
00:57:33,988 --> 00:57:35,168
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

846
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:38,109
Vice-President Bares.

847
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:38,629
Yes.

848
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,089
Councilor Carvillo.

849
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:40,530
Yes.

850
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:41,630
Councilor Collins.

851
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:41,990
Yes.

852
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:42,830
Councilor Knight.

853
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:43,330
Yes.

854
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,271
Councilor Scarpelli.

855
00:57:44,391 --> 00:57:44,631
Yes.

856
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:45,751
Councilor Sang.

857
00:57:46,591 --> 00:57:46,791
Yes.

858
00:57:48,692 --> 00:57:49,152
President Morrell.

859
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:52,063
Yes, so in the furnace during the night of the motion passes.

860
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:56,464
22-439 offered by Vice-President Behrs and Councilor Collins.

861
00:57:56,904 --> 00:58:00,745
So this was an item that was tabled to the next meeting from our July meeting.

862
00:58:00,765 --> 00:58:04,106
Vice-President Behrs.

863
00:58:04,326 --> 00:58:13,289
Motion to refer to a future committee of the whole revenue with the committee of the whole meeting with the mayor and her staff regarding the revenue situation and budget deficit.

864
00:58:15,297 --> 00:58:44,202
on the motion of vice-president berries to refer to the appointment of president it was my understanding that the paper had to be passed before august 8th for it to make the ballot um the revenue is going to be the revenue uh so these figures wouldn't necessarily reflect any accurate data or data points for us to have a informed discussion on it um you know if we get better revenue figures maybe then we could take a look at something but at this point you know i think that it's a little bit premature to keep a paper open on an override proposition based on override figures that are going to be

865
00:58:45,437 --> 00:58:49,538
out of date, and it would be my recommendation to have a paper received in place.

866
00:58:50,758 --> 00:58:51,418
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

867
00:58:53,419 --> 00:58:54,039
Councilor Collins.

868
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,119
Thank you, President Morrell and Councilor Knight.

869
00:58:57,139 --> 00:58:58,560
I think that point is well taken.

870
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:09,502
I was going to second the motion to send it to Committee of the Whole for a hypothetical future meeting on revenue with the expectation that, you know, when this meeting might occur, we can amend the paper.

871
00:59:11,603 --> 00:59:15,566
if we were to put the paper forward, speaking in very hypothetical terms here.

872
00:59:17,127 --> 00:59:24,413
In my mind, it's more of a placeholder move for now with the hope that we can have substantial future discussions on revenue with the mayor's office.

873
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:26,335
And that's all, thank you.

874
00:59:26,815 --> 00:59:27,455
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

875
00:59:27,475 --> 00:59:28,056
Vice Mayor Behrs.

876
00:59:28,076 --> 00:59:31,459
I mean, considering that this is the only

877
00:59:32,883 --> 00:59:39,344
substantive official proposal proposed by anybody to address the ongoing budget deficit issue.

878
00:59:40,024 --> 00:59:45,926
And it received an official response from the mayor, essentially validating its concerns, but not its scope.

879
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:49,466
I think it's a starting point for the discussion that needs to be had.

880
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,087
So that's why I would send it to Committee of the Whole.

881
00:59:54,047 --> 00:59:55,408
If the numbers change, the numbers change.

882
00:59:56,168 --> 00:59:57,508
We've been completely open

883
00:59:58,814 --> 01:00:01,316
We'd love to know the actual figures that we're in.

884
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:15,846
I think we've been really consistent about that for the last eight, nine months that we would really love to know where we are and not be, you know, piecing together the information that we received piecemeal and trying to figure it out ourselves.

885
01:00:16,206 --> 01:00:20,489
But that's where we've been left by the actions of the administration.

886
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:24,112
So, you know, if the numbers change, the numbers change.

887
01:00:24,152 --> 01:00:25,132
I have no problem with that.

888
01:00:27,062 --> 01:00:29,564
This is the only official proposal that's been made by anyone.

889
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:49,361
The mayor did issue a press release that had some sort of response and well, can no longer move forward because the deadlines that passed for the November ballot, it is still a starting point for discussion and the closest thing we have to an official starting point.

890
01:00:49,902 --> 01:00:51,363
I do hope that changes in the future.

891
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:52,124
Thank you.

892
01:00:54,023 --> 01:00:56,124
The reason I say this is because the paper doesn't make sense.

893
01:00:56,164 --> 01:01:00,626
If you look at what it says at the end, it says, from this assessment, the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2023.

894
01:01:00,906 --> 01:01:04,607
The deadline to make that was August 8th, according to Council of Business presentation.

895
01:01:05,067 --> 01:01:07,088
So the paper's dead on arrival already.

896
01:01:07,988 --> 01:01:11,790
If the issue is that you want to have a conversation about revenues, we already have a paper that's on the agenda.

897
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:15,411
We've been asking the mayor to come and present to us quarterly as to what the revenue picture is.

898
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:17,212
We set the tax rate in December.

899
01:01:18,396 --> 01:01:20,697
You know, that's when we should really be stopped.

900
01:01:20,818 --> 01:01:22,639
That's when we should really start talking about this.

901
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:25,140
When we set the tax rate in December to fund the budget that we just passed.

902
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:27,702
Thank you, Councilor Naye.

903
01:01:28,983 --> 01:01:29,823
Any further discussion?

904
01:01:32,405 --> 01:01:35,106
So on the motion of Vice Chair Sam Paris to refer this paper.

905
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:39,689
And I just want to be clear, this is a motion to send this for further discussion.

906
01:01:39,709 --> 01:01:42,431
None of this just cannot be put on the November ballot.

907
01:01:42,451 --> 01:01:43,672
I just want to make that clear.

908
01:01:43,692 --> 01:01:45,533
Name and address for the record, please.

909
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:52,143
There you go.

910
01:01:52,163 --> 01:01:52,863
Okay, thanks.

911
01:01:52,923 --> 01:01:53,544
Can you hear me now?

912
01:01:53,564 --> 01:01:55,164
I feel like I'm in a Verizon commercial.

913
01:01:57,524 --> 01:02:18,989
Thank you for taking time tonight to go through some of these important issues, especially with the meters, et cetera, because I was going to ask Mr. Kamara before he left and I forgot, does anyone know the last time, and I'm going to get onto the subject now, the meters were done, were they not too long ago, Adam?

914
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:25,377
I believe Mr Baker said that the project started in 2005 and ended in 2007 and that the machines had a 15 year shelf life.

915
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:27,298
I missed the beginning of that sentence, thank you.

916
01:02:27,438 --> 01:02:33,521
The machines had a 15 year shelf life, we're coming up on year 15 at the end of the next fiscal year and some of the machines are starting to fail already.

917
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:45,668
Okay, I'm coming tonight because we've reiterated some of the pros and cons of the important issue that was brought up about 12 million dollars to be gained from future taxes in about a year.

918
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:48,529
Even if it goes to community of the whole, which

919
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,350
I don't really wouldn't even move for that.

920
01:02:52,571 --> 01:03:02,233
I'm thinking, how many people has anyone done the research and how many homeowners lost their jobs in the city, due to covert or other extenuating circumstances.

921
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:14,356
How many people have not even been paid their rent, there have been some realtors who have come in support of landlords, some of them have not even didn't receive rent for over a year.

922
01:03:15,657 --> 01:03:20,661
And then going back a little bit because some of you who were not on the council at the time.

923
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:30,010
We're not participating in the three year discussion for many of us would actually not see the need for a new library but it passed.

924
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:36,034
You're supposed to be having eyes for the future, but also could happen.

925
01:03:36,654 --> 01:03:42,457
So I really don't think this is a really time to be imposing a $12 million.

926
01:03:42,657 --> 01:03:48,841
Another, you know, induction into the city, going on the taxpayers again.

927
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:57,546
So, with those ideas in mind, I think that you really maybe have to do a little bit more homework.

928
01:03:58,426 --> 01:04:00,508
before pushing this forward again.

929
01:04:00,528 --> 01:04:03,511
I don't just don't think that the timing is very good.

930
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:05,613
Thank you for your time.

931
01:04:05,873 --> 01:04:16,683
We also have to remember those people who own two and three family homes, who would just now my myself, getting into some chores and playing catch up because of the inflation so it just

932
01:04:17,712 --> 01:04:21,996
main, I don't think it's the only way to improve the city and to gain revenue.

933
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:24,599
So maybe if this is postponed for a while.

934
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:33,948
The seven of you with your keen heads might be able to come up with some really good ideas to get a mean use of income.

935
01:04:34,149 --> 01:04:34,389
Thanks.

936
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:35,495
Thank you.

937
01:04:35,835 --> 01:04:42,296
And again, I just want to make sure this is clear that this isn't something that can appear or would appear on the November ballot.

938
01:04:42,316 --> 01:04:44,017
This is just, one moment.

939
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:47,197
This is just being sent to a committee of the whole for discussion.

940
01:04:47,377 --> 01:04:49,538
There's no action items at this time.

941
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:52,318
It does not meet deadlines to be on the November ballot.

942
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:53,398
So I just want to make that clear.

943
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:55,619
Please just name and address for the record, please.

944
01:04:58,579 --> 01:04:59,120
Good evening.

945
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,280
My name is Paul Garrity.

946
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,220
I live at Cedar Road.

947
01:05:02,157 --> 01:05:04,357
I want to thank you councilors for your hard work.

948
01:05:05,018 --> 01:05:28,962
And I was sitting out here saying, is it, what I wanted to ask tonight, is there any way that we can get a sense of whether or not the council might support, if the mayor came forward with a proposal to fund an independent audit, is there any support around this council to start there to really find out where we are, so that as we proceed towards next year's budget, we're not fighting with each other, but really start to put a plan in place,

949
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:39,204
to know what our true deliverables are based upon state mandates, city ordinances, contractual obligations, to see what do we have to deliver?

950
01:05:39,224 --> 01:05:40,785
How is it being delivered?

951
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:41,965
Is there a better way to deliver it?

952
01:05:42,646 --> 01:05:53,653
And have this done by a professional independent, like Price Waterhouse, KPMG, I mean, somebody who could really give you people the information you need, and then allow it to become the basis of a body of knowledge that we can use going forward.

953
01:05:53,813 --> 01:05:59,096
So I'm just curious whether or not we might be able to have some kind of sense of feeling of, with the council support,

954
01:05:59,925 --> 01:06:01,806
A lot of information.

955
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:08,270
That was something that was proposed by me, I think, two months ago for an independent outside audit to be done in the city.

956
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:13,734
As of today, we've not received any response to that request.

957
01:06:14,514 --> 01:06:17,376
You are correct, that's something that should be done every so often.

958
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:28,445
a recommendation that a council asking say $300,000 to bring in a real heavyweight to do it.

959
01:06:29,006 --> 01:06:39,276
I'm trying to get a feel for whether it's worth my time to write a letter to the mayor and say, look, you need to send a letter to the council saying, you need to ask for this kind of money so we can really start the process and get off the dime.

960
01:06:39,897 --> 01:06:40,497
Thank you.

961
01:06:40,557 --> 01:06:44,982
I believe we're all supported Councilor Caviello with that motion, so.

962
01:06:47,124 --> 01:06:47,324
Thank you.

963
01:06:47,444 --> 01:06:48,145
Any further discussion?

964
01:06:50,194 --> 01:07:03,685
on the motion of us, Madam President, just reiterate that the paper is in order to place on the ballot for the 11 23 election, an override question that had to be placed on the ballot by August 8 in order for the paper to be operational.

965
01:07:04,225 --> 01:07:04,946
The paper is moved.

966
01:07:05,706 --> 01:07:07,688
So we're having a meeting on something that's dead.

967
01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:09,529
It's in fact, it does pass.

968
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,491
President Ferris, would you like to amend the paper?

969
01:07:11,511 --> 01:07:15,174
I mean, all you have to do is change

970
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:23,162
I think four words to make it unmoot once again, or sorry, eight words.

971
01:07:23,322 --> 01:07:32,088
So it's not really that the concept and ideas moot, it's that it's now been delayed to a future discussion.

972
01:07:32,768 --> 01:07:43,016
I'm happy to amend it to strike out the first paragraph and replace it with, you know, be it resolved that the Medford City Council

973
01:07:47,033 --> 01:08:14,780
request a meeting with the mayor and finance staff regarding planning for the ongoing revenue shortfall and

974
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:19,376
structural budget deficit.

975
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,583
Thank you, President Paris.

976
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:32,805
On that motion, name and address for the record, please.

977
01:08:33,085 --> 01:08:34,686
Mary Anna Ducey, 2 Nod Street.

978
01:08:35,207 --> 01:08:40,691
I thought that this was an opportune time to bring up this newspaper article I saw on the July 24th

979
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,766
Boston Sunday Globe finances.

980
01:08:44,247 --> 01:08:48,051
It said, Medford's surveying public on how to spend rescue funds.

981
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:53,376
Medford has launched a survey to seek community input on how it should spend $20 million in federal funds.

982
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:59,723
The city is receiving $48 million from the American Rescue Plan Act signed into law by President Biden last year.

983
01:09:00,323 --> 01:09:03,824
with funds to come in installments through 2025.

984
01:09:04,284 --> 01:09:17,069
NEPA previously allocated $19 million of the $48 million to replace city revenues it lost during the pandemic and for other fiscal funds, which leaves approximately $20 million remaining for investments in the community projects and programs.

985
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:23,611
The survey provides an opportunity for city residents to offer their preferences on what should be targeted with the spending.

986
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:32,713
It seems like if we have a potential 13 million deficit, it should be not any survey to find out where we should spend the money.

987
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:44,777
I think the city should put it where to reduce the deficit, so that's regarding our spending that's regarding our funding which is used for very specific sources and we've already the city has maxed out the amount it can use

988
01:09:45,597 --> 01:09:46,797
to replace revenue.

989
01:09:46,857 --> 01:09:48,918
I understand that it's staggered.

990
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,798
You can't just spend it all at one time.

991
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:51,419
Correct.

992
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:53,719
And you have to spend it on particular projects.

993
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:54,059
Correct.

994
01:09:54,099 --> 01:10:07,003
However, the city budget, I'm sure they could reshuffle money to apply this money to portions of the city that would be eligible for this money, rather than considering even a 2.5% override.

995
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:12,164
I mean, the general public doesn't understand the mechanics of all this, but this is kind of shocking

996
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:20,692
When you consider having to probably maybe pass a proposition to an iPhone right and raise property taxes, when you have money sitting there.

997
01:10:20,712 --> 01:10:25,737
They looking for suggestions on how to spend for this purpose.

998
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:29,441
If I could just embarrass.

999
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:33,145
We received a total of 48 million in the heart of money.

1000
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,582
about 20 million of that already to cover the deficit.

1001
01:10:40,163 --> 01:10:47,187
And there's a formula in ARPA that says of the total amount you get, this is how much you can use to cover your budget deficit.

1002
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:48,748
We've already maxed that out.

1003
01:10:48,989 --> 01:10:58,695
So this 20 million, I wish it was flexible enough that we could use it to address the existing budget shortfalls, although it's still one-time revenue and not actually a long-term solution to the problem.

1004
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:02,438
The issue, the remaining 20 million that they're talking about in that article,

1005
01:11:02,978 --> 01:11:07,360
is essentially the money from the federal law that we can't use to cover the deficit.

1006
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,600
We can only use it for so what can you use this for?

1007
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:11,701
We can use it for a few specific purposes.

1008
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,002
Water and sewer is one of them.

1009
01:11:14,082 --> 01:11:17,543
And that's we just discussed that and streets associated with it.

1010
01:11:18,744 --> 01:11:21,165
policies to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis.

1011
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:24,286
One of the things that we approved and that the city did do

1012
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:32,125
In January, it was hire a federal funds manager who was supposed to look at all of the specific, very detailed U.S.

1013
01:11:32,185 --> 01:11:37,186
Treasury rules and documents that outline exactly how you can spend the $20 million.

1014
01:11:37,746 --> 01:11:43,007
We had a great person who was doing that work who was terminated, as I understand it, by the administration in July.

1015
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:46,428
So now we don't have the expert that we need to understand all of that.

1016
01:11:47,368 --> 01:11:49,989
Well, you just talked tonight about the water meters and so forth.

1017
01:11:50,029 --> 01:11:54,630
So if this can be applied to water meters, that's so much the better.

1018
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:55,250
Right.

1019
01:11:55,431 --> 01:12:01,878
And in what we were discussing, they are planning to use 700,000 of that towards the water meter project.

1020
01:12:01,898 --> 01:12:11,750
So, you know, I think the survey is asking, what can we do with the balance of the money that... The city shouldn't be asking the public.

1021
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:14,013
The city should know where they need to spend the money.

1022
01:12:14,432 --> 01:12:17,155
Well, and you know what, that's... I know, it's not your call.

1023
01:12:17,195 --> 01:12:18,697
We don't initiate that process.

1024
01:12:18,777 --> 01:12:20,039
I understand that.

1025
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:31,992
But I'm just bringing it up because it seemed ridiculous when we heard the midnight discussion about the budget deficit, and here, a couple of weeks later, we see that there's money sitting there, and they're looking for suggestions how to use it.

1026
01:12:32,553 --> 01:12:33,534
Yeah, I think...

1027
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:36,851
Certainly the optics are not great.

1028
01:12:38,033 --> 01:12:45,582
Obviously you made the point when you came up that the specifics are incredibly complicated and I think we've been trying our best over the last two months to

1029
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,863
take a complicated and opaque process and make it as transparent as possible and boil it down to the understanding of it.

1030
01:12:53,964 --> 01:13:13,515
All I can say is I wish we could use that $20 million to address that issue, but it's legally- I'll leave this here and you can put it in your agenda there and you can figure out if there's any way, instead of looking for suggestions here, you can shuffle around some things and use it to reduce the deficit basically.

1031
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:13,695
Yeah.

1032
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:19,828
Thank you.

1033
01:13:20,548 --> 01:13:21,109
Councilor Sang.

1034
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:28,192
I believe my comment was back to the main discussion.

1035
01:13:29,212 --> 01:13:40,757
I just wanted to say that I believe that it seems possible that we, on the points that the date might be moved, that we can amend it.

1036
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:43,138
I believe Councilor Behrs has done that.

1037
01:13:44,278 --> 01:13:49,000
And we talked about the dollar amounts perhaps not being the right amounts,

1038
01:13:49,444 --> 01:14:03,908
I believe that the best way to do that is to invite everyone, have a long, you know, a committee of them all about it, to have a discussion in the open, transparent forum where we can kind of talk about what makes sense, what doesn't make sense in front of everyone.

1039
01:14:04,228 --> 01:14:11,830
And instead of, you know, just having people decide, you know, having, you know, some counselors have to do the work and then place it on theirs.

1040
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:13,230
And I think putting it on,

1041
01:14:14,328 --> 01:14:23,553
Now having that discussion in open forum, I think makes the most sense in terms of transparency, in terms of letting people know what we're doing and how we've come to dollar amounts.

1042
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:29,196
So I plan to vote in favor of the motion to move this to a committee vote.

1043
01:14:30,837 --> 01:14:31,337
Thank you.

1044
01:14:31,357 --> 01:14:33,118
Councilor Knight.

1045
01:14:33,498 --> 01:14:36,360
I'd just like to point out that there's really no need to amend anything.

1046
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:43,584
If you look at the agenda and we see paper 22026, which was filed the first meeting in January,

1047
01:14:44,858 --> 01:15:04,485
In paper 22027, also filed the first meeting in January, requesting quarterly updates from the city, chief financial officer in the city's financial health, and a monthly copy of the Warren articles to see where we're spending our money, right, which is exactly what Councilman Bass is asking for in his amended paper, pretty much.

1048
01:15:05,641 --> 01:15:17,214
meeting with the finance team to discuss revenue shortfalls, revenue growth, and the like, which is what we've been asking for since January of this year, since the first meeting that this council met.

1049
01:15:17,655 --> 01:15:21,740
And quite frankly, going back to the term before, and we haven't got it.

1050
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:26,613
We haven't got, again, the paper before us is moved.

1051
01:15:27,113 --> 01:15:28,073
It's dead on arrival.

1052
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:32,074
It was supposed to be passed to go to get on the ballot by August 8th.

1053
01:15:32,274 --> 01:15:33,934
The paper is asking to be placed on the ballot.

1054
01:15:34,594 --> 01:15:43,236
We have papers that are already readily available for us to act upon that haven't been acted upon, that have been on the table for eight months, with the administration failing to respond to them in any capacity.

1055
01:15:45,537 --> 01:15:46,937
Why don't we take care of the first things first?

1056
01:15:48,718 --> 01:15:49,318
Thank you, Councilman Knight.

1057
01:15:49,498 --> 01:15:50,518
New address for the record, please.

1058
01:15:52,383 --> 01:15:54,965
Good evening, Andrew Castaneda, East Medford Mass.

1059
01:15:55,746 --> 01:15:56,947
I'll be very brief.

1060
01:15:57,848 --> 01:16:10,678
I'm actually glad that you're a day late and a dollar short and not going to be able to get this Prop 2.5 override on this November's ballot, because a lot of the taxpayers are struggling to pay their bills.

1061
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:13,901
As you said, with inflation, especially the homeowners,

1062
01:16:15,393 --> 01:16:19,275
Matter of fact, we already got hit last December when we set the tax rate.

1063
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:26,578
My hit was probably $450, an extra charge that just started this year.

1064
01:16:27,338 --> 01:16:35,462
And if this $12 million override went through, I'm hearing it's gonna cost 800, it's gonna cost me $1,000 extra.

1065
01:16:36,122 --> 01:16:43,025
At the worst scenario, and I'm not for overrides of two and a half, God rest Barbara Anderson's soul,

1066
01:16:44,162 --> 01:16:47,563
Although the law is flawed on a state level, and I'll get into it some other time.

1067
01:16:47,784 --> 01:16:53,186
Because everyone, every single owner occupied should get the same dollar amount.

1068
01:16:54,646 --> 01:16:55,487
And that would make it fair.

1069
01:16:57,528 --> 01:17:01,249
But I got to fight City Hall and Medford before I can fight the state.

1070
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:06,912
But I know my idea is perfect if I can get the right mathematician to do the math.

1071
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:12,454
So I don't need a thousand dollar jump on top of it all.

1072
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:18,280
And we're not Winchester with these overrides of two and a half or debt exclusions.

1073
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,821
Never been done in this town.

1074
01:17:21,263 --> 01:17:26,270
However, if it did something like this for $12 million, that would cost me a thousand dollars one shot this year.

1075
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:28,713
I want you to do that debt override business.

1076
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:30,735
It'll probably cost $40 per annum.

1077
01:17:32,432 --> 01:17:38,817
instead of $1,000 per year for 20 years until the debt is paid, then it stops.

1078
01:17:39,278 --> 01:17:44,822
Madam President, debt exclusion really shouldn't be used to address an operational deficit.

1079
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:49,553
The debt exclusion is normally used to address the capital need.

1080
01:17:49,713 --> 01:17:56,036
You take the debt exclusion out to pay off a bond over a certain period of time to build a building or to take care of a project.

1081
01:17:57,136 --> 01:18:00,957
To do a debt exclusion with an expiring use to hire 25 new DPW workers.

1082
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:02,818
Well, after 25 years, what happens?

1083
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:05,359
That debt exclusion falls off the books and then- You can't pay it.

1084
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:07,279
You can't even legally do it.

1085
01:18:07,379 --> 01:18:12,721
Okay, so like Winchester, I went to legal for $100 million debt exclusion to build the Winchester High School a few years back.

1086
01:18:13,441 --> 01:18:13,982
And that was 800 bucks.

1087
01:18:15,502 --> 01:18:18,185
per quarter for 20 years.

1088
01:18:18,885 --> 01:18:28,074
So at least if you can't help relieve the taxpayer, as Dr. Sorella would say, come down even one lousy dollar.

1089
01:18:28,615 --> 01:18:34,560
But if you can't really help the taxpayer, give them tax relief, or hear her, at least do no harm.

1090
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:37,323
Thank you for not getting it in a timely manner.

1091
01:18:38,372 --> 01:18:52,721
And I do want to know if there is a committee of the whole tomorrow at 6pm, zoom exclusively to discuss potential, just the impact of owner occupied and a number of other exemptions of prices and bears had placed on the agenda a few weeks back.

1092
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:59,245
Just know that no matter present that do believe you spoke on that, I'm not gonna be able to make tomorrow's meeting I do have a work obligation.

1093
01:18:59,265 --> 01:18:59,425
Yes.

1094
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,520
Is the part time city assessor Ellen Bordeaux going to be there?

1095
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:04,141
Yes.

1096
01:19:04,721 --> 01:19:05,861
This time she's going to be there.

1097
01:19:05,881 --> 01:19:06,061
Yes.

1098
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,022
Interim interim chief assessor.

1099
01:19:08,122 --> 01:19:10,803
This is going to be a public meeting so people can come in in person.

1100
01:19:11,183 --> 01:19:11,963
It's zoom only.

1101
01:19:14,504 --> 01:19:14,984
On the motion.

1102
01:19:15,064 --> 01:19:23,407
So we have a motion of vice president bears as amended by motion of vice president bears as amended by vice president bears seconded by Councillor Collins.

1103
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:24,608
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1104
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,571
Vice President bears.

1105
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:36,632
Yes, that's trivial.

1106
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:39,694
That's a college.

1107
01:19:39,915 --> 01:19:40,135
Yes.

1108
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:42,036
That's a night.

1109
01:19:43,197 --> 01:19:44,117
That's a scarpelli.

1110
01:19:44,157 --> 01:19:45,818
That's the same.

1111
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:46,939
Yes.

1112
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:49,761
President Morrell.

1113
01:19:50,201 --> 01:19:52,142
Yes, for the affirmative three in the negative.

1114
01:19:52,202 --> 01:19:53,023
The motion passes.

1115
01:19:57,307 --> 01:20:08,755
22-448 offered by Councilor Carvillo, be it so resolved that Medford City Council call a meeting of the subcommittee on rules and ordinances to discuss Chapter 74, Article 11, Section 3 to amend the rules for private ways in the city.

1116
01:20:08,775 --> 01:20:12,017
Councilor Carvillo, I do wanna know, I believe it's actually Chapter 74, Article 2, Section 3.

1117
01:20:14,646 --> 01:20:16,028
Yeah, I may have had the wrong one there.

1118
01:20:16,048 --> 01:20:22,917
But yeah, again, it's this is something to that's been a topic of attention many years in the city.

1119
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:30,267
Actually, what is the private way in the services that private ways are entitled to people live on private ways.

1120
01:20:30,828 --> 01:20:38,153
don't pay any less taxes than the people on the public way, and they deserve the same services that everyone else gets.

1121
01:20:38,693 --> 01:20:45,998
And I think when you look at the article, all it addresses is talking about the fixing of the street.

1122
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:53,964
It doesn't talk about cutting a tree down, trimming a tree, or any other things that anybody who lives on the public way would get.

1123
01:20:54,404 --> 01:20:57,006
So I'd like to refer this to a subcommittee on the rules.

1124
01:20:57,026 --> 01:20:57,866
Let's define

1125
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:03,998
what gets done on a private way.

1126
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:08,641
And actually, most people don't even know what a private way is.

1127
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:13,484
You have a lot of new people moving into the community.

1128
01:21:13,844 --> 01:21:17,046
I think they don't even understand what it is.

1129
01:21:17,346 --> 01:21:21,789
Let's get a better definition of what a private way is and what the city is gonna do.

1130
01:21:22,069 --> 01:21:25,971
Let's say the city should be doing everything that it does on everyone else's street.

1131
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:28,033
They shouldn't get less.

1132
01:21:28,453 --> 01:21:29,774
And if we're gonna give them less,

1133
01:21:30,414 --> 01:21:36,136
and give them a separate tax classification so they pay a lesser amount of taxes if they're not going to get the same on services.

1134
01:21:36,176 --> 01:21:42,698
So, if we can refer this to a subcommittee on rules and ordinances, we appreciate it.

1135
01:21:43,418 --> 01:21:44,538
Thank you, Councilor Carviel.

1136
01:21:45,218 --> 01:21:46,038
Any further discussion?

1137
01:21:47,919 --> 01:21:50,720
On the motion of Councilor Carviel, I was seconded by Councilor Knight.

1138
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:51,940
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1139
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:54,481
Vice President Paris.

1140
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,500
That's trivial.

1141
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:56,921
Yes.

1142
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:57,601
Yes.

1143
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:57,961
Yes.

1144
01:21:58,141 --> 01:21:58,301
Yes.

1145
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,681
Yes, seven in favor, zero in the negative.

1146
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:08,642
The motion passes.

1147
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:10,904
22-449 offered by Councilor Carviello.

1148
01:22:10,944 --> 01:22:19,611
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have a representative from DCR appear before the council to explain why concrete sidewalks on the Felsway were torn up and replaced with asphalt.

1149
01:22:19,751 --> 01:22:20,512
Councilor Carviello.

1150
01:22:20,612 --> 01:22:21,433
Thank you, Madam President.

1151
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:32,842
Again, if people would look up in the Felsway, I got many calls wanting to know why very good concrete sidewalks were torn up and now they're being replaced with asphalt.

1152
01:22:33,322 --> 01:22:33,483
Why?

1153
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:35,430
What's the matter?

1154
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,391
We're not Winchester?

1155
01:22:37,511 --> 01:22:41,052
We don't get the concrete sidewalks like they get?

1156
01:22:41,672 --> 01:22:42,353
The DCI?

1157
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:44,693
We don't get lights like they get in other cities?

1158
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:47,535
In curbs or whatever?

1159
01:22:50,818 --> 01:22:54,860
These should be torn up immediately and replaced with concrete like they were.

1160
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:02,945
The residents of the Fells Way don't deserve second tier sidewalks that were torn up.

1161
01:23:03,505 --> 01:23:08,808
Again, let's say all those sidewalks were in good condition, they didn't need to be torn up.

1162
01:23:09,548 --> 01:23:24,178
So again, I would ask that we have the representatives of the DPR come here to explain why they did it, and that we also ask our state delegation to find out why we're getting asphalt and other cities like Winchester get concrete.

1163
01:23:25,559 --> 01:23:27,060
We're not a second class community.

1164
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,020
Thank you.

1165
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:28,841
Vice President Behrs.

1166
01:23:29,782 --> 01:23:30,882
Thank you, Madam President.

1167
01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:37,327
As a resident of the Felsway, I'm obviously frustrated and disturbed by what's going on.

1168
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:39,028
When

1169
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:48,004
I won't relitigate the fact that basically the city got no notice from DCR about this project and had no input over the planning.

1170
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:58,150
But when residents have gone up to foremen and folks on site, they have said, and I believe also folks at DCR, DCR has said, this is now standard procedure everywhere.

1171
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,891
We're putting asphalt everywhere.

1172
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:02,552
I mean, I think it's wrong.

1173
01:24:02,753 --> 01:24:07,075
I'm just relaying that that's the answer that they're sending out there or that they're having their workers sent out there.

1174
01:24:07,788 --> 01:24:11,690
If you look at the workmanship, it's a disaster.

1175
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:23,656
I mean, up and down the entire street, there are, you know, four, five, six inch drop-offs into dirt piles, asphalt adjacent to other asphalt that doesn't line up with it.

1176
01:24:24,276 --> 01:24:33,641
You know, the only thing about the project that seems at all even compliant is that there's some better curbing in some places.

1177
01:24:33,841 --> 01:24:36,923
But, you know, I think we're gonna end up

1178
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:41,098
with a project that's of a worse condition than when we started.

1179
01:24:41,138 --> 01:24:44,940
And this is a multi-million dollar improvement project, or it's supposed to be.

1180
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,702
So I have no problem with this agenda.

1181
01:24:47,762 --> 01:24:50,623
I'm sure, I hope someone shows up.

1182
01:24:50,704 --> 01:24:56,427
We haven't been getting anyone from the state to show up for anything, even though they've been having a huge negative impact on the community.

1183
01:24:56,447 --> 01:25:06,453
I also am hoping to get an update from the mayor on whether she has reached out to get the DCR commissioner down here for that site visit that we voted on almost three months ago.

1184
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:12,954
that Senator Jalen offered to set up, as long as she did it in concert with the mayor, and we've got no update on that either.

1185
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:18,899
But that could be another avenue to try to get them to do something better here.

1186
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,842
It's bad.

1187
01:25:22,482 --> 01:25:24,764
Thanks.

1188
01:25:26,285 --> 01:25:29,848
I just reiterate what my fellow councils have been saying.

1189
01:25:30,269 --> 01:25:34,472
It seems like lately, the city of Memphis has been getting a tail kick by the state.

1190
01:25:36,255 --> 01:25:43,761
You see some of these concerns we've had with DCR, the public transportation, what's happening with removal of buses.

1191
01:25:44,642 --> 01:25:48,445
And then something we'll have to discuss because something very dangerous is going on.

1192
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:55,251
And I'll be making a recommendation soon to close off the on-ramp for 93 at the rotary.

1193
01:25:57,523 --> 01:26:09,134
They put barriers that now jet into the highway and leaving people in the most dangerous, dangerous situations without any notice to anyone.

1194
01:26:09,174 --> 01:26:23,807
So if you're taking that exit and you're a Method resident for the last 30 years, and you hop up on the highway and all of a sudden you look up, there is a fixed Jersey barrier right in front of you, pushing you right into traffic.

1195
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,381
So we're having a serious problem.

1196
01:26:26,461 --> 01:26:40,287
And I think that what we need to do, to be honest with you, is have a meeting with all of our state delegates and sit with them and ask them for some guidance on where we're going with what we're seeing here in Method.

1197
01:26:40,307 --> 01:26:43,929
Because to me, it's nothing but a lack of respect.

1198
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:46,290
And I think we need some movement.

1199
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:50,953
So my recommendation is that not only with what Councilor Caviello said,

1200
01:26:53,025 --> 01:26:55,667
Our neighbors on the Felsway are just appalled.

1201
01:26:56,408 --> 01:27:10,017
I mean, just appalled, but if you, like Councilor says, you move up and down two miles to a different community, and their streets are paved with granite and cement, it's beautiful.

1202
01:27:10,717 --> 01:27:18,883
So I think there's a major discrepancy going on here, and I don't know why, but it seems like when you start adding it up,

1203
01:27:20,048 --> 01:27:26,654
Method's getting the short end of the stick in many different state entities, whether it be DCR, DOT, or public transit.

1204
01:27:26,694 --> 01:27:37,644
So my recommendation, if Councilor Caviello allows me, that part of this discussion, that we invite our state delegates to come down and really ask them what's going on at the Statehouse.

1205
01:27:38,465 --> 01:27:39,166
What did we do wrong?

1206
01:27:39,206 --> 01:27:44,470
Did someone break up with someone's significant other or something that comes from Medford?

1207
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,732
I don't know, but we need to figure this out because this is terrible.

1208
01:27:49,073 --> 01:27:53,316
It's frustrating that we're hearing more issues coming from the straight state side.

1209
01:27:53,796 --> 01:28:00,762
We have enough to worry about here in Medford right now to be piled on with what's going on on our state roads and highways.

1210
01:28:01,462 --> 01:28:13,885
and public transit, and now our sidewalks the DCR, and our path issues or lack of grass issues or cleanliness issues or more on issues, we go on and on.

1211
01:28:14,566 --> 01:28:20,207
But I think we need to sit down with people and look them in the eye so I'll make that as a form of emotion.

1212
01:28:20,247 --> 01:28:20,547
Thank you.

1213
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:35,458
And listening to what my colleagues are saying and looking at paper 22451, I think that merging the two papers together and developing an agenda for discussion with our state delegation would make sense.

1214
01:28:36,539 --> 01:28:42,044
You know, we have a paper that was passed on May 17th, June, July, August, now three months have passed, 90 days.

1215
01:28:42,765 --> 01:28:45,387
We haven't had the meeting with Senator Jalen.

1216
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,229
Senator Jalen hasn't been able to set up the meeting.

1217
01:28:47,309 --> 01:28:48,830
Maybe the mayor's not available, I don't know.

1218
01:28:49,643 --> 01:28:54,104
But, you know, maybe it's time to reach out to the other members of our delegation to see if they can move this along a little bit.

1219
01:28:54,124 --> 01:29:05,528
You know, a state senator has a much larger district to represent 160,000 people across three to four communities, whereas state representatives represent 40,000 people each, you know, across one or two communities.

1220
01:29:05,868 --> 01:29:10,649
So maybe reaching out to our state delegation on the House side might be helpful in moving this endeavor forward.

1221
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:13,250
But I think it would make sense for us to merge this along with 22451.

1222
01:29:14,855 --> 01:29:17,417
and develop an agenda for items of concern.

1223
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:23,142
Now, I know we've passed a number of items relative to DCI roadways and other parcels and properties.

1224
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:32,129
So we can probably put together with the assistance of the city clerk, an agenda for discussion with a very short order and move on this.

1225
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:35,131
Thank you, Councilor Neidt.

1226
01:29:35,151 --> 01:29:35,471
Vice Mayor Behrs.

1227
01:29:35,491 --> 01:29:36,372
I also have a form of motion.

1228
01:29:37,573 --> 01:29:38,374
Thank you, Madam President.

1229
01:29:38,634 --> 01:29:40,976
I don't have a problem with Councilor Neidt's suggestion.

1230
01:29:41,216 --> 01:29:41,756
Other than that,

1231
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:51,344
I do think that the Felsway situation warrants, you know, we can have a meeting on the litany of problems that we have.

1232
01:29:51,384 --> 01:29:59,829
And that was the intent of the paper in May was, you know, we've got problems up and down on what Councilor Scarpelli was just saying on every issue.

1233
01:29:59,849 --> 01:30:09,074
You know, I do think that this sidewalk project does deserve hopefully a little bit more specific and urgent response because it's not done yet.

1234
01:30:09,926 --> 01:30:27,860
It's happening now, and I'm hoping maybe we could change course on it, but I don't have a problem merging the two and then having a more immediate meeting on this specific project and then a full meeting on the full range of issues that we have with our DCR properties in the city.

1235
01:30:31,765 --> 01:30:33,126
attack the problem, right?

1236
01:30:33,146 --> 01:30:35,368
And we're going to say, listen, let's talk about the Felsway now.

1237
01:30:35,668 --> 01:30:36,669
Let's talk about the Fulton Heights.

1238
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:39,311
These are the seven issues we have in the Fulton Heights now.

1239
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:40,392
Let's talk about the Fulton Heights.

1240
01:30:40,452 --> 01:30:41,273
Oh, you did a good job.

1241
01:30:41,313 --> 01:30:41,753
Now come back.

1242
01:30:42,114 --> 01:30:42,954
Let's talk about this again.

1243
01:30:43,015 --> 01:30:43,715
Let's talk about this next.

1244
01:30:43,755 --> 01:30:44,296
You know what I mean?

1245
01:30:44,556 --> 01:30:46,558
Just for an efficiency purpose, really more than anything else.

1246
01:30:46,578 --> 01:30:47,258
You know what I mean?

1247
01:30:47,278 --> 01:30:48,279
The state's going to think we're crazy.

1248
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:50,100
We already sent them enough lunatic stuff as it is.

1249
01:30:50,481 --> 01:30:51,041
You know what I mean?

1250
01:30:51,342 --> 01:30:52,763
This is something that actually makes a difference.

1251
01:30:52,783 --> 01:30:54,084
This is something that matters in our community.

1252
01:30:54,104 --> 01:30:55,105
This is something we can move on.

1253
01:30:55,565 --> 01:30:56,406
You know what I mean?

1254
01:30:56,426 --> 01:31:01,950
That's why I get a little concerned when we send a lot of letters up to the statehouse that don't really have anything to do with real life issues that are going on.

1255
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:03,291
You know what I mean?

1256
01:31:03,431 --> 01:31:05,613
You know, in terms of nuts and bolts and service delivery.

1257
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:12,678
So, you know, my concern is that, you know, if we're going and we're asking for help from the state, that we do it the right way, that we have a game plan.

1258
01:31:13,118 --> 01:31:14,259
We have an order of operations.

1259
01:31:14,299 --> 01:31:21,404
We have an organizational effectiveness so that we don't just go in screaming and yelling because we got a call from a neighbor about how they don't like the sidewalk.

1260
01:31:22,045 --> 01:31:24,967
And, you know, the goal is we tried, but we never get the result.

1261
01:31:26,305 --> 01:31:28,406
And a lot of that has to do with planning more than anything else.

1262
01:31:29,107 --> 01:31:29,627
Thank you, Councilor.

1263
01:31:29,667 --> 01:31:31,008
Councilor Scarpalli.

1264
01:31:31,088 --> 01:31:32,588
Just a point of information.

1265
01:31:32,608 --> 01:31:40,032
I know that Representative Donato just informed me that he is working extremely hard.

1266
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:45,595
He's talked with the state this morning for any questions about the on-ramp.

1267
01:31:46,076 --> 01:31:51,419
They're coming out with new signs and information for the community as soon as possible.

1268
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:53,200
So we thank for his commitment.

1269
01:31:54,827 --> 01:32:04,234
And that's that's a benefit of having someone like Mr. Donato in place that he's sitting home watching these meetings, and he's already ahead of the game so I really appreciate that so thank you.

1270
01:32:05,415 --> 01:32:12,560
Let's see, see response, I do just want to know on the point of the sidewalks I think a lot of

1271
01:32:13,612 --> 01:32:15,573
very, thank you Councilor Carvio for bringing this forward.

1272
01:32:15,593 --> 01:32:16,834
I think a lot of important points have been made.

1273
01:32:17,034 --> 01:32:34,162
And also the fact, you know, we talk about heat islands in this city and we're actively taking concrete out, which is cooler and replacing it with black asphalt, which only makes our streets hotter where we're lacking those trees and just contributes to a problem we're already facing, which, you know, walk around the street these past several weeks at this point, and you feel the difference.

1274
01:32:34,243 --> 01:32:36,224
So it's absolutely unacceptable.

1275
01:32:36,244 --> 01:32:39,245
We do a number of motions on the floor, but Ms.

1276
01:32:39,265 --> 01:32:40,886
Cameron, do you want to speak on the current paper?

1277
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:53,109
I'm a little bit confused about whether it's in order or out of order, but I wanted to raise a comment about DCR property in general, not specifically the Felsway.

1278
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:54,532
Should I hold that?

1279
01:32:57,175 --> 01:33:04,761
So my one specific concern that I wanted to bring up was the bridge behind the armory going on Route 16.

1280
01:33:06,042 --> 01:33:20,373
It is crumbling and I'm really concerned because it's like it's an area now that's highly trafficked by boaters and there are pieces of concrete that are falling into the water or ready to fall into the water and it's a historic bridge.

1281
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:22,354
It defines the character of the community.

1282
01:33:22,374 --> 01:33:24,996
I think it's even on the National Register of Historic Sites.

1283
01:33:25,553 --> 01:33:35,759
So the repairs, I don't know if it's DCR or MassDOT, but the repairs that have already been made on that bridge have been not historically appropriate.

1284
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:43,344
And now the bridge is getting graffiti on top of its disrepair, and it's just looking terrible.

1285
01:33:43,804 --> 01:33:52,510
And so I would ask, first of all, I wanted to say that I think that in Medford, we are incredibly, incredibly fortunate to have the resources

1286
01:33:52,929 --> 01:33:56,812
that we have of the state parks and properties and historic resources.

1287
01:33:57,552 --> 01:34:08,740
And I just want to encourage not only that they be well maintained, but that they be historically appropriately maintained and that they be safe.

1288
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:09,400
Thank you.

1289
01:34:09,901 --> 01:34:10,141
Thank you.

1290
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,441
Councilor Carviel.

1291
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:13,342
Thank you, Madam President.

1292
01:34:14,743 --> 01:34:18,425
Councilor Baer's motion on 22451.

1293
01:34:18,846 --> 01:34:21,748
Again, these are things that we've been asking for for a long time.

1294
01:34:21,768 --> 01:34:26,211
I mean, I don't know how many times I've asked them to clean up Route 16, over by that bridge.

1295
01:34:26,551 --> 01:34:31,515
I mean, the whole area, there's logs in the water, which are all controlled by the DCR.

1296
01:34:32,015 --> 01:34:34,097
Again, and Councilor Scapoli's right.

1297
01:34:34,197 --> 01:34:36,959
It seems that we seem to be getting the short end of the stick.

1298
01:34:37,659 --> 01:34:41,944
on a lot of these DCRs and some of these projects.

1299
01:34:42,004 --> 01:34:55,918
I've got one more I didn't even add on here, but I was a little disappointed in Senator Jalen taking pictures of Winchester with them getting their second train station renovated and we can't get 10 cents to fix the train station in West Medford.

1300
01:34:56,959 --> 01:34:58,760
Just keep slapping us in the face, that's okay.

1301
01:34:59,802 --> 01:35:00,082
But again,

1302
01:35:02,922 --> 01:35:12,971
I think I think I was right, get the full state delegation down here, along with the DCR, let them start answering some questions why we're not getting what we pay for services.

1303
01:35:17,475 --> 01:35:22,479
Before we continue to be I just want to take the motion to merge the two papers just so we're aware of what we're discussing.

1304
01:35:25,085 --> 01:35:44,291
Councilor Knight motion to merge the paper we're discussing 22-449 with 22-451 offered by vices and affairs, which states be it resolved by the Medford City Council to the city administration, provide an update to paper 22353, which outlined an invitation to the new DCR commissioner to come to Medford for a site visit to better understand the impact of DCR roads, parks and properties on our community.

1305
01:35:44,851 --> 01:35:50,313
The paper passed on May 17th, 2022 and Senator Jalen's office graciously offered to assist the city in scheduling a visit.

1306
01:35:50,793 --> 01:35:54,014
So on the motion of Councilor Knight to merge those two papers,

1307
01:35:55,047 --> 01:35:56,968
seconded by Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1308
01:35:56,988 --> 01:35:57,068
Yes.

1309
01:35:57,088 --> 01:35:57,188
Yes.

1310
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:57,408
Yes.

1311
01:35:57,508 --> 01:35:57,608
Yes.

1312
01:36:17,717 --> 01:36:20,279
Yes, I'm in the firm is you're in the negative motion passes by Susan bears.

1313
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:20,599
Thanks.

1314
01:36:20,679 --> 01:36:26,483
And just to be clear again, my intent with the original paper to do this three by three was exactly the council.

1315
01:36:26,523 --> 01:36:29,505
I was just saying, which is come down here and we'll talk about everything.

1316
01:36:29,525 --> 01:36:31,786
Now that the papers are merged, that's fine.

1317
01:36:31,806 --> 01:36:38,050
I hope we get an update from the administration on if they've reached and reached out to DCR and Senator Jalen's office to schedule that.

1318
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:42,693
I think also what we should do in the short term relative to councilor Kirby yellows point

1319
01:36:43,258 --> 01:36:51,605
is have someone from DCR come to a council meeting to discuss the sidewalks on the Felsway.

1320
01:36:51,665 --> 01:37:01,093
That doesn't need to be all the rigmarole and scheduling and planning of getting the DCR commissioner down here and talking about 25 different issues we have with DCR.

1321
01:37:01,894 --> 01:37:04,696
So if we could maybe get that to happen, you know,

1322
01:37:06,735 --> 01:37:14,538
I mean, as soon as possible, the summer's kind of difficult, but even if we could get a written update in the next 10 days, you know.

1323
01:37:14,958 --> 01:37:16,079
Before the project's all done.

1324
01:37:16,359 --> 01:37:16,619
Right.

1325
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:36,067
So I don't know, but that would be, now that the papers are merged, if we could get some sort of update from DCR where the clerk's office could send out tomorrow to DCR and to the state delegation a request for an immediate update within 10 days regarding whether or not we can get the sidewalks

1326
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:42,392
address the issue and get the concrete sidewalks replaced with concrete, not with asphalt.

1327
01:37:42,832 --> 01:37:47,654
And then we can go down the road and look at the longer issue we have with DCR properties.

1328
01:37:48,794 --> 01:37:58,377
I just don't want this Felsway issue to get dumped in the pile and with 50 other problems that we have, when we still might have a chance to influence that process in some way.

1329
01:37:58,397 --> 01:38:00,598
Thank you.

1330
01:38:00,638 --> 01:38:01,858
Councilor Nye.

1331
01:38:01,898 --> 01:38:03,299
I'm thinking it might make more sense that we

1332
01:38:04,002 --> 01:38:09,803
as a council, direct the DPW commissioner to address the issue and then report back to us in a defined period of time.

1333
01:38:11,644 --> 01:38:13,724
You know, it's an infrastructure improvement.

1334
01:38:13,764 --> 01:38:16,465
The DPW director's involved in all this type of work, right?

1335
01:38:16,505 --> 01:38:19,525
When it comes down to traffic management, plans, permits, or ground opening and the like.

1336
01:38:20,525 --> 01:38:26,307
So it might make sense for us to reach out to the DPW commissioner and say, DPW commissioner, what's going on?

1337
01:38:26,427 --> 01:38:27,847
These are projects that you're aware of, right?

1338
01:38:28,147 --> 01:38:30,328
Why is the product not coming back in the metric way?

1339
01:38:30,368 --> 01:38:32,168
Why is the product coming back in the DCR way?

1340
01:38:33,473 --> 01:38:48,161
please explain to us why and what steps you take to remedy it because, you know, ultimately, the DC has, you know, when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of public works, our public works director is the person, our infrastructure person is the public works director.

1341
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:50,402
The city clerk can send a letter and wait for a response.

1342
01:38:50,422 --> 01:38:54,264
It seems like a lot of it might be technical in nature, and I don't know why.

1343
01:38:54,324 --> 01:38:56,585
It might be a very easy answer to what Tim already asked.

1344
01:38:58,792 --> 01:39:04,976
So it might make sense for us to direct the director of public works to do these inquiries and report back to us in a certain period of time.

1345
01:39:05,016 --> 01:39:05,956
That's just my suggestion.

1346
01:39:06,016 --> 01:39:09,798
I won't offer them a full motion or anything, but it just seems like it would make sense.

1347
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:10,399
Yeah.

1348
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:11,960
Okay.

1349
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:15,402
So I have multiple motions on the floor.

1350
01:39:15,442 --> 01:39:25,988
So the motion of councilor Scarpelli to set up a meeting with the delegation to talk about numerous TCR issues and motion from councilor Knight to work through the

1351
01:39:27,105 --> 01:39:29,607
DPW commissioner to get a response regarding the sidewalks.

1352
01:39:31,328 --> 01:39:34,411
Okay, we can take it as amendments.

1353
01:39:34,431 --> 01:39:36,913
Lost half of this paper, so we have a main motion.

1354
01:39:36,933 --> 01:39:38,955
I don't have a main motion.

1355
01:39:39,035 --> 01:39:47,622
I think the amended motion, it's merged, and now the amended motion would be one, to reach out to the DPW commissioner.

1356
01:39:47,642 --> 01:39:54,988
I mean, do we have a- So I think on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to hold the

1357
01:39:55,789 --> 01:40:08,319
to meet with the state delegation to discuss DCR issues as amended by Councilor Knight so that the DPW commissioner reaches out immediately.

1358
01:40:08,339 --> 01:40:13,383
So just so I know what we're talking about, we're going to

1359
01:40:25,552 --> 01:40:28,474
ask for a meeting with delegation on state entities.

1360
01:40:29,574 --> 01:40:39,400
We're going to ask the DPW Commission to report back to us within 10 days why the DCR is replacing it with asphalt.

1361
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:45,903
And then we're also going to ask the administration for the update on paper 22-353.

1362
01:40:45,923 --> 01:40:54,088
So do I have a motion to approve the main paper and I'll take all those amendments?

1363
01:40:56,418 --> 01:40:57,519
We have to vote on the, I mean, it's.

1364
01:40:57,599 --> 01:41:02,422
We really have to vote on the amendments if there's disagreement.

1365
01:41:02,562 --> 01:41:06,964
Right, I don't disagree with any amendments now that the paper's merged.

1366
01:41:07,665 --> 01:41:11,207
It's mine and Councilor Kerrio's, so I don't know.

1367
01:41:11,227 --> 01:41:17,591
So on the motion on the main merged paper, so I have a motion for all.

1368
01:41:18,011 --> 01:41:18,772
I would just like to,

1369
01:41:19,994 --> 01:41:21,736
response from the DPW commissioner is fine.

1370
01:41:21,836 --> 01:41:30,145
I'd like to get a response from the DPW commissioner as soon as possible as to any information that the DPW commissioner has regarding the sidewalks on the Felsway.

1371
01:41:30,545 --> 01:41:41,597
And then I'd also like to say once we get that response that the DPW commissioner with the support of the council contact DCR and the state delegation to encourage them to, um,

1372
01:41:43,812 --> 01:42:03,390
replace the concrete sidewalks on the Fellsway and Fellsway West with concrete sidewalks and not asphalt sidewalks, because I feel like what we're just going to get back from the DPW commissioner is he's going to come back and say, DCR said this is their policy, and then we're going to be in September, the project's going to be done, and we're not going to have at least asked them and said that we would prefer the sidewalks.

1373
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:09,716
So yeah, I mean, I'm happy to motion to approve the merged papers as amended to say,

1374
01:42:11,116 --> 01:42:15,317
the meeting with the state delegation and have the clerk reback.

1375
01:42:15,357 --> 01:42:18,678
He has Madam President, we're talking about a sidewalk.

1376
01:42:18,698 --> 01:42:24,439
He would turn this thing into a national project for a rocket ship to go to space to move.

1377
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:25,800
I'm just trying to get all that.

1378
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:31,821
Everyone's making motions should have only taken one at a time because now we're Mr Clerk, would you please read the amendments?

1379
01:42:32,481 --> 01:42:35,462
All right.

1380
01:42:38,298 --> 01:42:41,460
Councilor Scarpelli had an amendment asking the state delegation.

1381
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:47,104
This is joint papers now.

1382
01:42:47,144 --> 01:42:50,606
Councilor Scarpelli has an amendment asking the state delegation to attend the meeting.

1383
01:42:50,626 --> 01:43:04,735
Councilor Knight has an amendment asking the DPW to contact DCR, get an update

1384
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:09,699
Okay.

1385
01:43:15,843 --> 01:43:31,034
And then Councilor Behrs has an amendment requesting a response on replacing the sidewalks, the planned asphalt sidewalks with concrete sidewalks as soon as possible.

1386
01:43:31,054 --> 01:43:35,276
Does that reflect everyone's amendments?

1387
01:43:38,178 --> 01:43:38,519
I guess.

1388
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:40,290
Sure.

1389
01:43:40,551 --> 01:43:41,251
Do you want to submit?

1390
01:43:44,414 --> 01:43:46,976
I mean, I think I don't want to deliver it.

1391
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:48,978
I mean, I think it's just getting everything in order.

1392
01:43:49,058 --> 01:43:51,160
I would like to do it.

1393
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:55,563
I'm just trying to get it right.

1394
01:43:55,784 --> 01:43:57,405
Frustration on this process.

1395
01:43:57,445 --> 01:43:59,927
Make sure everyone knows they're voting on to.

1396
01:44:01,048 --> 01:44:01,729
Yeah, I mean,

1397
01:44:03,652 --> 01:44:30,604
Yeah, I would like to ask the DPW commissioner for response as soon as possible as to why the DCR, you know, to Councilor Kerrio's initial motion will explain why concrete sidewalks on the fellows way were torn up and replaced with asphalt and then send a communication, ask the DPW commissioner to send a communication to DCR and the state delegation saying that it's the preference of the city and the city council that the concrete sidewalks be replaced

1398
01:44:31,496 --> 01:44:33,557
with equivalent concrete sidewalks.

1399
01:44:33,738 --> 01:44:34,578
That's all I'm trying to do.

1400
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:47,407
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs to approve the main emerged paper as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1401
01:44:47,427 --> 01:44:48,588
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1402
01:44:52,871 --> 01:44:53,731
Vice President Behrs.

1403
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:54,212
Yes.

1404
01:44:55,212 --> 01:44:55,933
Councilor Kerrio.

1405
01:44:56,033 --> 01:44:56,293
Yes.

1406
01:44:56,733 --> 01:44:57,414
Councilor Collins.

1407
01:44:57,554 --> 01:44:57,774
Yes.

1408
01:44:58,595 --> 01:44:59,075
Councilor Knight.

1409
01:45:00,548 --> 01:45:01,328
Councilor Scarpelli.

1410
01:45:01,368 --> 01:45:01,589
Yes.

1411
01:45:01,989 --> 01:45:02,589
Councilor Seng.

1412
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:07,212
Councilor Seng.

1413
01:45:10,734 --> 01:45:12,155
We're missing your audio, Councilor Seng.

1414
01:45:12,175 --> 01:45:13,615
We don't have your audio, Councilor.

1415
01:45:13,876 --> 01:45:14,256
Thumbs up.

1416
01:45:15,617 --> 01:45:16,077
President Morrell.

1417
01:45:16,451 --> 01:45:35,972
Yes, I'm in the furnace here and I get the motion passes to do that for five zero offered by vice president bears be resolved by the member city council that the city administration provide an update on the expansion of the standard road maintenance practice known as crack ceiling, and whether or not the city has been conducting regular cracks going to keep streets in good condition be a further result of the city administration provide an update on whether any additional funding recommended.

1418
01:45:36,953 --> 01:45:49,484
recommended payment management plan which showed that the city's maintenance backlog for roads would increase from 48 million in FY 2021 to over 120 million in FY 2026 without adding additional funding is being invested in road maintenance.

1419
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,545
Vice President Baird.

1420
01:45:50,645 --> 01:45:51,646
Thank you, Madam President.

1421
01:45:51,906 --> 01:45:56,610
Press release came out a couple weeks ago that the city is going to start crack sealing some roads.

1422
01:45:57,221 --> 01:46:00,763
My understanding is that's a standard maintenance practice that we probably should have always been doing.

1423
01:46:00,783 --> 01:46:03,704
Probably shouldn't be press release worthy that we're doing it now.

1424
01:46:05,165 --> 01:46:11,829
So I'd like to know is to whether we had been doing any cracks ceiling before the current project.

1425
01:46:12,729 --> 01:46:16,871
And the reason I asked that is that I was looking over the paper management plan that came out last year.

1426
01:46:17,632 --> 01:46:23,235
And as far as I can tell, or the plan says that if the city

1427
01:46:24,157 --> 01:46:41,001
does not increase its investment in road maintenance from $1 million per year to about $9.5 million per year, that the backlog of maintenance is going to grow drastically over the next five fiscal years.

1428
01:46:41,621 --> 01:46:44,602
It was at $48 million in fiscal year 21.

1429
01:46:45,262 --> 01:46:51,984
If we continue on the same path of investing $1 million per year in road maintenance, which is essentially our Chapter 90 allocation from the state,

1430
01:46:52,644 --> 01:46:56,506
then that backlog will balloon to 120 million just for the roads.

1431
01:46:56,526 --> 01:46:57,787
That's not even including sidewalks.

1432
01:46:57,807 --> 01:47:00,769
That's just the roads by fiscal year 2026.

1433
01:47:01,889 --> 01:47:03,890
We just passed the fiscal year 2023 budget.

1434
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:05,671
We're going into the fiscal year 2024.

1435
01:47:06,492 --> 01:47:17,318
And I just think it once again indicates the massive, not only that we are facing a massive, a significant structural budget deficit in the short term on operating costs, but we have essentially a massive

1436
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:28,906
budget needs deficit in the long term, where if we don't multiply our investment in roads by 10 times, then we're going to see our backlog triple in just five years.

1437
01:47:29,807 --> 01:47:39,757
So basically what these folks who are experts in pavement said is you need to have 10 times as much money spent on road maintenance as you have now if you actually want to make a dent in your road maintenance backlog.

1438
01:47:40,619 --> 01:47:45,407
When anyone looks at their roads and sidewalks and says, why are they in such horrible shape?

1439
01:47:45,427 --> 01:47:50,757
It's basically because the city is spending one tenth of what it needs to be spending to address the problem.

1440
01:47:51,438 --> 01:47:51,759
Thank you.

1441
01:47:54,221 --> 01:47:54,801
Thank you, Madam President.

1442
01:47:54,821 --> 01:47:57,203
I thank Council for bringing this forward.

1443
01:47:57,563 --> 01:48:11,093
Something I brought up a few years ago when I was up in Maine three weeks ago, what they're doing is what I suggested and then Councilor Favreau was here, was the grinding and milling all at the same time.

1444
01:48:12,314 --> 01:48:21,380
to on the non-busy roads, the side streets, where they come in, they grind the road and they mix it and they put it right back down immediately.

1445
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:28,405
We can, you know, again, this is a thinking out of the box, but I say I saw them doing it up in Maine when I was up there.

1446
01:48:29,185 --> 01:48:36,910
I don't know why we asked for a pilot program to bring a company in and maybe try a half a dozen side streets.

1447
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:51,619
I'm not saying that you do high street and make sure the big streets, but I think it's an option that we should look into for the side streets that don't get the wear and tear, and maybe we can get two streets done for the price of one or three streets for the price of one down.

1448
01:48:52,459 --> 01:48:56,282
So again, I would hope that the engineer is looking into something of that

1449
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:03,578
of that status so that maybe we can get more bang for our buck.

1450
01:49:04,139 --> 01:49:05,901
It won't cost us under $20 million.

1451
01:49:08,725 --> 01:49:09,647
Thank you, Councilor Carmelo.

1452
01:49:09,727 --> 01:49:10,488
Any further discussion?

1453
01:49:12,871 --> 01:49:13,412
Councilor Collins.

1454
01:49:14,352 --> 01:49:15,152
Thank you President Morrell.

1455
01:49:15,192 --> 01:49:18,334
I just wanted to thank Vice President Barris for putting this on the agenda.

1456
01:49:18,354 --> 01:49:25,398
I know when I first took office earlier in the year and started getting those emails about the roads, I took a deep dive into the pavement management plan.

1457
01:49:25,958 --> 01:49:30,960
I think it really is an encapsulation of a lot of the revenue spending issues that we're facing as a city.

1458
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:39,285
You know, it goes without saying, when we don't have the money to spend on a problem, the problem gets more expensive to solve in this case.

1459
01:49:40,356 --> 01:49:40,997
by multiples.

1460
01:49:41,717 --> 01:49:43,519
We all think the roads are bad enough now.

1461
01:49:43,979 --> 01:49:46,841
Certain roads I bike down, I feel like I'm gonna fall in and never hear from again.

1462
01:49:47,522 --> 01:50:01,814
I think that this really just drives home the point that we need to see a plan for how we're going to get on top of this, because it's hard for me to fathom the roads being what they are, and we all hear about it all the time, how that's gonna be in three years if we don't find a way to multiply our investment.

1463
01:50:02,334 --> 01:50:02,735
Thank you.

1464
01:50:03,816 --> 01:50:04,656
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1465
01:50:04,676 --> 01:50:05,437
Any further discussion?

1466
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:17,774
On the motion of Vice President Baird, seconded by, did you want to speak on this paper?

1467
01:50:18,554 --> 01:50:19,955
I just wanted to say something.

1468
01:50:20,855 --> 01:50:29,639
A few years back, Carding Street was paid because they reached the pipes and it was beautiful and they put the trees back and the grass back just the way we wanted.

1469
01:50:30,059 --> 01:50:35,761
This was what Mayor McGlinney came down and listened to the residents on my block on Carding Street.

1470
01:50:36,424 --> 01:50:37,244
and we were grateful.

1471
01:50:37,965 --> 01:50:44,188
A few years back, they took the house down across from me, and in doing so, they had to dig up the street again.

1472
01:50:45,308 --> 01:50:57,534
And when they put it back, the contractor, my son, who was into construction, noticed how they patched the street, called the city, and the city says, oh, don't worry about it, it'll be fine.

1473
01:50:57,794 --> 01:50:59,595
We says, no, it's going to crack.

1474
01:51:00,316 --> 01:51:04,518
So the city had an opportunity to have the contractor fix

1475
01:51:05,328 --> 01:51:10,190
Carting Street, and the shoe cracks go right down the middle of my driveway when I go out.

1476
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:14,612
And they didn't take that opportunity to have the contractor.

1477
01:51:15,113 --> 01:51:20,875
So on the other side of the city, they cost people money, because now they're going to have to repave Carting Street.

1478
01:51:21,716 --> 01:51:34,862
I would hope that they would take attention next time when a resident brings something to their attention and not cost the taxpayers and the people in Method a cost that shouldn't accrue to them and everything.

1479
01:51:35,292 --> 01:51:37,853
but Connie Street should be on that list to be fixed again.

1480
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:39,794
And it shouldn't have been done by the city.

1481
01:51:39,834 --> 01:51:45,597
It should have been done by the contractor within the year's time, because that's when it started cracking right after they fixed it.

1482
01:51:46,257 --> 01:51:47,638
So thank you for listening to me.

1483
01:51:47,938 --> 01:51:48,298
Thank you.

1484
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:55,042
On the motion of Vice President Behrs, I seconded by Councilor Kerrio.

1485
01:51:55,062 --> 01:51:56,062
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1486
01:52:01,265 --> 01:52:02,085
Vice President Behrs.

1487
01:52:02,965 --> 01:52:03,766
Councilor Kerrio.

1488
01:52:03,826 --> 01:52:04,006
Yes.

1489
01:52:04,583 --> 01:52:05,263
Councilor Collins.

1490
01:52:05,903 --> 01:52:06,104
Yes.

1491
01:52:07,044 --> 01:52:07,464
Councilor Knight.

1492
01:52:07,484 --> 01:52:07,604
Yes.

1493
01:52:08,164 --> 01:52:10,185
Councilor Scarpelli.

1494
01:52:10,225 --> 01:52:10,405
Yes.

1495
01:52:10,925 --> 01:52:11,546
Councilor Sang.

1496
01:52:12,006 --> 01:52:12,206
Yes.

1497
01:52:13,966 --> 01:52:14,487
President Morrell.

1498
01:52:14,787 --> 01:52:14,947
Yes.

1499
01:52:15,047 --> 01:52:17,048
I'm going to affirm as negative the motion passes.

1500
01:52:17,068 --> 01:52:27,531
22-452 offered by Councilor Collins and Vice Mayor Behr is being resolved by the Memphis City Council that a representative of the Bradley Road Tenants Association be invited to provide an update on the status of their tenancy.

1501
01:52:28,172 --> 01:52:28,772
Councilor Hollands.

1502
01:52:29,862 --> 01:52:34,726
Thank you, President Morrell, and we have a couple of representatives of the Bradley Road Tenant Association here tonight.

1503
01:52:34,746 --> 01:52:41,590
I'm sure my fellow counselors will remember hearing from some of these folks starting back in April.

1504
01:52:42,471 --> 01:52:48,095
Really, I wanna let these tenants speak for themselves and give us an update on what they've been going through.

1505
01:52:48,135 --> 01:52:48,776
Thank you for being here.

1506
01:52:49,116 --> 01:52:57,502
Yes, hi, I'm Liza Maloney, 26 Bradley Road, and thank you for allowing me to speak tonight on this topic.

1507
01:52:59,164 --> 01:53:11,809
So as you remember, this past March 2022, over half the building of 34 units received termination notices of our tenancy at will agreements, given 30 to 60 days to move.

1508
01:53:12,589 --> 01:53:24,234
Since that night in April, when there were actually 14 tenants here to speak with you and just to appear before you, only four tenants at will remain in the building, and I'm one of them.

1509
01:53:25,394 --> 01:53:26,335
The rest of the tenants

1510
01:53:27,328 --> 01:53:29,809
that were on leases which expired this summer.

1511
01:53:29,829 --> 01:53:35,151
There's only two of those original tenants who are on leases left in the building.

1512
01:53:36,192 --> 01:53:45,556
So the building is mostly empty now except for four to five apartments that management has re-rented soon after the original tenants were forced out.

1513
01:53:46,556 --> 01:53:51,158
Original tenants were not given the option to stay even though they offered to pay $500 more.

1514
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:55,445
and the new tenants are paying $500 more.

1515
01:53:55,805 --> 01:53:58,187
So it doesn't make a lot of sense.

1516
01:53:59,828 --> 01:54:11,456
No meaningful work has been done in the building despite management's claims to the media in May that asbestos remediation, the kitchen, the bathroom updates were the reason for the mass eviction.

1517
01:54:12,357 --> 01:54:16,199
Asbestos was actually done, removal was done last year.

1518
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:20,062
So that should not have impacted this mass eviction at all.

1519
01:54:21,952 --> 01:54:29,995
The new tenants wonder why the building is empty, and people's personal effects are left in piles in the basement as they moved.

1520
01:54:31,875 --> 01:54:41,179
The four remaining tenants at will were given until July 31st to leave, and on Monday, August 1st, we received the court summons from a sheriff.

1521
01:54:42,019 --> 01:54:51,162
The summons were filed this past Monday, the 8th, and we expect to receive a court date to start the eviction process, could be this week.

1522
01:54:52,847 --> 01:55:00,571
We have repeatedly asked the owner to negotiate with the tenant association collectively to stay in the building, and the owner has refused.

1523
01:55:01,392 --> 01:55:11,757
Instead, the owner contacted us individually to negotiate one-on-one, and some residents did kind of cut deals with the owner and have left.

1524
01:55:13,778 --> 01:55:19,702
These one-on-one negotiations all included moving out of the building, so none of them included staying in the building.

1525
01:55:19,722 --> 01:55:22,263
It could be 30 days, three months,

1526
01:55:23,263 --> 01:55:37,913
In their haste to clear the building to increase rents and their profits, management has been personally showing long-term tenants properties they cannot afford and pressuring them to sign new leases at these properties.

1527
01:55:39,674 --> 01:55:46,859
Management seems to have also retaliated this week against one of the tenants who just left a few moments ago.

1528
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,642
He's a self-employed painter.

1529
01:55:51,651 --> 01:55:59,475
and he used to be allowed to park behind the building and he just received a letter that he can no longer do so because he's now part of the Tenants Association.

1530
01:56:01,516 --> 01:56:09,261
There was a story in the Boston Globe today about how renters are over-asking just like home buyers.

1531
01:56:10,201 --> 01:56:21,327
This is the state of housing in the greater Boston area and I can tell you with complete certainty that every one of the panicked tenants who fled in those first 30 days regrets it.

1532
01:56:22,282 --> 01:56:27,243
These tenants fled with no time to find a similar affordable apartment.

1533
01:56:28,983 --> 01:56:38,425
Massachusetts is one of the most progressive states in the country, yet it's legal to evict tenants through no fault of their own and give them only 30 days to vote.

1534
01:56:39,866 --> 01:56:52,168
To buy time, tenants must work closely with elected officials, as I'm here tonight, and apply public pressure through social media or rallies to bring attention to the unjust nature of the no-fault eviction.

1535
01:56:52,693 --> 01:56:55,474
and use the courts to try to stay in their homes.

1536
01:56:56,234 --> 01:56:57,995
This is the system in Massachusetts.

1537
01:56:59,295 --> 01:57:02,736
I'm not sure how you recover from this financially or emotionally.

1538
01:57:03,136 --> 01:57:13,160
If you're the family who lived next to me, who is now paying $700 more per month plus heat because they took the first available apartment in that 30 day window.

1539
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:19,982
Their dreams of a home for their eight year old boy in the Medford school system are now on hold.

1540
01:57:21,249 --> 01:57:31,131
or the teacher or senior who are now paying so much more for less because they didn't feel the luxury to find something they could actually afford within the 30 days.

1541
01:57:33,091 --> 01:57:41,113
There should be a better and more just process for no fault evictions, which also stay on your record for future landlords to discover.

1542
01:57:41,973 --> 01:57:44,954
Victims of no fault evictions are victimized twice.

1543
01:57:46,814 --> 01:57:50,395
So there are many points of view with this and many proposed solutions.

1544
01:57:51,081 --> 01:57:56,243
Perhaps a six month timeframe should become the law to allow tenants to land on their feet.

1545
01:57:57,323 --> 01:58:05,546
Perhaps tenants should have the first right of refusal to choose to stay at a higher rent or purchase their unit if it's being converted to condos.

1546
01:58:06,706 --> 01:58:11,247
Perhaps rent control 2.2 is the answer to address skyrocketing rents.

1547
01:58:12,188 --> 01:58:19,650
Something needs to be done because tenants like myself will continue to use one of the only tools available to us, the courts.

1548
01:58:20,193 --> 01:58:24,475
to fight to stay in their homes and or buy more time to find something else.

1549
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:27,917
No one wins in this outdated system.

1550
01:58:28,097 --> 01:58:32,120
It only feeds into the larger housing crisis and ties up the courts.

1551
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:44,387
When I first came before you in April, I reluctantly mentioned to Kit that I understood that the owner had the right to evict us and flip the building for higher profits.

1552
01:58:45,167 --> 01:58:48,469
And Kit very wisely told me, but at what cost?

1553
01:58:50,174 --> 01:59:03,022
There's an enormous human and societal cost to Savage's property grab, which has inhumanely displaced long-term tenants, seniors, people on Section 8, families, and working professionals.

1554
01:59:03,863 --> 01:59:09,186
The city and state aren't equipped for the flood of services needed to handle this crisis.

1555
01:59:09,826 --> 01:59:11,047
We need a new playbook.

1556
01:59:12,468 --> 01:59:16,951
There's a legal term, qui bono, and it means who benefits.

1557
01:59:18,111 --> 01:59:18,812
When Savage

1558
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:25,714
Purchases of property, tenants most certainly do not benefit, and neither does the community, only savage benefits.

1559
01:59:27,515 --> 01:59:29,276
And just a couple more points.

1560
01:59:29,776 --> 01:59:32,577
With remote work, residents have choices.

1561
01:59:32,778 --> 01:59:39,321
It may be forced to live elsewhere or in another state altogether if this housing crisis isn't addressed on many levels.

1562
01:59:40,162 --> 01:59:46,045
We lose diversity in the rich fabric of our community when residents are displaced in favor of profits

1563
01:59:46,422 --> 01:59:49,484
with no safety net to catch them or break the fall.

1564
01:59:51,285 --> 01:59:55,689
And this was a note I scribbled as I came, was coming here tonight.

1565
01:59:55,789 --> 01:59:59,751
If we can't make this happen in here in Massachusetts, then where?

1566
02:00:00,412 --> 02:00:06,436
Massachusetts has been on the forefront of so many transformative laws and movements throughout history.

1567
02:00:07,157 --> 02:00:13,861
Let's make history again with comprehensive and compassionate changes to the tenant, landlord, owner laws.

1568
02:00:15,022 --> 02:00:16,083
That's it, thank you.

1569
02:00:17,502 --> 02:00:17,822
Thank you.

1570
02:00:18,303 --> 02:00:18,863
Councilor Collins.

1571
02:00:20,484 --> 02:00:21,365
Thank you, President Marillyn.

1572
02:00:21,525 --> 02:00:24,948
Thank you so much, Liza, for being here and for speaking for your association.

1573
02:00:25,068 --> 02:00:26,690
My fellow Councillors will indulge me.

1574
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:31,454
I just want to, again, thank you, Liza, and just draw out a couple things from what you said.

1575
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:40,922
As we had this discussion back in March, back in April, you know, I didn't want Liza to be here tonight on behalf of the Tenants Association because there's some action that we can take to

1576
02:00:41,862 --> 02:00:45,965
materially change their position right now, this week, this month.

1577
02:00:46,585 --> 02:00:47,986
They're well aware of the process.

1578
02:00:48,006 --> 02:00:51,449
They've been working with professional housing justice organizers.

1579
02:00:52,129 --> 02:00:53,970
They know the score and they know what they have to do next.

1580
02:00:54,110 --> 02:01:01,215
But as I think we're all very acutely aware, this is a phenomenon befalling our community.

1581
02:01:01,255 --> 02:01:02,436
It's been falling our community.

1582
02:01:02,676 --> 02:01:04,077
It's happening right now on Bradley Road.

1583
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:05,218
It's happening on Fells Way.

1584
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:07,900
It's happening at multiple properties in Medford.

1585
02:01:09,181 --> 02:01:11,002
We need to keep our focus on this.

1586
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:16,952
we need to keep shining a light on everywhere this happens in Medford.

1587
02:01:18,713 --> 02:01:25,035
Specific to the story on Bradley Road, I just want to draw out a couple of points to make sure that they're heard.

1588
02:01:26,116 --> 02:01:31,718
Firstly, that the line was these vacancies are being created so that we can renovate.

1589
02:01:32,258 --> 02:01:33,319
Renovations didn't happen.

1590
02:01:34,319 --> 02:01:38,821
Secondly, I think we talk often about the value of collective bargaining.

1591
02:01:39,378 --> 02:01:41,439
unionization and various circumstances.

1592
02:01:42,119 --> 02:01:44,939
And when this group of tenants sought to do that, they were punished for it.

1593
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:50,881
Materially, legally, they were punished for seeking to band together, to be in community with one another.

1594
02:01:51,821 --> 02:01:57,463
And it strikes me as a real double standard for who's allowed to exert pressure over a situation.

1595
02:01:58,583 --> 02:02:02,544
Given the state of the housing market regionally, not just in Medford, but regionally,

1596
02:02:03,564 --> 02:02:06,906
tenants and all sorts of residents are impacted by economic pressures.

1597
02:02:07,686 --> 02:02:19,612
When they seek to do what they can to stay in their homes, to stay in a community that they've invested in, that they have students in the public school system, that they've lived their whole lives here, that type of pressure is allowed to be penalized.

1598
02:02:19,692 --> 02:02:24,535
So again, I reiterate, I know there's no motion that we can pass tonight,

1599
02:02:25,272 --> 02:02:32,714
to make this expense, to make this anxiety, to make these months of work and trauma go away for these residents.

1600
02:02:33,554 --> 02:02:40,036
But I felt it was very important to put Liza's story and the Bradley Road Tenant Association story on public record.

1601
02:02:40,556 --> 02:02:41,477
Again, so thank you.

1602
02:02:43,037 --> 02:02:43,797
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1603
02:02:43,817 --> 02:02:44,478
Vice Mayor Behrs.

1604
02:02:45,998 --> 02:02:46,818
Thank you, Madam President.

1605
02:02:48,819 --> 02:02:49,559
Thank you, Liza.

1606
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:52,580
Thank you to the whole Tenants Association

1607
02:02:54,730 --> 02:02:58,111
you know, I'm sorry that we're at this point.

1608
02:02:58,711 --> 02:03:00,632
And I can say that I'm not living it.

1609
02:03:02,753 --> 02:03:05,494
I can only imagine how it feels and how it's felt for months.

1610
02:03:05,534 --> 02:03:10,556
And I know how people were feeling right when it happened and they jumped ship just to have something.

1611
02:03:10,616 --> 02:03:12,176
Cause that's, that's really how it feels.

1612
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:18,118
It's like you're suddenly you're maybe in a lifeboat for 30 or 60 days and you have to find another boat to get out.

1613
02:03:18,138 --> 02:03:19,039
That's not going to sink.

1614
02:03:19,479 --> 02:03:22,360
So you can keep going to work and have a roof over your head.

1615
02:03:22,934 --> 02:03:24,896
and have some sense of stability in your life.

1616
02:03:26,397 --> 02:03:29,300
That's the cost.

1617
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:35,706
At the forefront, we can talk about the city and the property taxes and an override.

1618
02:03:36,387 --> 02:03:41,471
The forefront of the cost of living issue in this community, the forefront of displacement,

1619
02:03:42,363 --> 02:03:56,856
And the people who are really getting hit the hardest when we talk about cost of living are renters who are living in buildings that are being treated purely as speculative investments by big developers, large companies, wealthy people.

1620
02:03:57,697 --> 02:04:04,543
The only thing they care about is they bought this thing, it's an investment, it's got to make money, end of story.

1621
02:04:05,363 --> 02:04:07,886
The rest of the equation doesn't matter to them.

1622
02:04:08,632 --> 02:04:22,838
I want to take what you said about qui bono and take it to a paradigm that I try to use and that I learned a long time ago is incredibly useful when you're talking about the intersection of political decisions and economics.

1623
02:04:22,999 --> 02:04:24,959
It's not just who benefits.

1624
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:28,281
It's who pays, who benefits, and who decides.

1625
02:04:29,121 --> 02:04:29,982
In this situation,

1626
02:04:31,035 --> 02:04:40,917
The only person that's benefiting is this property owner who's making a massive gain on a speculative investment in a housing market that doesn't care about people.

1627
02:04:43,486 --> 02:04:44,467
Who's paying?

1628
02:04:45,187 --> 02:04:46,929
We're paying, the city of Medford's paying.

1629
02:04:47,089 --> 02:04:51,713
We're paying, and I don't mean just the city itself, the city and its residents, that's who's paying.

1630
02:04:52,213 --> 02:04:59,839
These people are paying in anxiety, displacement, lack of stability, loss of community, exclusion.

1631
02:05:00,219 --> 02:05:09,787
We're paying as a city because we are no longer able to house people who wanna live here in a stable and affordable way that we've been able to do it a long time, for a long time.

1632
02:05:10,408 --> 02:05:18,274
And the only people, you know, this is the really twisted part, and we can slow down the decision and try to make an impact here and there, but who decides?

1633
02:05:19,415 --> 02:05:23,438
The person who's making the benefit is the only person who's deciding.

1634
02:05:24,779 --> 02:05:32,085
They're deciding to get rid of people for their own benefit and dump the costs onto their tenants, their residents, and onto us as a city.

1635
02:05:32,933 --> 02:05:35,817
That's a fundamentally unfair system.

1636
02:05:36,277 --> 02:05:41,044
And it's a fundamentally unfair thing for this community to have to face and for its residents to deal with.

1637
02:05:42,245 --> 02:05:47,853
Now, I think this speaks to why it's so important.

1638
02:05:48,643 --> 02:06:13,563
that this local council does the advocacy that we've been doing to our state delegation around the needed changes in state law to give communities like Medford tools to change the playbook and balance the equation so that it's not one party completely benefiting, you know, one other party completely paying the costs and no one being able to adjust that equation.

1639
02:06:14,224 --> 02:06:15,205
So I think, again,

1640
02:06:16,302 --> 02:06:18,323
There's things that we can try to do at the local level.

1641
02:06:18,743 --> 02:06:32,107
I think we should try to do them, have the conversations, move it along, paying a few bucks more so that we can have actually the level of staff support that we need to help people who are in housing crisis would be a start.

1642
02:06:32,687 --> 02:06:35,568
To have people who can support people through housing stability.

1643
02:06:36,228 --> 02:06:43,590
We have neighboring communities that have dozens of people where if you're a resident who's facing this problem, you can go to your city and someone will help you with your case.

1644
02:06:44,030 --> 02:06:45,491
They will help you through the process.

1645
02:06:46,717 --> 02:06:51,699
We have someone you can call who can kind of direct you somewhere else, but it's not the same level of support.

1646
02:06:52,779 --> 02:07:05,943
So when we're talking about helping the people most in need, the people most facing inequity, the people who are having the cost of living fight, that's the hardest in the community, they need support from their city government.

1647
02:07:06,603 --> 02:07:10,164
They need resources in their city government actually devoted to this problem.

1648
02:07:11,044 --> 02:07:12,445
We need to provide those.

1649
02:07:13,443 --> 02:07:27,087
They need a change in state law to balance the equation so that people are put first and that our communities are put first and not just the needs of whoever decides to buy whatever building whatever day to make however much money they want to make.

1650
02:07:28,507 --> 02:07:32,208
you know, we can keep going on and say, you know, I guess it's just about money.

1651
02:07:32,268 --> 02:07:35,088
That's what land and buildings and housing is all about.

1652
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,409
It's just about who can make the most money.

1653
02:07:38,089 --> 02:07:52,951
And the more that we do that, the more that you're gonna be in the situation where people can't live here, where the kids of people who grew up here can't live here, where people, you know, you don't have the diversity, racial, economic, social diversity that makes a community great.

1654
02:07:54,132 --> 02:07:56,052
All of the problems that we're talking about

1655
02:07:57,075 --> 02:08:00,576
As a community, this issue of housing is at the core of it.

1656
02:08:01,336 --> 02:08:26,163
And I know that I as one counselor will continue to push as hard as I can for the city to invest more resources in this crisis, for the city council and hopefully the city administration to advocate for the long overdue legal changes that we need at the state level to give us more tools, and hopefully throw out that old playbook and get a new one.

1657
02:08:26,894 --> 02:08:36,163
because the old playbook's not working for anybody except for the speculators who are making millions and millions and millions of dollars off of people's housing, from people's homes.

1658
02:08:37,785 --> 02:08:38,966
Now, I just said some nice things.

1659
02:08:39,006 --> 02:08:42,289
We'll see where it goes, but that's how I feel about it.

1660
02:08:42,549 --> 02:08:42,910
Thank you.

1661
02:08:44,051 --> 02:08:44,852
Supervisor Leopold.

1662
02:08:44,872 --> 02:08:49,216
We have a few members of the public who'd like to speak.

1663
02:08:50,826 --> 02:08:53,128
Anita Nagum, 9 Norton Ave, Medford.

1664
02:08:53,708 --> 02:08:55,150
I would just like to address one thing.

1665
02:08:55,250 --> 02:09:00,894
I don't know if you saw, but in the past week or two, Somerville's new zoning ordinance was upheld by a court.

1666
02:09:01,815 --> 02:09:06,259
It prohibits evictions for condo conversions for one year.

1667
02:09:06,699 --> 02:09:09,121
It gives tenants the right of first refusal.

1668
02:09:09,601 --> 02:09:13,024
So I would look into that and see if any of those things can be applied to Medford.

1669
02:09:13,084 --> 02:09:17,027
It was just upheld within, I'm going to say the past 10 days.

1670
02:09:18,509 --> 02:09:18,769
Thank you.

1671
02:09:21,278 --> 02:09:28,663
Would you like to speak?

1672
02:09:28,683 --> 02:09:29,583
No, he's good.

1673
02:09:30,144 --> 02:09:39,630
I'm going to say something that's probably a bit insensitive, but I'm going to fix it with a solution.

1674
02:09:41,011 --> 02:09:44,693
My godfather from Northern Italian dialect used to say to me,

1675
02:09:50,263 --> 02:09:55,271
On the first of the month, he who laughs and he or she who cries.

1676
02:09:55,291 --> 02:09:58,516
In other words, landlord tenant situations.

1677
02:09:59,157 --> 02:10:00,859
And I think what he meant by that was,

1678
02:10:01,954 --> 02:10:07,521
that if you can afford to buy the house, for some, even if they can, they don't want the headaches.

1679
02:10:07,601 --> 02:10:08,843
And I understand, believe me.

1680
02:10:09,524 --> 02:10:16,653
But eventually after 25, 30, 35 year payments, you own it free and clear, hopefully.

1681
02:10:17,033 --> 02:10:20,718
And then you are in control of your own destiny, hopefully.

1682
02:10:22,362 --> 02:10:25,323
So, there is a solution and you don't need the state for this.

1683
02:10:25,803 --> 02:10:35,107
You can do it right here, especially on that mile of Mystic Avenue, the old highway to Boston 38 could do it like New York City does to control your rents.

1684
02:10:35,807 --> 02:10:38,768
They have the cooperative housing I believe that's the term.

1685
02:10:39,648 --> 02:10:40,689
Have you heard of a council.

1686
02:10:41,529 --> 02:10:41,889
Thank you.

1687
02:10:42,569 --> 02:10:43,770
So, whether it's.

1688
02:10:44,718 --> 02:10:50,021
private or quasi government and quasi private, a mixture.

1689
02:10:50,601 --> 02:10:55,964
And you could, the rents would be locked in with minimal increases.

1690
02:10:57,885 --> 02:11:02,447
It can't be that hard to do if someone wants to get going.

1691
02:11:03,548 --> 02:11:06,930
But also in Vienna, Austria,

1692
02:11:08,498 --> 02:11:14,179
I cut out an article from the Boston Globe, but my wife has me throwing out papers, so I discarded it.

1693
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:22,241
It's a huge building, and it's quasi government and private, and everybody seems to be happy.

1694
02:11:22,541 --> 02:11:26,542
It's not like a development or a project type that we have here.

1695
02:11:26,562 --> 02:11:31,684
I mean, it has a swimming pools, it has everything.

1696
02:11:32,364 --> 02:11:35,905
So it can be done if somebody wants to do it.

1697
02:11:36,625 --> 02:11:37,325
Thank you for listening.

1698
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:38,842
Thank you, Mr. Casagrande.

1699
02:11:41,324 --> 02:11:43,825
Bill Giglio on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.

1700
02:11:54,134 --> 02:12:07,638
So, everything that the points that the tenants and Zachary as a saying as totally percent is a totally totally correct I mean the trauma, imagine the trauma and all that.

1701
02:12:08,258 --> 02:12:12,540
going with the tenant when they're asked to pay more rent.

1702
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:17,183
Now imagine on top of that, having an override and they have to pay even more on top of that.

1703
02:12:17,223 --> 02:12:19,884
So just, I need to think, people need to think about that.

1704
02:12:20,344 --> 02:12:25,547
My second point is, why was I shut off on, why was I disabled on the chat on this?

1705
02:12:25,967 --> 02:12:27,008
I can't figure out why.

1706
02:12:27,068 --> 02:12:30,990
Every week I'm getting to say, when as soon as I write something, other people aren't being disabled.

1707
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:32,390
Is there a reason why I'm being disabled?

1708
02:12:34,211 --> 02:12:35,752
The chat is disabled for everyone.

1709
02:12:36,635 --> 02:12:39,216
Then how is the things on the chat?

1710
02:12:39,356 --> 02:12:40,437
There's chats going on.

1711
02:12:41,637 --> 02:12:42,117
No, it's not.

1712
02:12:42,137 --> 02:12:43,138
It's disabled for everyone.

1713
02:12:44,959 --> 02:12:46,279
Okay, I'll send you the screenshot tomorrow.

1714
02:12:46,439 --> 02:12:49,621
It's most definitely.

1715
02:12:50,561 --> 02:12:51,001
Thank you.

1716
02:12:53,802 --> 02:12:59,985
On the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and place on file as seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1717
02:13:00,145 --> 02:13:01,646
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1718
02:13:08,842 --> 02:13:09,622
Vice President bears.

1719
02:13:09,782 --> 02:13:10,002
Yes.

1720
02:13:10,783 --> 02:13:11,443
Councilor Kerrio.

1721
02:13:11,623 --> 02:13:11,843
Yes.

1722
02:13:12,603 --> 02:13:13,304
Council Collins.

1723
02:13:13,644 --> 02:13:13,824
Yes.

1724
02:13:15,084 --> 02:13:15,604
Councilor night.

1725
02:13:15,664 --> 02:13:15,924
Yes.

1726
02:13:16,225 --> 02:13:16,945
Councilor scrub Kelly.

1727
02:13:21,546 --> 02:13:22,827
Councilor saying, Yes.

1728
02:13:24,047 --> 02:13:24,587
President Merrill.

1729
02:13:25,068 --> 02:13:25,248
Yes.

1730
02:13:25,768 --> 02:13:28,929
Six in the front of one absent during the night of the motion passes.

1731
02:14:00,513 --> 02:14:06,677
Paper 22-453, offered by President Morrell, Vice President Behrs, and Councilor Collins.

1732
02:14:07,357 --> 02:14:21,406
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Public Health and Community Safety Subcommittee meet to consider potential ordinances, policies, and regulations to strengthen the protection of reproductive rights for Medford residents and for people seeking medical care in Medford.

1733
02:14:21,666 --> 02:14:22,287
President Morrell.

1734
02:14:28,991 --> 02:14:37,298
We can see around the country that the reproductive rights of everyone are under attack, have been rolled back have been removed for countless people.

1735
02:14:38,139 --> 02:14:46,486
I know many may say that this is not a city issue but it's been made clear that these rights are being attacked at every single level, and there is no stopping point.

1736
02:14:46,946 --> 02:14:48,748
These are rights that when removed will

1737
02:14:49,732 --> 02:15:06,821
or do endanger the health, endanger the lives, endanger the future of individuals who seek reproductive care at so many different levels, whether it's abortion, whether it's miscarriage management, whether it's IVF, expanding families, making decisions that are right for families.

1738
02:15:06,881 --> 02:15:09,883
These are decisions that, these rights being removed,

1739
02:15:10,871 --> 02:15:15,693
and every level also tend to impact the most marginalized in our society who need these services.

1740
02:15:17,054 --> 02:15:26,859
And I just wanna make sure that we open the discussion, that we talk about what we can do on a city level to make sure that these rights that are enshrined, remain enshrined, that they remain protected.

1741
02:15:27,179 --> 02:15:30,561
We as elected officials are stewards of the residents.

1742
02:15:30,681 --> 02:15:33,563
And I've heard from countless residents who say, what can we do on the city level?

1743
02:15:33,903 --> 02:15:35,103
What can the city council do?

1744
02:15:36,124 --> 02:15:38,105
People are scared, they should be scared.

1745
02:15:38,523 --> 02:15:43,987
They have every right to be scared because rights are being rolled back across the country and nowhere safe, honestly.

1746
02:15:44,187 --> 02:15:49,330
And we need to do what we can to protect the reproductive health of residents.

1747
02:15:50,671 --> 02:15:51,031
Thank you.

1748
02:15:51,472 --> 02:15:52,392
Thank you, Madam President.

1749
02:15:52,732 --> 02:15:53,353
Councilor Collins.

1750
02:15:54,173 --> 02:15:54,594
Councilor Collins.

1751
02:15:55,754 --> 02:15:56,255
Thank you.

1752
02:15:56,375 --> 02:16:00,778
And thank my fellow councilors for putting this forward and allowing me to co-sponsor.

1753
02:16:00,798 --> 02:16:04,340
I think that President Morrell put it perfectly.

1754
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:06,362
And I think, you know,

1755
02:16:07,524 --> 02:16:12,147
In my mind, there's no need to defend why these local policies are necessary.

1756
02:16:13,448 --> 02:16:19,613
But, you know, where there is a need for explanation, I'd say, and this goes for anything, your rights exist until they don't.

1757
02:16:20,553 --> 02:16:29,600
And I think it's easy to feel in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, one of the, you know, overall bluest states in the nation, that this doesn't apply here.

1758
02:16:31,176 --> 02:16:32,276
That's true until it isn't.

1759
02:16:33,117 --> 02:16:38,659
And it's true in Massachusetts until it isn't, it's true in Medford until it isn't, that's true everywhere.

1760
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:52,725
And I think that the only responsible thing to do, I think I said this the last time we talked about reproductive justice and protecting medical care for women, for gender non-conforming people, for all types of people was on the agenda.

1761
02:16:52,745 --> 02:16:58,588
The way things are going, the failure to be progressive is regressive.

1762
02:16:59,048 --> 02:17:00,049
We need to be proactive.

1763
02:17:02,013 --> 02:17:04,234
All types of people's lives are at stake, so thank you.

1764
02:17:04,854 --> 02:17:05,675
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1765
02:17:05,755 --> 02:17:06,575
Councilor Sang.

1766
02:17:07,596 --> 02:17:09,877
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

1767
02:17:10,537 --> 02:17:14,959
I just wanted to say that I thank you three for putting this on the agenda.

1768
02:17:15,499 --> 02:17:19,481
I full-heartedly support this.

1769
02:17:19,661 --> 02:17:26,204
I also thank Councilor Collins for bringing up the item that we worked on

1770
02:17:28,105 --> 02:17:29,325
a few weeks ago, a few months ago.

1771
02:17:29,345 --> 02:17:39,769
And I'm glad to see that we have a resolution here that will advance the scope even further and to make sure that we really are truly addressing this issue at the local level.

1772
02:17:40,889 --> 02:17:46,251
Because President Morales is right that these fights are happening at every single level.

1773
02:17:46,671 --> 02:17:48,932
And oftentimes we even see in the news that

1774
02:17:50,072 --> 02:17:52,013
the, it can be a difference.

1775
02:17:52,753 --> 02:18:01,216
The difference can be seen in local ordinances and oftentimes that's what really determines, you know, the outcome of these fights.

1776
02:18:01,736 --> 02:18:09,359
And so I think it's absolutely necessary that we take the steps that we can as a city to protect the rights of our residents.

1777
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:13,761
I would also like to take this as an opportunity to

1778
02:18:14,841 --> 02:18:28,031
to say, you know, we, we want to make sure that we're, you know, we welcome people who might not be able to get that treatment in other states, but can come have have the means to come to Medford, or just stay in Medford overnight.

1779
02:18:28,592 --> 02:18:32,735
And, you know, it's important to affirm that support, I believe.

1780
02:18:34,511 --> 02:18:51,981
And with, unfortunately, what will be an influx of people seeking care in Massachusetts, I also think it's time to call on our state and our state leaders to address a need for demand when it comes to reproductive services, reproductive health care.

1781
02:18:52,381 --> 02:18:57,724
Because we're going to see increasing demand in our own state, and we want to make sure that everyone can get treatment.

1782
02:18:59,205 --> 02:19:01,769
We that means we have to work on our own capacity as well.

1783
02:19:02,249 --> 02:19:17,710
So, you know, we can we can imagine Massachusetts as a as a haven for reproductive health care, but we really do need to do more at the state level to to make sure that we can remain a haven for reproductive health care.

1784
02:19:19,872 --> 02:19:20,732
Thank you, Mr. President.

1785
02:19:20,772 --> 02:19:26,175
I want to thank President Morales for bringing this forward.

1786
02:19:26,215 --> 02:19:34,099
Women's reproductive rights are a very important issue, not just in Medford, but throughout the whole country.

1787
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:39,441
Some decisions were made recently that vastly affect them.

1788
02:19:41,822 --> 02:19:42,623
I would think that

1789
02:19:43,935 --> 02:19:47,988
Strengthening them only helps our community, helps people in our community.

1790
02:19:50,985 --> 02:19:55,248
I had some conversation with the people from Tufts and Hallmark.

1791
02:19:55,989 --> 02:20:03,794
And I think one of the discussions they're looking to do is take the third floor of the hospital and make it for women's health issues.

1792
02:20:04,135 --> 02:20:07,357
So maybe we may want to invite them to that meeting.

1793
02:20:08,478 --> 02:20:15,523
And I think they understand the importance of this for women, not just in Metro, but throughout the country.

1794
02:20:15,563 --> 02:20:17,104
And I say, you know, if their daughters

1795
02:20:19,629 --> 02:20:31,283
I understand the issues that go along with this, and I support this, but I did want you to know that I did have some conversation with them, and if you could invite them to the meeting, because I know that is in there.

1796
02:20:32,204 --> 02:20:38,351
Someone said that they're in discussion to put on a whole floor of women's things, and that was something that I

1797
02:20:40,093 --> 02:20:57,375
asked him to do when back when they were when the hospital was closing and uh was asking from i said we we don't have anything for women in this community and i i thought that say five years ago i thought that was an important issue and i still think it's an important issue now and i support this whole heartedly thank you that's for real i'd be happy to accept that as an amendment

1798
02:20:57,956 --> 02:20:59,237
Thank you, Councilor Caravaglio.

1799
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:10,468
On the motion of President Morrell to send this resolution to the Public Health and Community Safety Subcommittee, seconded by Councilor Collins as amended by Councilor Caravaglio.

1800
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:14,872
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, you may call the roll.

1801
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:27,881
and I'm not seeing any public participation.

1802
02:21:28,961 --> 02:21:32,583
I guess I'm the Montessori liaison, so I will reach out to Montessori for you.

1803
02:21:33,864 --> 02:21:36,005
I will do that this week before you go on vacation.

1804
02:21:38,146 --> 02:21:38,446
All right.

1805
02:21:40,467 --> 02:21:41,128
Councilor Kerrio.

1806
02:21:41,488 --> 02:21:41,968
Yes.

1807
02:21:42,769 --> 02:21:43,409
Councilor Collins.

1808
02:21:44,089 --> 02:21:44,289
Yes.

1809
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:45,850
Councilor Knight.

1810
02:21:48,332 --> 02:21:49,152
Councilor Scarpelli.

1811
02:21:51,033 --> 02:21:51,573
Councilor Seng.

1812
02:21:52,113 --> 02:21:52,354
Yes.

1813
02:21:54,175 --> 02:21:54,675
President Morrell.

1814
02:21:55,902 --> 02:21:56,702
Vice President Bears.

1815
02:21:56,983 --> 02:22:00,264
Yes, five in the affirmative, none in the negative, two absent.

1816
02:22:00,304 --> 02:22:01,505
The motion passes.

1817
02:22:28,306 --> 02:22:31,889
22-454 offered by Vice President Behrs, Councilor Collins, and Councilor Sang.

1818
02:22:32,049 --> 02:22:43,700
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the City Administration provide a detailed update on the current blocked off connection between Medford and Somerville on East Albion Street, and whether that could be opened to allow pedestrian and bike access in that neighborhood.

1819
02:22:44,421 --> 02:22:45,162
Vice President Behrs?

1820
02:22:45,362 --> 02:22:46,403
Thank you, Madam President.

1821
02:22:47,424 --> 02:22:50,107
I sent an email to the City Administration about this.

1822
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:55,562
10, 9, 10 months ago, kind of hit a dead end at the time.

1823
02:22:55,582 --> 02:22:58,483
We've since cycled through to a new fire chief.

1824
02:22:59,484 --> 02:23:07,808
And I have sent a request but I'm awaiting a response and I would just, essentially what this is about is East Albion Street crosses Medford and Somerville.

1825
02:23:08,309 --> 02:23:09,910
Currently it's completely blocked off.

1826
02:23:11,019 --> 02:23:13,380
So no pedestrian access, no bike access.

1827
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:22,885
There are some park facilities at Medford, some park facilities in Somerville right next door that would make sense to connect and provide added benefits to residents of both communities.

1828
02:23:23,585 --> 02:23:38,893
And I would just like to ask my fellow counselors to ask the city administration for an update on whether that barrier is city controlled, private controlled, controlled by the city of Somerville, and what are ways that we can make improvements there to allow for pedestrian and bike access.

1829
02:23:41,505 --> 02:23:42,085
Councilor Collins.

1830
02:23:42,666 --> 02:23:43,446
Thank you, President Morrell.

1831
02:23:43,466 --> 02:23:55,453
Yes, just echoing that, you know, this would be good to know where to start with this sense and figure out our next steps from there so that we can have a usable through way for pedestrians.

1832
02:23:55,694 --> 02:23:55,974
Thank you.

1833
02:23:56,434 --> 02:23:56,674
Thank you.

1834
02:23:57,054 --> 02:23:58,375
Councilor Sang, would you like to speak on this?

1835
02:24:01,437 --> 02:24:05,960
I believe that my colleagues have covered it pretty well, but you know, this is about accessibility.

1836
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,921
This is about improving our community.

1837
02:24:07,961 --> 02:24:11,003
I think these are basic goals that all of us share.

1838
02:24:12,977 --> 02:24:13,777
Thank you.

1839
02:24:14,278 --> 02:24:15,038
Any further discussion?

1840
02:24:17,219 --> 02:24:24,543
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1841
02:24:34,329 --> 02:24:36,050
Vice President Behrs?

1842
02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:36,390
Yes.

1843
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:37,551
Councilor Kerrio?

1844
02:24:37,711 --> 02:24:37,931
Yes.

1845
02:24:39,032 --> 02:24:39,672
Councilor Collins?

1846
02:24:39,792 --> 02:24:40,012
Yes.

1847
02:24:40,713 --> 02:24:41,213
Councilor Knight?

1848
02:24:44,098 --> 02:24:44,819
Councilor Scarpelli.

1849
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:47,060
Councilor Seng.

1850
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:47,861
Yes.

1851
02:24:49,121 --> 02:24:49,642
President Morrell.

1852
02:24:50,202 --> 02:24:51,963
Yes.

1853
02:24:52,023 --> 02:24:57,067
Five in the affirmative, two absent, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1854
02:24:57,087 --> 02:25:09,575
22-455 offered by vices and bears and Councilor Seng, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration provide an update regarding the city's application for federal funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law and whether or not the city will be applying for the Safe Streets for All

1855
02:25:10,202 --> 02:25:19,406
SS4A grant to create a Vision Zero Action Plan and or the Reconnecting Communities pilot to explore mitigation to the historic and ongoing impact of highway construction on our community.

1856
02:25:19,786 --> 02:25:20,506
Vice President Behrs.

1857
02:25:20,946 --> 02:25:21,907
Thank you, Madam President.

1858
02:25:22,867 --> 02:25:26,489
And thank you, Councilor Senk, for co-sponsoring with me.

1859
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:31,591
I think as folks know, last year, the U.S.

1860
02:25:31,611 --> 02:25:39,714
Congress and the President signed, passed and the President signed a bipartisan infrastructure law allocating hundreds of billions of dollars for infrastructure.

1861
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:42,129
to states and municipalities.

1862
02:25:43,129 --> 02:25:55,114
I'm interested both in generally what of those funds the city has applied for or is looking to access and also specifically to grant programs, Safe Streets for All, which would allow us to create a Vision Zero action plan.

1863
02:25:55,174 --> 02:26:00,215
Vision Zero means that we would have zero fatalities on our streets.

1864
02:26:00,756 --> 02:26:06,738
This is personally important to me as someone who has lost someone close to me in a traffic collision.

1865
02:26:08,185 --> 02:26:24,407
And also the reconnecting communities pilot that's a program it's in a pilot this year and I think they're looking to expand it to a full program and future fiscal years, which is all about the impact of the construction of highways and those divided communities, as we know, Medford.

1866
02:26:25,508 --> 02:26:29,209
lost entire neighborhoods when they built a highway right through the middle of the city.

1867
02:26:29,869 --> 02:26:38,692
And also we have the overpass on Route 16 as well, which takes up a surprising amount of space if you actually start to look at the square footage of that whole intersection.

1868
02:26:39,312 --> 02:26:46,974
So I do think it would be great if the city could apply for that program as well to look at if there's ways that the federal government

1869
02:26:48,132 --> 02:26:58,998
is now willing to fund mitigation and reparative action to the funding that they put into the highway system in the 1950s and 60s that had such negative impacts on communities.

1870
02:26:59,238 --> 02:27:01,479
So that's the intent of this resolution.

1871
02:27:02,099 --> 02:27:06,402
And I move to approve and send this to the city administration.

1872
02:27:09,537 --> 02:27:10,778
Thank you, President Morrell.

1873
02:27:12,359 --> 02:27:14,841
I think this is also fairly straightforward.

1874
02:27:14,901 --> 02:27:22,926
You know, I mean, given our discussions after in the last two months, we know that we need to be applying for funds wherever we can.

1875
02:27:23,647 --> 02:27:26,629
We need to be taking advantage of every single opportunity that we can.

1876
02:27:26,729 --> 02:27:29,210
And so, you know, this is us being proactive.

1877
02:27:30,652 --> 02:27:41,703
When it comes to vision zero when it comes to when it comes to vision zero you know that's something that our council has already supported on one of counselor bears is vice president bears his motions back a few months ago.

1878
02:27:42,964 --> 02:27:45,606
And I think the benefits of it are.

1879
02:27:46,347 --> 02:27:47,147
extremely clear.

1880
02:27:47,748 --> 02:28:00,312
And when it comes to mitigating the historic and ongoing impact of highway construction, you know, this is something that sociologists and a lot of researchers have said

1881
02:28:01,487 --> 02:28:11,535
is one of the massive barriers to equity and has been one of the massive barriers to equity and equality in local communities, especially in suburban communities like ours.

1882
02:28:12,155 --> 02:28:22,563
And so I think from an extra dimension, from an equity lens, this is another important part of this resolution.

1883
02:28:24,985 --> 02:28:25,306
Thank you.

1884
02:28:28,112 --> 02:28:36,855
not to belabor something I'm sure we'll all support and get a request on, but another piece of that reconnecting communities is, you know, mitigation of sound, right?

1885
02:28:36,875 --> 02:28:40,096
We've been working on sound barriers on the Fountain Street for a long time.

1886
02:28:40,156 --> 02:28:43,316
Representative Donato has been working on that as long as, as well as many councilors.

1887
02:28:43,336 --> 02:28:45,157
I think we've all sent resolutions in support of that.

1888
02:28:45,777 --> 02:28:54,640
There was a report out recently that put us as one of the top communities for lowered health and life expectancy due to the pollutants of highways.

1889
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:55,640
I happen to live

1890
02:28:56,750 --> 02:29:00,771
You know, I look at the highway every day outside of the windows of my house.

1891
02:29:00,851 --> 02:29:02,191
I happen to live very close to one.

1892
02:29:03,271 --> 02:29:15,793
And I, you know, hope that the position of our house and whatever else means that we're a little safer than other people, but we have a very high level of health impacts from pollution, from motor traffic as well.

1893
02:29:16,633 --> 02:29:20,754
So those are just some of the additional things that I think apply on this mitigation.

1894
02:29:20,794 --> 02:29:24,755
And hopefully we can bring in some federal money to address those impacts.

1895
02:29:24,775 --> 02:29:25,035
Thank you.

1896
02:29:26,619 --> 02:29:27,359
Any further discussion?

1897
02:29:29,841 --> 02:29:33,103
On the motion of Vice President Behrs is seconded by Councilor Seng.

1898
02:29:34,123 --> 02:29:35,144
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1899
02:29:43,148 --> 02:29:44,029
Vice President Behrs?

1900
02:29:44,609 --> 02:29:44,809
Yes.

1901
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:45,970
Councilor Kerrio?

1902
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:46,410
Yes.

1903
02:29:47,911 --> 02:29:48,552
Councilor Collins?

1904
02:29:48,952 --> 02:29:49,152
Yes.

1905
02:29:49,592 --> 02:29:50,072
Councilor Knight?

1906
02:29:50,433 --> 02:29:50,633
Yes.

1907
02:29:51,413 --> 02:29:52,114
Councilor Scarpelli?

1908
02:29:52,154 --> 02:29:52,494
Yes.

1909
02:29:52,914 --> 02:29:53,454
Councilor Seng?

1910
02:29:54,015 --> 02:29:54,195
Yes.

1911
02:29:56,029 --> 02:29:56,609
President Morrell.

1912
02:29:56,969 --> 02:30:18,695
Yes, seven in front of zero the negative motion passes to two dash 456 offer by various affairs and counselor Collins be resolved by the Memphis City Council to the national grid that national grid provide information on the persistent power outages affecting multiple met for neighborhoods and why they're occurring, be it further resolved that national group provide updated plans regarding infrastructure improvements to the local electric power infrastructure to the city of Medford.

1913
02:30:20,930 --> 02:30:21,711
Thank you, Madam President.

1914
02:30:21,751 --> 02:30:23,993
Thank you, Councilor Collins for co sponsoring this with me.

1915
02:30:24,054 --> 02:30:29,679
I think this was actually even something that I submitted before the latest round of outages that we saw.

1916
02:30:31,061 --> 02:30:33,864
Obviously, we had some storm induced outages over the past few days.

1917
02:30:33,924 --> 02:30:36,566
That's something you can't necessarily mitigate for.

1918
02:30:36,586 --> 02:30:40,731
Although if our utilities were underground, then that wouldn't be a problem that we would have.

1919
02:30:41,471 --> 02:30:41,992
But you know,

1920
02:30:42,681 --> 02:30:48,567
National Grid's only making a couple billion in profits off of the people of Massachusetts every year, so they can't be asked to do too much.

1921
02:30:50,409 --> 02:30:59,920
Essentially, here we have had outages at really unexpected times in South Medford, multiple times impacting residents, obviously, in the many ways that power outages impact them.

1922
02:31:00,580 --> 02:31:02,222
It's even worse now with remote work, though.

1923
02:31:02,262 --> 02:31:04,384
You have people at home that can't work for a few hours.

1924
02:31:05,722 --> 02:31:07,604
So, you know, we've had some up in the heights.

1925
02:31:07,824 --> 02:31:12,709
We had a pretty long power outage recently, which is longer than I can remember.

1926
02:31:13,349 --> 02:31:20,476
And then, you know, so I want to know if there's a current issue that's made our grid in worse condition than it's been in the past.

1927
02:31:21,277 --> 02:31:24,840
Now, whether that's demand or infrastructure, I don't know, but I'd like to have the answer.

1928
02:31:25,761 --> 02:31:27,383
And then there's this larger question of

1929
02:31:28,410 --> 02:31:38,296
You know, we had some folks here recently, I think from National Grid, and I asked them, are we planning to bury any of the utilities on, I mean, it may have been Winthrop Street, I can't remember where it was, but, and they basically said no.

1930
02:31:39,016 --> 02:31:44,679
Now we're about to, we just saw, it hasn't been quite passed yet, but it got through the Senate, right?

1931
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:48,422
Massive investment in electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging.

1932
02:31:48,882 --> 02:31:54,685
We have climate change and the heat waves that we've been going through that are putting much more demand in our electrical grid.

1933
02:31:55,486 --> 02:31:57,567
And I could go on and on and on and on,

1934
02:31:58,303 --> 02:32:01,064
Um, but and then you have storm impact, right?

1935
02:32:01,124 --> 02:32:03,084
Because we have so much above ground utility.

1936
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:07,225
So in addition to is there a short term problem in the short term plan?

1937
02:32:07,846 --> 02:32:19,749
I'd like to know how much of the billions of dollars in profits National Grid is planning to plow back into our infrastructure so it's ready for the additional electric needs that we're gonna have over the next 5-10 years.

1938
02:32:20,089 --> 02:32:21,389
Thank you, Madam President.

1939
02:32:23,410 --> 02:32:23,950
Councilor Collins.

1940
02:32:24,951 --> 02:32:25,373
Thank you.

1941
02:32:25,393 --> 02:32:26,276
Um, yes.

1942
02:32:26,317 --> 02:32:26,537
Thank you.

1943
02:32:26,578 --> 02:32:27,702
Vice president bears first.

1944
02:32:27,762 --> 02:32:28,706
You're hurting this resolution.

1945
02:32:29,766 --> 02:32:32,427
have been hearing a lot about these power outages.

1946
02:32:32,847 --> 02:32:34,847
For me, I mostly hear about it from folks in hillsides.

1947
02:32:34,947 --> 02:32:40,449
I'm shocked it hasn't affected my apartment building yet, which probably means in the next couple of days, since I'm saying that out loud.

1948
02:32:41,249 --> 02:32:48,871
But, you know, we were just talking earlier tonight about poor communication, you know, a feeling of lack of respect from some of the entities that affect life here in Medford.

1949
02:32:49,391 --> 02:32:52,331
To me, National Grid is top of that list, especially lately.

1950
02:32:52,972 --> 02:32:56,972
I think we deserve to know why these problems are happening more frequently.

1951
02:32:57,513 --> 02:32:59,253
And as Vice President Behrs just said,

1952
02:33:00,314 --> 02:33:23,088
in the past time to be thinking long term, I wanna know, even if it's in the beginning stages of strategy for how we're going to protect our utilities, protect our increased load for electricity, protect against increased vulnerability because of increasingly intense storms that we know are coming, that are only gonna get more intense in future years, what is the plan?

1953
02:33:23,868 --> 02:33:26,670
I think that municipalities should be included in those discussions.

1954
02:33:28,768 --> 02:33:30,008
and I'm eager to hear it.

1955
02:33:30,508 --> 02:33:30,888
Thank you.

1956
02:33:31,789 --> 02:33:32,069
Thank you.

1957
02:33:32,789 --> 02:33:33,849
Councilor Carvalho.

1958
02:33:33,869 --> 02:33:34,709
Thank you, Madam President.

1959
02:33:34,989 --> 02:33:36,490
This isn't just a metric problem.

1960
02:33:36,550 --> 02:33:37,390
It's a national problem.

1961
02:33:37,650 --> 02:33:38,630
It starts in Washington.

1962
02:33:39,030 --> 02:33:44,431
I mean, we're being told that this, that the grid isn't gonna be able to hold up at some point.

1963
02:33:44,511 --> 02:33:52,573
And there's been, I know there's some investment in it, but it starts in Washington where this grid

1964
02:33:54,232 --> 02:33:55,834
should be rebuilt.

1965
02:33:56,214 --> 02:33:59,898
It's ancient and no money has been spent on it in many, many years.

1966
02:34:01,560 --> 02:34:02,201
People don't know.

1967
02:34:02,501 --> 02:34:03,943
National Grid is not an American company.

1968
02:34:03,963 --> 02:34:04,964
It's owned by a British company.

1969
02:34:07,432 --> 02:34:10,994
I don't think the Brits really care about what goes on over here in Massachusetts.

1970
02:34:11,514 --> 02:34:25,461
But again, this is a national problem, and it should be dealt with in Washington and work its way across the whole country so that the grid is replaced to handle the needs going forward in this country.

1971
02:34:25,481 --> 02:34:28,202
And as of now, it's not being met.

1972
02:34:28,222 --> 02:34:31,243
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

1973
02:34:32,404 --> 02:34:32,824
Councilor Knight.

1974
02:34:33,264 --> 02:34:34,345
Madam President, thank you very much.

1975
02:34:35,599 --> 02:34:45,996
As we've discussed in the past, the city of metric right now is undergoing, it's probably the largest electrical infrastructure project that it's seen in 40 years with the other source pipeline project.

1976
02:34:46,096 --> 02:34:46,276
And if.

1977
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:51,963
We talked back to 2013-2014 when this project first was discussed.

1978
02:34:52,743 --> 02:35:05,350
One of the reasons that this project needed to come to play was because of the grid on the East Coast region and rolling brownouts that were occurring and the like, because the grid did not have the capacity to deal with the volume that's on it.

1979
02:35:06,090 --> 02:35:11,853
So, when we talk about, you know, why are these power outages happening?

1980
02:35:12,193 --> 02:35:15,114
I think that's something that we're well aware of and we've known about for the better part of a decade.

1981
02:35:16,034 --> 02:35:19,716
And, you know, we're in the process of a construction project that's attempting to address it in a regional fashion.

1982
02:35:20,816 --> 02:35:23,077
So that's something I point to keep in mind.

1983
02:35:23,117 --> 02:35:32,201
And also, because this construction project's going on, the load's being distributed to other parts of our grid, which is putting additional pressure on our grid, right?

1984
02:35:32,221 --> 02:35:33,902
So that coupled with, you know, the heat wave,

1985
02:35:34,802 --> 02:35:41,844
And the amount of people that are cranking up the ACs, I think, has put some strain on the remaining infrastructure that's in place here in our community.

1986
02:35:42,204 --> 02:35:46,025
At least that's what I've been able to read up on and what I've been able to find out and speak with Mr. Gilligan.

1987
02:35:46,806 --> 02:35:48,746
So with that being said, I move approval of the paper.

1988
02:35:48,766 --> 02:35:50,587
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1989
02:35:50,807 --> 02:35:51,627
Any further discussion?

1990
02:35:53,808 --> 02:35:57,069
On the motion of Councilor Knight, it's seconded by Councilor Collins.

1991
02:35:57,109 --> 02:35:58,129
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1992
02:36:05,862 --> 02:36:06,702
Vice President bears?

1993
02:36:07,342 --> 02:36:07,602
Yes.

1994
02:36:08,802 --> 02:36:09,503
Councilor Kerrio?

1995
02:36:09,723 --> 02:36:09,963
Yes.

1996
02:36:10,903 --> 02:36:11,543
Councilor Collins?

1997
02:36:11,743 --> 02:36:11,983
Yes.

1998
02:36:12,723 --> 02:36:13,243
Councilor Knight?

1999
02:36:13,283 --> 02:36:13,423
Yes.

2000
02:36:13,443 --> 02:36:14,824
Councilor Scarpelli?

2001
02:36:15,044 --> 02:36:15,204
Yes.

2002
02:36:15,844 --> 02:36:16,404
Councilor Singh?

2003
02:36:16,884 --> 02:36:17,124
Yes.

2004
02:36:18,624 --> 02:36:19,124
President Morrell?

2005
02:36:19,404 --> 02:36:19,584
Yes.

2006
02:36:19,604 --> 02:36:30,966
7-0 negative the motion passes.

2007
02:36:31,326 --> 02:36:35,627
We took participation earlier, but things could have been misconstrued.

2008
02:36:38,104 --> 02:36:40,286
Okay, we have just a few more items.

2009
02:36:40,506 --> 02:36:41,207
I do apologize.

2010
02:36:41,507 --> 02:36:47,952
How many more items do you have?

2011
02:36:48,152 --> 02:36:49,433
We have four or five more items.

2012
02:36:51,415 --> 02:36:51,655
Thank you.

2013
02:36:52,756 --> 02:36:56,177
After this, could you step up?

2014
02:36:56,198 --> 02:36:56,438
Thank you.

2015
02:36:56,538 --> 02:37:08,262
Q2-457 offered by Bison Bears being resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration provide an update on the tools and devices used to paint lines on city-owned playing fields, including how they were acquired, how much they cost, and expected lifespan.

2016
02:37:09,295 --> 02:37:09,935
Vice President Behrs.

2017
02:37:10,055 --> 02:37:11,216
Thank you, Madam President.

2018
02:37:12,117 --> 02:37:15,338
This is truly a question of curiosity.

2019
02:37:16,859 --> 02:37:21,822
Looks like we have small machines used to pick lines on city-owned fields that I hadn't seen before.

2020
02:37:21,862 --> 02:37:27,525
And I'm just interested to know what the acquisition process was for those and how long we can expect it to last.

2021
02:37:28,566 --> 02:37:29,046
Move approved.

2022
02:37:30,427 --> 02:37:34,909
Further discussion on the motion of Vice President Behrs as seconded by Councilor Knight.

2023
02:37:34,949 --> 02:37:35,990
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2024
02:37:44,128 --> 02:37:44,248
Yes.

2025
02:37:44,268 --> 02:37:44,408
Yes.

2026
02:37:44,469 --> 02:37:44,769
Yes.

2027
02:37:44,809 --> 02:37:44,949
Yes.

2028
02:37:46,071 --> 02:37:46,231
Yes.

2029
02:38:23,889 --> 02:38:36,283
22 dash 458 offered by counselor saying be it so resolved that the Metro City Council asked the MBTA to reinstate the 325 326 and 710 bus routes, given the planned closure one month closure of the orange line.

2030
02:38:37,183 --> 02:38:45,592
beginning on August 19th, ensure that there are sufficient shuttle buses for Orange Line communities, especially for the state primary election on September 6th.

2031
02:38:45,892 --> 02:38:53,480
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council supports federal officials' calls for the elimination of subway and bus fares while the Orange Line service changes are in place,

2032
02:38:54,547 --> 02:39:05,795
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council ask the city administration to inform residents of changes to Orange Line service and of alternatives such as free commuter rail services to zone 1A, 1B and zone 2 stations.

2033
02:39:06,115 --> 02:39:16,883
And be it further resolved that the city council ask the city administration to work with MBTA and solicit feedback from the community to see how Medford can mitigate increases to traffic.

2034
02:39:17,123 --> 02:39:17,844
Councilor say.

2035
02:39:18,878 --> 02:39:20,539
Thank you, Vice President bears.

2036
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:32,369
Um, we all have, I'm sure at this by this point we've all heard about the planned one month closure of the orange line, starting for August 19, I believe it goes until September 20.

2037
02:39:32,969 --> 02:39:36,652
You know this this is a massive inconvenience for anyone who uses orange line.

2038
02:39:37,813 --> 02:39:41,196
I used to growing up, I still use it to visit my parents.

2039
02:39:42,517 --> 02:39:47,201
Many, many, many people use it for work, you know, Wellington is one of the most popular stations.

2040
02:39:47,861 --> 02:39:53,306
And we have a lot of North Medford residents who use Malden Center Station as well.

2041
02:39:54,467 --> 02:39:57,449
This is going to be a massive headache for many of our residents.

2042
02:39:59,270 --> 02:40:08,956
I believe it's, you know, we all know how the MBTA is great at listening, but I believe that it is our job to push for as much as we can.

2043
02:40:08,976 --> 02:40:14,260
The first part is a nod to the work that our counselors have already done.

2044
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:22,648
the councillors who've come before me, and who are still with us today, have already done regarding the 325 326 and 710 the circumstances now are new.

2045
02:40:22,688 --> 02:40:24,210
And so we should just push again, in my opinion.

2046
02:40:31,037 --> 02:40:37,619
You know, there's also been a lot of concern about the number of shuttle buses, how many passengers they can take.

2047
02:40:37,939 --> 02:40:47,782
The numbers that the MBTA has kind of suggested just don't line up with the MBTA's own data with regards to how many people ride the Orange Line on a daily basis.

2048
02:40:47,962 --> 02:40:57,065
And this is going to be especially a huge problem for the primary election on September 6th, because it's going to force a lot of our voters to have to reconsider their plans and

2049
02:40:58,845 --> 02:41:04,990
you know, they might not even be able to make it from work to vote.

2050
02:41:05,250 --> 02:41:11,755
And so I think that's particularly an important point that should be made.

2051
02:41:12,896 --> 02:41:22,244
Our federal officials, many federal officials, including our representatives and senators, have called for the elimination of subway and bus fares.

2052
02:41:24,359 --> 02:41:30,985
especially noted that the Congress has given money for the MBT to use to for this purpose.

2053
02:41:31,685 --> 02:41:39,071
And it's up to the MBT leadership to decide whether in the state leadership to decide whether they choose to take that route.

2054
02:41:39,211 --> 02:41:48,419
I believe that this is something that would really benefit, at least mitigate some of the negative effects of, of the Orange Line closures.

2055
02:41:50,520 --> 02:42:06,137
We also, the MBTA has announced that if you do hold a Charlie card, that you can show your Charlie card on a Purple Line train, a commuter rail train, and you can ride it for free as long as you're coming

2056
02:42:07,300 --> 02:42:11,424
from them to a zone 1A, zone 1B, and zone 2 station.

2057
02:42:12,845 --> 02:42:23,254
So for a lot of Medford residents, West Medford and North Station, West Medford and Malden Center are stations that they can get on trains with.

2058
02:42:23,374 --> 02:42:30,420
And the MBTA has also said that the Haverhill line will stop at Malden Center during the closures.

2059
02:42:31,341 --> 02:42:40,585
Um, and the last part of this is just to ask the city administration to, um, work with them be to try our best to work with the MBTA and to really.

2060
02:42:41,545 --> 02:42:59,952
At the very least on our own end, um, expect that they're going to be increases in in car traffic and road traffic, given the closures and to see what we can do, um, to mitigate, uh, the negative effects and to make sure that, you know, traffic people can get to work as fast as possible.

2061
02:43:01,341 --> 02:43:01,981
Thank you.

2062
02:43:03,362 --> 02:43:04,042
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

2063
02:43:04,082 --> 02:43:05,823
Any further comments from members of the Council?

2064
02:43:05,843 --> 02:43:12,966
I will just say, for one, thank you, Councilor Sang, for putting this on the agenda.

2065
02:43:14,306 --> 02:43:21,269
You know, as it seems to be always at the MBTA, there's nice headlines, or maybe not so nice headlines, or the devils of the details.

2066
02:43:22,130 --> 02:43:30,293
So far, I've seen some communications back and forth with municipalities that are less than encouraging, but I support this resolution.

2067
02:43:30,788 --> 02:43:34,571
Is there any public participation regarding this or any MBTA issues?

2068
02:43:37,153 --> 02:43:38,554
Name and address for the record, please.

2069
02:43:39,055 --> 02:43:40,636
Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street.

2070
02:43:41,336 --> 02:43:50,364
If you recall, I was before the council in June and again last month in July about the proposal to eliminate Medford buses.

2071
02:43:51,881 --> 02:44:03,423
When I was here before, I told you I had about 8,000 petition signatures, I mean 800, excuse me, petition signatures opposing the changes that the MBTA was going to make.

2072
02:44:04,263 --> 02:44:13,405
Since then, we've collected more and July 28th was the day that we submitted the proposals to the petitions to the MBTA.

2073
02:44:13,485 --> 02:44:16,525
We had 1696 Medford petitions

2074
02:44:21,045 --> 02:44:30,053
and signatures, and we had 330, some of them petition signatures, or total of over 2,026 petitions that we submitted.

2075
02:44:30,793 --> 02:44:40,001
Now, this kind of came about because I met Pat Jelen, and she kind of helped us get involved here with the media part of it.

2076
02:44:40,782 --> 02:44:47,248
But when I was here before, you asked for a copy of the petition that we had, and I produced one here

2077
02:44:48,005 --> 02:44:49,306
for the Medford City Council.

2078
02:44:50,347 --> 02:44:51,108
There's two parts.

2079
02:44:51,348 --> 02:44:55,913
There's the Medford portion, and then there's one for the, one of the buses, 96 only.

2080
02:44:56,053 --> 02:45:06,042
I've also prepared a cover letter with about a dozen, eight or 10 points here for the councilors that,

2081
02:45:07,367 --> 02:45:10,749
that goes over the different points here.

2082
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:16,893
Some of which is the communications, which was non-existent, you might as well say for the MBTA.

2083
02:45:17,734 --> 02:45:21,796
I talked to, personally talked to 1500 people for this petition.

2084
02:45:22,817 --> 02:45:27,000
None of them knew anything about this change in the buses.

2085
02:45:28,066 --> 02:45:32,287
It can't be that 1,500 people in the city of Medford wouldn't know about this issue.

2086
02:45:32,727 --> 02:45:34,828
There's something wrong here about the communications.

2087
02:45:35,268 --> 02:45:41,129
They gave the MBTA an F and they gave the city of Medford very poor grades too.

2088
02:45:42,670 --> 02:45:44,870
So I just thought you'd wanna know that.

2089
02:45:47,611 --> 02:45:48,871
What else can I tell you here?

2090
02:45:49,311 --> 02:45:55,473
Pat Jones was very helpful as well as Sean Gabali from Arlington.

2091
02:45:56,617 --> 02:46:02,121
I did speak to Paul Donato's aide, I left him my name and phone number, but he never called me back.

2092
02:46:03,062 --> 02:46:06,704
Perhaps Joan's office kept him informed there, I don't know.

2093
02:46:07,645 --> 02:46:10,607
As far as Christine Barber, she never got back to us.

2094
02:46:10,667 --> 02:46:12,688
We emailed her, she never got back to us.

2095
02:46:13,588 --> 02:46:15,210
So we're a little disappointed in that.

2096
02:46:18,292 --> 02:46:21,694
So anyway, what I did tonight,

2097
02:46:22,290 --> 02:46:29,154
is for you counselors, because I don't know how long it takes for the clerk's office to get you copies of whatever you want here.

2098
02:46:29,774 --> 02:46:35,977
I just made you copies of the cover letter that you can take with you tonight, so that you can kind of look them over.

2099
02:46:36,598 --> 02:46:42,341
And if you have any questions about what we've put in here, feel free to contact me.

2100
02:46:43,321 --> 02:46:45,002
So- Thanks, Mary Ann.

2101
02:46:45,222 --> 02:46:51,206
Okay, and here is the- Larry, just if you could.

2102
02:46:56,178 --> 02:46:56,598
Thank you.

2103
02:46:57,038 --> 02:47:00,980
Thank you for your efforts as well as to all the people who helped you with the petition.

2104
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,702
And I know your advocacy has been incredible.

2105
02:47:04,762 --> 02:47:05,282
All right.

2106
02:47:05,442 --> 02:47:13,386
And just want to acknowledge a couple of my co-residents here who participated in the meeting here and Angela Murphy.

2107
02:47:14,186 --> 02:47:22,790
And without Anita, I would have been, you know, I would have been able to connect and collect signatures, but she did a lot of email and

2108
02:47:23,267 --> 02:47:25,588
and communications with the state house and so forth.

2109
02:47:26,169 --> 02:47:37,835
So there it is.

2110
02:47:39,496 --> 02:47:41,557
Anita Nagum, 9 Norton Ave, Medford.

2111
02:47:42,057 --> 02:47:44,098
I just want to speak briefly to a couple of points.

2112
02:47:44,719 --> 02:47:47,660
The MBTA's outreach on this was absolutely abysmal.

2113
02:47:47,780 --> 02:47:49,381
It was completely unacceptable.

2114
02:47:50,722 --> 02:47:52,443
The city of Medford was not far behind.

2115
02:47:53,127 --> 02:47:58,409
There was one reverse 9-1-1 that was sent out, which mentioned submit feedback for the better bus project.

2116
02:47:59,270 --> 02:48:00,150
No other details.

2117
02:48:00,290 --> 02:48:02,631
And it was one of two or three items in the message.

2118
02:48:03,371 --> 02:48:09,574
I contacted the mayor's office twice and asked that a reverse 9-1-1 be sent out with specifics of the changes.

2119
02:48:11,035 --> 02:48:16,097
I got messages back saying the mayor had already sent out a reverse 9-1-1.

2120
02:48:17,858 --> 02:48:19,498
Marianne and I were getting signatures.

2121
02:48:21,759 --> 02:48:22,580
I made flyers.

2122
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:28,381
I made posters and flyers with little tabs on the bottom.

2123
02:48:29,301 --> 02:48:33,882
I spent quite a bit of my own time and resources doing this.

2124
02:48:34,102 --> 02:48:36,462
My husband put them up in Davis Square every day.

2125
02:48:36,482 --> 02:48:39,743
A few other people put them up around the neighborhood.

2126
02:48:40,423 --> 02:48:43,583
The only people who knew about this were people who had seen our flyers.

2127
02:48:44,384 --> 02:48:48,964
And I would say that was, maybe I encountered five people who had seen them.

2128
02:48:49,464 --> 02:48:51,805
The rest of them were people that we went up to and

2129
02:48:53,185 --> 02:48:53,765
contact it.

2130
02:48:54,186 --> 02:48:55,626
I wrote buses several days.

2131
02:48:56,367 --> 02:48:59,928
Nobody on the bus is new, completely unacceptable.

2132
02:49:01,229 --> 02:49:05,731
And I would be willing to wager that there are still Medford residents who don't know anything about this.

2133
02:49:06,171 --> 02:49:10,714
I asked that that reverse 9-1-1 go out before the comment period was over on the 31st.

2134
02:49:11,134 --> 02:49:12,054
It's now too late.

2135
02:49:12,815 --> 02:49:15,116
The original plan was not to have a final draft.

2136
02:49:15,736 --> 02:49:19,598
Now there is going to be a final draft, but it's not clear that there will be an open comment period.

2137
02:49:20,893 --> 02:49:27,876
The second thing was there were zoom meetings there was one that was specific to Medford and I believe it coincided with the city council meeting.

2138
02:49:28,396 --> 02:49:38,720
But the last zoom meeting for this project was on a Thursday, and it was very disappointing that there weren't any elected representatives Medford on that call.

2139
02:49:39,381 --> 02:49:45,463
There were representatives from Cambridge at the first one representatives from Somerville and Arlington at the second one.

2140
02:49:48,315 --> 02:49:55,918
That being said, I would highly recommend that the city council contact your counterparts in Somerville, Arlington, and Cambridge.

2141
02:49:56,659 --> 02:50:05,723
As a united group, you would definitely have more clout than you would as individual or individual cities contacting the MBTA on this issue.

2142
02:50:06,263 --> 02:50:13,266
And several of the bus routes that I'm most familiar with, like the 96 goes through Medford, Somerville, Cambridge.

2143
02:50:13,846 --> 02:50:15,707
The 80 goes through Arlington,

2144
02:50:18,531 --> 02:50:34,677
Medford, or Arlington Somerville, but is close enough to Medford that actually Arlington Medford Somerville so there are three towns involved in each of these I would highly recommend that you contact your counterparts.

2145
02:50:36,638 --> 02:50:42,080
Some real and Cambridge City Councils and the at the Arlington select board.

2146
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:47,562
There's definitely support, and you will have much more influence.

2147
02:50:50,168 --> 02:51:02,915
When the general public finds out that their bus routes are going to be changed, when this starts being implemented, if this is finalized, there is going to be chaos across Eastern Massachusetts, the entire MBTA system.

2148
02:51:03,255 --> 02:51:07,557
As it is, there were over 15,000 comments, including our 2,000.

2149
02:51:08,658 --> 02:51:10,679
However, there are still communities who don't know about it.

2150
02:51:10,699 --> 02:51:17,282
And again, I don't think most Medford residents, even ones who ride the bus, know about it.

2151
02:51:19,268 --> 02:51:19,608
Thank you.

2152
02:51:19,828 --> 02:51:20,249
Thank you.

2153
02:51:23,091 --> 02:51:24,432
Name and address for the record, please.

2154
02:51:25,233 --> 02:51:30,157
Angela Murphy, 16 Conning Street Method, and I just wanted to add to what Anita said.

2155
02:51:30,697 --> 02:51:33,720
You can also perhaps reach out to the community of Woburn.

2156
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:42,767
There are three particular buses that would affect me personally if changed or eliminated, and this would affect my work.

2157
02:51:43,302 --> 02:51:47,366
because I just took a full-time job in Woburn, won't be able to get there.

2158
02:51:47,826 --> 02:51:54,812
And the people going to Woburn, especially Woburn Senior Center, they also didn't know about this and they're in an uproar too.

2159
02:51:55,232 --> 02:51:57,234
So reach out to those communities too.

2160
02:51:58,035 --> 02:52:09,585
I understand Winchester asked for one of the bus routes to be changed because they wanted it to serve as their community, but it's not a necessity to change that bus route because they already have

2161
02:52:10,025 --> 02:52:18,331
the bus going to 134 to Winchester Center to North Woburn and that's the one they want to eliminate and change the other one.

2162
02:52:18,831 --> 02:52:19,972
It just doesn't make sense.

2163
02:52:20,032 --> 02:52:26,976
So maybe City of Memphis could reach out to Woburn also and Mayor Galvin over there and talk to them.

2164
02:52:27,557 --> 02:52:36,663
I've already spoken to my son-in-law who was the captain of the force there and he says the community is not aware of a lot of things changing there too.

2165
02:52:37,182 --> 02:52:40,064
and the ones that I speak to are very upset.

2166
02:52:40,845 --> 02:52:41,906
So thank you.

2167
02:52:42,226 --> 02:52:42,626
Thank you.

2168
02:52:44,468 --> 02:52:45,649
Name and address for the record, please.

2169
02:52:46,870 --> 02:52:49,472
William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2170
02:52:49,892 --> 02:52:51,453
I'm gonna be very quick.

2171
02:52:53,695 --> 02:53:00,380
My request is simply that we avert another communications problem that I've already seen the T itself do and a bunch of the media.

2172
02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:03,703
And that is that if we do a reverse 911 call or something,

2173
02:53:04,690 --> 02:53:14,061
We got to remind people that at the same time, the green line is going to be screwed up between Union Square and government center.

2174
02:53:16,525 --> 02:53:23,351
If you take an express bus to Haymarket, you take a computer rail to North station, that's not going to work.

2175
02:53:24,091 --> 02:53:28,395
If you don't usually ride the green line, but you say, I'm gonna take a bus to Leach Pier, that's not gonna work.

2176
02:53:28,735 --> 02:53:36,061
And we need to warn everybody about all of these, because a lot of times the most obvious solution isn't going to work because the green line is screwed up also.

2177
02:53:36,461 --> 02:53:41,405
So I still put, they do a reverse like what we call, the orange line is getting all the attention in news.

2178
02:53:42,387 --> 02:53:47,478
but people need to know about the green line too because that might be their backup and they need a second backup.

2179
02:53:47,959 --> 02:53:48,380
Thanks.

2180
02:53:49,583 --> 02:53:50,625
Thank you Mr. Navarro.

2181
02:53:52,124 --> 02:54:06,647
I will just, for folks who may or may not know, we as a city council have requested a lot of communications improvements from the city of Medford on a lot of different issues, specifically around this issue.

2182
02:54:07,287 --> 02:54:18,129
We passed a resolution regarding making sure that the full amount of information was sent out in reverse 911 calls, especially people who don't have access to computers or may not otherwise be able to access information.

2183
02:54:19,089 --> 02:54:20,149
We as a city council held

2184
02:54:20,709 --> 02:54:21,810
our own committee of the whole meeting.

2185
02:54:21,850 --> 02:54:23,192
We invited the MBTA here.

2186
02:54:23,232 --> 02:54:23,973
They didn't show up.

2187
02:54:24,073 --> 02:54:34,023
We still held the meeting and took public comment, took comments from the councillors and submitted those as part of the official public comment record for the MBTA.

2188
02:54:34,743 --> 02:54:42,851
We requested, I believe, a couple of reverse 911 calls specifically about this issue to pull out prior to the July 31st public comment period.

2189
02:54:43,572 --> 02:54:46,273
And I'm probably missing two or three other things.

2190
02:54:46,433 --> 02:54:57,057
Oh, there's Yeah, we did request that if whatever draft is produced after this public comment period that that draft be presented and then another public comment period occur.

2191
02:54:57,637 --> 02:54:58,878
And then we're also looking at

2192
02:54:59,409 --> 02:55:13,237
where the city's authority and potentially the city council's authority is as to the creation of new bus stops, and if that possibly is a way that the city could say, we're not going to approve any new bus stops, adjustments to routes without potentially the loss of others.

2193
02:55:13,297 --> 02:55:17,600
We don't know exactly where that is yet, but that's another tool we're exploring using as a city council.

2194
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:26,265
When it comes to communication, all we can do is ask, we can put out our agendas and hold our meetings, which we do, and we can use our personal, you know,

2195
02:55:27,070 --> 02:55:33,895
candidate means to reach out to people, but we do not control the apparatus of reverse 9-1-1 or the city's communications.

2196
02:55:33,935 --> 02:55:45,685
Otherwise, as much as we may want to, and as much as we may ask for things to happen, sometimes that's the same as you asking for them to do something in the city administration.

2197
02:55:45,705 --> 02:55:46,966
So I just wanted to put that out there.

2198
02:55:48,307 --> 02:55:51,970
Are there any other comments from city councilors, any amendments to the paper?

2199
02:55:55,103 --> 02:55:56,885
Seeing none, Roberta, you wanna speak?

2200
02:55:57,565 --> 02:55:59,066
Keep public comment going.

2201
02:56:01,789 --> 02:56:03,790
Thank you, Roberta Cameron, North Street.

2202
02:56:04,651 --> 02:56:18,203
And I just wanted to point out that my neighbor's use of flyers seem to be very effective at reaching people who, you know, because reverse 911 is a very difficult way to convey

2203
02:56:18,995 --> 02:56:21,156
primarily visual information.

2204
02:56:21,656 --> 02:56:34,059
So I'd really like to see the city use more written communication as well, whether it be posters or mailer or signs in any commonly seen locations.

2205
02:56:34,359 --> 02:56:39,860
That would, I can probably do more than reverse 911 to raise people's awareness of this.

2206
02:56:40,220 --> 02:56:40,580
Thank you.

2207
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:42,481
Thank you.

2208
02:56:45,321 --> 02:56:48,302
One more thing, the city of Cambridge, I discovered

2209
02:56:49,006 --> 02:56:54,570
towards the end of the comment period, put up their own flyers on bus stops, actually on the poles.

2210
02:56:56,611 --> 02:57:11,661
I did that with the paper flyers, but they had flyers encased in plastic, and they were from the city of Cambridge telling people that this bus stop may be changed, where they could submit feedback, and there was also a link to a Cambridge survey.

2211
02:57:14,063 --> 02:57:17,465
I put comments into the MBTA saying the MBTA should be doing that,

2212
02:57:17,815 --> 02:57:26,717
themselves on every effective route, not to mention flyers and posters on every effective bus route in every T station.

2213
02:57:28,578 --> 02:57:41,461
I've spoken with Pat Jelen and Sean Garbali about that, but the city of Medford could put up, it would be a little time consuming, I mean, not hugely expensive for the actual materials, but it could be done.

2214
02:57:42,722 --> 02:57:43,002
Again, we,

2215
02:57:45,321 --> 02:57:52,165
Marianne and I really organized this, but we had a network of people who helped us and we didn't even get to every neighborhood.

2216
02:57:52,245 --> 02:57:54,506
I didn't even get to the high street in Medford.

2217
02:57:54,546 --> 02:57:56,327
We were so busy with Medford Hillside.

2218
02:57:56,347 --> 02:58:02,151
I did a little in Medford Square, but the only people really who knew about this were the ones who had seen our flyers.

2219
02:58:02,231 --> 02:58:05,873
I think there were five people who had found out about it independently.

2220
02:58:07,534 --> 02:58:09,355
And again, there are still people who don't know about it.

2221
02:58:10,396 --> 02:58:12,097
Thank you, yeah, and I completely agree that

2222
02:58:13,050 --> 02:58:15,331
You know, that work should be the responsibility of city government.

2223
02:58:17,031 --> 02:58:32,916
One of the conversations we've been having tonight is about resources and the city of Cambridge has, you know, a very large budget due to their Kendall Square and commercial development and all of that, very low tax rate for residential and a lot of resources to be able to put into projects like this that the city doesn't have right now, but absolutely should have.

2224
02:58:34,157 --> 02:58:36,497
Any further comment from the public or members of the council?

2225
02:58:39,638 --> 02:58:41,299
On the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by.

2226
02:58:42,648 --> 02:58:43,809
Seconded by Councilor Carvio.

2227
02:58:43,829 --> 02:58:44,991
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2228
02:58:45,351 --> 02:58:45,912
Motion approved.

2229
02:58:50,117 --> 02:58:50,798
Councilor Carvio?

2230
02:58:51,118 --> 02:58:51,379
Yes.

2231
02:58:52,500 --> 02:58:53,141
Councilor Collins?

2232
02:58:53,661 --> 02:58:53,862
Yes.

2233
02:58:54,342 --> 02:58:54,763
Councilor Naik?

2234
02:58:54,783 --> 02:58:54,863
Yes.

2235
02:58:56,585 --> 02:58:57,326
Councilor Scarpelli?

2236
02:58:57,546 --> 02:58:57,706
Yes.

2237
02:58:58,908 --> 02:58:59,428
Councilor Sang?

2238
02:58:59,969 --> 02:59:00,209
Yes.

2239
02:59:01,391 --> 02:59:01,971
President Morrell?

2240
02:59:02,131 --> 02:59:02,292
Yes.

2241
02:59:03,300 --> 02:59:17,611
Vice President bears yes 70 affirmative zero the negative motion passes to dash 459 offered by Councilor saying it's a result of the metric City Council asked the Board of Health to lay out its approach to addressing the monkey fox public health emergency and any guidelines associated with it, Councilor saying.

2242
02:59:18,547 --> 02:59:20,328
Um, thank you, Vice President bears.

2243
02:59:20,509 --> 02:59:29,095
Um, as, as we know, the federal government recently declared monkey pox a health emergency, a public health emergency.

2244
02:59:29,115 --> 02:59:34,259
I just, you know, people have been asking me what, um, what our government should do about it.

2245
02:59:35,919 --> 02:59:48,622
I believe I have confidence that in our board of health, but you know, in the spirit of reducing panic in the spirit of, you know, making, making sure our lives go, go on as normal.

2246
02:59:49,042 --> 03:00:00,865
I think it would be helpful for for us as a city council and for residents to know what our city strategy is regarding both both addressing the public health emergency but also.

2247
03:00:02,858 --> 03:00:04,586
how we're going to communicate that strategy.

2248
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:07,561
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

2249
03:00:07,601 --> 03:00:08,321
Any further comment?

2250
03:00:08,521 --> 03:00:10,583
Yes, I appreciate that, Mr. President.

2251
03:00:10,623 --> 03:00:13,945
The gentleman bringing this up, and, you know, we all have to be very hypervigilant over here.

2252
03:00:13,985 --> 03:00:28,935
That's why I think, you know, when we talk with our friends and our neighbors and individuals that travel out of country, that we be sure that they take the appropriate steps when they come back to the country, back from vacations and back from stuff like that, that they take the appropriate steps to be sure that they're not infecting anybody else with some diseases like this.

2253
03:00:28,975 --> 03:00:30,656
But I appreciate the gentleman bringing it forward.

2254
03:00:30,696 --> 03:00:36,060
I too certainly have questions for the Board of Health in terms of the transmission of the disease and what steps we're taking.

2255
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:37,380
in order to prevent it.

2256
03:00:37,580 --> 03:00:48,764
It's my understanding that was that immunization for this or vaccination for this at some point in time that was discontinued or eradicated due to the smallpox disease being eradicated.

2257
03:00:49,024 --> 03:00:50,305
Well, I understand it's the same vaccine.

2258
03:00:51,025 --> 03:00:53,306
So with that being said, I thank the gentleman and I second this motion.

2259
03:00:54,086 --> 03:00:55,426
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2260
03:00:55,707 --> 03:00:59,768
The motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Seng, seconded by Councilor Knight, President Morocco.

2261
03:01:01,071 --> 03:01:01,691
Thank you, Mr. President.

2262
03:01:01,751 --> 03:01:11,017
I do understand my fellow counselors making a joke about whenever our counselors travel, but I do just caution about just sometimes jokes can be misconstrued as misinformation.

2263
03:01:11,037 --> 03:01:16,460
So I would just caution against jokes of this nature when it's an evolving disease that we're learning more about.

2264
03:01:16,940 --> 03:01:17,280
Thank you.

2265
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:18,741
Thank you, President Morrell.

2266
03:01:19,581 --> 03:01:20,762
Any further comment?

2267
03:01:20,902 --> 03:01:26,245
I think my interpretation was misguided, Mr. President, but it is what it is.

2268
03:01:26,465 --> 03:01:29,107
On the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Knight,

2269
03:01:30,541 --> 03:01:31,181
Any further questions?

2270
03:01:32,822 --> 03:01:33,762
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2271
03:01:36,343 --> 03:01:37,163
Councilor Kerrio?

2272
03:01:37,444 --> 03:01:37,624
Yes.

2273
03:01:38,244 --> 03:01:38,884
Councilor Collins?

2274
03:01:39,164 --> 03:01:39,364
Yes.

2275
03:01:40,205 --> 03:01:40,645
Councilor Knight?

2276
03:01:40,925 --> 03:01:41,145
Yes.

2277
03:01:41,685 --> 03:01:42,425
Councilor Scarpelli?

2278
03:01:42,765 --> 03:01:42,966
Yes.

2279
03:01:43,526 --> 03:01:44,106
Councilor Sang?

2280
03:01:44,686 --> 03:01:44,906
Yes.

2281
03:01:46,127 --> 03:01:46,627
President Morrell?

2282
03:01:48,793 --> 03:01:48,993
Yes.

2283
03:01:49,574 --> 03:01:50,294
Vice President Pierce.

2284
03:01:50,314 --> 03:01:50,554
Yes.

2285
03:01:50,614 --> 03:01:51,795
The affirmative, none the negative.

2286
03:01:51,835 --> 03:01:52,776
Motion passes.

2287
03:01:52,796 --> 03:01:55,738
22-460 offered by President Morrell.

2288
03:01:55,778 --> 03:02:02,003
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council meet in committee of the whole to review and suggest updates to the Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 section 6.2 signs.

2289
03:02:05,564 --> 03:02:06,224
Thank you, Mr. President.

2290
03:02:06,284 --> 03:02:15,610
I know we've been working to kind of any zoning amendments that perhaps are, you know, immediate in nature, but working to save them for when we can work with again with the zoning consultant.

2291
03:02:15,651 --> 03:02:22,635
But I think signs has come up a number of times over the past few years, sometimes in some controversial ways regarding illumination.

2292
03:02:22,655 --> 03:02:30,120
And I think also now, last month, we saw the presentation for the DB charging signs that are a new type of science.

2293
03:02:30,897 --> 03:02:32,158
that are petitioned for in the city.

2294
03:02:32,218 --> 03:02:41,545
So I think it would be worth meeting in the committee of the whole just to see, just hear some, I know we've all heard from some local business owners, some building owners, as far as things they might like to see changed.

2295
03:02:41,585 --> 03:02:50,752
So I think it's time that we could meet committee of the whole and just discuss and see what amendments may be worth making or not at this time to present back to the council as a whole.

2296
03:02:51,312 --> 03:02:52,253
So I would move approval.

2297
03:02:53,213 --> 03:02:54,254
Thank you, Madam President.

2298
03:02:56,016 --> 03:02:59,018
Any further comments by fellow councilors?

2299
03:03:00,757 --> 03:03:02,157
Any comment by members of the public?

2300
03:03:04,478 --> 03:03:06,458
I see Mr. Pompeo on Zoom.

2301
03:03:06,518 --> 03:03:09,639
I will unmute you and ask you for your name and address for the record, please.

2302
03:03:13,780 --> 03:03:16,701
Thank you very much, Steven Pompeo, 18 Newton Road, Medford.

2303
03:03:17,361 --> 03:03:20,042
And thank you, President Morrell, for putting this on the agenda.

2304
03:03:21,235 --> 03:03:24,055
This is something that the Chamber of Commerce has addressed before.

2305
03:03:25,056 --> 03:03:33,537
So I look forward to bringing back to the full board tonight, just to report that we're going to be addressing this at a future committee of the whole meeting.

2306
03:03:35,277 --> 03:03:42,319
I know we do look forward again to helping the city update and improve the current sign ordinance.

2307
03:03:42,979 --> 03:03:46,139
So we thank you for taking this up and hopefully you vote to move it forward.

2308
03:03:46,199 --> 03:03:46,519
Thank you.

2309
03:03:48,140 --> 03:03:49,260
Thank you, Mr. Pompeo.

2310
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:50,280
Any further comments?

2311
03:03:51,714 --> 03:03:54,636
On the motion of President Morrell, seconded by Councillor Knight.

2312
03:03:54,656 --> 03:03:55,797
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2313
03:03:56,758 --> 03:03:57,459
Councillor Kerrio?

2314
03:03:57,799 --> 03:03:58,019
Yes.

2315
03:03:59,060 --> 03:03:59,740
Councillor Collins?

2316
03:04:00,061 --> 03:04:00,281
Yes.

2317
03:04:01,081 --> 03:04:01,582
Councillor Knight?

2318
03:04:01,782 --> 03:04:01,982
Yes.

2319
03:04:02,242 --> 03:04:02,983
Councillor Scarpelli?

2320
03:04:03,243 --> 03:04:03,463
Yes.

2321
03:04:03,784 --> 03:04:04,344
Councillor Singh?

2322
03:04:05,125 --> 03:04:05,325
Yes.

2323
03:04:06,566 --> 03:04:07,126
President Morrell?

2324
03:04:07,326 --> 03:04:07,527
Yes.

2325
03:04:08,067 --> 03:04:08,828
Vice President Pearce?

2326
03:04:08,988 --> 03:04:09,308
Yes.

2327
03:04:09,328 --> 03:04:12,570
Assembly affirmative to the negative motion passes.

2328
03:04:24,625 --> 03:04:43,953
22-464 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the City Ordinance 48-773 be amended striking 75 years or older and replace it with construct before 1900 and be it further resolved that the City Ordinance 48-78H be amended by striking 18 months and replacing it with six months.

2329
03:04:44,093 --> 03:04:44,593
Councilor Knight.

2330
03:04:45,053 --> 03:04:54,018
Madam President, this is to address some of the inequities that have come up through our Medfit Historical Commission and the handling of demolition delays and demolition permits.

2331
03:04:54,438 --> 03:05:06,445
When we discussed the budget, we talked about what was going on over there and the circumstances, and I was in a position at that point in time to cut their budget entirely based upon the treatment that they provided to homeowners and business owners in this community that are trying to invest their money and message.

2332
03:05:07,145 --> 03:05:12,952
At just last night's meeting, it was determined that one of the members, one of the voting members is actually not even residing in the city of Medford.

2333
03:05:13,672 --> 03:05:24,624
It was brought up at last night's meeting that there's an individual that's looking to file a cease and desist order against a historical commission and is threatening litigation against that historical commission right now.

2334
03:05:25,265 --> 03:05:26,206
So there's a lot going on.

2335
03:05:26,528 --> 03:05:34,136
But one thing that's not going on is houses getting saved and houses getting restored back to their political, cultural, historical significance.

2336
03:05:34,577 --> 03:05:44,767
Now, when we sit here and we look at this community and we see the number of houses that have been fixed in the last 22 years or restored in the last 22 years, I think one comes to mind, and that was by agreement, and that was 22 Toro Avenue.

2337
03:05:45,088 --> 03:05:48,932
And after that, I don't think we've seen any successes, Madam President, based upon our current ordinance.

2338
03:05:50,919 --> 03:06:03,129
Right now, we add 16 parts to court, for example, to an 18 month demolition delay project that would have been a multimillion dollar project that would have increased growth in our neighborhoods, it would have increased the tax base in our neighborhood, and it would have addressed housing in our neighborhood.

2339
03:06:04,090 --> 03:06:05,191
Projects fell through, why?

2340
03:06:05,211 --> 03:06:06,892
Because they ran out of funding.

2341
03:06:07,173 --> 03:06:08,073
Why did they run out of funding?

2342
03:06:08,133 --> 03:06:09,374
Because of the demolition delay.

2343
03:06:10,435 --> 03:06:17,761
So what I'm doing is asking that this council revert back to the way that the demolition delay was prior to the changes that were made in 2015.

2344
03:06:20,782 --> 03:06:24,023
We can go back to the drawing board and figure out something that works in this community.

2345
03:06:24,243 --> 03:06:26,504
But currently, right now, what we do doesn't work.

2346
03:06:27,565 --> 03:06:33,587
We talk about restoring and preserving historic houses with political or cultural significance.

2347
03:06:34,787 --> 03:06:36,108
Then you look at 20 Cushing Street.

2348
03:06:36,708 --> 03:06:37,988
Can anybody tell me who grew up there?

2349
03:06:38,989 --> 03:06:39,649
Michael McGlynn.

2350
03:06:40,829 --> 03:06:50,013
His father, Jack McGlynn, before him, owned the home, a business owner in this community, a former school committee member, a former city councilor, a former mayor, a former state representative.

2351
03:06:50,940 --> 03:06:55,562
His two sons, Richard and Jack, Olympic medalists.

2352
03:06:57,803 --> 03:07:01,884
His other son, Michael, the longest serving mayor in the history of Massachusetts.

2353
03:07:03,124 --> 03:07:05,245
That house isn't politically significant to this community.

2354
03:07:06,166 --> 03:07:11,368
That house hasn't been given a historical designation, but Pacelli's, a pizza shop is.

2355
03:07:13,208 --> 03:07:15,069
Something's significantly wrong with this process.

2356
03:07:16,118 --> 03:07:18,879
All right, but ultimately the bottom line is our ordinance doesn't work.

2357
03:07:19,739 --> 03:07:22,620
Our ordinance doesn't work and they're not reaching the goals that they've established.

2358
03:07:24,261 --> 03:07:43,928
So with that being said, Madam President, I ask that this matter be forwarded to a committee of the whole for us to take a look at this, get redacted language and bring this back to a sense of normalcy and reality so that we can move forward as a community and we can continue to grow and not hold up people for inordinate amounts of time.

2359
03:07:45,149 --> 03:07:46,910
for the process that is futile.

2360
03:07:49,190 --> 03:07:49,871
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2361
03:07:51,271 --> 03:07:52,511
Councilor Kerrio.

2362
03:07:52,551 --> 03:07:53,312
Thank you, Madam President.

2363
03:07:53,412 --> 03:07:55,392
I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up.

2364
03:07:55,412 --> 03:08:02,254
I mean, this is a vote we took some years ago, and I'll be the first one to admit I made a mistake in voting for that.

2365
03:08:03,675 --> 03:08:10,277
We thought it was going to be helpful, and what turned into what we thought was a good thing has turned into a deterrent for this community.

2366
03:08:11,212 --> 03:08:14,353
as far as building, as far as any type of growth.

2367
03:08:15,194 --> 03:08:18,675
And all we're doing is holding people up from bettering our community.

2368
03:08:18,955 --> 03:08:29,920
I think, if you remember during our zoning thing, one of the comments Mr. Brzezinski made was, why start things that are gonna make your community better?

2369
03:08:31,597 --> 03:08:38,820
And he says, I live in probably one of the most historic towns in the country, and we don't even have a law like this, nor does it say this in our books.

2370
03:08:39,360 --> 03:08:41,021
So again, I support Councilor Knight on this.

2371
03:08:41,581 --> 03:08:44,762
Like I said, I think it's something that we brought up some years ago.

2372
03:08:45,543 --> 03:08:48,824
Like I said, I'll be the first one to admit, I made a bad vote on that.

2373
03:08:49,564 --> 03:08:58,848
And I think it's time that we write it and start getting some of these properties that are sitting there, decrepit, and getting them up and going.

2374
03:08:59,188 --> 03:09:00,609
I mean, look at the Sicardi Funeral Home.

2375
03:09:01,349 --> 03:09:26,076
middle of west method sitting there leaves weeds growing all over the place i mean and you drive around other other other ones too let's see we're just tying we're just tying up people's money and time and by the time uh they get through the delay cost of building has gone up labor's gone up uh everything has gone up so uh i think it's time that we that we that we right or wrong councillor collins

2376
03:09:27,844 --> 03:09:31,128
Thank you, President Morrell, and thank you for the discussion on this resolution so far.

2377
03:09:31,168 --> 03:09:35,512
I think that, you know, I'm glad that this motion will be discussed in the committee as a whole.

2378
03:09:35,552 --> 03:09:37,594
I think there's a really robust discussion to be had here.

2379
03:09:37,634 --> 03:09:41,459
I think that, you know, these revisions are made in good faith.

2380
03:09:41,519 --> 03:09:44,722
I think that a lot of folks on the historical commission are also acting in good faith.

2381
03:09:45,082 --> 03:09:48,926
And I think there's certainly a path forward to make sure that the

2382
03:09:50,410 --> 03:09:54,333
Values of this ordinance are enshrined and it really works well for the community.

2383
03:09:54,653 --> 03:10:00,738
So last night at last night's meeting, I believe it was applicant that was introduced.

2384
03:10:01,370 --> 03:10:05,734
And they said, this applicant's here before us just because they just want to share with us what's going on with their project.

2385
03:10:06,355 --> 03:10:09,038
And the applicant, is there anybody who had anything to say?

2386
03:10:09,058 --> 03:10:10,259
The applicant says, yeah, I'm here.

2387
03:10:10,359 --> 03:10:11,540
That's not what I'm here for at all.

2388
03:10:11,620 --> 03:10:12,481
I don't know who told you that.

2389
03:10:12,821 --> 03:10:14,062
I gave you a cease and desist letter.

2390
03:10:14,082 --> 03:10:14,823
I'm trying to sue you.

2391
03:10:14,883 --> 03:10:16,164
I want my demolition permit.

2392
03:10:16,585 --> 03:10:18,987
So it's not necessarily all done in good faith.

2393
03:10:19,187 --> 03:10:20,168
They give good stories.

2394
03:10:20,809 --> 03:10:23,371
But the fact of the matter is, there's been comments that say,

2395
03:10:24,172 --> 03:10:26,614
If we hold you up, we're happy.

2396
03:10:26,694 --> 03:10:27,634
We've completed our goal.

2397
03:10:27,975 --> 03:10:28,795
Set in live session.

2398
03:10:29,315 --> 03:10:30,256
That's not what they're there for.

2399
03:10:30,296 --> 03:10:31,157
That's not their objective.

2400
03:10:31,177 --> 03:10:32,357
That's not the intent of the audience.

2401
03:10:32,397 --> 03:10:33,978
They're not living up to the legislative intent.

2402
03:10:34,799 --> 03:10:35,079
All right?

2403
03:10:35,139 --> 03:10:37,941
They've gone way outside the scope of their legislative intent.

2404
03:10:38,261 --> 03:10:50,249
When we look back to the beginning of our term, I'm sorry, we look back to 2021, when Governor Baker put out a release, I believe he said, in the Boston Globe, there was an article talking about boards and commissions running rampant in communities.

2405
03:10:50,829 --> 03:10:51,850
And this is a perfect example.

2406
03:10:54,143 --> 03:10:55,244
Thank you for that point of information.

2407
03:10:55,304 --> 03:10:56,025
Vice President Behrs.

2408
03:10:56,285 --> 03:10:57,986
Thank you, Madam President.

2409
03:10:59,147 --> 03:11:09,576
I will be voting to send this to Committee of the Whole because I always believe that there are improvements that we can make to our city's ordinances and rules to better achieve the goals that we're trying to achieve.

2410
03:11:10,376 --> 03:11:22,546
I hope that part of the discussion will be getting the facts on the table about exactly what's happening, how many permits that are being requested are going through the Historical Commission, how many are being approved,

2411
03:11:23,548 --> 03:11:25,690
are being held up, what's the timeline on that?

2412
03:11:26,171 --> 03:11:37,363
I really think that the place where we can focus some really good work on this is around just making the process better for everyone involved.

2413
03:11:39,285 --> 03:11:40,647
And I think that there are ways to

2414
03:11:41,698 --> 03:11:55,387
accelerate some of what's going on now so that people can get the answers that they deserve and need to have, and that we can also balance that with the protection of the city's goals as stated in the ordinance.

2415
03:11:55,447 --> 03:11:56,788
So I look forward to that discussion.

2416
03:11:57,848 --> 03:12:00,890
Thank you, Madam President.

2417
03:12:01,090 --> 03:12:06,654
I've been to many housing workshops, and one of the biggest things that they talk about is streamlining the process.

2418
03:12:07,580 --> 03:12:11,462
In this community, we're making the process harder for the people to do things.

2419
03:12:11,502 --> 03:12:14,604
So again, Council Member is right.

2420
03:12:15,765 --> 03:12:25,770
I think we need to sit down and have discussion, figure out how to get this commission to do things, to make things simpler, not harder for development.

2421
03:12:26,251 --> 03:12:30,173
I mean, we're up to the point now, you can't do siding in your house anymore.

2422
03:12:30,213 --> 03:12:31,414
You can't do anything.

2423
03:12:32,314 --> 03:12:32,494
Again,

2424
03:12:34,633 --> 03:12:39,978
This is a commission that's really gone out of control.

2425
03:12:40,378 --> 03:12:42,880
From historical, now we're into everybody's house now.

2426
03:12:43,381 --> 03:12:46,103
This is a historical community.

2427
03:12:46,183 --> 03:12:48,205
Almost every house is old here.

2428
03:12:50,593 --> 03:12:51,313
Thank you.

2429
03:12:51,373 --> 03:12:54,015
It's no longer historical commission it's a design review board.

2430
03:12:54,275 --> 03:12:54,536
All right.

2431
03:12:54,936 --> 03:13:09,706
Now what it is is it's a group of people that have gotten together and said we're going to tell you what your house can and can't look like and we're going to tell you what you can and can't do to the largest purchase, right, regardless, regardless of whether or not the person intends on knocking the house down and building another one and improving our community and selling it or living in it.

2432
03:13:10,487 --> 03:13:13,049
All right, they're not the building code enforcement officer.

2433
03:13:13,889 --> 03:13:15,290
All right, and they're not the zoning board.

2434
03:13:16,270 --> 03:13:21,652
All right, so, and they're certainly not a design review board because the ordinance doesn't call for that, okay?

2435
03:13:21,972 --> 03:13:25,473
So they're having individuals come before them and submit plans.

2436
03:13:25,633 --> 03:13:26,854
Oh, these are what the plans will look like.

2437
03:13:26,874 --> 03:13:27,754
This is what it'll look like.

2438
03:13:27,794 --> 03:13:28,614
This is what it'll look like.

2439
03:13:29,235 --> 03:13:31,515
The ZBA might shut that down in a heartbeat.

2440
03:13:31,876 --> 03:13:33,376
It might not comply with building code.

2441
03:13:34,977 --> 03:13:35,917
It's outside their scope.

2442
03:13:36,217 --> 03:13:37,278
It's outside their authority.

2443
03:13:37,938 --> 03:13:40,039
It's clear they've been abusing this power.

2444
03:13:40,299 --> 03:13:43,880
And the reason it's clear is because if you're in the good old boys club, if you're in their network,

2445
03:13:45,441 --> 03:13:47,482
you seem to get an expedited permit.

2446
03:13:48,043 --> 03:13:49,964
If you're not, then you don't.

2447
03:13:55,028 --> 03:13:59,331
Sorry for the discussion, knowing that we are voting on this now to send it for further discussion.

2448
03:14:09,057 --> 03:14:11,219
I just wanted to suggest that

2449
03:14:12,120 --> 03:14:19,042
There may be more precise tools that could be available to protect the historic resources in neighborhoods.

2450
03:14:19,582 --> 03:14:33,867
I'd be really nervous about reducing what limited protection we have for the character of the neighborhood, for the historic elements that make Medford be the community that it is.

2451
03:14:33,887 --> 03:14:38,128
I highly, highly endorse

2452
03:14:39,458 --> 03:14:56,211
the ability to invest in new development in Medford and there are many places and many types of new development that we should be promoting, we need to be using our housing production plan we need to adopt the housing production plan and we need to use the housing production plan and the master plan

2453
03:14:56,687 --> 03:15:20,128
process and additional planning processes to go out and find out what kind of development we do want in the neighborhoods, collectively, so that the neighbors are not paying the price for development rampant development that's just turning a profit that's not respecting the community that we already are today, we need to be information.

2454
03:15:21,049 --> 03:15:24,214
On that profit that gets turned is an investment that comes back into this community.

2455
03:15:24,895 --> 03:15:27,539
So when that parcel gets sold, it gets taxed at a higher rate.

2456
03:15:28,199 --> 03:15:30,763
So if we look at the parcel on West Street, for example, that sold for $600,000.

2457
03:15:32,344 --> 03:15:36,466
And we're talking right now about the historic, the historic preservation.

2458
03:15:36,486 --> 03:15:43,330
Right, but you're also talking about not not the board of this person just bought this to make a profit, the city doesn't have any benefit.

2459
03:15:43,630 --> 03:15:45,852
The city has a great benefit when people invest in this community.

2460
03:15:46,152 --> 03:15:52,535
And if we look at West Street we had a parcel that sold for 618,000 that got redeveloped and then the redeveloped process sold for 2.8.

2461
03:15:52,956 --> 03:15:56,938
All right, that increases our tax base that gives us more money to do things we want to do.

2462
03:15:58,218 --> 03:16:16,370
through the chair, I just wanted to suggest that we should be looking for what kind of development we do want in the community and using zoning and our planning processes to promote the kind of development that we do want in the community so that we're not just inviting developers to eliminate our historic building stock.

2463
03:16:16,570 --> 03:16:17,251
Thank you very much.

2464
03:16:17,271 --> 03:16:17,851
Thank you.

2465
03:16:19,852 --> 03:16:24,916
Mr. Casting a name and address for the record, please.

2466
03:16:28,838 --> 03:16:29,518
Castanetti.

2467
03:16:32,880 --> 03:16:40,763
When I grew up as a kid on Mystic Ave in a house that was built in the 1750s, I believe.

2468
03:16:41,603 --> 03:16:45,085
It used to be where Governor's Ave is.

2469
03:16:45,125 --> 03:16:49,086
They moved it to Mystic Ave to make Governor's Ave.

2470
03:16:49,686 --> 03:16:52,187
A reasonable facsimile of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston.

2471
03:16:52,427 --> 03:16:55,729
Hence, you have the islands in the middle, but you don't have those beautiful brownstones.

2472
03:16:56,989 --> 03:16:58,170
My father used to say to me,

2473
03:16:59,112 --> 03:17:03,173
with a sixth grade education method is anti-business.

2474
03:17:06,293 --> 03:17:13,474
So he said, look, the only two businesses that are making it that's Cal's diner and Hosmer.

2475
03:17:18,515 --> 03:17:21,356
And constant light is getting ahead of me.

2476
03:17:22,576 --> 03:17:27,997
Carol's is still is there as part two location.

2477
03:17:28,866 --> 03:17:34,370
They had a beautiful location, Grosvenor Police Station and the fire station.

2478
03:17:34,390 --> 03:17:36,651
And Hosmer is now Grava.

2479
03:17:39,573 --> 03:17:40,794
Hosmer Chiefs, baseball?

2480
03:17:42,455 --> 03:17:42,855
Okay.

2481
03:17:43,556 --> 03:17:48,239
So I'm agreeing with these two gentlemen to my left and right.

2482
03:17:51,601 --> 03:17:54,343
I understand historical, I like to keep character.

2483
03:17:55,964 --> 03:17:56,384
However,

2484
03:17:57,752 --> 03:18:02,775
Even though we have over 10,000 houses at over 100 years old, to me they're not historical per se.

2485
03:18:04,636 --> 03:18:15,183
The real house, house my father owned, I'm not mentioning where, because he might have problems down the road when they start destroying Mr. Gav to rebuild.

2486
03:18:16,164 --> 03:18:17,845
So I'm not going to flip the card over.

2487
03:18:19,766 --> 03:18:21,007
We're anti-business.

2488
03:18:22,372 --> 03:18:27,156
If my house is built in 1910, it should not be questioned, it might be historical.

2489
03:18:27,456 --> 03:18:39,546
If a developer wants to come in and rip it down, I understand you want to keep up the character, but you've got to develop the counselor mindset and then add extra real estate tax base.

2490
03:18:43,029 --> 03:18:47,432
It's sad, they have to wait a year and a half to knock it down, is that right?

2491
03:18:48,273 --> 03:18:50,434
And they have to put up some serious money.

2492
03:18:51,452 --> 03:18:55,373
and they have to carry that, and they still have to need the approval, mind you.

2493
03:18:55,893 --> 03:18:58,834
And some of them went bankrupt, me and me on Riverside Avenue.

2494
03:18:59,234 --> 03:19:02,534
I'd like to buy that parcel and do it myself, if it's not too late.

2495
03:19:04,295 --> 03:19:08,856
You can't be anti-business to a point that you're crippling our city.

2496
03:19:08,876 --> 03:19:12,296
I think I'm gonna stop talking.

2497
03:19:13,377 --> 03:19:14,597
I'm kind of upset.

2498
03:19:15,577 --> 03:19:17,558
It's just overkill.

2499
03:19:18,378 --> 03:19:18,838
It really is.

2500
03:19:19,940 --> 03:19:20,761
Thank you, Mr. Kessinger.

2501
03:19:20,801 --> 03:19:21,662
Any further discussion?

2502
03:19:21,682 --> 03:19:24,224
Name and address for the record, please.

2503
03:19:24,244 --> 03:19:27,567
William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, Apartment 1B.

2504
03:19:28,668 --> 03:19:29,969
This discussion can get a little bit...

2505
03:19:31,497 --> 03:19:35,498
You know, we gotta have the facts, as Councilor Beers said.

2506
03:19:35,898 --> 03:19:45,160
One thing that Councilor Knight said that really concerns me is this idea that the Historical Commission might be acting like a design review board.

2507
03:19:45,820 --> 03:19:50,781
That's a problem I've seen in articles from more media-rich communities.

2508
03:19:51,761 --> 03:19:54,382
I don't know what ours is doing, because we don't have a newspaper.

2509
03:19:55,942 --> 03:19:59,203
But basically, I think that is a real concern.

2510
03:19:59,263 --> 03:20:01,163
And I think as the discussion goes forward,

2511
03:20:02,224 --> 03:20:06,566
Where I personally come down on this issue is going to depend on whether or not that's happening.

2512
03:20:07,767 --> 03:20:14,071
Because I know in Cambridge, for example, there was a marijuana shop going up above where the Tasty Burger is.

2513
03:20:14,792 --> 03:20:18,374
And the historical commission had these ridiculous things they wanted, it made no sense.

2514
03:20:18,394 --> 03:20:20,596
It was like that had nothing to do with historical.

2515
03:20:21,284 --> 03:20:24,985
And so definitely if that's going on, that's a question that I think we need to answer.

2516
03:20:25,345 --> 03:20:33,268
But a stop to it if it is, and if not, let's find out if our particular commission is not succumbing to the temptation to do that.

2517
03:20:34,008 --> 03:20:34,268
Thanks.

2518
03:20:34,889 --> 03:20:35,209
Thank you.

2519
03:20:36,009 --> 03:20:36,749
Any further discussion?

2520
03:20:36,769 --> 03:20:44,852
I also want to know as my fellow councilors did, I am all for having discussion to make sure that our ordinances are meeting their intent.

2521
03:20:44,952 --> 03:20:47,953
So I will be voting in favor of this to continue that discussion.

2522
03:20:49,171 --> 03:20:54,074
On the motion of cancer night a second by Mr please call the role.

2523
03:20:58,256 --> 03:20:59,237
Vice President bears.

2524
03:20:59,317 --> 03:20:59,557
Yes.

2525
03:21:00,818 --> 03:21:01,018
Yes.

2526
03:21:01,078 --> 03:21:01,218
Yes.

2527
03:21:01,258 --> 03:21:01,478
Yes.

2528
03:21:01,638 --> 03:21:01,858
Yes.

2529
03:21:10,910 --> 03:21:12,211
Yes, I'm in front of the negative.

2530
03:21:12,231 --> 03:21:13,211
The motion passes.

2531
03:21:13,291 --> 03:21:17,193
Going back to the records that were tabled earlier in the meeting as we waited for Councilor Scarpelli.

2532
03:21:17,313 --> 03:21:20,614
The records of meeting of July 19th, 2022 were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

2533
03:21:20,654 --> 03:21:21,775
Councilor Scarpelli, I have to sign them.

2534
03:21:24,336 --> 03:21:27,097
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Kerrio.

2535
03:21:27,297 --> 03:21:31,239
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2536
03:21:34,201 --> 03:21:34,961
Vice President Behrs.

2537
03:21:36,081 --> 03:21:36,281
Yes.

2538
03:21:36,962 --> 03:21:37,622
Councilor Kerrio.

2539
03:21:37,922 --> 03:21:38,082
Yes.

2540
03:21:38,522 --> 03:21:39,163
Councilor Collins.

2541
03:21:39,343 --> 03:21:39,483
Yes.

2542
03:21:40,118 --> 03:21:40,619
Council night.

2543
03:21:41,399 --> 03:21:41,579
Yes.

2544
03:21:53,132 --> 03:22:08,427
Before we close, I just like to let everybody know that August 21 is challenge day for the MIT baseball group, a long time group started in Medford for the boys and girls that are physically challenged.

2545
03:22:09,348 --> 03:22:11,690
I ask everyone to please come out to Debra Park.

2546
03:22:12,735 --> 03:22:14,797
on the 21st to support the group.

2547
03:22:15,838 --> 03:22:26,108
People helping children with physical disabilities to have a good fun day with playing sports there.

2548
03:22:26,508 --> 03:22:27,449
It's a good family day.

2549
03:22:27,469 --> 03:22:31,773
There's all kinds of different people there, and animated characters.

2550
03:22:31,793 --> 03:22:34,696
So I urge everyone to try and attend.

2551
03:22:35,197 --> 03:22:36,458
Thank you, Councilor Carvejo.

2552
03:22:37,924 --> 03:22:50,774
Sorry, I have to mention, I know that unfortunately I couldn't make it the other evening, but my daughter did go and the kudos to the Method Police Department on the National Night Out.

2553
03:22:52,376 --> 03:23:04,786
What an event to really showcase what our Method Police Department does for our community and the discussions I've had with neighbors and friends that

2554
03:23:06,335 --> 03:23:08,196
really never looked at the police in that light.

2555
03:23:08,276 --> 03:23:12,579
It was such a refreshing conversation we had.

2556
03:23:12,639 --> 03:23:15,101
So I just want to give them congratulations.

2557
03:23:15,181 --> 03:23:20,224
And this is what really, these are the type of events that really enhance what NEPA's really about.

2558
03:23:20,244 --> 03:23:22,526
So it's exciting to see.

2559
03:23:24,687 --> 03:23:25,968
I think we should do more of those.

2560
03:23:26,288 --> 03:23:26,868
So thank you.

2561
03:23:27,389 --> 03:23:28,289
Thank you, Mr. Carpelli.

2562
03:23:28,369 --> 03:23:31,131
And I just want to note tomorrow's meeting, the whole meeting will be about

2563
03:23:32,694 --> 03:23:34,695
tax exemption programs available to the city.

2564
03:23:34,795 --> 03:23:37,276
Just an educational meeting to ask questions.

2565
03:23:37,316 --> 03:23:39,236
It will be Zoom only 6 p.m.

2566
03:23:39,296 --> 03:23:46,078
And also there is a traffic commission meeting probably of interest on Tuesday, August 16th at 5 p.m.

2567
03:23:46,118 --> 03:23:52,441
because it talks about bike lanes on Winthrop Street, talking about Winthrop Street endlessly here at Stephen Miller Drive and Main Street at Mystic Avenue.

2568
03:23:54,341 --> 03:23:56,042
Do I have a motion to adjourn?

2569
03:23:56,062 --> 03:23:59,863
I have a motion of Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn as seconded by Councilor Carvella.

2570
03:23:59,903 --> 03:24:00,943
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2571
03:24:04,396 --> 03:24:05,518
Yes.

2572
03:24:05,538 --> 03:24:05,678
Yes.

2573
03:24:05,738 --> 03:24:05,979
Yes.

2574
03:24:06,199 --> 03:24:06,480
Yes.

2575
03:24:06,981 --> 03:24:07,141
Yes.
