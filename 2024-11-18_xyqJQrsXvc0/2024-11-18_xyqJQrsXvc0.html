    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=692.115s">Yes,</a>  six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=694.276s">The</a>  motion passes to take public participation to hear from members of the chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=698.397s">Do</a>  you want to lead in at all, Councilor Caraviello?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=701.918s">The</a>  chamber had a paper on there, I think a couple of meetings ago during the budget in regards to a parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=707.66s">And</a>  they've asked if we give them a minute to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=710.802s">And</a>  I think Mr. Carroll, the president of the chamber is here to speak on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=716.023s">Along</a>  with Dominic Camaro of the chamber.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=718.302s">Thank</a>  you for waiting several hours at previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=720.643s">So</a>  give me a chance to speak now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=724.044s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=724.604s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=727.906s">Thank</a>  you for giving us an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=730.807s">He</a>  had to try to discuss the possibility of bringing back a parking garage in the city of Medford in the downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=739.03s">We,</a>  you know, previously years ago, we had one behind Salvatore's and Colleen's area that collapsed, never been rebuilt. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=747.681s">The</a>  need for additional parking in this square is just enormous. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=752.865s">I'm</a>  hoping we have an opportunity to take a look at two. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=755.027s">I</a>  think you need one on the east side of the square, as well as on the west side. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=758.83s">And</a>  a way of making these garages self-sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=763.554s">I</a>  don't know if anyone goes down to Assembly Square and see how their garages are operated. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=769.278s">They're</a>  all self-service. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=772.107s">there's</a>  an opportunity to put other businesses into the garages, maybe top floor, bottom floor, a little retail and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=779.631s">So,</a>  I mean, we're just hoping as a chamber that the need for parking, especially when Chevalier is there, as great as Chevalier is for the downtown area, which it is, the need for additional parking because it just creates gridlock and the whole square gets shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=794.619s">So,</a>  I mean, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=796.925s">I</a>  think now's the time to try to look at it and see where we can go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=802.569s">So</a>  I appreciate any discussion and I'm trying to move this thing forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=806.412s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=806.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=810.175s">Any</a>  Councilors, Madam President, just money papers come from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=814.959s">Historically,</a>  there was conversation relative to the construction or reconstruction of the <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=820.288s">At</a>  that point in time, I don't think the mayor was too supportive of that paper or that initiative or endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=825.369s">Presently,</a>  we're looking at a financial situation here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=828.27s">We're</a>  looking at, what, $29 million in deficit spending over the past three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=833.972s">So</a>  from a financial standpoint, I think we're not in a great position right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=840.053s">The</a>  certain funds that were out there were available to us, whether or not they're still available to us is a whole different ball of wax and a whole different question. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=846.254s">I</a>  know that there was several million dollars that was dedicated to this community through the federal government's transportation bond bill, and I know that there was several million dollars dedicated to this community from the state's transportation bond bill in order to get those funds released. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=857.277s">It'd</a>  have to be an act of Congress, literally, and also an act of the governor at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=863.028s">It's</a>  certainly a worthwhile endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=864.81s">I</a>  know that we have some concerns about the traffic management in this community and the parking management in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=869.074s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello has a resolution on, coming up a little later, whether or not we have the capacity to handle this type of stuff, whether or not it's a good idea for the city to be in the business of parking, whether or not we should outsource it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=879.283s">We</a>  looked at having outsourced parking in the previous administrations and <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=883.687s">seem</a>  to generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=885.027s">Now</a>  we seem to be spending quite a bit of money and not getting anything back and not getting a return on our investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=890.489s">That</a>  coupled with a lot of the confusion that we're seeing in the neighborhoods related to tickets, appeals processes, being pushed to outside court for a day in court, filing fees and the like is creating a situation over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=906.035s">I</a>  certainly support anything that will bring business to our communities and revitalization of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=911.358s">We've</a>  only been talking about that since the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=913.66s">So,</a>  you know, if anything will help, I think it would be if I could graduate in conjunction with the work that we're doing at Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=919.443s">But</a>  I think we need a bit of a private partnership and a commitment in order to do that, as well as a commitment from the administration.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=928.109s">I</a>  was a member of this council when this came up, I think maybe about 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=934.433s">And</a>  I was supportive of it back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=935.974s">And</a>  I think back then we had a, as Councilor Leib mentioned, we had a $6 million from the transportation bond bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=943.959s">That's</a>  since long gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=946.221s">And</a>  then I think, then Congressman Maki got us another $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=950.704s">And</a>  I think that's since gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=952.885s">So</a>  there's $8 million that we kind of squandered <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=956.387s">for</a>  a garage that should have been put up right after it fell down, or got torn down. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=963.431s">And</a>  like Councilor Layton says, this is a money paper that would have to come from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=968.973s">And</a>  you'll see right now, I think our budget is stretched to the max and the cost of putting up one garage, nevermind two, I think it's just, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=982.551s">I</a>  don't see where the funding is coming now, but like I said, I do support the garage, and if they're able to come up with a public-private partnership or some type of thing, I will be in support of it.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=993.336s">if</a>  I can, Councilor, I agree fully with both Councilor Ntuk and Chair Aviello, but I think a public private partnership is really the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1004.264s">The</a>  city has never really done much of that, if any at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1008.007s">And</a>  now it's time, I mean, you can, my guess is we could find opportunities with developers that would be interested in doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1018.5s">that</a>  we have to start somewhere is what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1020.502s">And</a>  I'm not sure if you think it has to be a paper from the mayor or does it come from here to the mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1026.609s">You</a>  have to tell me where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1029.433s">Okay,</a>  so you're saying for us to solicit the mayor to put a paper in front of the council and then go from there.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1038.6s">On</a>  that note, Madam President, if you look at the recodified zoning ordinance, what the council did was allow for the opportunity, for instance, is where we can have public-private partnerships and entities like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1047.526s">We</a>  have shared parking changes in our zoning ordinance, which allows an entity to have parking during the day for business and parking at night for residential or other uses, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1056.672s">So</a>  I think that that's something that we've really set the stage for. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1059.994s">It's</a>  just a matter of putting a plan together and executing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1062.315s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1062.816s">The</a>  availability is there and the opportunity as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1066.258s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1067.313s">And</a>  I think to that extent, I raised this during that conversation, has there ever been discussion with the Harvard Vanguard, because there's that garage there, you know, that's a nine to five business, and there would presumably be some- The city had a contract with them for 20 years, and they never renewed it.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1082.086s">When</a>  they built that part of the original agreement with the city was that it was going to be a parking available. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1086.71s">I</a>  don't know if anybody remembers that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1088.291s">Well,</a>  you're older than I am.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1089.893s">I've</a>  reached out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1092.957s">They</a>  don't want to rent it out because they're a liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1096.98s">So</a>  that's the question, is somebody getting written there and them getting sued.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1101.463s">I</a>  suggest the Chevalier people to go speak to them because of the previous arrangements. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1107.607s">But</a>  like you said, cop, there's a liability problem.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1111.99s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1112.31s">Councilor</a>  Scarpellilli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1113.991s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1114.292s">First,</a>  I apologize for my parents and my tightness. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1116.753s">I</a>  came from emergency work and either late for another 45 minutes to get here as fast as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1122.869s">I</a>  apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1123.95s">So</a>  on the note of our parking garage, I know I missed the beginning of it, but being creative, I think, is what's so important that we reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1135.795s">And</a>  you would think that looking at the different entities, bigger developments that are going on in the city, partnering with them, but even thinking outside the box, I brought this up years ago, that one thing Medford lacks is, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1152.277s">facilities</a>  for youth for outside activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1159.703s">And</a>  neighboring communities have used parking garages, the top floors, as indoor facilities and recreation facilities, where you would not only get the <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1173.592s">the</a>  partnership to help build such a structure, but at the same time, also have the opportunity to create funding through <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1185.857s">fees</a>  through parking from the participants from those programs during the evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1192.56s">If</a>  you look at Boston, right next to the Boston Garden, you have a good example that there's an indoor athletic facility, excuse me, basketball city that's right above. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1203.826s">So</a>  they have five <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1205.907s">five</a>  stories of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1207.768s">Top</a>  layer is a recreational facility that's utilized by its city, its recreation department throughout the day, and still leaves enough parking for businesses, merchants, for <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1225.553s">for</a>  multiple uses, but at the same time, creating revenue with a partner and trickling down those funds to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1232.098s">So</a>  there's different ways to be creative here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1235.421s">And</a>  it's something that's drastically needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1238.443s">I</a>  know that we've talked to many people and these are, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1244.188s">22</a>  years of master planning for city <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1247.311s">I</a>  would love to find a way that you now encompass both sides of our square as we start looking toward development, putting in, bringing in parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1261.632s">I</a>  think it's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1262.412s">I</a>  think that it's one of the reasons why we can't further development in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1267.094s">So</a>  I think it's, you know, where do you put the cart in front of the horse? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1273.156s">We</a>  have to make a move. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1274.156s">I</a>  think that this is probably a very important step to move Medford Square forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1278.878s">And</a>  I thank you, my fellow Mustangs, that they keep fighting the fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1287.461s">So</a>  thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1294.653s">All</a>  right, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1295.934s">Our</a>  next move will be, we'll approach the mayor and see where that goes, and hopefully we have a paper in front of you shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1301.279s">All</a>  right, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Heinegg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1364.81s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1365.931s">So</a>  basically, I and Nick Belythe are looking to complete work renovating and building out 30 Harvard Ave to open up a tap room there where we will make beer and sell it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1383.767s">And</a>  I'm here tonight also to talk a little bit about the food aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1389.748s">For</a>  me, this has been the culmination of 15 years of brewing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1394.749s">I'm</a>  about to start my 25th year of teaching in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1399.55s">It's</a>  my profound and sincere desire to create a community-oriented meeting space where a neighbor and friend and family can congregate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1412.637s">It's</a>  been a significant personal investment for both of us financially as well as time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1417.621s">It's</a>  where I've been all today and where I'll be all tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1421.845s">We're</a>  gonna be looking to as much as possible to hire local people. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1425.548s">And</a>  I would say that over the last seven years in our business, you can see that we've done a fair amount of whether it's donations or creating a reading series in conjunction with the Medford Historical Society. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1440.107s">This</a>  is where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1440.907s">This</a>  is where my kids go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1443.008s">My</a>  daughter just graduated and is about to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1445.99s">Weep,</a>  weep. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1447.591s">Sincere</a>  weep, weep, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1450.512s">So</a>  there's been a lot of support from the local neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1452.913s">Everybody's</a>  coming by every day asking, when are we open? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1455.895s">And</a>  I'm not here tonight with a crystal clear date, because we're still building and sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1462.798s">But</a>  in short, this is a community meeting space. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1466.62s">And</a>  it's not very big. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1467.42s">It's</a>  2,600 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1470.387s">you</a>  know, start small and dream big, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1472.989s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1473.77s">I'll</a>  go to the chair of the second and licensing Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1477.232s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1478.793s">Um,</a>  documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1480.535s">Everything</a>  is in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1482.176s">Um,</a>  this is something that we've all been waiting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1485.799s">I</a>  know that Mr. Heineck is a cornerstone of our community, and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1491.042s">This</a>  is something we've been preaching about for years, bringing in small businesses that keep business out of Winchester and out of Somerville and right here in our own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1502.167s">And</a>  why not support one of our own? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1505.629s">So,</a>  as I said, everything's in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1508.63s">After</a>  my colleagues' comments, I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1511.332s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1512.092s">Thank</a>  you, Congressman Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1512.933s">Advices</a>  and Affairs.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1514.615s">Madam</a>  President, thank you, Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1518.496s">And</a>  I don't know if Nick's on Zoom or listening in, or I know that he's probably excited for this to be voted on and approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1525.819s">I</a>  had two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1527.94s">One</a>  of them was when do you open, so now I only have one, which is, is the lemon saison going to be on tap when you open?</p>

    <p>[Heinegg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1536.267s">Can</a>  I answer yes to both? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1539.309s">So</a>  we're still building, but we're hoping, you know, as soon as possible, we still need to put in the floors and bathroom partitions and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1548.697s">But</a>  we're trying to make the most of my ever dwindling summer vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1553.441s">Okay,</a>  but I can <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1555.504s">can</a>  say that I'm pretty confident that we'll be open in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1559.066s">Hopefully</a>  before the leaves change and it gets too chilly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1562.868s">We'll</a>  be in an everlasting Elta Cuba situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1565.649s">All</a>  I'll say is that I hope we can expedite things that we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1573.013s">I</a>  spend a lot of time at Home Depot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1574.714s">They</a>  know my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1575.994s">They're</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1577.195s">All</a>  right, awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1577.915s">I'm</a>  trying to be light here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1578.876s">I'm</a>  trying to have a little fun with it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1581.317s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1582.277s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1583.973s">Madam</a>  President, ultimately, a convictual license is a license to sell food. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1588.601s">By</a>  ordinance, we require the breweries to sell food. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1591.126s">So</a>  this is a no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1592.929s">Move</a>  approval.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1594.271s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1594.972s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1596.014s">OIDC,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1596.535s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1598.745s">I</a>  just wanted to state how excited I am for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1602.688s">I've</a>  known Mr. Heining since I was in high school, and all of us knew that he had a passion for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1609.133s">But</a>  it's not just a passion for brewing, it's a passion for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1612.496s">Throughout</a>  the development of this project, I think we've really seen his commitment to Medford as a community and his desire to really make sure that this is a Medford business run for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1626.347s">in</a>  cooperation with different, you know, groups here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1629.508s">And</a>  I think that's something, you know, I think this is a project that we can all be part of as a community here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1634.89s">And</a>  I just know that so, so many people are so excited for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1639.751s">I</a>  think a lot of your former students are going to be there on week one waiting to, you know, give you a high five as you, as this project goes into place.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1651.435s">Thank</a>  you, Jessica. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1653.618s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, Max, thank you for coming down again for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1657.019s">Um,</a>  you know, a couple of months ago I put I sent out a resolution to the mayor to start a West Medford redevelopment committee, and we're still waiting for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1669.483s">And</a>  I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1670.623s">This</a>  is one of the businesses that will help in the redevelopment of West Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1677.104s">You've</a>  got three, four restaurants on there, this makes another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1681.365s">Hopefully</a>  your neighbor besides you will do something with that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1685.886s">I</a>  mean, I know people have been calling him to purchase the property for some kind of nice, that'd be a nice, make a nice development there, and that'll be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1694.168s">But</a>  I think, like Councilor Scott probably says, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1698.098s">We're</a>  taking a small business and bringing it into a small community, into a small pilot community, which is gonna help that pilot community grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1705.941s">And</a>  I thank you for your dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1708.261s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1709.302s">And</a>  I do just have one question that came from someone on Zoom, it's just asking if the building will be accessible and have accessible restrooms.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1886.435s">We</a>  plan to replace the existing water meters in the city with new meters that meet the current needs. <a

href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1962.232s">This</a>  program is a 0% interest loan program that has paid off over 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1966.074s">The</a>  city currently has phase two and phase three funding available. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1969.555s">Phase</a>  two will only be available through the end of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1971.616s">The</a>  tier two portion of this project is a restricted amount of funding within each phase that can be spent on certain types of projects such as meter replacements. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1980.78s">The</a>  breakdowns of each phase and available restricted tier two funds are below. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1985.044s">Phase</a>  two total available is $3,662,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1986.225s">Phase</a>  two tier two available is $2,518,006 of the total. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1987.587s">Phase</a>  three total available is $5,400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1989.368s">Phase</a>  three tier three available is $5,370,526 of the total. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2005.424s">Total</a>  available for a tier two restricted amount is $7,888,532. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2007.685s">This</a>  recommendation includes using most of the phase two tier two available funds leaving $1,143,994 available for other eligible projects and using $5,281,994 from the phase three tier two available funds leaving $88,532 for other eligible projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2032.864s">There</a>  are other projects we would typically target MWRA, LWSAP for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2036.866s">However,</a>  they are also eligible for other available sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2039.868s">Due</a>  to the smaller size of these projects, they're more appropriate for either ARPA retained earnings or remaining funds from MWRA, potentially other sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2047.532s">Water</a>  and Soil Superintendent Dan Stoneking and Head Meteor Technician Ron Baker will be available to answer questions on this important project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2053.935s">Thank</a>  you for your time and attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2055.496s">Respectfully</a>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2059.958s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2062.983s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2064.644s">Sounds</a>  like a big, exciting project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2067.525s">A</a>  lot of work ahead of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2069.966s">I</a>  just want to confirm a couple things, just so I know exactly what we're talking about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2075.428s">The</a>  letter says that there's the MWR loan portion will require an approved loan order from the city council, so that would be coming later that's not this paper tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2086.634s">And</a>  then my only other question is related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2091.035s">Do</a>  we know how much this would increase the annual water sewer bond borrowing amount by like how much more we'd be paying a year after we took out that loan order? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2100.638s">Is</a>  that a question that we'd want to answer at a later date?</p>

    <p>[Ron Baker]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2103.098s">We'd</a>  want to answer that at a later date.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2105.632s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2105.892s">Yeah,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2106.952s">Just</a>  as we're starting the process, that's going to be a question I'll have down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2111.994s">This</a>  seems like it's has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2114.475s">It</a>  has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2115.375s">So,</a>  you know, I have no objections, but those would be my questions just considering the financial transition of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2121.217s">And</a>  I know this would be on the enterprise side, so it would be a little bit different, but just want to make sure we have everything in a needed place to actually fund everything over the 10 year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2131.881s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2132.913s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2133.593s">If</a>  I could also just get name and address for the record for both of you.</p>

    <p>[Ron Baker]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2136.554s">Yes,</a>  my name is Dan something the water superintendent and my address.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2141.635s">I'm</a>  just your like your Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2144.796s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2147.477s">The</a>  water rates didn't come out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2150.338s">I'm</a>  the water meter and billing specialist for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2154.599s">I'm</a>  at 21 James Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2156.56s">Thank</a>  you both</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2158.873s">Governor</a>  Kamara, the chair of the Water and Sewer Commission, I strongly support everything these two gentlemen are going to be proposing tonight.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2164.899s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2166.341s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2168.503s">Thank</a>  you for coming up here for this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2169.965s">So</a>  the $8.5 million that does the whole city? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2175.07s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2175.751s">Even</a>  the commercial also? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2177.093s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2178.274s">And</a>  how long do we anticipate this? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2180.156s">When</a>  will it start? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2181.702s">How</a>  long do you think before we get done?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2183.806s">We</a>  would like to start sooner than later, just due to the age of the meters and the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2192.235s">we</a>  will start as soon as funding is available, which the funding will be available with the council's approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2199.539s">We</a>  need the MWRA loan, which is requesting your approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2205.702s">It's</a>  0%, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2206.763s">0%,</a>  10 years, so it'd be about $780,000 per year annually that we would pay.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2213.146s">So</a>  is that the maximum that we could borrow, was it 78 in a row, 78, I'm sorry, 78 in a row?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2217.749s">Of</a>  the MWRA tier two?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2220.17s">That</a>  was the maximum? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2220.691s">Funding?</a> </p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2222.31s">That's</a>  the max that can be used for meters in the system.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2226.632s">And</a>  is there any discussion about increasing the, maybe getting meters for the outside watering, for the outside meters for people to do outside watering? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2238.466s">I</a>  know some other cities and towns have different systems that they use. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2243.17s">I</a>  think someone in Revere told me that they have something that goes on their faucet outside and then you turn it into the air and they bill you for what you used all year.</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2254.588s">We</a>  don't use that format. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2256.949s">We</a>  actually install the irrigation meters where the original meter is, so that anything going through that irrigation meter can go outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2265.411s">Anybody</a>  can apply if they have an in-ground irrigation system, and we separate it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2270.772s">And</a>  again, let's say, you're right-handed to have an irrigation system, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2273.873s">You</a>  can't just water your lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2275.073s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2275.773s">So</a>  you'd have to put a $5,000 or $6,000 investment into your front lawn in order to get the benefit of the- That's the current rule, yes.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2283.354s">Again,</a>  I know there's something that's overdue and needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2286.68s">I</a>  support it 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2287.261s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2287.521s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2288.162s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2291.76s">Thank</a>  you, thank you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2293.501s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello already got to one of my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2295.922s">I</a>  was gonna ask, you know, with a 0% loan, why stop at $7.8 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2300.024s">But</a>  if that's the cap, as I understand it to be from your response, then that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2305.786s">And</a>  then for my benefit, and perhaps for other less water meter savvy listeners at home, reading this, it sounds like phase refers to the phase of the project, tier refers to project specific <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2319.012s">Buckets</a>  of funding, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2320.713s">Is</a>  that the difference between phase two and tier two?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2322.813s">It's</a>  the way that the MWRA gives out loans. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2326.254s">So</a>  they have different phases, which is time, year one, year two, year three. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2333.156s">The</a>  tier two, phase two funding, which is a good portion of the $7.8 million, will be sunsetting at the end of fiscal 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2345.74s">So</a>  it'll go away if the city does not use it.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2348.666s">So</a>  the tier represents when that particular bucket of money expires?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2351.849s">Tier</a>  two is what it can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2354.272s">The</a>  phase is the time.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2356.534s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2357.215s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2358.076s">Appreciate</a>  that clarification.</p>

    <p>[Ron Baker]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2361.119s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2362.18s">A</a>  couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2363.922s">I</a>  don't think either one of you gentlemen, we had the last time that we went through a meter replacement.</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2369.548s">I</a>  came and was part of the cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2372.27s">I</a>  cleaned it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2372.77s">It</a>  was a mess, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2374.752s">I</a>  was brought in in 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2376.913s">I</a>  actually finished the project, what was left over.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2379.695s">There</a>  was quite a bit of, I guess, problems surrounding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2384.039s">Now,</a>  listen, I understand we need to get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2387.081s">I</a>  understand that we're getting 7.8 million bucks for free pretty much, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2391.324s">I</a>  mean, we just have to pay it back, but we're getting it at 0%. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2396.197s">What's</a>  the plan to make sure that what happened last time doesn't happen again when we go through this process?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2403.501s">Yeah,</a>  I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2405.322s">So</a>  one of the big problems with the first go around.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2407.863s">Why</a>  don't we just explain that, what some of the big problems with the first go around.</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2410.505s">The</a>  first go around was estimation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2413.026s">Estimation</a>  of accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2414.787s">And</a>  the faster we can get started on this, the less estimations that we will have to send out.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2421.01s">And</a>  the reason for estimations was because of outdated equipment that was given less than accurate readings?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2425.313s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2426.485s">Um,</a>  and we're running into that now and the maintenance is becoming a problem where we, we have a small staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2435.132s">We</a>  weren't meant to install the whole system. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2438.015s">So</a>  what we're trying to do is we're getting to a crossroads where we either do a big overhaul and we're not fit to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2446.762s">So</a>  we want to do the whole system at once, get everybody on it, you know, a hundred percent accurate playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2453.848s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2454.725s">which</a>  will stabilize the enterprise accounts and the rates going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2460.147s">And</a>  we're at a point now where there's so many to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2465.448s">We've</a>  been maintaining the whole time, but we were at a point where we wanted to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2470.589s">I</a>  approached the mayor and said, Mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2472.542s">you</a>  know, there's better systems out there that do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2476.805s">So</a>  what we're looking into is what else can the meter systems give us? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2481.989s">Not</a>  only just read the meters.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2484.21s">Leak</a>  detection.</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2485.551s">So</a>  the new meters that we're looking at right now have built in leak detection inside the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2490.895s">So</a>  everybody's house will be helping monitor the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2495.438s">And</a>  if your house lights up and his house lights up and you guys are right side by side, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2499.745s">Dan</a>  will know to send his crew in between those two houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2503.05s">There</a>  may be a water main break or a service leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2507.55s">So</a>  we're just trying to improve what we have as we come to a crossroads because we have so much to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2513.395s">It's,</a>  do we stay with the system or do we go with what's out there now?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2517.679s">So</a>  last time, I think part of the problem that we ran into was that there was a lot of inaction, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2521.182s">We</a>  didn't make up our minds as to what we wanted to do.</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2522.663s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2523.163s">And</a>  then we fell into a spot where the meters were at the spot where they needed to be done and they needed to be done immediately.</p>

    <p>[Heinegg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2528.428s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2528.808s">And</a>  we're not at that spot right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2531.253s">with</a>  some assurances that if we get this project done and we do it in a timely fashion, that we won't run into the same problems that we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2538.516s">With</a>  the lifespan of the new meters, we're taking out a $7.8 million loan that's going to be paid back over 10 years.</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2544.079s">The</a>  system that was put in place in 2005 was a mechanical meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2548.42s">The</a>  average lifespan before it should be replaced is like 11 years, because they start to lose function, lose calibration in favor of the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2559.212s">then</a>  the rates have to go up a little bit, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2561.213s">To</a>  compensate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2562.494s">The</a>  new meters that we're putting in are ultrasonic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2565.596s">They</a>  have no moving parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2567.217s">They</a>  don't break down. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2569.038s">They're</a>  said to last 20 plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2571.659s">So</a>  we're going to be getting leak detection, no breakdown of accuracy for 20 years.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2577.963s">And</a>  then we're going to pay the loan off in 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2579.244s">So</a>  we're going to get 10 years for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2580.724s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2581.345s">So</a>  one of the goals was unaccounted for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2584.18s">And</a>  Dan came onto the committee when we were looking and researching the meters, and he found this meter really crucial to his operations, trying to keep the water in the pipes and finding leaks when they happen.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2603.067s">The</a>  paper that's before us this evening is nothing more than an informational paper, if I'm not understanding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2607.169s">Maybe</a>  that's what it looks like, right?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2608.249s">We</a>  wanted to come forward to you guys today and ask the council what questions you have from us before we approach you for signing off on the funding.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2617.552s">Has</a>  the city applied for the loan and have they been deemed eligible for the loan?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2621.134s">We</a>  are eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2622.194s">I've</a>  been in queue for a while now with the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2625.476s">I've</a>  been going back and forth with the representative from the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2629.397s">We're</a>  ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2632.868s">it</a>  has to go through bond council and through city council with approval.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2637.97s">That's</a>  my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2639.01s">So</a>  we need to approve you to put the application in?</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2642.671s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2644.032s">That's</a>  what the MWRA wants from us.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2645.692s">I</a>  can see why, because they're not going to give you the money and then have you come back here and then us not approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2649.994s">That</a>  would make sense.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2652.014s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2652.574s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2654.055s">President</a>  Bears and then back to Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2655.975s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2656.736s">You</a>  answered my question about the lifespan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2658.436s">So</a>  that's helpful to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2661.275s">Just</a>  to clarify what Councilor Knight said. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2662.875s">So</a>  you want us to approve this paper tonight and that'll initiate the process and then you'll come back with the loan order or we have to approve the loan order before you get- The next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Dan Stoneking]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2673.258s">We</a>  would like to be on the next meeting for the first hearing of the first three or four that it needs to go through for votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2681.679s">And</a>  after that, it's just bond council and you guys signing off.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2686.38s">Yeah,</a>  so that was kind of where I was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2690.489s">Our</a>  next meeting is September 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2692.81s">So</a>  just make sure I work with the clerk and the mayor in advance to make sure papers on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2699.534s">And</a>  if you guys have any further questions for us, you know, we'll come and answer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2704.076s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2704.436s">Can</a>  we just offer that in the form of a motion that the mayor initiate the process?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2707.458s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2710.7s">Do</a>  I have a second on that motion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2712.18s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2713.481s">Second</a>  by Vice Mayor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2715.817s">And</a>  then just to the point about our next meeting, if for whatever reason, the process, you do need it sooner, we can call it, we can call a special meeting if we need to, if you need to move that sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2724.66s">So</a>  just work with the clerk on anything related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2728.761s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2731.042s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2731.422s">Yeah,</a>  on the point of this being advanced notice ahead of the loan approval, I just wanted to say that from one councilor's perspective, you know, having the opportunity to ask questions before we vote on it is very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2740.866s">So</a>  I really appreciate the coming before us tonight, the foresight, it's very helpful.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2745.543s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2746.863s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2750.185s">So</a>  we have a motion from Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, and the language on that is that the mayor initiate the process on a loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2760.888s">Is</a>  that, represent your motion Councilor Knight?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3022.337s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3024.218s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3025.818s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3026.218s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3029.28s">I</a>  think that it's really normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3031.321s">It's</a>  really healthy for us to reevaluate the ordinances that guide what our hospitality industries can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3037.203s">And,</a>  you know, I've put things on the agenda in recent months to try and <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3041.101s">see</a>  how we can work with the Liquor Commission, work with our economic development director to see what needs to change so that our bars and our restaurants specifically can thrive in our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3051.186s">So</a>  I hope that we can collaborate with the Liquor Commission and other relevant departments to see what needs to be changed and then go about changing it so that our business owners can cater to what people are looking for and do even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3064.492s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3064.792s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3066.553s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3067.333s">Madam</a>  President, yes, thank you to Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3070.98s">You</a>  know, this request is really in line with what we're seeing around the community and in neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3074.783s">If</a>  you look at some of the newly opened establishments, my question as to whether or not the ratio is exactly what's been put out through way of ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3082.249s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3082.709s">If</a>  you look at some of the newer establishments, there's a lot of bar seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3085.492s">That</a>  doesn't include outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3087.073s">It</a>  only includes indoor seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3089.175s">So</a>  I think this is something that's really in line with the practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3092.677s">It's</a>  also in line with what we're seeing in neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3095.72s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello makes a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3097.301s">People</a>  like to sit at bars, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3100.248s">Restaurants</a>  also like to have that model because it allows them to cut down the amount of staff that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3104.25s">So</a>  they can have one person serves multiple day of multiple people from one location. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3107.951s">So</a>  it's also an operational issue and an operational efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3114.114s">So</a>  with that being said, I support the resolution or item we have a second motion.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3117.955s">I</a>  also wanted to thank councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3124.41s">This</a>  is straightforward, it's logical, it's a modernization update that if we want to revive our businesses, if we want to help our restaurant industry, this is one of the steps that we can take. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3136.555s">And</a>  I think it will also make Medford a more attractive place for people to come if there's more seating, if there's more availability, if there's more of a feeling of liveliness in our restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3149.76s">and</a>  bars. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3150.58s">Um,</a>  you know, this is exactly the type of steps steps that I think we need to take in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3157.303s">So</a>  I want wanted to thank my colleague.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3162.005s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor say any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Caraviello seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3168.967s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3173.129s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3174.069s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3175.53s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3177.65s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3179.344s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3180.084s">Councilor</a>  Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3185.206s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3186.926s">President</a>  Morell?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3187.887s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3188.287s">Six</a>  in the affirmative, one absent, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3190.107s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3190.948s">22-421,</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the parking director appear before the council to explain why parking kiosks are not accepting cash or credit cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3200.23s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3201.431s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3202.151s">I'm</a>  a little disappointed we don't have anybody from the parking commission here to discuss this, knowing this is on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3211.092s">Many</a>  of our machines don't take coins. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3213.093s">They</a>  don't take credit cards with signs on them saying, you know, find another kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3218.274s">But</a>  I think most of them, they want you to go on the app. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3222.094s">Not</a>  everybody has the app to go onto. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3226.655s">I</a>  think that this is something that wasn't very well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3233.377s">These</a>  kiosks that we have, they're old. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3235.975s">and</a>  they need to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3237.737s">And</a>  I know that's going down, that's in the plans to buy new meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3243.683s">I</a>  think we just were taking about half a million dollars MAPA funds, which was questionable to me, to buy parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3255.505s">These</a>  kiosks that we have, either shut them off or fix them so they work. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3260.069s">Because</a>  right now we have a parking commission that's out of control in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3264.092s">Tagging</a>  all over the place, tagging neighborhoods, tagging for 12 inches from the curb, tagging. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3269.657s">I</a>  mean, you're supposed to have plate readers on these cars to read the cars, so no one cars are registered, not registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3276.143s">People</a>  are just getting tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3277.084s">Like</a>  I said, there's not a day that goes by that I don't get a phone call regarding a parking matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3282.731s">And</a>  I think my other councilors probably gave them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3285.772s">So</a>  I mean, I think this is something, I don't know what subcommittee this would go to for further discussion going forward to talk about the parking departments and see what changes I think need to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3299.915s">I</a>  think it's been up and running and I feel that some things are working and some things aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3308.177s">So</a>  I'd like to refer this to</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3310.865s">If</a>  you want to refer to economic development, if you want to refer to me the whole I did speak with the director and she said she would be available in September.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3319.292s">If</a>  you want to refer to a community hold on the line, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3321.934s">If</a>  we have a particular subcommittee you want to refer to but I think that um, I think we need to have a discussion with the department right now to discuss a lot of the issues that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3332.083s">Actually,</a>  I think I brought up one of the biggest problems is the appeal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3338.223s">People</a>  are getting denied for a lot of times, not a good reason, and they're telling them, oh, don't appeal it to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3345.065s">Well,</a>  it's $200 and change to appeal a $25 ticket, whether you win or lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3351.506s">So</a>  again, some of these things just don't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3354.627s">And</a>  I think you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3357.348s">Whenever</a>  you're ready to call it to me, I think there's something that should be discussed and a suggestion made, maybe some change should be made.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3366.313s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3367.053s">President</a>  Bears and Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3368.914s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3371.034s">Considering</a>  that I'd be happy to make the motion to send this to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3375.616s">And</a>  if we're gonna have a committee discussion on this further, then I don't have any further comment at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3379.397s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3380.957s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3381.858s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3382.918s">I</a>  think the easiest answer to this question is, you know, why have the kiosk accepting change credit cards is because we don't have the capacity as a community time to take this endeavor at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3393.401s">I</a>  think it was fully rolled out and it was not necessarily the best business decision the city could have made. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3400.364s">But</a>  one of my biggest concerns that I had said when we looked at the revenue forecast previous years was that I'd hate to see the revenue deficit being made up from the backs of the residents of this community through pocket tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3415.86s">And</a>  if we're gonna have hypervigilant parking enforcement offices, we have to give the people in this community a chance to be able to pay when they want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3424.162s">And</a>  I'd say walk 500 feet or 600 feet or 700 feet out of the business district that you're in to find another kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3430.843s">I</a>  don't think that makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3432.743s">And</a>  I really do think that this does focus around economic development and revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3437.504s">So</a>  this is something that definitely warrants a good hot book. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3440.805s">And</a>  I thank the council for bringing it up in the second motion.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3444.585s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3447.686s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello to send us to agree the whole and seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3453.988s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3495.297s">on</a>  the motion of vice-president berries to refer to the appointment of president it was my understanding that the paper had to be passed before august 8th for it to make the ballot um the revenue is going to be the revenue uh so these figures wouldn't necessarily reflect any accurate data or data points for us to have a informed discussion on it um you know if we get better revenue figures maybe then we could take a look at something but at this point you know i think that it's a little bit premature to keep a paper open on an override proposition based on override figures that are going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3525.437s">out</a>  of date, and it would be my recommendation to have a paper received in place.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3568.076s">I</a>  mean, considering that this is the only <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3572.883s">substantive</a>  official proposal proposed by anybody to address the ongoing budget deficit issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3580.024s">And</a>  it received an official response from the mayor, essentially validating its concerns, but not its scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3586.806s">I</a>  think it's a starting point for the discussion that needs to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3589.586s">So</a>  that's why I would send it to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3594.047s">If</a>  the numbers change, the numbers change. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3596.168s">We've</a>  been completely open <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3598.814s">We'd</a>  love to know the actual figures that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3601.336s">I</a>  think we've been really consistent about that for the last eight, nine months that we would really love to know where we are and not be, you know, piecing together the information that we received piecemeal and trying to figure it out ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3616.206s">But</a>  that's where we've been left by the actions of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3620.609s">So,</a>  you know, if the numbers change, the numbers change. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3624.152s">I</a>  have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3627.062s">This</a>  is the only official proposal that's been made by anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3629.604s">The</a>  mayor did issue a press release that had some sort of response and well, can no longer move forward because the deadlines that passed for the November ballot, it is still a starting point for discussion and the closest thing we have to an official starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3649.902s">I</a>  do hope that changes in the future.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3651.823s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3654.023s">The</a>  reason I say this is because the paper doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3656.164s">If</a>  you look at what it says at the end, it says, from this assessment, the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3660.906s">The</a>  deadline to make that was August 8th, according to Council of Business presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3665.067s">So</a>  the paper's dead on arrival already. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3667.988s">If</a>  the issue is that you want to have a conversation about revenues, we already have a paper that's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3671.81s">We've</a>  been asking the mayor to come and present to us quarterly as to what the revenue picture is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3676.051s">We</a>  set the tax rate in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3678.396s">You</a>  know, that's when we should really be stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3680.818s">That's</a>  when we should really start talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3682.739s">When</a>  we set the tax rate in December to fund the budget that we just passed.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3687.101s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Naye. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3688.983s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3692.405s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice Chair Sam Paris to refer this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3695.126s">And</a>  I just want to be clear, this is a motion to send this for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3699.709s">None</a>  of this just cannot be put on the November ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3702.451s">I</a>  just want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3703.692s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3711.123s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3712.163s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3712.923s">Can</a>  you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3713.564s">I</a>  feel like I'm in a Verizon commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3717.524s">Thank</a>  you for taking time tonight to go through some of these important issues, especially with the meters, et cetera, because I was going to ask Mr. Kamara before he left and I forgot, does anyone know the last time, and I'm going to get onto the subject now, the meters were done, were they not too long ago, Adam?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3740.174s">I</a>  believe Mr. Baker said that the project started in 2005 and ended in 2007 and that the machines had a 15 year shelf life. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3745.537s">I</a>  missed the beginning of that sentence, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3747.438s">The</a>  machines had a 15 year shelf life, we're coming up on year 15 at the end of the next fiscal year and some of the machines are starting to fail already.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3753.821s">Okay,</a>  I'm coming tonight because we've reiterated some of the pros and cons of the important issue that was brought up about 12 million dollars to be gained from future taxes in about a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3766.969s">Even</a>  if it goes to community of the whole, which <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3769.57s">I</a>  don't really wouldn't even move for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3772.571s">I'm</a>  thinking, how many people has anyone done the research and how many homeowners lost their jobs in the city, due to covert or other extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3783.093s">How</a>  many people have not even been paid their rent, there have been some realtors who have come in support of landlords, some of them have not even didn't receive rent for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3795.657s">And</a>  then going back a little bit because some of you who were not on the council at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3800.681s">We're</a>  not participating in the three year discussion for many of us would actually not see the need for a new library but it passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3811.531s">You're</a>  supposed to be having eyes for the future, but also could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3816.654s">So</a>  I really don't think this is a really time to be imposing a $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3822.657s">Another,</a>  you know, induction into the city, going on the taxpayers again. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3830.422s">So,</a>  with those ideas in mind, I think that you really maybe have to do a little bit more homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3838.426s">before</a>  pushing this forward again. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3840.528s">I</a>  don't just don't think that the timing is very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3844.792s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3845.873s">We</a>  also have to remember those people who own two and three family homes, who would just now my myself, getting into some chores and playing catch up because of the inflation so it just <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3857.712s">main,</a>  I don't think it's the only way to improve the city and to gain revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3862.457s">So</a>  maybe if this is postponed for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3865.86s">The</a>  seven of you with your keen heads might be able to come up with some really good ideas to get a mean use of income. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3874.149s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3875.175s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3875.835s">And</a>  again, I just want to make sure this is clear that this isn't something that can appear or would appear on the November ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3882.316s">This</a>  is just, one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3884.097s">This</a>  is just being sent to a committee of the whole for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3887.377s">There's</a>  no action items at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3889.558s">It</a>  does not meet deadlines to be on the November ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3892.338s">So</a>  I just want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3894.119s">Please</a>  just name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Paul Garrity]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3898.579s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3899.16s">My</a>  name is Paul Garrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3900.3s">I</a>  live at Cedar Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3902.157s">I</a>  want to thank you councilors for your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3905.018s">And</a>  I was sitting out here saying, is it, what I wanted to ask tonight, is there any way that we can get a sense of whether or not the council might support, if the mayor came forward with a proposal to fund an independent audit, is there any support around this council to start there to really find out where we are, so that as we proceed towards next year's budget, we're not fighting with each other, but really start to put a plan in place, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3929.898s">to</a>  know what our true deliverables are based upon state mandates, city ordinances, contractual obligations, to see what do we have to deliver? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3939.224s">How</a>  is it being delivered? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3940.945s">Is</a>  there a better way to deliver it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3942.646s">And</a>  have this done by a professional independent, like Price Waterhouse, KPMG, I mean, somebody who could really give you people the information you need, and then allow it to become the basis of a body of knowledge that we can use going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3953.813s">So</a>  I'm just curious whether or not we might be able to have some kind of sense of feeling of, with the council support,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3959.925s">A</a>  lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3962.206s">That</a>  was something that was proposed by me, I think, two months ago for an independent outside audit to be done in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3969.071s">As</a>  of today, we've not received any response to that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3974.514s">You</a>  are correct, that's something that should be done every so often.</p>

    <p>[Paul Garrity]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3983.921s">a</a>  recommendation that a council asking say $300,000 to bring in a real heavyweight to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3989.006s">I'm</a>  trying to get a feel for whether it's worth my time to write a letter to the mayor and say, look, you need to send a letter to the council saying, you need to ask for this kind of money so we can really start the process and get off the dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3999.897s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4000.557s">I</a>  believe we're all supported Councilor Caraviello with that motion, so.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4007.124s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4007.444s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4010.194s">on</a>  the motion of us, Madam President, just reiterate that the paper is in order to place on the ballot for the 11 23 election, an override question that had to be placed on the ballot by August 8 in order for the paper to be operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4024.225s">The</a>  paper is moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4025.706s">So</a>  we're having a meeting on something that's dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4028.448s">It's</a>  in fact, it does pass.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4029.87s">President</a>  Ferris, would you like to amend the paper?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4031.511s">I</a>  mean, all you have to do is change <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4038.438s">I</a>  think four words to make it unmoot once again, or sorry, eight words. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4043.322s">So</a>  it's not really that the concept and ideas moot, it's that it's now been delayed to a future discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4052.768s">I'm</a>  happy to amend it to strike out the first paragraph and replace it with, you know, be it resolved that the Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4067.033s">request</a>  a meeting with the mayor and finance staff regarding planning for the ongoing revenue shortfall and</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4095.953s">structural</a>  budget deficit.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4105.88s">Thank</a>  you, President Paris. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4110.663s">On</a>  that motion, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4113.085s">Mary</a>  Anna Ducey, 2 Nod Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4115.207s">I</a>  thought that this was an opportune time to bring up this newspaper article I saw on the July 24th <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4121.584s">Boston</a>  Sunday Globe finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4124.247s">It</a>  said, Medford's surveying public on how to spend rescue funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4128.511s">Medford</a>  has launched a survey to seek community input on how it should spend $20 million in federal funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4133.917s">The</a>  city is receiving $48 million from the American Rescue Plan Act signed into law by President Biden last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4140.323s">with</a>  funds to come in installments through 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4144.284s">NEPA</a>  previously allocated $19 million of the $48 million to replace city revenues it lost during the pandemic and for other fiscal funds, which leaves approximately $20 million remaining for investments in the community projects and programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4157.349s">The</a>  survey provides an opportunity for city residents to offer their preferences on what should be targeted with the spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4164.251s">It</a>  seems like if we have a potential 13 million deficit, it should be not any survey to find out where we should spend the money.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4173.734s">I</a>  think the city should put it where to reduce the deficit, so that's regarding our spending that's regarding our funding which is used for very specific sources and we've already the city has maxed out the amount it can use <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4185.597s">to</a>  replace revenue.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4186.857s">I</a>  understand that it's staggered. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4188.958s">You</a>  can't just spend it all at one time.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4190.958s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4191.619s">And</a>  you have to spend it on particular projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4193.859s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4194.099s">However,</a>  the city budget, I'm sure they could reshuffle money to apply this money to portions of the city that would be eligible for this money, rather than considering even a 2.5% override. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4207.683s">I</a>  mean, the general public doesn't understand the mechanics of all this, but this is kind of shocking <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4213.004s">When</a>  you consider having to probably maybe pass a proposition to an iPhone right and raise property taxes, when you have money sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4220.712s">They</a>  looking for suggestions on how to spend for this purpose.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4227.539s">If</a>  I could just embarrass.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4230.142s">We</a>  received a total of 48 million in the heart of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4236.38s">about</a>  20 million of that already to cover the deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4240.163s">And</a>  there's a formula in ARPA that says of the total amount you get, this is how much you can use to cover your budget deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4247.548s">We've</a>  already maxed that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4248.989s">So</a>  this 20 million, I wish it was flexible enough that we could use it to address the existing budget shortfalls, although it's still one-time revenue and not actually a long-term solution to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4259.296s">The</a>  issue, the remaining 20 million that they're talking about in that article, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4262.978s">is</a>  essentially the money from the federal law that we can't use to cover the deficit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4267.38s">We</a>  can only use it for so what can you use this for?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4269.741s">We</a>  can use it for a few specific purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4272.201s">Water</a>  and sewer is one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4274.082s">And</a>  that's we just discussed that and streets associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4278.744s">policies</a>  to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4281.985s">One</a>  of the things that we approved and that the city did do <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4285.583s">In</a>  January, it was hire a federal funds manager who was supposed to look at all of the specific, very detailed U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4292.185s">Treasury</a>  rules and documents that outline exactly how you can spend the $20 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4297.746s">We</a>  had a great person who was doing that work who was terminated, as I understand it, by the administration in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4303.087s">So</a>  now we don't have the expert that we need to understand all of that.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4307.368s">Well,</a>  you just talked tonight about the water meters and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4310.029s">So</a>  if this can be applied to water meters, that's so much the better.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4314.95s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4315.431s">And</a>  in what we were discussing, they are planning to use 700,000 of that towards the water meter project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4321.898s">So,</a>  you know, I think the survey is asking, what can we do with the balance of the money that... The city shouldn't be asking the public.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4331.93s">The</a>  city should know where they need to spend the money.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4334.432s">Well,</a>  and you know what, that's... I know, it's not your call. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4337.195s">We</a>  don't initiate that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4338.777s">I</a>  understand that.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4340.059s">But</a>  I'm just bringing it up because it seemed ridiculous when we heard the midnight discussion about the budget deficit, and here, a couple of weeks later, we see that there's money sitting there, and they're looking for suggestions how to use it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4352.553s">Yeah,</a>  I think... <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4355.349s">Certainly</a>  the optics are not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4358.033s">Obviously</a>  you made the point when you came up that the specifics are incredibly complicated and I think we've been trying our best over the last two months to <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4367.0s">take</a>  a complicated and opaque process and make it as transparent as possible and boil it down to the understanding of it.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4373.964s">All</a>  I can say is I wish we could use that $20 million to address that issue, but it's legally- I'll leave this here and you can put it in your agenda there and you can figure out if there's any way, instead of looking for suggestions here, you can shuffle around some things and use it to reduce the deficit basically.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4393.555s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4399.428s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4400.548s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4401.129s">I</a>  believe my comment was back to the main discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4409.212s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I believe that it seems possible that we, on the points that the date might be moved, that we can amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4421.217s">I</a>  believe Councilor Bears has done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4424.278s">And</a>  we talked about the dollar amounts perhaps not being the right amounts, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4429.444s">I</a>  believe that the best way to do that is to invite everyone, have a long, you know, a committee of them all about it, to have a discussion in the open, transparent forum where we can kind of talk about what makes sense, what doesn't make sense in front of everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4444.228s">And</a>  instead of, you know, just having people decide, you know, having, you know, some Councilors have to do the work and then place it on theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4451.87s">And</a>  I think putting it on, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4454.328s">Now</a>  having that discussion in open forum, I think makes the most sense in terms of transparency, in terms of letting people know what we're doing and how we've come to dollar amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4463.893s">So</a>  I plan to vote in favor of the motion to move this to a committee vote.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4470.837s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4471.357s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4473.498s">I'd</a>  just like to point out that there's really no need to amend anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4476.5s">If</a>  you look at the agenda and we see paper 22026, which was filed the first meeting in January, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4484.858s">In</a>  paper 22027, also filed the first meeting in January, requesting quarterly updates from the city, chief financial officer in the city's financial health, and a monthly copy of the Warren articles to see where we're spending our money, right, which is exactly what Councilman Bass is asking for in his amended paper, pretty much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4505.641s">meeting</a>  with the finance team to discuss revenue shortfalls, revenue growth, and the like, which is what we've been asking for since January of this year, since the first meeting that this council met. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4517.655s">And</a>  quite frankly, going back to the term before, and we haven't got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4523.772s">We</a>  haven't got, again, the paper before us is moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4527.113s">It's</a>  dead on arrival. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4528.473s">It</a>  was supposed to be passed to go to get on the ballot by August 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4532.274s">The</a>  paper is asking to be placed on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4534.594s">We</a>  have papers that are already readily available for us to act upon that haven't been acted upon, that have been on the table for eight months, with the administration failing to respond to them in any capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4545.537s">Why</a>  don't we take care of the first things first?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4548.718s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4549.498s">New</a>  address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4552.383s">Good</a>  evening, Andrew Castagnetti, East Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4555.746s">I'll</a>  be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4557.848s">I'm</a>  actually glad that you're a day late and a dollar short and not going to be able to get this Prop 2.5 override on this November's ballot, because a lot of the taxpayers are struggling to pay their bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4570.939s">As</a>  you said, with inflation, especially the homeowners, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4575.393s">Matter</a>  of fact, we already got hit last December when we set the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4579.855s">My</a>  hit was probably $450, an extra charge that just started this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4587.338s">And</a>  if this $12 million override went through, I'm hearing it's gonna cost 800, it's gonna cost me $1,000 extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4596.122s">At</a>  the worst scenario, and I'm not for overrides of two and a half, God rest Barbara Anderson's soul, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4604.162s">Although</a>  the law is flawed on a state level, and I'll get into it some other time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4607.784s">Because</a>  everyone, every single owner occupied should get the same dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4614.646s">And</a>  that would make it fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4617.528s">But</a>  I got to fight City Hall and Medford before I can fight the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4622.67s">But</a>  I know my idea is perfect if I can get the right mathematician to do the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4628.372s">So</a>  I don't need a thousand dollar jump on top of it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4633.213s">And</a>  we're not Winchester with these overrides of two and a half or debt exclusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4638.62s">Never</a>  been done in this town. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4641.263s">However,</a>  if it did something like this for $12 million, that would cost me a thousand dollars one shot this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4646.29s">I</a>  want you to do that debt override business. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4649.233s">It'll</a>  probably cost $40 per annum. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4652.432s">instead</a>  of $1,000 per year for 20 years until the debt is paid, then it stops.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4659.278s">Madam</a>  President, debt exclusion really shouldn't be used to address an operational deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4665.432s">The</a>  debt exclusion is normally used to address the capital need. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4669.713s">You</a>  take the debt exclusion out to pay off a bond over a certain period of time to build a building or to take care of a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4677.136s">To</a>  do a debt exclusion with an expiring use to hire 25 new DPW workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4681.357s">Well,</a>  after 25 years, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4682.878s">That</a>  debt exclusion falls off the books and then- You can't pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4685.439s">You</a>  can't even legally do it.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4687.379s">Okay,</a>  so like Winchester, I went to legal for $100 million debt exclusion to build the Winchester High School a few years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4693.441s">And</a>  that was 800 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4695.502s">per</a>  quarter for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4698.885s">So</a>  at least if you can't help relieve the taxpayer, as Dr. Sorella would say, come down even one lousy dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4708.615s">But</a>  if you can't really help the taxpayer, give them tax relief, or hear her, at least do no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4714.861s">Thank</a>  you for not getting it in a timely manner.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4718.372s">And</a>  I do want to know if there is a committee of the whole tomorrow at 6pm, zoom exclusively to discuss potential, just the impact of owner occupied and a number of other exemptions of prices and bears had placed on the agenda a few weeks back.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4733.561s">Just</a>  know that no matter present that do believe you spoke on that, I'm not gonna be able to make tomorrow's meeting I do have a work obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4739.265s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4740.319s">Is</a>  the part time city assessor Ellen Bordeaux going to be there?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4743.94s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4744.721s">This</a>  time she's going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4745.881s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4746.141s">Interim</a>  interim chief assessor.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4748.122s">This</a>  is going to be a public meeting so people can come in in person.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4751.183s">It's</a>  zoom only. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4754.504s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4755.064s">So</a>  we have a motion of vice president bears as amended by motion of vice president bears as amended by vice president bears seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4763.468s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4772.81s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4774.971s">Yes,</a>  that's trivial. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4779.074s">That's</a>  a college. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4779.915s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4781.215s">That's</a>  a night. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4783.197s">That's</a>  a scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4784.157s">That's</a>  the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4786.739s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4789.2s">President</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4790.201s">Yes,</a>  for the affirmative three in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4792.202s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4797.307s">22-448</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it so resolved that Medford City Council call a meeting of the subcommittee on rules and ordinances to discuss Chapter 74, Article 11, Section 3 to amend the rules for private ways in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4808.775s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, I do wanna know, I believe it's actually Chapter 74, Article 2, Section 3.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4814.646s">Yeah,</a>  I may have had the wrong one there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4816.048s">But</a>  yeah, again, it's this is something to that's been a topic of attention many years in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4823.819s">Actually,</a>  what is the private way in the services that private ways are entitled to people live on private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4830.828s">don't</a>  pay any less taxes than the people on the public way, and they deserve the same services that everyone else gets. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4838.693s">And</a>  I think when you look at the article, all it addresses is talking about the fixing of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4846.399s">It</a>  doesn't talk about cutting a tree down, trimming a tree, or any other things that anybody who lives on the public way would get. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4854.404s">So</a>  I'd like to refer this to a subcommittee on the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4857.026s">Let's</a>  define <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4861.937s">what</a>  gets done on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4865.599s">And</a>  actually, most people don't even know what a private way is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4869.521s">You</a>  have a lot of new people moving into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4873.844s">I</a>  think they don't even understand what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4877.346s">Let's</a>  get a better definition of what a private way is and what the city is gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4882.069s">Let's</a>  say the city should be doing everything that it does on everyone else's street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4886.071s">They</a>  shouldn't get less. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4888.453s">And</a>  if we're gonna give them less, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4890.414s">and</a>  give them a separate tax classification so they pay a lesser amount of taxes if they're not going to get the same on services. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4896.176s">So,</a>  if we can refer this to a subcommittee on rules and ordinances, we appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4940.612s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4941.893s">Again,</a>  if people would look up in the Felsway, I got many calls wanting to know why very good concrete sidewalks were torn up and now they're being replaced with asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4953.322s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4954.99s">What's</a>  the matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4955.61s">We're</a>  not Winchester? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4957.511s">We</a>  don't get the concrete sidewalks like they get? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4961.672s">The</a>  DCI? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4962.373s">We</a>  don't get lights like they get in other cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4965.354s">In</a>  curbs or whatever? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4970.818s">These</a>  should be torn up immediately and replaced with concrete like they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4975.44s">The</a>  residents of the Fells Way don't deserve second tier sidewalks that were torn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4983.505s">Again,</a>  let's say all those sidewalks were in good condition, they didn't need to be torn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4989.548s">So</a>  again, I would ask that we have the representatives of the DPR come here to explain why they did it, and that we also ask our state delegation to find out why we're getting asphalt and other cities like Winchester get concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5005.559s">We're</a>  not a second class community.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5007.8s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5008.04s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5009.782s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5012.463s">As</a>  a resident of the Felsway, I'm obviously frustrated and disturbed by what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5018.848s">When</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5020.66s">I</a>  won't relitigate the fact that basically the city got no notice from DCR about this project and had no input over the planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5028.565s">But</a>  when residents have gone up to foremen and folks on site, they have said, and I believe also folks at DCR, DCR has said, this is now standard procedure everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5038.61s">We're</a>  putting asphalt everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5041.252s">I</a>  mean, I think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5042.753s">I'm</a>  just relaying that that's the answer that they're sending out there or that they're having their workers sent out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5047.788s">If</a>  you look at the workmanship, it's a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5051.95s">I</a>  mean, up and down the entire street, there are, you know, four, five, six inch drop-offs into dirt piles, asphalt adjacent to other asphalt that doesn't line up with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5064.276s">You</a>  know, the only thing about the project that seems at all even compliant is that there's some better curbing in some places. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5073.841s">But,</a>  you know, I think we're gonna end up <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5078.116s">with</a>  a project that's of a worse condition than when we started. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5081.138s">And</a>  this is a multi-million dollar improvement project, or it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5085.38s">So</a>  I have no problem with this agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5087.762s">I'm</a>  sure, I hope someone shows up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5090.704s">We</a>  haven't been getting anyone from the state to show up for anything, even though they've been having a huge negative impact on the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5096.447s">I</a>  also am hoping to get an update from the mayor on whether she has reached out to get the DCR commissioner down here for that site visit that we voted on almost three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5106.969s">that</a>  Senator Jalen offered to set up, as long as she did it in concert with the mayor, and we've got no update on that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5113.074s">But</a>  that could be another avenue to try to get them to do something better here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5120.5s">It's</a>  bad.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5122.482s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5126.285s">I</a>  just reiterate what my fellow councils have been saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5130.269s">It</a>  seems like lately, the city of Medford has been getting a tail kick by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5136.255s">You</a>  see some of these concerns we've had with DCR, the public transportation, what's happening with removal of buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5144.642s">And</a>  then something we'll have to discuss because something very dangerous is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5149.066s">And</a>  I'll be making a recommendation soon to close off the on-ramp for 93 at the rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5157.523s">They</a>  put barriers that now jet into the highway and leaving people in the most dangerous, dangerous situations without any notice to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5169.174s">So</a>  if you're taking that exit and you're a Method resident for the last 30 years, and you hop up on the highway and all of a sudden you look up, there is a fixed Jersey barrier right in front of you, pushing you right into traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5184.8s">So</a>  we're having a serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5186.461s">And</a>  I think that what we need to do, to be honest with you, is have a meeting with all of our state delegates and sit with them and ask them for some guidance on where we're going with what we're seeing here in Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5200.307s">Because</a>  to me, it's nothing but a lack of respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5204.53s">And</a>  I think we need some movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5206.791s">So</a>  my recommendation is that not only with what Councilor Caraviello said, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5213.025s">Our</a>  neighbors on the Felsway are just appalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5216.408s">I</a>  mean, just appalled, but if you, like Councilor says, you move up and down two miles to a different community, and their streets are paved with granite and cement, it's beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5230.717s">So</a>  I think there's a major discrepancy going on here, and I don't know why, but it seems like when you start adding it up, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5240.048s">Method's</a>  getting the short end of the stick in many different state entities, whether it be DCR, DOT, or public transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5246.694s">So</a>  my recommendation, if Councilor Caraviello allows me, that part of this discussion, that we invite our state delegates to come down and really ask them what's going on at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5258.465s">What</a>  did we do wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5259.206s">Did</a>  someone break up with someone's significant other or something that comes from Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5264.51s">I</a>  don't know, but we need to figure this out because this is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5269.073s">It's</a>  frustrating that we're hearing more issues coming from the straight state side. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5273.796s">We</a>  have enough to worry about here in Medford right now to be piled on with what's going on on our state roads and highways. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5281.462s">and</a>  public transit, and now our sidewalks the DCR, and our path issues or lack of grass issues or cleanliness issues or more on issues, we go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5294.566s">But</a>  I think we need to sit down with people and look them in the eye so I'll make that as a form of emotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5300.247s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5304.629s">And</a>  listening to what my colleagues are saying and looking at paper 22451, I think that merging the two papers together and developing an agenda for discussion with our state delegation would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5316.539s">You</a>  know, we have a paper that was passed on May 17th, June, July, August, now three months have passed, 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5322.765s">We</a>  haven't had the meeting with Senator Jalen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5325.787s">Senator</a>  Jalen hasn't been able to set up the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5327.309s">Maybe</a>  the mayor's not available, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5329.643s">But,</a>  you know, maybe it's time to reach out to the other members of our delegation to see if they can move this along a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5334.124s">You</a>  know, a state senator has a much larger district to represent 160,000 people across three to four communities, whereas state representatives represent 40,000 people each, you know, across one or two communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5345.868s">So</a>  maybe reaching out to our state delegation on the House side might be helpful in moving this endeavor forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5350.929s">But</a>  I think it would make sense for us to merge this along with 22451. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5354.855s">and</a>  develop an agenda for items of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5357.477s">Now,</a>  I know we've passed a number of items relative to DCI roadways and other parcels and properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5363.942s">So</a>  we can probably put together with the assistance of the city clerk, an agenda for discussion with a very short order and move on this.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5374.43s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5375.151s">Vice</a>  Mayor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5375.491s">I</a>  also have a form of motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5377.573s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5378.634s">I</a>  don't have a problem with Councilor Knight's suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5381.216s">Other</a>  than that, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5383.32s">I</a>  do think that the Felsway situation warrants, you know, we can have a meeting on the litany of problems that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5391.384s">And</a>  that was the intent of the paper in May was, you know, we've got problems up and down on what Councilor Scarpelli was just saying on every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5399.849s">You</a>  know, I do think that this sidewalk project does deserve hopefully a little bit more specific and urgent response because it's not done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5409.926s">It's</a>  happening now, and I'm hoping maybe we could change course on it, but I don't have a problem merging the two and then having a more immediate meeting on this specific project and then a full meeting on the full range of issues that we have with our DCR properties in the city.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5431.765s">attack</a>  the problem, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5433.146s">And</a>  we're going to say, listen, let's talk about the Felsway now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5435.668s">Let's</a>  talk about the Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5437.43s">These</a>  are the seven issues we have in the Fulton Heights now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5439.351s">Let's</a>  talk about the Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5440.452s">Oh,</a>  you did a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5441.313s">Now</a>  come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5442.114s">Let's</a>  talk about this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5443.015s">Let's</a>  talk about this next. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5443.755s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5444.556s">Just</a>  for an efficiency purpose, really more than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5446.578s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5447.278s">The</a>  state's going to think we're crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5448.319s">We</a>  already sent them enough lunatic stuff as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5450.481s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5451.342s">This</a>  is something that actually makes a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5452.783s">This</a>  is something that matters in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5454.104s">This</a>  is something we can move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5455.565s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5456.426s">That's</a>  why I get a little concerned when we send a lot of letters up to the statehouse that don't really have anything to do with real life issues that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5462.01s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5463.431s">You</a>  know, in terms of nuts and bolts and service delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5466.833s">So,</a>  you know, my concern is that, you know, if we're going and we're asking for help from the state, that we do it the right way, that we have a game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5473.118s">We</a>  have an order of operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5474.299s">We</a>  have an organizational effectiveness so that we don't just go in screaming and yelling because we got a call from a neighbor about how they don't like the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5482.045s">And,</a>  you know, the goal is we tried, but we never get the result. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5486.305s">And</a>  a lot of that has to do with planning more than anything else.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5489.107s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5489.667s">Councilor</a>  Scarpellilli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5491.088s">Just</a>  a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5492.608s">I</a>  know that Representative Donato just informed me that he is working extremely hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5500.453s">He's</a>  talked with the state this morning for any questions about the on-ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5506.076s">They're</a>  coming out with new signs and information for the community as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5511.479s">So</a>  we thank for his commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5514.827s">And</a>  that's that's a benefit of having someone like Mr. Donato in place that he's sitting home watching these meetings, and he's already ahead of the game so I really appreciate that so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5525.415s">Let's</a>  see, see response, I do just want to know on the point of the sidewalks I think a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5533.612s">very,</a>  thank you Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5535.593s">I</a>  think a lot of important points have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5537.034s">And</a>  also the fact, you know, we talk about heat islands in this city and we're actively taking concrete out, which is cooler and replacing it with black asphalt, which only makes our streets hotter where we're lacking those trees and just contributes to a problem we're already facing, which, you know, walk around the street these past several weeks at this point, and you feel the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5554.243s">So</a>  it's absolutely unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5556.244s">We</a>  do a number of motions on the floor, but Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5559.265s">Cameron,</a>  do you want to speak on the current paper?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5563.27s">I'm</a>  a little bit confused about whether it's in order or out of order, but I wanted to raise a comment about DCR property in general, not specifically the Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5573.47s">Should</a>  I hold that? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5577.175s">So</a>  my one specific concern that I wanted to bring up was the bridge behind the armory going on Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5586.042s">It</a>  is crumbling and I'm really concerned because it's like it's an area now that's highly trafficked by boaters and there are pieces of concrete that are falling into the water or ready to fall into the water and it's a historic bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5600.553s">It</a>  defines the character of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5602.374s">I</a>  think it's even on the National Register of Historic Sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5605.553s">So</a>  the repairs, I don't know if it's DCR or MassDOT, but the repairs that have already been made on that bridge have been not historically appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5616.42s">And</a>  now the bridge is getting graffiti on top of its disrepair, and it's just looking terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5623.804s">And</a>  so I would ask, first of all, I wanted to say that I think that in Medford, we are incredibly, incredibly fortunate to have the resources <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5632.929s">that</a>  we have of the state parks and properties and historic resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5637.552s">And</a>  I just want to encourage not only that they be well maintained, but that they be historically appropriately maintained and that they be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5649.06s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5652.541s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5654.743s">Councilor</a>  Baer's motion on 22451. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5658.846s">Again,</a>  these are things that we've been asking for for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5661.768s">I</a>  mean, I don't know how many times I've asked them to clean up Route 16, over by that bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5666.551s">I</a>  mean, the whole area, there's logs in the water, which are all controlled by the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5672.015s">Again,</a>  and Councilor Scapoli's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5674.197s">It</a>  seems that we seem to be getting the short end of the stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5677.659s">on</a>  a lot of these DCRs and some of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5682.004s">I've</a>  got one more I didn't even add on here, but I was a little disappointed in Senator Jalen taking pictures of Winchester with them getting their second train station renovated and we can't get 10 cents to fix the train station in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5696.959s">Just</a>  keep slapping us in the face, that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5699.802s">But</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5702.922s">I</a>  think I think I was right, get the full state delegation down here, along with the DCR, let them start answering some questions why we're not getting what we pay for services.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5717.475s">Before</a>  we continue to be I just want to take the motion to merge the two papers just so we're aware of what we're discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5725.085s">Councilor</a>  Knight motion to merge the paper we're discussing 22-449 with 22-451 offered by vices and affairs, which states be it resolved by the Medford City Council to the city administration, provide an update to paper 22353, which outlined an invitation to the new DCR commissioner to come to Medford for a site visit to better understand the impact of DCR roads, parks and properties on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5744.851s">The</a>  paper passed on May 17th, 2022 and Senator Jalen's office graciously offered to assist the city in scheduling a visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5750.793s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight to merge those two papers, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5755.047s">seconded</a>  by Mr. Clark, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5756.988s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5757.088s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5757.208s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5757.508s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5777.717s">Yes,</a>  I'm in the firm is you're in the negative motion passes by Susan bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5780.399s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5780.679s">And</a>  just to be clear again, my intent with the original paper to do this three by three was exactly the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5786.523s">I</a>  was just saying, which is come down here and we'll talk about everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5789.525s">Now</a>  that the papers are merged, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5791.806s">I</a>  hope we get an update from the administration on if they've reached and reached out to DCR and Senator Jalen's office to schedule that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5798.63s">I</a>  think also what we should do in the short term relative to councilor Kirby yellows point <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5803.258s">is</a>  have someone from DCR come to a council meeting to discuss the sidewalks on the Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5811.665s">That</a>  doesn't need to be all the rigmarole and scheduling and planning of getting the DCR commissioner down here and talking about 25 different issues we have with DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5821.894s">So</a>  if we could maybe get that to happen, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5826.735s">I</a>  mean, as soon as possible, the summer's kind of difficult, but even if we could get a written update in the next 10 days, you know.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5834.958s">Before</a>  the project's all done.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5836.359s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5839.58s">So</a>  I don't know, but that would be, now that the papers are merged, if we could get some sort of update from DCR where the clerk's office could send out tomorrow to DCR and to the state delegation a request for an immediate update within 10 days regarding whether or not we can get the sidewalks <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5858.571s">address</a>  the issue and get the concrete sidewalks replaced with concrete, not with asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5862.832s">And</a>  then we can go down the road and look at the longer issue we have with DCR properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5868.794s">I</a>  just don't want this Felsway issue to get dumped in the pile and with 50 other problems that we have, when we still might have a chance to influence that process in some way.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5878.397s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5880.638s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5881.898s">I'm</a>  thinking it might make more sense that we <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5884.002s">as</a>  a council, direct the DPW commissioner to address the issue and then report back to us in a defined period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5891.644s">You</a>  know, it's an infrastructure improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5893.764s">The</a>  DPW director's involved in all this type of work, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5896.505s">When</a>  it comes down to traffic management, plans, permits, or ground opening and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5900.525s">So</a>  it might make sense for us to reach out to the DPW commissioner and say, DPW commissioner, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5906.427s">These</a>  are projects that you're aware of, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5908.147s">Why</a>  is the product not coming back in the metric way? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5910.368s">Why</a>  is the product coming back in the DCR way? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5913.473s">please</a>  explain to us why and what steps you take to remedy it because, you know, ultimately, the DC has, you know, when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of public works, our public works director is the person, our infrastructure person is the public works director. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5928.361s">The</a>  city clerk can send a letter and wait for a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5930.422s">It</a>  seems like a lot of it might be technical in nature, and I don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5934.324s">It</a>  might be a very easy answer to what Tim already asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5938.792s">So</a>  it might make sense for us to direct the director of public works to do these inquiries and report back to us in a certain period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5945.016s">That's</a>  just my suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5946.016s">I</a>  won't offer them a full motion or anything, but it just seems like it would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5950.159s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5951.659s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5951.98s">So</a>  I have multiple motions on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5955.442s">So</a>  the motion of councilor Scarpelli to set up a meeting with the delegation to talk about numerous TCR issues and motion from councilor Knight to work through the <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5967.105s">DPW</a>  commissioner to get a response regarding the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5971.328s">Okay,</a>  we can take it as amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5974.431s">Lost</a>  half of this paper, so we have a main motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5976.933s">I</a>  don't have a main motion.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5979.035s">I</a>  think the amended motion, it's merged, and now the amended motion would be one, to reach out to the DPW commissioner.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5987.642s">I</a>  mean, do we have a- So I think on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to hold the <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5995.789s">to</a>  meet with the state delegation to discuss DCR issues as amended by Councilor Knight so that the DPW commissioner reaches out immediately.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6008.339s">So</a>  just so I know what we're talking about, we're going to</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6025.552s">ask</a>  for a meeting with delegation on state entities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6029.574s">We're</a>  going to ask the DPW Commission to report back to us within 10 days why the DCR is replacing it with asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6039.88s">And</a>  then we're also going to ask the administration for the update on paper 22-353.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6045.923s">So</a>  do I have a motion to approve the main paper and I'll take all those amendments?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6056.418s">We</a>  have to vote on the, I mean, it's.</p>
