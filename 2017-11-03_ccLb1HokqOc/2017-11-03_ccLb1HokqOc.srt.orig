1
00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:02,714
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, I see that the clock says 6.59.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:17,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to welcome to the stage our candidates for mayor in Medford, Stephanie Muccini-Burke and David McKillop, Sr.

3
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:40,320
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would like everyone in the audience to do is to refrain from applause during the debate until we get to the very end.

4
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,968
[SPEAKER_01]: However, at this point, why don't we give both of them a round of applause?

5
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:03,723
[SPEAKER_01]: The first opening statement will be delivered by Stephanie.

6
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:10,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

7
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,237
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Stephanie Muccini-Burke and I'm running for re-election to be your mayor, the chief executive officer of the city.

8
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:19,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here tonight.

9
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, I chose to reside and raise my family here.

10
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:31,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Having graduated from Medford High, I earned a bachelor's degree in business from Suffolk University and a master's in taxation from Bentley University.

11
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:36,938
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband Brian and I have three beautiful children who have all attended public schools.

12
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:42,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I am and always have been invested in this community and will continue to be its champion.

13
00:01:43,785 --> 00:02:01,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that 15 years as your city councilor, five years as the city's director of budget and personnel, 25 years as a licensed certified public accountant opening my own small business here in Medford, and just under two years as your mayor makes me the most qualified person to be the chief executive officer of the city.

14
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:08,171
[SPEAKER_02]: My administration has and will continue to be a responsible steward of all taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.

15
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:13,012
[SPEAKER_02]: We will continue to aggressively pursue grant funding to leverage our dollars.

16
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford's high quality bond rating is no accident.

17
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:23,248
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the result of careful planning and the prudent expenditure of municipal funds for projects that better our city.

18
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,930
[SPEAKER_02]: In under two years, we've accomplished much.

19
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,774
[SPEAKER_02]: We've contracted for professional management of the Chevalier Theater to Bill Blumenreich Presents of the Wilbur.

20
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:40,220
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be a catalyst in the Medford Square Master Plan that we worked on collaboratively with residents and business owners, many of you here tonight.

21
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:45,454
[SPEAKER_02]: We have implemented the complete streets methodology with projects being done in every section of the city.

22
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very proud of tackling the issue of the need for a new police station head on.

23
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:59,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Our fine law enforcement personnel deserve nothing less as they go about serving the safety needs of our residents every hour of every day of every night.

24
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,300
[SPEAKER_02]: In the world in which we live, safety can never be taken for granted.

25
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:08,577
[SPEAKER_02]: The needs of our public safety employees are many, and they must continually be addressed.

26
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:12,661
[SPEAKER_02]: We have done just that in year one alone of the five-year capital plan.

27
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:21,309
[SPEAKER_02]: The city has purchased 12 new cruisers, breathing apparatus and turnout gear for our firefighters, new trucks and equipment for our DPW.

28
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to continue to move Medford into a brighter future.

29
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:30,917
[SPEAKER_02]: To do it, one will need to be inclusive, respectful, and equipped to do the job.

30
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:34,820
[SPEAKER_02]: One must listen, be organized, and ready to lead.

31
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:40,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I am that candidate that has the critical attributes necessary to move all of Medford forward.

32
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,066
[SPEAKER_02]: You deserve a mayor that can effectuate change.

33
00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:54,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that my experience, leadership, style, and ability to collaborate will help deliver on core local services and help ensure economic opportunity for everyone in Medford.

34
00:03:55,593 --> 00:04:03,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ask you, do you want to continue to bring meaningful change to the city, our city with a person that has a proven track record of accomplishment?

35
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:04,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

36
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:05,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

37
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:18,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'd like to remind everyone it would be great if you could hold your applause till the very end because it ends up cutting into the candidate's time.

38
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:22,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave, you will also have three minutes to give an opening statement.

39
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:23,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

40
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:24,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone for being here.

41
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:29,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank my family, I'd like to thank Tufts, and I'd like to thank the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

42
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:35,789
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an exciting time for Medford, as it has been for many, many years, but we are at a precipice.

43
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:40,631
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a crossroad in Medford, and we have to decide which direction we want to go.

44
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:43,659
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to be part of that direction.

45
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:58,193
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started this campaign back in July, I'm sorry, in June, I really came out wanting to share my ideas and express some of the experiences that I've had with my business as well as the city that my business is in.

46
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:05,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about the opportunity of those ideas because I've worked in businesses all the way up and down the East Coast for the past 30 plus years.

47
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:22,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those ideas coming from different cities could really give us the opportunity to change direction in Medford and open up our eyes to different and exciting ways of doing business as well as ways of opening up our lives and community spirit and involvement.

48
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:32,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Although my work experiences have taken me outside of the city limits for most of my adult life, it doesn't lend credence to the fact that I have no vested interest in my own town.

49
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:34,073
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's quite the opposite.

50
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:40,520
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me the unique opportunity to take great ideas and ways to doing business I've learned in several different states and apply it here.

51
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:52,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I've experienced in many different cultures and ways of thinking from city to city, giving me coping mechanisms to maximize the best results, working individuals as well as varying groups in individual cities or towns.

52
00:05:53,233 --> 00:06:01,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned over the years the art of collaboration and how important it is to put people together in a room, to get ideas going, to express their ideas.

53
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:04,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Every voice needs to be heard in a city, not select groups.

54
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,683
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this city, I believe that we can do that.

55
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:13,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we've got some great opportunities here pulling people together and moving this city forward.

56
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:17,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who know me best will tell you that I'm a man of my word.

57
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a man who will stick to a code of ethics even though it may not benefit me in the end.

58
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:22,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm open.

59
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:23,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm inviting.

60
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:24,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm approachable.

61
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:27,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate when I hear what people have to say.

62
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,438
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no such thing as a bad idea.

63
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that every voice should be heard.

64
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,641
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to disagree.

65
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,323
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not okay to dismiss someone for disagreeing.

66
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:42,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my motto when it comes to bringing people together.

67
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:49,692
[SPEAKER_00]: In over 30 years of running businesses, in the last 15 years of my own, I've managed and created budgets.

68
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:55,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hired, developed, trained, and created training programs for over 5,000 people.

69
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:01,343
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it takes to get business moving, and I know what it will take to get a city moving.

70
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:04,866
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just coming up with great ideas, action,

71
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:09,389
[SPEAKER_00]: logistics and execution and that's what will move the city forward.

72
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:21,555
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideas that we have for this city could be endless and all we need to do is open it up and untap the potential that we have and that's what I'd like to do in the city of Medford starting on day one.

73
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:22,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

74
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:26,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

75
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:36,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Our questions will begin with a very broad question, and then we'll move on to more specifics as we get into the debate.

76
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:40,166
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question will go to Dave first, and then to Stephanie.

77
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:42,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is simply this.

78
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:46,028
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the most important issue facing our city?

79
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:51,812
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest issue that we have facing this city right now is this agenda of density.

80
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:53,092
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an issue.

81
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,453
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to address it.

82
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows that this city is going to grow.

83
00:07:57,195 --> 00:08:01,298
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we handle it, what we need to do to approach this situation.

84
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,480
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even had a zoning conversation.

85
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:11,185
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the Board of Appeals comes together, they're really not quite sure what to do with rules that are 30 plus years old.

86
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:16,848
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have that conversation first before we can even map out the city and what we want to do.

87
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,209
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe density is not the way to go.

88
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:36,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe mixed use and taking care of our downtown areas and keeping the integrity, the culture and the status of some of these downtowns and the quality of those downtowns and rebuild that and get the excitement going from one downtown to the next because each downtown has its own personality and we shouldn't lose that.

89
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,979
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't believe density is the way to go.

90
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:49,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's our infrastructure that is probably the most demanding and complex thing that we have for the city of Medford.

91
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,991
[SPEAKER_02]: We have aging infrastructure for our water and sewer pipes.

92
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:59,393
[SPEAKER_02]: We have streets that we're working on that are in pretty poor shape and we need to address those.

93
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:12,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Systematically, so we've been spending a lot of time over the course of the last two years looking at the Complete Streets Program so that we can address our main drags and get them up to tip-top shape and also make them safe in the way that we do it.

94
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a whole new approach.

95
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:23,915
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel strongly that you need to look at our streets not only for cars but for people and pedestrians and for people on bicycles and wheelchairs and handicapped accessibility issues.

96
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:27,398
[SPEAKER_02]: We think that that is the most important issue that we need to face right now.

97
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely we are on our way to doing that.

98
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:30,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

99
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to respond to that Dave.

100
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:35,166
[SPEAKER_01]: You have one minute.

101
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:36,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I would.

102
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:40,893
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the complete streets program in my eyes needs to be complete.

103
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the complete streets program is a good start.

104
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:47,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I think taking care of the corners of most of the sidewalks in the street areas is great.

105
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:52,185
[SPEAKER_00]: But an ADA handicap accessibility means just that.

106
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:56,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone in a wheelchair wants to get up on the sidewalk, they can do that now.

107
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:03,237
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go 20, 30, 40 feet down the street, down the sidewalk, you still may not be able to pass and have to go out onto the street.

108
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,719
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, that's what complete streets means.

109
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's complete the projects or else it's really just an incomplete street program.

110
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:12,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

111
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:16,487
[SPEAKER_02]: With miles of roadway in the city of Medford, we are attacking streets.

112
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,109
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making it a priority, and we're looking at it from the ground up.

113
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:22,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have put funding in place.

114
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:29,754
[SPEAKER_02]: From the state, we were able to get a $400,000 grant after signing the community compact with the lieutenant governor just two months in my first term.

115
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That enabled us to put together a complete streets policy.

116
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, we now are out in the roads.

117
00:10:35,777 --> 00:10:36,618
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing the work.

118
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:40,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that you'll spend some time, look at High Street, because that's where we're taking it.

119
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will be going all over the city.

120
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,525
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Haines Square project.

121
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:52,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows Spring Street and Salem Street and how that intersection is tremendously difficult to navigate, not only for people, but for vehicles.

122
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is being worked on right now.

123
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:58,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think that that will be a fine addition to the Salem Street area as well.

124
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's happening all throughout the community.

125
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:01,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

126
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:09,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next question will go first to Stephanie, and that is, do you support charter review?

127
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:16,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, what aspects of the city charter do you think should be the subject of that review?

128
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely support charter review.

129
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:32,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually offered a home rule petition to the city council in order to get it through the state legislature so the people that have been trying to get signatures for I think three years now, some of them are in this room, we could cut out that process so we could go right to the ballot.

130
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:38,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, with a four to three city council vote, the state legislature doesn't give much merit to a home rule for that.

131
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They really like to see community support in order to move a home rule through.

132
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:45,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, that did not pass.

133
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe in charter review.

134
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally like WAD representation.

135
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:51,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people don't.

136
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:53,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to like WAD representation.

137
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:54,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would make sense.

138
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, I wouldn't like to see a huge council.

139
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't like to see it greater than seven.

140
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:09,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we could maybe look at two wards at a time, so we'd have four at large and three ward representatives, I'm sorry, four ward representatives and three at large.

141
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:11,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be a fabulous mix.

142
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we would get a lot of business done in the city.

143
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:15,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is one of the critical things.

144
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:22,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I hear on the streets, and I'm sure David hears it too, is four-year mirror, because you're in such a short period of time.

145
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,904
[SPEAKER_02]: and now you're spending time in an election and that goes for the city council as well, a new city councilor.

146
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:31,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that's something that should be looked at as well.

147
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree that the charter review has to happen.

148
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:40,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree that the 43 is not a majority rule.

149
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:42,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand how we can't push that through.

150
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:42,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fight for that.

151
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:49,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it is a struggle, although we have over 4,200 signatures at this point, maybe a little bit more.

152
00:12:50,012 --> 00:13:00,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that combined with the home rule petition, we can make this conversation happen, but I think it's time after 30 plus years that this has not been a review

153
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,926
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it is the exact plan that we have right now or another plan, I think that we have to open this conversation up.

154
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:18,337
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that there is a lot of room for interpretation in certain areas of it, but I certainly believe that for a city to move forward, and I've always said this, the city needs to be fluid.

155
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:23,341
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have term limitations so we can have these new creative ideas come forward.

156
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,983
[SPEAKER_00]: A city needs to grow.

157
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:31,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to grow is to have new blood come in with new ideas and new interpretations of the way the city should go forward.

158
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think term limitations is something that should also be looked at as part of the conversation.

159
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:40,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Stephanie, would you like a minute rebuttal?

160
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:40,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.

161
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:47,882
[SPEAKER_02]: We've offered many home rule petitions in the city of Medford, and most of them are, you know, six to one votes, seven unanimous.

162
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:51,505
[SPEAKER_02]: The legislature does not look at four to three while it is a simple majority.

163
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,086
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not put weight in that.

164
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,568
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not think that you're really crying out for change.

165
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:06,136
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what happens up at the state legislature, and we did fight, we did try to get it passed, more so for the people that are collecting the signatures, because they deserve to have that ballot question put on.

166
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:08,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that is a very important thing.

167
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:14,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything should be reviewed when you review a ballot on the charter.

168
00:14:14,098 --> 00:14:15,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You should look at all facets of it.

169
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:17,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, I support that wholeheartedly.

170
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,499
[SPEAKER_00]: David?

171
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So you support, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot we can't address each other.

173
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,601
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, as far as the charter goes, I think that the term limitations is the most important part of it.

174
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, again, I will stand behind that 150%.

175
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:40,448
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that wards are a great idea to look at, but it really, let's take a look at the plan.

176
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this plan the best plan for us right now?

177
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:43,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be a different plan?

178
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:50,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to exhaust all avenues and look at that and look at it as a whole, as a city, and really come together and make that decision collectively.

179
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,421
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, terrific.

180
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:56,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next question will go first to David.

181
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:02,846
[SPEAKER_01]: We received a number of questions regarding the vibrancy of Medford's business district.

182
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:06,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And from those questions, I'm going to ask you two.

183
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:07,829
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is this.

184
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:09,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't ask both at once.

185
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:11,071
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is this.

186
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:16,695
[SPEAKER_01]: The parking system remains a source of discussion several years after its debut.

187
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:24,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you propose to leave it as is, or are there steps that you will take that you think could improve the system?

188
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.

189
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,221
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to change this program.

190
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:33,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Why we haven't held Republic's feet to the fire in this respect is absolutely beyond me.

191
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:37,167
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the poorest customer service program I've ever seen.

192
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:56,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere and I've been in customer service for 30 years and I can tell you every contract is designed to be broken We need to sit down with this company We need to hold their feet to the fire and we need to make the program work for the citizens of this city not for the private entity the kiosk program is not working and

193
00:15:56,813 --> 00:16:15,718
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot tell me, for the thousands and thousands of people that I've spoken to, that this is an okay program when they are so frustrated with it that they literally get in their car and drive to an entirely different city, whether it's a CVS or a pizza place, to get their work and job done.

194
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:22,559
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's embarrassing, I think it's frustrating, and I think it's time that we hold this company's feet to the fire.

195
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we don't do it now, we'll never do it,

196
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:41,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything can be renegotiated and it's time to do that and make it more palatable for the people that want to visit our downtowns because I'm telling you right now, if you talk to a lot of the businesses, a good 60% of those businesses are complaining that this program is not working well for them.

197
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Stephanie, your answer to the same question.

198
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:47,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Kennedy.

199
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:58,142
[SPEAKER_02]: The parking program, while not perfect, and I'll agree, it's not perfect, we have tweaked it tremendously in probably the first six months when I took office.

200
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:01,786
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an app on your phone that you can pay for your parking.

201
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:03,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We've dropped the app fee.

202
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 35 cents when we entered the contract.

203
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,733
[SPEAKER_02]: We have it down to a nickel for Medford residents in order to use the app fee.

204
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:27,555
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a business add-on program so that if you were at the doctor's office or you were getting your hair done or anything, any service you were having done in the squares, the business owner can add time to your vehicle so that you don't have to go out because it was a bone of contention at the beginning that some things take more than two hours and if you parked on the street, that's the limit.

205
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:29,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So we made that change as well.

206
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:31,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We made the lots, turned them into three-hour lots.

207
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:35,161
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a senior sticker for $25 per year.

208
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:47,672
[SPEAKER_02]: A senior not only gets the sticker and doesn't have to visit a kiosk or a meter anywhere in the city, but they also have an extra hour on street that they're able to park, a great benefit to our senior citizens as well.

209
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,026
[SPEAKER_02]: We are waiting right now for the Charlie car.

210
00:17:51,086 --> 00:18:00,184
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the piece that I've been pushing for and it comes from the actually developer of the parking kiosk itself, not the, not Republic Parking.

211
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:07,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are waiting on a trolley car that would work similar to your T-pass and just stick it in and it just has your plate on it so you don't have to do anything else.

212
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:13,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to mention that there's an amortization schedule that's attached to the contract.

213
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:22,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were to try to buy out of that contract right now today, it would be $522,000 that the city would have to pay to buy out of the contract.

214
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:28,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus we lose about a little under $500,000 in miscellaneous receipts that we're receiving right now from our parking program.

215
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:35,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two things would go away, then we'd have to buy all new equipment in order to get a program back up in the street.

216
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:40,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've talked to a lot of business owners, and they know that now there is turnover on the street.

217
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:43,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior cars were parking there and taking the bus into town.

218
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:44,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's turnover.

219
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:47,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Your customers have a place to park now.

220
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a very positive thing.

221
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:49,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

222
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:53,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna call an audible.

223
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:58,168
[SPEAKER_01]: We agreed on first names when we were meeting backstage.

224
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:06,370
[SPEAKER_01]: In the formality of this moment, I'm feeling uncomfortable with it, so I'm gonna switch to something a little more formal.

225
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,010
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mr. McKillop, you may respond to that.

226
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. McKillop Sr.

227
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. McKillop Sr., okay.

228
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor, I would agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.

229
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:29,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I don't understand the senior parking program because our seniors have worked hard their entire life.

230
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:36,466
[SPEAKER_00]: If we really desperately need that $25 from our seniors, then I think we're actually worse off than we probably thought we were.

231
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:39,027
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to make it free for the seniors.

232
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:40,208
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number one.

233
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:46,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, all we've done is basically take our commuters and push our commuters further into the neighborhoods.

234
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:57,299
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that has now done for us is try to figure out ways where we have to put more signage further into some of these neighborhoods because our residents are even more frustrated because they can't find parking.

235
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:06,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirdly, when you have open spaces and your businesses are complaining that business is not good, it's not because there's open spaces for good reasons.

236
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:09,787
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because there's open spaces for frustrated reasons.

237
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:11,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have experienced it.

238
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have watched people get frustrated with it.

239
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:17,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you one quick, well, I guess that's it, my time is up.

240
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you for respecting the clock.

241
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:22,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

242
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Muccini-Burke.

243
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:24,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

244
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:31,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I also just wanted to throw out there that we put forth a package to the council for $250,000 to be spent in the various business districts.

245
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:39,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And that money, $50,000 per district, certainly could purchase single head meters if that was what the calling was for, or it could be used for beautification.

246
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,133
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with the chamber.

247
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:48,696
[SPEAKER_02]: They put together a committee so that we can work on this directly and come up with a plan for that $250,000, which is what the council wants to see.

248
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:51,157
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to see details of how it will be spent.

249
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:52,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing.

250
00:20:54,657 --> 00:21:00,241
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this parking program kind of noosed me two years ago, and I know that it's an issue.

251
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:04,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've tried so hard to make changes that make sense and that make it easier.

252
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:12,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really urge people, when you go to Somerville and you go to Boston and you're using your phone to pay for your parking, you can do that in Medford too.

253
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:13,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've gotten the word out there.

254
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,131
[SPEAKER_02]: So just use your phone.

255
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:15,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so easy.

256
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:16,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how I travel.

257
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I do when I stop during the day.

258
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:23,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure that you load up that app and you use it, because it is a huge benefit.

259
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:29,396
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I think that we can finish a sentence.

260
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Finishing a sentence is fine.

261
00:21:33,198 --> 00:21:34,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving forward.

262
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go off onto another subject area, but finishing a sentence is fine.

263
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:45,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Our second question related to Medford's business districts is this.

264
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:54,137
[SPEAKER_01]: How will you make the commercial tax base in the city broader, including more food and beverage options for the squares?

265
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question goes first to Ms.

266
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Macchini-Berg.

267
00:21:58,281 --> 00:21:58,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

268
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:05,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important as part of our Medford Square master plan that we've just finished the work on.

269
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:08,846
[SPEAKER_02]: The report is online at the City of Medford website.

270
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:10,266
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mixed use.

271
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Mixed use is what we have in Station Landing.

272
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It works in other communities.

273
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:19,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to build up the mixed use features in Medford Square.

274
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:25,451
[SPEAKER_02]: You do see it to a small degree, but it's not very dense when you look at two stories maybe above the storefronts.

275
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really important that we add that element to Medford Square.

276
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:37,116
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a zoning amendment that is going to be offered to the city council very shortly so that we can work collaboratively with them as well.

277
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:46,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, on Mystic Avenue, we just received another grant in order to look at the Mystic Avenue corridor for zoning, specifically for zoning purpose.

278
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:55,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to walk away at the end of this process with an actual amendment that can then go to the city council and they know that everyone has worked on this process.

279
00:22:55,505 --> 00:23:04,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are two key elements that I think will add businesses to the square and also the mixed use so you bring people that will now go into the businesses.

280
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:09,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really important, I think, for us to be recruiting businesses, a diversified business base.

281
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:18,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where the city and the chamber work together in order to look at businesses that we think are lacking in the square and try to reach out and recruit them.

282
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:20,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried that in a couple of occasions.

283
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a business liaison in my office

284
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:26,672
[SPEAKER_02]: We have attempted to reach out and try to get certain types of business into the city.

285
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:31,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that you were saying all these grand openings that we're having, there's a lot going on in Medford.

286
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:38,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you look at the types of restaurants in Medford Square in particular, you can eat pretty much anything from any country and we have it there.

287
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:41,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a great diversity of restaurants right now.

288
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

289
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. McKillop.

290
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that there is so much more to do in this.

291
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:49,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the master plan is a start.

292
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:54,594
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good start, but it's a contrast for what I believe is what we need to do for businesses in the downtown.

293
00:23:54,954 --> 00:23:57,815
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have the infrastructure to move this forward.

294
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:09,020
[SPEAKER_00]: If we did have the infrastructure to move this forward, it would look a lot different than the way it looks right now, which is the same office and the same community development program for the past 20 plus, maybe even 30 years.

295
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,422
[SPEAKER_00]: To move a city forward, you have to, again, build the infrastructure to get there.

296
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,663
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't believe we're in that position yet.

297
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:28,307
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even have a design and review board to help businesses come into the city and really work with each and every individual downtown in their personalities to move each and every downtown forward.

298
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:33,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Hillside is completely different than what's going on in Medford Square, which is completely different than what goes on in Ainsquare.

299
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:43,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a design and review board to help these businesses because if Johnny Pizza wants to come in and they want to open up a pizza place and they think Hillside is the best place to go,

300
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:47,254
[SPEAKER_00]: There's seven pizza places in a row in Hillside.

301
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to help them to understand.

302
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:52,917
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens then is it creates mix.

303
00:24:53,418 --> 00:24:55,419
[SPEAKER_00]: And mix is what gets business going.

304
00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:00,842
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want a downtown that has several of the same type of product downtown.

305
00:25:01,122 --> 00:25:04,244
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a mix so people can get excited about that.

306
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:08,047
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part that I want to talk about the master plan is I'm really confused by it.

307
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,828
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't really much in there about development of business.

308
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:17,493
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is they're talking about eliminating 40% of the parking which is based off of a Nelson Nygaard study from 2005.

309
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:30,262
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have Chevalier Theatre going like we're all saying that's going to come up and running and then we have five new businesses downtown and throw a couple of hundred people on the street and then somewhere along the line the waterway gets going,

310
00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:33,003
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we eliminating 40% of our business?

311
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:34,143
[SPEAKER_00]: The master plan is not 100%.

312
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:44,208
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not ready to be initiated, and we certainly don't have the amount of people that we need in the community development or design and review to move this forward.

313
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:45,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

314
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:47,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Puccini-Burke, your one-minute response.

315
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I differ from his opinion.

316
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:59,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the master plan has been a very concerted effort on the part of businesses, residents who came out to all the meetings in order to get it to be what we want it to be.

317
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:02,885
[SPEAKER_02]: That plan will use shared parking.

318
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,266
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to create more parking.

319
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:06,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to use shared parking.

320
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:09,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people that live in the units during the day and go to work,

321
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:12,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Their spaces will open up and the businesses will use them.

322
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we're going to network the parking issue.

323
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:17,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's really an important element as well.

324
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:21,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not going to lose 40% of the parking spaces in Medford Square.

325
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:22,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you that.

326
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:23,628
[SPEAKER_02]: That will not happen.

327
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:28,992
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing about the master plan is to bring businesses and mixed use to the river.

328
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:31,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we're not embracing the river.

329
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:32,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge asset for us.

330
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:35,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to do better work at that.

331
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:37,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what this master plan is leading us to.

332
00:26:37,938 --> 00:26:38,638
[SPEAKER_02]: The development.

333
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:51,576
[SPEAKER_02]: closer to the river along the City Hall line where there's so much open space there that we can really capitalize on to create this mixed-use vibrant downtown so people can enjoy the multitude of restaurants that are already there.

334
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I just shut off.

335
00:26:55,562 --> 00:26:56,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. McKillop.

336
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,985
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the riverway is a sore spot for me because that is the jewel of the downtown.

337
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:07,068
[SPEAKER_00]: We could reinvent the entire downtown by using that riverway.

338
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,329
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to get close.

339
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:09,370
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be on it.

340
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about time we look at that.

341
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:12,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Ring Road has to go.

342
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,976
[SPEAKER_00]: The development has to be on the water.

343
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:17,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Just visualize the fact that there's a boardwalk.

344
00:27:17,598 --> 00:27:24,880
[SPEAKER_00]: with all these great restaurants and shops that face the water with cafe style doors where you can sit down and enjoy that type of environment.

345
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:34,502
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's mixed use where there's actually condos or townhomes or affordable housing mixed in there that really brings the whole downtown to a totally different level.

346
00:27:34,882 --> 00:27:38,523
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to open our eyes and create new and exciting ways to look at this city.

347
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:47,345
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting close to the water, it is being on the water and using the water and that will move this city forward and that will reinvent Medford permanently.

348
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:51,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, our next question is as follows.

349
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:56,067
[SPEAKER_01]: The housing market in Medford is exploding.

350
00:27:57,107 --> 00:28:00,528
[SPEAKER_01]: 02155 has been named one of the hottest real estate zip codes in the country.

351
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:10,510
[SPEAKER_01]: What can the city do to develop a strategic housing plan so that long-time residents don't get squeezed out and young families can afford to live here?

352
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll begin with Mr. McKillop.

353
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,462
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always say, if I sell my house today, I can't afford to buy it back.

354
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,044
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem in Medford.

355
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:21,705
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a problem.

356
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people look at it as a good problem, some people look at it as a bad problem.

357
00:28:25,508 --> 00:28:39,278
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm walking neighborhoods, there are people that have been in their houses for 60, 70 years, and they're retirees, and they can't find a way to make it affordable to live in their own house because year after year, the house gets reappraised for tax purposes.

358
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:45,583
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some people out there that have their home, they bought it for $20,000 or $30,000, and today it's worth $900,000.

359
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:56,871
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they're finding is that they're having to ask family members to come in and move in with them because their tax base payment is $10,000 or even more a year.

360
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:04,598
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing that to the citizens that have contributed so much to this city for so many years?

361
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:08,342
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look at tax incentives for these folks.

362
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:14,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what we have to do is not only do we have to look at low-income housing, we have to look at middle-income housing and try to balance that.

363
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:17,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to take a look at the way we're going to do that.

364
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:21,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of that comes from the Community Preservation Act because there is that 70% of free money.

365
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:25,499
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other ways that we can look at that and we need to balance that.

366
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it goes back to what are we going to do?

367
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:28,842
[SPEAKER_00]: First, start with zoning.

368
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:39,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, stop this density program that we have going on because that will definitely gentrify everything and eliminate the process of trying to keep these downtowns a little bit more balanced for everyone.

369
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:40,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

370
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:41,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

371
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:42,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacini-Burke.

372
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

373
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:56,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, I think in part of all of the development that we're going to see, which Medford is a very popular place to be, and if we do some of these mixed-use projects, we will have additional housing opportunities.

374
00:29:56,625 --> 00:30:03,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So the key to that is including the affordability component into every new building that goes on.

375
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:04,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, we're acquiring 10%.

376
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:08,207
[SPEAKER_02]: That number will probably be increased in the very near future.

377
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:12,815
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is an inclusionary zoning ordinance that will up that percentage.

378
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:22,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it does is it gives developers an opportunity that if you do more affordable housing, we'll let you maybe get away with a few less parking spaces.

379
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:27,567
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're actually working with developers so that you get a mix that works for the city of Medford.

380
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:36,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think inclusionary zoning is, it can be a voluntary basis where if they do more, they may not have to reach some of the setbacks and things of that nature that go along with zoning.

381
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:47,899
[SPEAKER_02]: As many people know, we did a mixed-use zone down in Station Landing, and I think that that is really, it was one of the first mixed-use, first transit-oriented development zoning opportunities that we had.

382
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:51,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see how it has worked and how it has benefited the city.

383
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:59,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need some of that, and we need some more commercial entities so that we can continue to spread the tax burden across all the different elements.

384
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:04,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that those two things combined will be very productive for the city.

385
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:10,479
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe, I go back to exactly what I said before.

386
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:16,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Building the business base is going to increase the tax base which will level some of the residential burden.

387
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:21,784
[SPEAKER_00]: The more that we get these businesses up and running and do the mixed use, the more important it is.

388
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:28,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that we can do that with each downtown and recreating the downtowns by keeping the same personality.

389
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:34,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's crucial to the movement of all these people that are gonna be coming into Medford

390
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:47,272
[SPEAKER_00]: They have every expectation that they want to be able to enjoy Medford, and we need to recreate the downtown so we can have that tax base increase so we can level the playing field on the way we actually set the taxes up.

391
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:54,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Because year after year, taking a look at the way we're gonna find money and attacking the homeowners is just not the way to go anymore.

392
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:55,193
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not feasible.

393
00:31:55,474 --> 00:31:59,334
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't continue to run a business, you can't continue to run a city like that.

394
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:01,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

395
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:01,795
[SPEAKER_00]: McCheney-Burke.

396
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:02,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

397
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:14,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if many of you in the audience know, but pretty much every year, certainly in the last 25, the tax burden has been shifted to the greatest degree to commercial entities as opposed to the residential.

398
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:17,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have done that over and over again.

399
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:21,026
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council has voted for that tax relief for the residents.

400
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:24,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's still hard on the pocket, but with rising costs,

401
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:26,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Things don't stay stable.

402
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:28,150
[SPEAKER_02]: There's rising costs out there.

403
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,193
[SPEAKER_02]: There's salaries that are increasing, and there's infrastructure needs that we need to pay for.

404
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:39,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to do what's within prop two and a half, which is we have totally complied with, and we need to figure out how to best spend that money.

405
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's, those are some things that we have to do.

406
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting back to the river, that's the point.

407
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:53,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the point I was making is we need to move everything to the river, but we need to have the footpaths that go in front of the houses so that we continue on

408
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,352
[SPEAKER_02]: with all the connectivity that we're doing right now.

409
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:02,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also want to see housing and mixed use closer to the river so that we can benefit from it.

410
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:03,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge asset.

411
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:05,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been ignored for too long.

412
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a priority.

413
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is part of the master plan.

414
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:11,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question for the timekeeper.

415
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:17,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that we've gone through 2, 2, 1, 1 on that question.

416
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,052
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rebuttals were showing 2 on the clock.

417
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure I didn't get confused.

418
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,640
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

419
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:29,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup, okay.

420
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:33,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure I haven't lost my place, not a problem.

421
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:36,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

422
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:46,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Muccini-Burke, do you support rebuilding the Medford Public Library, specifically by way of the city's matching the state grant so that the new building can go forward?

423
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,048
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, when can we expect the rebuilding to begin?

424
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:54,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we put together, with the great help of our council president,

425
00:33:55,017 --> 00:34:00,641
[SPEAKER_02]: in seven months a grant application that normally takes communities two to three years to do.

426
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:08,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, when we put in that application, we thought that we would be maybe in phase two of the allotment of the grant if we were even successful.

427
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:21,155
[SPEAKER_02]: When we got the word that we were in the first round, which is this year, we all kind of went into a little bit of a panic because we wanted to put a foundation in place a year and a half prior to being able to utilize the grant.

428
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,516
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, we have put together a form to foundation.

429
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:32,898
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be seeking out contributions in order to hopefully match what the state has put up, which is about $12.6 million.

430
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge grant.

431
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:50,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very optimistic from those that have already been interviewed and people that we have reached out to that we will be able to parlay the state grant, double it with the foundation money, and then be left for the city to put up a piece, which is about $5 million, which is the goal.

432
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:52,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very optimistic.

433
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We are embracing the new library.

434
00:34:54,525 --> 00:35:01,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I wholeheartedly support it, or I would not have asked for the committee to be put together to get the grant even off the ground.

435
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:10,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think everybody knows, and I've said it at every meeting, every public meeting that I've been at, if I ask someone to do something, it's not just to put it on the shelf.

436
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:11,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really to enact it.

437
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:16,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for all the hard work, the people that worked on that building committee, Mr. Carviello.

438
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:39,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the hard work that you've done to to secure this grant and we look forward to moving forward with it Mr. McKillop, so I'm about priorities and I know that when you were elected mayor that you your priority was to take care of the police and fire department and that has now been kind of put to little a little to the behind before the actual library and

439
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,833
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, now that it's done, we already have the grant.

440
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:49,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, is it that you've already raised $17 million?

441
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:51,103
[SPEAKER_00]: You've planned to raise $17 million?

442
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:54,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the end, most people have already said, and it's been reported by

443
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:59,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Wicked Local that it would cost up to $34 million to build this library.

444
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:06,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying the burden is $5 million for the citizens of Medford, so $17 million has been found?

445
00:36:07,193 --> 00:36:19,338
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money to find in this period of time, and I'm hoping that's the case because I'd like to be able to do the same thing for the Police and Fire Department, which I believe we need to have yesterday, because that's, to me, what the priority should have been.

446
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all in favor of a new library.

447
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:23,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should have a new library, but it's priorities for me.

448
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:32,284
[SPEAKER_02]: As everyone knows, we have appropriated $2 million for new police headquarters.

449
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:37,285
[SPEAKER_02]: This talk about it not happening or that it's fictitious is so inaccurate.

450
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:39,045
[SPEAKER_02]: We've put the money up, $2 million.

451
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:40,926
[SPEAKER_02]: The architect meets every single week.

452
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:45,367
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an onus project manager, an OPM on board that meets with us as well.

453
00:36:47,007 --> 00:37:00,218
[SPEAKER_02]: and the engineer from the city hall and we also have the chief who's put together a team of police officers of all ranks and all sexes to go around and visit various police stations around us so that we can get the best with our plan.

454
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:09,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So to say that the police department is not a priority of mine is very disingenuous because that was the priority and that is why we're working so hard to get it done.

455
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:10,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

456
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:20,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if it was a priority, then I think the grant writing for the library first prior to the grant writing for the police and fire station doesn't make sense to me.

457
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:30,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to have, each of you would like to have one more back and forth on this?

458
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:31,092
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that.

459
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:32,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, please.

460
00:37:32,993 --> 00:37:37,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've talked to Congresswoman Clark, all of our US senators.

461
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:41,935
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no grant money for police stations for infrastructure.

462
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:43,115
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not there.

463
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:55,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the director of public safety for the state of Massachusetts walk through our police station, agree with us that it is in deplorable condition, and then said, walk up to Lawrence and go look at theirs.

464
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:58,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to say Medford is not as bad as Lawrence.

465
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,581
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they told us.

466
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:06,387
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no funding, unlike the schools, that you can go to the MSBA and get 54, 55 percent match.

467
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:08,789
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no funding out there for public safety.

468
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I've raised that with our state delegation as well.

469
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I've raised it with the governor and the lieutenant governor.

470
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:23,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's saying it's a great idea, but they need to figure out how they can get the money in order to match the city of Medford and all these other communities that are dealing with crumbling stations.

471
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:26,500
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a priority.

472
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. McKillop, you may have up to a minute to respond to that.

473
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:34,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawrence is not as bad as Medford, thank God.

474
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:38,315
[SPEAKER_00]: But Malden is three times better than Medford.

475
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,139
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're proud of that.

476
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:44,738
[SPEAKER_00]: then we should end the conversation right now.

477
00:38:45,298 --> 00:38:53,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the end result is we need to set the priority and we needed to set it from the beginning of the year last year, this year.

478
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:59,232
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all of a sudden we're starting to work on that and it's frustrating to me that we haven't taken it to a different level.

479
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:02,435
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even have a grant writer ready to write a grant to make this happen.

480
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:05,298
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more.

481
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:08,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You people want to see this?

482
00:39:14,882 --> 00:39:16,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell you what, it's a debate.

483
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:17,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's debate.

484
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:19,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

485
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:24,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Muccini-Burke and Mr. McKillop can each have one more minute, and then I think we can move on to another topic.

486
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:26,835
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that understand,

487
00:39:27,953 --> 00:39:29,374
[SPEAKER_02]: government and how it works.

488
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:31,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fast.

489
00:39:31,774 --> 00:39:33,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Procurement takes time.

490
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:36,176
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to go out and procure for the architect.

491
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,977
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to go out and procure for the owner's project manager.

492
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:42,958
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to follow all these steps in government in order to get things done.

493
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,360
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to know how big we were building the station and we had to find a location for it.

494
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:59,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked to every owner of property in the city of Medford, from up in the hillside area to Wellington to the courthouse, the Cambridge courthouse that sits in the city of Medford and doesn't service us as a district court.

495
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:03,341
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked to every person to see if there was a place that we could get into

496
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:04,839
[SPEAKER_02]: little quicker.

497
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:14,710
[SPEAKER_02]: When all was said and done, a lot of the officers that I spoke to said, we like being right here in the heart of Medford that we can get to any location in minutes.

498
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,372
[SPEAKER_02]: We like this location.

499
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:20,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what drove us back to the training facility, which is where we're building it.

500
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:27,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the next probably six months, you're going to see that building come down, and then you're going to see a new structure go up.

501
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:31,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know many of the offices in this room tonight have been part of this process.

502
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:33,248
[SPEAKER_02]: They've looked at the plans.

503
00:40:33,428 --> 00:40:37,591
[SPEAKER_02]: They've chosen an option because there were two that were just delivered to them in the last two weeks.

504
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:41,775
[SPEAKER_02]: They've selected the option that they like best, and that's where we're going with this.

505
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:42,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

506
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:48,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's hold your applause if we can.

507
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:51,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. McKillop, you may have a minute and 15 seconds if you choose.

508
00:40:51,942 --> 00:40:53,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I go back to priorities.

509
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:56,247
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty common sense for me, and I only deal with the facts.

510
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,351
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a priority, and it's been a priority.

511
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:03,293
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know the condition of that fire and police department.

512
00:41:03,614 --> 00:41:04,154
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it.

513
00:41:04,635 --> 00:41:05,395
[SPEAKER_00]: It's horrific.

514
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:06,556
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bad situation.

515
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:11,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for a fact that the police went to you, Mayor Burke,

516
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:16,562
[SPEAKER_00]: with a plan for the female officers to get them out of a bathroom and actually give them a place to change.

517
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:19,163
[SPEAKER_00]: That plan was put together by the police officers.

518
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:20,363
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ready to go.

519
00:41:20,683 --> 00:41:22,264
[SPEAKER_00]: They even had the dollar amount ready.

520
00:41:22,624 --> 00:41:24,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last hour, the answer was no.

521
00:41:24,884 --> 00:41:28,605
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet we found $500,000 to put a new park on Riverside Ave.

522
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I just look at priorities, folks.

523
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:34,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I think we can move on at this point.

524
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:40,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a little applause for both of them, so we're even.

525
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

526
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:48,706
[SPEAKER_01]: The opioid crisis affects Medford as well as the country as a whole.

527
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:54,831
[SPEAKER_01]: What more can be done in our schools to prevent our children from becoming involved with opioids?

528
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:57,393
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question goes first to Mr. McKillop.

529
00:41:58,472 --> 00:41:59,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had said this before.

530
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:05,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the opioid crisis should take precedence over everything because it's actually destroying entire families.

531
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:05,897
[SPEAKER_00]: It's horrific.

532
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:07,599
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scary to all of us.

533
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one person has the answer to this.

534
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:11,441
[SPEAKER_00]: We need civic leaders.

535
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:12,582
[SPEAKER_00]: We need religious leaders.

536
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:13,703
[SPEAKER_00]: We need medical leaders.

537
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:20,770
[SPEAKER_00]: to come together in an emergency type situation in the city of Medford, whether it's weekly, bi-weekly, whatever we need to do.

538
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:31,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the school is also that important link, the teachers and the parents to come in there and talk not just about curriculum, but to talk and open it up.

539
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,904
[SPEAKER_00]: The dialogue needs to happen for these children as young as kindergarten all the way up.

540
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:51,012
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to understand what they're faced with, and they need to hear it from both parents and teachers, and administrators, and counselors, and really show that we're behind these children so they can move forward in life and not have to deal with this situation.

541
00:42:51,052 --> 00:43:03,098
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a scary, scary, scary time, and if we don't wrap our arms around it and take a volunteer look at this, because this is something we need to fix yesterday, folks, and we've got to get involved, and we've got to do it now.

542
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:04,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

543
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:05,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacini-Burke.

544
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:06,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

545
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:18,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crisis and we need to just face the fact it is a crisis and it is a priority for cities, towns, states across this country and we have been

546
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:26,520
[SPEAKER_02]: fortunate in obtaining grant money so that we can attempt to fight this horrible disease that it has turned into.

547
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have received grants for the school department so that they're doing educational programs, because it all starts with education.

548
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:34,582
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, that's where it all starts.

549
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:37,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to teach the kids to stay on the track.

550
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:43,324
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've also expanded that in the city of Medford with our opioid team, our team Medford.

551
00:43:43,904 --> 00:43:49,792
[SPEAKER_02]: that meets with not only people suffering from opioid addiction in the schools and in the city, but the trades.

552
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:51,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so commonplace in the trades.

553
00:43:51,934 --> 00:44:00,024
[SPEAKER_02]: When we've done our analyses, they've shown 40% of all the opioid issues that come through the public safety arena

554
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:04,007
[SPEAKER_02]: are people from the trades because of the hard work that they do.

555
00:44:04,428 --> 00:44:11,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when they get injured, they have to get some medicine to get through the day because they need to put food on the table for their family.

556
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:14,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have found that there is a huge issue there as well.

557
00:44:14,414 --> 00:44:19,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been devoting a lot of time and energy to meeting with the unions and the tradesmen as a whole.

558
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:23,321
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can get to them and try to provide them help.

559
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:29,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, for the first time, we've offered a budget item that started July 1st for a full-time recovery coach.

560
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,688
[SPEAKER_02]: This young man is out in the neighborhoods.

561
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:33,270
[SPEAKER_02]: He's talking to people.

562
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,651
[SPEAKER_02]: He's educating people.

563
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:41,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's working hand-in-hand with the school nurses, the teachers, all the extracurricular programs that are there.

564
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:47,178
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with them, the coaches, who sometimes may be the first line of defense to see things that are going on.

565
00:44:47,658 --> 00:44:50,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they know what to look for, they can catch things earlier.

566
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:55,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have been doing that in a concerted effort, and we're meeting with the district attorney, Ryan.

567
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,121
[SPEAKER_02]: She holds monthly meetings at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

568
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:05,002
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a team of police chiefs and doctors and nurses from all across the region that touch Medford.

569
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:11,464
[SPEAKER_02]: We meet there monthly in order to do best practices so that we can figure out how can we move forward to curb this epidemic.

570
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:14,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Mr. McKillop, your response.

571
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:19,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I said a sense of urgency, to me a sense of urgency is not meeting monthly.

572
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,713
[SPEAKER_00]: A sense of urgency is meeting weekly if we have to, daily if we have to.

573
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:25,214
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get our arms around this.

574
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:33,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Spencer is a young man that lived in my neighborhood and we saw him grow up and we're very, very proud of that young man and he's doing great things, but that is just not enough.

575
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:36,022
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs an army behind him.

576
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:44,388
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get together as a community, and we need to fight this with everything we've got, and a monthly meeting with the DA is not gonna cut it.

577
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:46,150
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get together, folks.

578
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:57,798
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get everyone in our community, all of our leaders, to rise up and make this happen for our kids, for our future, for families, because it's not just about construction workers, it's about everyone, and it's touching everyone.

579
00:45:59,380 --> 00:45:59,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

580
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,021
[SPEAKER_00]: McCheney-Burke, your response.

581
00:46:01,712 --> 00:46:02,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

582
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:06,295
[SPEAKER_02]: We meet regularly in the city of Medford on this topic.

583
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:07,716
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plans.

584
00:46:08,136 --> 00:46:12,259
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had in plain sight exposés in City Hall.

585
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:15,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We've set up a room so the parents know what to look for.

586
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:18,263
[SPEAKER_02]: You would be amazed at things that are right in front of your face.

587
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,585
[SPEAKER_02]: that have bottoms that pop out of them, and things are in them.

588
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:29,650
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did in plain sight, and I don't think I saw anyone here at that event, but there were a lot of people from the general public that came out to it.

589
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming.

590
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:32,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an informative night.

591
00:46:32,872 --> 00:46:34,273
[SPEAKER_02]: We hold these all the time.

592
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:41,077
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much going on in the city because we want to get to the parents so that they can see what's transpiring, so they can

593
00:46:41,957 --> 00:46:48,343
[SPEAKER_02]: see that little, that something about their child, something has gone wrong that they can correct and catch it early.

594
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:58,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing that through education in our school system and the city of Medford playing a very active role in outreach as well as providing an educational support system.

595
00:46:58,673 --> 00:47:01,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe me, that office has a little army.

596
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:04,479
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about seven people in that office and we meet regularly on it.

597
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:06,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

598
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:11,149
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a very thorough and interesting exchange on the police station.

599
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:14,271
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another public safety related question.

600
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:26,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Given that Medford is a growing community, do you believe that our police and fire departments need to be expanded in order to respond to an increase in issues related to public safety?

601
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question first goes to Ms.

602
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:29,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Machiney-Berg.

603
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:30,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

604
00:47:31,153 --> 00:47:33,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we are actually in the process of expanding.

605
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:41,216
[SPEAKER_02]: If you looked at this year's budget, we put in monies for January to start a civilian staffing of our 9-1-1 program.

606
00:47:41,856 --> 00:47:51,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that will do is the money that will be spent on the civilian staffing will free up officers that are in there now, generally three at the time, will be back in force.

607
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:53,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's three on a given shift.

608
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:59,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will have about seven extra offices that are basically being added to patrol and or

609
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,760
[SPEAKER_02]: traffic, whatever the case may be.

610
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did with this year's budget was a reallocation by putting in the civilian.

611
00:48:07,242 --> 00:48:10,904
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to garner additional people that can be out in the streets.

612
00:48:11,444 --> 00:48:12,864
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's very important.

613
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:18,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I think if you look at the budget, you have a limited amount of money that you can spend.

614
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:23,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have to allocate that source of funding across all different spectrums.

615
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:26,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of important things going on in the city of Medford.

616
00:48:27,511 --> 00:48:37,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So from that regard, we did increase the police budget, which I thought was warranted, and we will be seeing increases probably going forward as well.

617
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:39,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. McKillop.

618
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:42,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the police budget is not enough.

619
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:46,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that what we have to do is we have to come up with a comprehensive plan to move forward.

620
00:48:46,497 --> 00:48:50,800
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to have all of this growth in the city, we need a formula.

621
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:59,447
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know exactly how many people or an estimated amount of people that will actually be moving into the city of Medford and how many police officers and firemen we need for that.

622
00:48:59,887 --> 00:49:04,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to plan ahead of that and not just try to work with what we've got.

623
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to kind of open our eyes and broaden our horizons in the respect of where we want to go.

624
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:20,721
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have 5,000 new people coming into the city of Medford because of development, out of the 5,000, how many police officers and firemen and emergency medical people that we need in this city?

625
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:22,081
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we need to do.

626
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:24,323
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to sit down and have that type of a conversation

627
00:49:24,643 --> 00:49:30,407
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are proactive, not reactive, and we are ready for the influx of new people coming into the city.

628
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:36,752
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already behind the eight ball with the staffing of the police station, the police department, as well as the fire department.

629
00:49:37,493 --> 00:49:41,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that one of the campaign promises was to create a foot patrol for all the downtowns.

630
00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:42,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great idea.

631
00:49:43,057 --> 00:49:48,221
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the things I think I would love to agree with you on, but I think we have to investigate how we're going to do that.

632
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:52,785
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to talk about budget, our budget is very, very top-heavy.

633
00:49:52,845 --> 00:49:57,889
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a very balanced budget, and there are things that we can do to balance the budget a little bit better.

634
00:49:58,269 --> 00:49:59,130
[SPEAKER_00]: I've looked at the budget.

635
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's an incredibly top-heavy budget, and you become stagnant.

636
00:50:03,994 --> 00:50:07,197
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't move when you have a very top-heavy budget, and you need to work with that.

637
00:50:08,128 --> 00:50:08,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

638
00:50:08,328 --> 00:50:09,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Macchini-Burk, your response?

639
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:12,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did want to just add one thing on foot patrols.

640
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,152
[SPEAKER_02]: We did implement a change in the way that our sector cars are dispersed.

641
00:50:16,192 --> 00:50:24,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, they're regularly out of the vehicles, walking the squares, meeting the business owners and the constituents that are there every single day.

642
00:50:25,037 --> 00:50:31,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did put that in place, and Chief Sacco has been very on top of making sure that that happens.

643
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:40,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the calls in when we've discovered people that were living under our footbridge in Medford Square that no one knew was living there because of the foot patrol.

644
00:50:40,382 --> 00:50:42,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were able to discover a lot of those types of things.

645
00:50:43,323 --> 00:50:46,124
[SPEAKER_02]: They've also been able to move people along if they're loitering.

646
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:49,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've also just gotten to know people a little bit better.

647
00:50:49,385 --> 00:50:52,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're big supporters of that, obviously.

648
00:50:52,706 --> 00:50:54,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

649
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:56,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. McKillop.

650
00:50:57,757 --> 00:50:59,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think there's enough of an effort there.

651
00:50:59,398 --> 00:51:00,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be consistent.

652
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we have bigger, broader issues.

653
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,381
[SPEAKER_00]: We just talked about the opioid crisis and how that's overpowering us.

654
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:09,843
[SPEAKER_00]: We just talked about the fact that we're gonna have all these people moving in to the city.

655
00:51:10,644 --> 00:51:13,005
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much going on, so many moving parts.

656
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:16,787
[SPEAKER_00]: A sporadic officer on the street is just not enough.

657
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,228
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be a more consistent presence.

658
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:24,791
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to really get people to understand that we're there to help and these officers are willing to do that.

659
00:51:25,151 --> 00:51:27,532
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to have enough of a force to be able to do it.

660
00:51:28,933 --> 00:51:29,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

661
00:51:31,535 --> 00:51:32,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next question is this.

662
00:51:33,796 --> 00:51:40,079
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your cultural plan and what steps would you take to ensure that Medford has a vibrant arts community?

663
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,621
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes first to Mr. McKillop.

664
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:54,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the city that my business is in, Salem Mass, I'm sure you all know where Salem is, it's a huge art community and jazz festival and a lot of moving parts in that city.

665
00:51:54,627 --> 00:51:59,330
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the unique opportunities that I have bringing to Medford is I've experienced all of that.

666
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of that.

667
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:09,215
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we had art shows in my own restaurant, because that's how important it is for the community of Salem, and I'd like to be able to bring that to Medford as well.

668
00:52:09,515 --> 00:52:19,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Because believe it or not, that is something that goes incredibly hand in hand with the downtowns, because the downtowns being an old retailer, this is something we talked about 25, 30 years ago,

669
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:31,472
[SPEAKER_00]: The malls will not be as important as downtown areas, but you cannot compete with recreated downtown areas like Assembly Row and Station Landing.

670
00:52:31,772 --> 00:52:32,773
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's happening.

671
00:52:32,813 --> 00:52:35,456
[SPEAKER_00]: The big companies are coming in and they're recreating downtown.

672
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:37,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these downtowns are struggling.

673
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:39,500
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get the same retail that you would get

674
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,740
[SPEAKER_00]: see over there.

675
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:49,905
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to be very unique and inviting, and the way to do that is to work in conjunction with art, jazz, music, and move this all forward.

676
00:52:49,945 --> 00:52:57,488
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some great festivals that we could put in this city, like a jazz festival, like an art festival, that we've already done some of that, but in a different and broader scale.

677
00:52:57,788 --> 00:53:06,392
[SPEAKER_00]: A chocolate festival, an ice festival, there's many, many ways that we can bring the life back into these downtowns, and I'm a huge advocate of that.

678
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:07,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

679
00:53:07,553 --> 00:53:08,213
[SPEAKER_00]: McCheney-Burke.

680
00:53:08,582 --> 00:53:08,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

681
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:11,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Likewise, I'm a huge advocate for that.

682
00:53:11,685 --> 00:53:17,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I think arts and culture really are an economic catalyst for downtowns.

683
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:18,331
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that.

684
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:20,833
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we've spent so much time on the Chevalier Theatre.

685
00:53:20,873 --> 00:53:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: We think that that is an immense opportunity to bring thousands of people, the theatre holds 2,000 people, to shows on an ongoing basis.

686
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:32,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that is up and running and we have people in there, it's

687
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:34,726
[SPEAKER_02]: New Year's Eve, his first act.

688
00:53:35,326 --> 00:53:37,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have some other things coming up there too.

689
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:39,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankie Valli showing up in April.

690
00:53:40,573 --> 00:53:45,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So once they're in there and having their shows regularly, it is a catalyst for economic growth.

691
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:51,246
[SPEAKER_02]: But to talk to arts and culture, when I talk to people, they talk about the single artist.

692
00:53:52,587 --> 00:53:54,069
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to expose their work.

693
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:55,190
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to show their work.

694
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:02,178
[SPEAKER_02]: We created a forum in City Hall where every month we're flipping out different artists and their work so that it's on display.

695
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:08,785
[SPEAKER_02]: If you come up, come up our two hallways and you can see all the beautiful artwork that citizens are producing on a regular basis.

696
00:54:09,226 --> 00:54:10,407
[SPEAKER_02]: We've paid attention to that.

697
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:19,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the Riverside Plaza project that we're putting up will have another location to be the mecca for all opportunities for the city to invest in events.

698
00:54:20,451 --> 00:54:25,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some of the great people here this evening that put them on, and they put them on in a parking lot.

699
00:54:25,534 --> 00:54:27,114
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to put them on.

700
00:54:27,134 --> 00:54:27,915
[SPEAKER_02]: They're that eager.

701
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:39,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look forward to working with you for a beautiful space, City Hall now being one of the key locations that will be able to house a lot of different events going on in the city in a very safe environment.

702
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,084
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Bill Blumenrecht, I can't say enough about him, what he has done with the Wilbur.

703
00:54:44,504 --> 00:54:46,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has already gotten into the city.

704
00:54:46,606 --> 00:54:58,536
[SPEAKER_02]: He's meeting with the chamber in another month, but he's met with the friends of the Chevalier in order to really figure out what are they all about and how can we best use that asset in order to move the city forward.

705
00:54:58,576 --> 00:55:02,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really proud of that, and we think that art belongs in every neighborhood.

706
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:10,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also working on some sides of buildings and we're trying to get some of the landlords to approve that we can do murals on the sides of buildings.

707
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:16,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in it in a host of ways and I have a cultural liaison that deals with this stuff every single day.

708
00:55:17,256 --> 00:55:17,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

709
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. McKillop, your response.

710
00:55:20,878 --> 00:55:24,579
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the City Hall is a great start, but I don't think it's enough.

711
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:28,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the folks that are making the art want to be able to move that around the city.

712
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:44,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So utilizing the restaurants and utilizing the different areas and inviting some sort of a festival where all of the restaurants and some of the shops are actually showing this wonderful product, where there's an opportunity to purchase it, I think is a great way to do that.

713
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:49,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the City Hall is great, but unless you're doing business in City Hall, you're not going to be able to appreciate

714
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:51,025
[SPEAKER_00]: the wonderful art that's out there.

715
00:55:52,046 --> 00:55:57,948
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as Chevalier Theatre goes, I'm really, really excited about Chevalier Theatre, and I think it's a great opportunity.

716
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:12,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I wonder, again, this is not against Mr. Bloomingwright, but I think it's a good judgment, and it's priorities, and there is a vetting process, and I know the vetting process was done between two groups.

717
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:14,813
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the North Shore Music Theatre, and it was Bill Bloomingwright.

718
00:56:15,193 --> 00:56:25,142
[SPEAKER_00]: And I question the way the vetting process goes, because when I vetted the two of them, I know that there was one concern for North Shore Music Theater, which was a real estate development issue.

719
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:34,530
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go back, my concern when I went to that meeting was there wasn't enough information with regards to all of the certificates that

720
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:50,059
[SPEAKER_00]: we needed for that contract, like Choke Safe, Serve Safe, Tip Safe, Certification, ASCAP, CSAC, and there was nothing in the writing of any of that contract that stipulated the importance of those items for Mr. Bloomwright to take care of.

721
00:56:50,520 --> 00:57:01,066
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as the vetting goes, I mean, if you go back, my concern was because we have the Boys and Girls Club, is there gonna be a quarry issue because that building shares the space with children?

722
00:57:01,286 --> 00:57:03,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a commitment that,

723
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:08,592
[SPEAKER_00]: There is absolutely no way that children would be able to interact with the people that are going in and out of that building.

724
00:57:08,632 --> 00:57:12,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it a little bit discerning, but again, there's a commitment there.

725
00:57:12,536 --> 00:57:14,018
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, if you look...

726
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:31,285
[SPEAKER_00]: really quick, sorry, if you look in the past of Mr. Bloomingwright, there is some issues and concerns in his background, especially one being that he's been brought up in a few issues, one being that serving underage minors, and that's a big concern of mine.

727
00:57:31,645 --> 00:57:35,807
[SPEAKER_00]: And I question, I would question, you know, that's a huge concern, so.

728
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Ms.

729
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:42,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Muccini-Burke, you can respond, and certainly you may take some additional time if you feel that you need to.

730
00:57:42,872 --> 00:57:45,053
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be an issue for most of us.

731
00:57:45,714 --> 00:57:52,758
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that will happen, the Board of Health plays an active role in giving out the victualist license.

732
00:57:53,219 --> 00:58:01,244
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually, through a home rule petition, it's actually the licensing commission of the city of Medford that will be handling both the liquor license as well as the common victualist.

733
00:58:01,264 --> 00:58:04,526
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, the Board of Health plays a major role in supporting that effort.

734
00:58:05,206 --> 00:58:14,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't open up until you've qualified through all the different serve safes and all those other programs that are mandated by the state to do business.

735
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:17,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will obviously be complying with that facet.

736
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:19,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I also just wanted to add one thing.

737
00:58:19,669 --> 00:58:28,791
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a counselor, I made a promise to the art community that when we get Medford Square off the ground, there would be a space for them to have their home.

738
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:31,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as we all know, they had a little spot in the mall

739
00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:39,837
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while that really worked out well, but they lost that when the mall turned into the plaza, the Wegmans that it will be on Sunday.

740
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:51,985
[SPEAKER_02]: But I promised them that when I was a counselor, and I hold my promises seriously, and that will be taking place when we do the revitalization and we do the mixed use in Medford Square.

741
00:58:52,085 --> 00:58:55,187
[SPEAKER_02]: They will have a home, and I guarantee them today on this.

742
00:58:56,048 --> 00:59:00,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I just wanted to add a little bit about the economic engine.

743
00:59:02,545 --> 00:59:05,866
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just listed as one of the top 10 cities in the country.

744
00:59:06,486 --> 00:59:08,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And that wasn't by accident.

745
00:59:08,247 --> 00:59:12,848
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually wrote up the Mystic River Celebration, which Cachet is responsible for.

746
00:59:13,188 --> 00:59:18,450
[SPEAKER_02]: That played a huge role in us getting that ranking because we have so many great events that are going on.

747
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:25,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if you visited the farmer's market over the summer, you got to see some of those events with musicians playing, artwork displaying.

748
00:59:26,372 --> 00:59:28,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Our restaurants partner with the artists.

749
00:59:28,572 --> 00:59:30,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They display artwork as well.

750
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:44,987
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a very rich community here, and I don't want anyone to walk out of here tonight and think that we don't, because it is a great community, we have fabulous businesses, they embrace the artists and we're collaboratively with them, so I just want everyone to realize that.

751
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:47,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

752
00:59:48,684 --> 00:59:55,928
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting near the end of our time, but we do have a couple of more questions that we probably have time to get in.

753
00:59:56,628 --> 01:00:01,850
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'd like to ask, do you believe Medford should be a sanctuary city?

754
01:00:02,471 --> 01:00:08,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And as part of that, perhaps you might tell us what the term sanctuary city means to you.

755
01:00:08,793 --> 01:00:10,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will begin with Ms.

756
01:00:10,394 --> 01:00:11,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Macheny-Berg.

757
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:11,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

758
01:00:12,846 --> 01:00:23,653
[SPEAKER_02]: We put forth a resolution that the city council signed on to, the school committee signed on to, and our human rights commission signed on to, making us a welcoming city.

759
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:26,375
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very proud of that moment.

760
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:31,959
[SPEAKER_02]: It also goes into the discussions that are being held throughout the community.

761
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:36,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second piece of that was the Safe Community Act, which is a state

762
01:00:37,102 --> 01:00:44,550
[SPEAKER_02]: the state legislature, I think over 50 state legislatures, Senate and House, have signed on to the Safe Communities Act that they're trying to push for the state.

763
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's important for it to be an umbrella.

764
01:00:47,532 --> 01:00:53,058
[SPEAKER_02]: People can't go from one community where they're safe to another community where they're in harm's way.

765
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:58,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that's a really important act and that's what would end up making sense.

766
01:00:58,824 --> 01:00:59,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you read it,

767
01:01:00,385 --> 01:01:02,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Sanctuary City really isn't defined anywhere.

768
01:01:03,447 --> 01:01:04,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a philosophy.

769
01:01:04,989 --> 01:01:07,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how you treat people that you come across.

770
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:18,259
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we've had issues, I met with the chief and his echelon of officers to speak to him about what happens now so that we could understand.

771
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,721
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pull someone over, what happens?

772
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:24,604
[SPEAKER_02]: If you arrest someone for shoplifting, what happens?

773
01:01:25,364 --> 01:01:30,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, if someone is arrested and brought to the station, they're fingerprinted.

774
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:33,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And when a fingerprint happens, it's sent up to the federal government.

775
01:01:34,426 --> 01:01:41,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's someone that has a warrant, is known, something comes back and they ask the city to either hold the person or then they would go to the courts.

776
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:48,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Because generally, a bill has already happened and these people have already moved through our system by the time the federal government gets back to you.

777
01:01:49,049 --> 01:01:57,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I wanted to make sure with the chief was that if someone is volunteering information about a crime, then we're not asking them, are you a U.S.

778
01:01:57,054 --> 01:01:57,455
[SPEAKER_02]: citizen?

779
01:01:57,495 --> 01:01:58,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It really doesn't matter.

780
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:00,977
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to be volunteering information to us.

781
01:02:01,337 --> 01:02:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't put up that wall where suddenly they feel like they're going to be scooted away, an ice truck and a black limo is going to come and take them away.

782
01:02:09,883 --> 01:02:12,204
[SPEAKER_02]: but that they're safe enough to report crimes.

783
01:02:12,284 --> 01:02:21,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's the balance is having safety of individuals and also information coming forward so that we can solve crimes and know when something's happening.

784
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,650
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a tough issue.

785
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:34,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of emotion surrounding it, but we need to understand how the city operates now in order to know that we're doing what we care to do and what's important to do.

786
01:02:34,896 --> 01:02:35,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. McKillop.

787
01:02:37,273 --> 01:02:40,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually in agreement with that portion of it.

788
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:48,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not, I've never been, I was brought up to not disobey the laws, whether they were civic or criminal.

789
01:02:48,747 --> 01:02:50,229
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I've always been brought up.

790
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,671
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for the federal and the state to take care of.

791
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:56,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that this city is a kind, caring, charitable city.

792
01:02:57,355 --> 01:02:58,616
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always proven that.

793
01:02:59,036 --> 01:03:01,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Chief Sacco laid it out the best possible way.

794
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:08,523
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been defined that we will take care of the people that are in this city, but as far as the law, the law is the law.

795
01:03:09,003 --> 01:03:14,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And my job as the mayor is I really want to focus on something else that's even twice as important, and that's the opioid crisis.

796
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:19,390
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where I want to put my energy, that's where I want to put my time, that's where I want to put my focus.

797
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:21,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

798
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:21,812
[SPEAKER_01]: McCheney-Burke?

799
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine, thank you.

800
01:03:24,641 --> 01:03:26,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we will move right along.

801
01:03:29,424 --> 01:03:37,650
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you plan to provide safer transportation options such as traffic calming, bike lanes, and pedestrian crossings?

802
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:45,915
[SPEAKER_01]: To what extent will these issues be addressed by the Complete Streets Program, and what is the current status of Complete Streets?

803
01:03:46,395 --> 01:03:48,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question goes first to Mr. McKillop.

804
01:03:49,437 --> 01:03:56,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Complete Streets program, the portion that I agree with is the crossroads and getting people up and down on the sidewalks and the bike paths.

805
01:03:56,822 --> 01:04:03,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a challenging time for us because there's a lot of things that we want to get accomplished in a very small amount of space.

806
01:04:03,828 --> 01:04:06,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this area is an old area, just like Boston, just like everywhere else.

807
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:10,913
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big challenge to get these bike paths up and running, and I can appreciate

808
01:04:11,365 --> 01:04:14,367
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that they are getting done.

809
01:04:15,248 --> 01:04:20,451
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be able to do that, I think some of the rules have to change, especially for bicyclists.

810
01:04:20,532 --> 01:04:32,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the bicyclist rules have to be kind of reevaluated and a little bit more structured so we can share the road properly and make sure that they're safe and the pedestrians are safe and the cars are safe in conjunction with each other.

811
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:40,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that there may be some areas that even though we desperately want a bike path, it just may not be able to happen because the road is just too tight.

812
01:04:40,482 --> 01:04:41,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the challenge becomes.

813
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:51,645
[SPEAKER_00]: It really makes me nervous to see the shared road more than it is to see the bike path because you just don't know what's going to happen while traffic is moving and you're sharing that space.

814
01:04:51,985 --> 01:04:53,185
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real concern for me.

815
01:04:53,285 --> 01:04:57,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that we should really kind of take a look at it, take a look at the rules for the bikes,

816
01:04:57,566 --> 01:05:05,734
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at the rules for interacting with the bicycles in shared space, and really kind of put together a comprehensive package for that.

817
01:05:07,155 --> 01:05:07,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

818
01:05:07,356 --> 01:05:08,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Puccini-Burke.

819
01:05:09,057 --> 01:05:09,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

820
01:05:10,478 --> 01:05:17,785
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I think I might have mentioned a little earlier, it was one of the first initiatives that we signed on to as a city was the community compact for complete streets.

821
01:05:18,787 --> 01:05:20,528
[SPEAKER_02]: We think it's a best practice.

822
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:25,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Some communities had already started doing it, and we thought it was important for us to embrace this.

823
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:30,473
[SPEAKER_02]: When you hear people talk about complete streets, it has to be part of your DNA.

824
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:34,855
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be how you live and breathe, creating your road structures.

825
01:05:35,255 --> 01:05:36,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really important.

826
01:05:38,597 --> 01:05:41,598
[SPEAKER_02]: The question, piece of the question was how far along are we?

827
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:44,620
[SPEAKER_02]: We finished, Boston Ave has a complete bike lane.

828
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:51,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully, I've heard great things from the people that reside in this neighborhood at some of the improvements that we've done in the Hillside neighborhood.

829
01:05:51,803 --> 01:05:59,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So from Boston Ave, from High Street all the way to the Somerville line, you either have a bike route dedicated to you or sharrows where it becomes too narrow.

830
01:05:59,947 --> 01:06:01,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree, when it becomes too narrow, it's a,

831
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:07,172
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a state level issue, bikes and cars sharing roads, but it's at the state level.

832
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:15,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're doing the sharrows there, so at least there is an eye alert that bikes have as much privilege to the roads as cars do.

833
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,962
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also are looking at Winthrop Circle.

834
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:24,246
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing extensions of the curbing at Winthrop Circle so that we can make that crosswalk much safer.

835
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:31,389
[SPEAKER_02]: High Street in front of the Brooks School, we had a couple of incidents there, so we are implementing best practices there as well.

836
01:06:31,429 --> 01:06:36,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if anyone drives there right now, you'll see the work that's being, is underway as we speak.

837
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:45,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And following up, once that work is done, that whole road will be repaved because we held off on the paving contract, obviously, so that we could finish the complete streets first.

838
01:06:46,532 --> 01:06:50,434
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, one of the most vital areas is the Haines Square area.

839
01:06:50,814 --> 01:06:55,017
[SPEAKER_02]: The Spring Street to Salem is just very dangerous.

840
01:06:55,757 --> 01:07:01,720
[SPEAKER_02]: We have pictures at some of our presentations of people with their carriages trying to get to the plaza there.

841
01:07:02,221 --> 01:07:06,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're basically walking through parking lots that cars are going back and forth in.

842
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:13,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that's a critical piece and we're going to be using Chapter 90 funds in order to pay for that because it is that important.

843
01:07:14,395 --> 01:07:19,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to capture some of it, we have Chapter 90 from the state.

844
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:22,567
[SPEAKER_02]: They give us a bucket of money, about a little under a million dollars each year.

845
01:07:22,907 --> 01:07:23,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out in April.

846
01:07:24,268 --> 01:07:26,611
[SPEAKER_02]: From that, we determine the road projects that we're going to do.

847
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:33,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been on, I'm on record as saying we're addressing the main thoroughfares in the community before we spend that money on side streets.

848
01:07:33,957 --> 01:07:37,560
[SPEAKER_02]: We think it's really important to get our main roads up to snuff.

849
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:38,922
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been let go too long.

850
01:07:39,362 --> 01:07:44,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are focusing our attention on the main roads, and then we will trickle into the neighborhoods.

851
01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:47,567
[SPEAKER_02]: When water and sewer projects are happening, roads will be fixed.

852
01:07:47,808 --> 01:07:51,230
[SPEAKER_02]: But roads will be fixed with a complete street perspective, which is very important.

853
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for giving me a little extra time.

854
01:07:53,391 --> 01:07:54,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. McKillop, you may respond.

855
01:07:55,012 --> 01:07:57,694
[SPEAKER_01]: You can certainly take a little extra time if you want to.

856
01:07:57,714 --> 01:07:58,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

857
01:07:58,274 --> 01:07:58,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

858
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:04,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the Complete Streets program goes, we've talked about that already.

859
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:14,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that, let's go back to the rules and what we're doing is because we're implementing these bike paths and it's this shared bike path that really concerns me more than anything else because

860
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:26,797
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going forward with it, we're moving forward with it, but I don't believe that we've really reviewed the rules well enough to be able to make sure that no one's going to get hurt in that respect, even to the point where maybe we should be discussing space between car and bike.

861
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:32,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's rules that we have to put into place so that we make sure everybody's safe, first and foremost.

862
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:42,549
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chapter 90 program, which gives you just under a million dollars, with the amount of roads that we have in Medford, we're never going to get caught up using this program.

863
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:47,771
[SPEAKER_00]: What it basically does is that you have to spend the $800,000 and then the state will give you back the $800,000, so all it is is a turning wheel.

864
01:08:51,153 --> 01:08:57,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the amount of roads, I mean, if you do the math, we'll just never be able to take care of what's going on in the city.

865
01:08:57,356 --> 01:09:07,961
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take a preventative maintenance action plan and put it into the budget so not only are we using the Chapter 90, but we're using additional money to keep moving forward and take care of the infrastructure of this city.

866
01:09:09,182 --> 01:09:09,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

867
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:10,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacini-Burke, your response.

868
01:09:12,587 --> 01:09:16,492
[SPEAKER_02]: When you can have a bike path off the roads, that's the best thing you can do.

869
01:09:16,613 --> 01:09:22,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the clipper ship connector that we've been working on so that bikes don't have to travel along with cars.

870
01:09:22,781 --> 01:09:26,767
[SPEAKER_02]: We obviously all agree, I think everyone agrees, that that's the best thing you can do.

871
01:09:26,847 --> 01:09:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, you can't do that everywhere.

872
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:32,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you do share a road, you share the road.

873
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:36,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bikes have as much privilege to the road as the car does.

874
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:41,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think it's very important that if they're going to be sharing, that we try to make it as safe as possible for them.

875
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,584
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the roads, like Boston Ave, for example, all meet federal guidelines for transportation.

876
01:09:46,964 --> 01:09:51,968
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't just willy-nilly go out there and say, we're going to make this lane 10 feet and that lane 11.

877
01:09:52,468 --> 01:09:56,932
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all structured by what the minimum lane width is by federal standards.

878
01:09:56,952 --> 01:09:57,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So we meet them.

879
01:09:58,813 --> 01:10:10,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, I just wanted to mention in regards to the high street area for the Brooks School, they started a walk to school program several years ago and they were parents mainly started this.

880
01:10:10,861 --> 01:10:15,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were lucky enough, we have secured a million dollar grant from the State Department of Transportation.

881
01:10:16,224 --> 01:10:19,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it's going to do, it's going to take you from Alston Street down to Woburn Street.

882
01:10:19,707 --> 01:10:24,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, we're going to have complete streets from all the way from Woburn to the train tracks in West Medford.

883
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:32,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that did, now that has prompted all of our other elementary schools to get on board with this Safe Routes to School Program.

884
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:35,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the Roberts, they have Walking Wednesdays.

885
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:45,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're trying to build up their inventory of events that they do so then we can apply for the grants and we can do that for the Roberts School and continue it along to the Columbus.

886
01:10:45,186 --> 01:10:46,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what our goal is.

887
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:52,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just really proud to announce that it was really parent-driven, this million-dollar grant that we've received.

888
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:54,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Department of Transportation is leading it up.

889
01:10:54,854 --> 01:10:55,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

890
01:10:55,996 --> 01:11:00,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Complex issues don't always fit neatly into our time categories.

891
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:04,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to take another 30 seconds to respond to that Mr. McKellar.

892
01:11:04,592 --> 01:11:09,857
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, well, I'll take the 30 seconds to just go back to the fact that I'm not saying I'm against bike paths.

893
01:11:09,897 --> 01:11:25,169
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is that if we're going to have shared space and we're going to try to squeeze these bike paths in old, old roads, we need to have a comprehensive look at the rules for both bikes and for cars and for pedestrians so we can make sure that everyone is safe in these spaces.

894
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:25,790
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

895
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

896
01:11:28,632 --> 01:11:31,475
[SPEAKER_01]: We are 25% of the way through the debate.

897
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:36,679
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

898
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I have come to our final question, and that will be followed by closing statements.

899
01:11:43,183 --> 01:11:47,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So my final question, which will go first to Ms.

900
01:11:47,325 --> 01:11:48,886
[SPEAKER_01]: McCheney-Burke, is this.

901
01:11:50,387 --> 01:12:00,793
[SPEAKER_01]: At a time when incivility is on the rise nationally, what steps will you take so that residents of Medford feel connected and part of an inclusive community?

902
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:09,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think if anyone even watches this campaign cycle, we haven't, we've been above board the entire way.

903
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:14,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone that has worked on this campaign has acted that way.

904
01:12:14,033 --> 01:12:19,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really proud that we're both here today and that we have run a really clean,

905
01:12:19,888 --> 01:12:26,890
[SPEAKER_02]: respectful campaign, so thank you for that, and thank you to everyone who has participated thus far, because that's really important.

906
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:37,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear all too often people that are so frustrated with the federal level, so frustrated with what's going on, but they know at home we can make change.

907
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:38,989
[SPEAKER_02]: We can participate.

908
01:12:39,369 --> 01:12:40,110
[SPEAKER_02]: We can come to you.

909
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:45,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many community events we have and people just show up because they want to feel part of something positive?

910
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:53,433
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really, really thrilled with all of the outreach that we've done and the people that have committed to assisting us.

911
01:12:53,813 --> 01:12:58,954
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had so many committees and so many efforts because people know that we're listening.

912
01:12:59,194 --> 01:13:02,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the vow is if you participate,

913
01:13:03,115 --> 01:13:04,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not dictating.

914
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:10,341
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of it all, we will implement what you are suggesting, and we saw that clearly with the Medford Square program.

915
01:13:11,022 --> 01:13:20,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think from a civility standpoint, people need to know that your elected officials here at home respect you, and hopefully you will respect us.

916
01:13:20,871 --> 01:13:23,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows there's the midnight warriors that are behind keyboards.

917
01:13:24,193 --> 01:13:29,018
[SPEAKER_02]: They say nasty, nasty things, not only about candidates, but about their families.

918
01:13:29,078 --> 01:13:30,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's disgusting, and it's vile.

919
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:39,284
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that people out there, when they go home tonight, that they're respectful behind their computer and just know that we're respectful back to you.

920
01:13:39,304 --> 01:13:41,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's really, really important.

921
01:13:41,265 --> 01:13:44,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I could drill that in, I would say that every single day to people.

922
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:50,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think before you type because it's there, it's there forever, and you can't take it back.

923
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:53,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just really brings down democracy.

924
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:55,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. McKillop.

925
01:13:56,780 --> 01:14:04,903
[SPEAKER_00]: So for inclusivity, I've never been more excited than when I opened my own business with my brother-in-law and my father-in-law, who's since passed away.

926
01:14:04,943 --> 01:14:07,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had some exciting times there for the past 15 years.

927
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:20,847
[SPEAKER_00]: But being part of that city and including myself in every aspect of what goes on and the different entities and the different groups, the most exciting part of it was that we worked together

928
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:23,767
[SPEAKER_00]: tirelessly to grow that city.

929
01:14:24,348 --> 01:14:37,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the point where we even, even my sales team and myself, we created another group for weddings and it was a bridal group for all of the different wedding venues in Salem, a perfect example of what collaboration is.

930
01:14:38,411 --> 01:14:40,611
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really compete with each other.

931
01:14:40,651 --> 01:14:51,694
[SPEAKER_00]: It was healthy competition, but we got together and we made something really exciting because it was about bringing more business into one city as opposed to one business trying to do everything they can to maximize their business.

932
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:56,015
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an example of bringing people together and building a coalition to move things forward.

933
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:59,596
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that we have different entities in this city to do that.

934
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:05,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that I would love to be able to have the opportunity to put these groups together and do even more exciting things.

935
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:06,417
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number one.

936
01:15:06,497 --> 01:15:15,219
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree with Mayor Burke that it is time to turn the corner in politics and move forward because it is about, it's not about us, it really isn't about us, it's about everyone.

937
01:15:15,259 --> 01:15:19,020
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about you especially and what you want with this city and for this city.

938
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:23,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And these ideas that you have, you have to bring them forward.

939
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:24,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Volunteerism needs to come back.

940
01:15:25,242 --> 01:15:28,643
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to all get engaged in our own city to move this city forward.

941
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:32,984
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's time that we need to act on that more than anything else.

942
01:15:33,364 --> 01:15:38,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think the time of sitting back and complaining about all the things that are going on is over.

943
01:15:39,025 --> 01:15:40,886
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for everybody to get engaged.

944
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:49,651
[SPEAKER_00]: to move Medford forward so we can actually not only be the best city for us, but the best city in Massachusetts bar none.

945
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:50,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way I feel.

946
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:52,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

947
01:15:52,352 --> 01:15:53,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Muccini-Burke, your response.

948
01:15:54,113 --> 01:15:54,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

949
01:15:55,314 --> 01:16:00,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we have so many fabulous people in the city of Medford that stand tall,

950
01:16:01,575 --> 01:16:09,378
[SPEAKER_02]: at a phone call, we need your help to get this off the ground or to get that off the ground or to come down to the happy birthday party and cut how many slices of cake.

951
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:18,242
[SPEAKER_02]: We need people that are always, that step up and we are so very blessed to have those people in the city of Medford.

952
01:16:18,262 --> 01:16:21,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to work every single day and I love my job.

953
01:16:21,683 --> 01:16:23,064
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's really not a job.

954
01:16:23,124 --> 01:16:28,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to meet fabulous people every single day that give their hearts and souls to make this city great.

955
01:16:29,427 --> 01:16:40,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect you all so very much, and I appreciate the hard work that you do, oftentimes without a pat on the back, except, you know, hopefully I'm saying thank you, because I tend to.

956
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:44,395
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people just do it to do it, because they want to feel involved.

957
01:16:44,435 --> 01:16:45,436
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to feel connected.

958
01:16:45,816 --> 01:16:49,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are very, very blessed to have those people in our community.

959
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm proud to be a lifelong Medford resident.

960
01:16:52,102 --> 01:16:57,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud that I opened my business up in Medford Square when I had my CPA firm for 10 years in Medford Square.

961
01:16:58,068 --> 01:17:04,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of choosing to stay in Medford like you may have chosen to reside in Medford.

962
01:17:04,614 --> 01:17:07,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very proud of that, and I love this city dearly.

963
01:17:08,117 --> 01:17:13,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not a thing that I could do that would ever put harm to this community.

964
01:17:13,141 --> 01:17:14,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I so love it.

965
01:17:14,382 --> 01:17:15,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's part of us.

966
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:16,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of me.

967
01:17:16,563 --> 01:17:17,484
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of my family.

968
01:17:18,244 --> 01:17:20,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do everything for this city.

969
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:21,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. McKillop.

970
01:17:23,658 --> 01:17:25,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lisa and I raised four kids in this city.

971
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been here married for 26 years.

972
01:17:29,202 --> 01:17:31,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa graduated in 1982 from this city.

973
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:33,346
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't left this city.

974
01:17:33,386 --> 01:17:35,647
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with it, even though I'm originally from Everett.

975
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:38,149
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always say six degrees of separation from Everett.

976
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:41,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is connected to Everett from one point or another.

977
01:17:42,413 --> 01:17:48,099
[SPEAKER_00]: But although as much as I loved Everett for all the time that I was there, I truly, truly love this city as well.

978
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just looking at this as my ideas when I first started were just that, ideas.

979
01:17:53,846 --> 01:17:59,613
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more I walked around from neighborhood to neighborhood and the frustration that I was feeling and the frustration that I was hearing,

980
01:18:00,153 --> 01:18:11,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt more invigorated to keep going and to keep pushing forward to the point now where I'm actually incredibly excited about the opportunity to help move some of the great ideas that we have forward in this city.

981
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:14,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe we can do that, but we need to do it together.

982
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:19,007
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do it collectively, and we need to hear every single idea that's out there to move it forward.

983
01:18:19,287 --> 01:18:24,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the things that we need to do is we need to make sure that we include everyone, like the Community Preservation Act.

984
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:33,981
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do something and we make a decision, it should be a decision based off of the entire city, not a select group, because that's big money that everyone should be involved in when we make those decisions.

985
01:18:35,863 --> 01:18:37,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.

986
01:18:38,225 --> 01:18:39,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we looking for another round?

987
01:18:44,634 --> 01:18:51,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we take one minute each to conclude that discussion and then we'll move into closing statements.

988
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:52,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

989
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:52,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Macini-Burr.

990
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:53,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

991
01:18:53,601 --> 01:19:01,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to commend the members of the CPA, CPC, Community Preservation Committee, for all of their hard work and outreach.

992
01:19:02,729 --> 01:19:05,472
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a perfect example of how you do it right.

993
01:19:05,852 --> 01:19:17,643
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had so many public forums, they've had so many public meetings, and they really are inclusive of everyone from sending information, not just, normally we use the database of property owners.

994
01:19:18,223 --> 01:19:20,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, we don't want just property owners being at the table.

995
01:19:21,246 --> 01:19:26,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually reached out to get tenants so that we could figure out a way to have their voices heard.

996
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:37,142
[SPEAKER_02]: From an inclusion perspective, I think my office and City Hall in particular, we have made such advancement in including people and also in diversity.

997
01:19:37,202 --> 01:19:41,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really proud of the positions we've taken and the appointments that we've made.

998
01:19:41,566 --> 01:19:48,098
[SPEAKER_02]: to really look outside of traditional and try to do things in the best interest of this community.

999
01:19:48,579 --> 01:19:48,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1000
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:55,861
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at the Community Preservation Act, my biggest concern is that 70% of that is considered free money.

1001
01:19:56,461 --> 01:19:57,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we've collected just over $1,231,000.

1002
01:19:57,621 --> 01:19:57,581
$1,231,000.

1003
01:19:57,721 --> 01:20:01,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of that, we'll probably receive in November 15% of that from the state, and that's their match, which isn't a heck of a lot.

1004
01:20:01,482 --> 01:20:02,303
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $184,000 if you do the calculation.

1005
01:20:13,406 --> 01:20:16,248
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a lot of money, but that's a lot of money in general.

1006
01:20:16,268 --> 01:20:19,270
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% of that is what they are considering free money.

1007
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:24,734
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for us to do with what we want within the parameters of the Community Preservation Act.

1008
01:20:25,134 --> 01:20:34,520
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe, like I'm hoping you believe, we should all be part of that decision and everyone should be communicating that, not just a select few with a select few surveys.

1009
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it needs to be more broad than that.

1010
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,023
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's incredibly important for the community.

1011
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:40,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.

1012
01:20:40,918 --> 01:20:46,019
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, we are going to move into closing statements.

1013
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:48,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of you will have three minutes.

1014
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will begin with Mr. McKillop.

1015
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,061
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.

1016
01:21:00,321 --> 01:21:04,502
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a technical problem.

1017
01:21:04,522 --> 01:21:05,902
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a two and a one.

1018
01:21:06,943 --> 01:21:09,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So this debate involves math.

1019
01:21:11,995 --> 01:21:13,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me calculate that, that would be three.

1020
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:15,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, John, you're all set.

1021
01:21:19,482 --> 01:21:19,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1022
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:30,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, like I had said earlier, when I joined this race, I joined this race because I really wanted to help and I thought my ideas would resonate with a lot of people.

1023
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:34,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea that my ideas would resonate this much.

1024
01:21:35,584 --> 01:21:43,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, like I said before, much more invigorated, much more excited about the opportunity to come to this city in the respect of being

1025
01:21:43,692 --> 01:21:57,359
[SPEAKER_00]: your leader and taking new ideas, ideas that I've learned all the way as far down as Miami, Florida, to all the way as far up as Bangor, Maine, to as far west as Cincinnati and Cleveland, Ohio, and everywhere in between.

1026
01:21:57,859 --> 01:22:03,241
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some really great ideas out there, folks, and sometimes you can't just bottle everything up in one space.

1027
01:22:03,602 --> 01:22:06,163
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be able to broaden your horizons and expand that.

1028
01:22:06,483 --> 01:22:19,410
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many things that we can do better like the school system and taking it to a totally different level and actually putting into place actual projects that we can actually move this city forward in the respect of being in the top 50.

1029
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:23,732
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we should limit ourselves to just patting ourselves on the back to where we are right now.

1030
01:22:24,032 --> 01:22:25,393
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go forward with that.

1031
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:33,557
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to be one of those new gateway cities where everybody's moving into this city, we need to have a school system that reflects that.

1032
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:37,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to go above and beyond to try and find ways to make that happen.

1033
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:38,821
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be part of that.

1034
01:22:39,182 --> 01:22:41,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be part of the overall growth of this city.

1035
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about some opportunities that we have.

1036
01:22:44,786 --> 01:22:46,088
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got a good start.

1037
01:22:46,368 --> 01:22:48,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could do much, much better than where we are right now.

1038
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:57,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can fix the tax situation and minimize the tax increases from year to year to year to year to year to year to year that we've all been experiencing.

1039
01:22:58,338 --> 01:23:10,508
[SPEAKER_00]: and I believe that that's just by taking the budget, breaking it completely down, and restructuring it and bringing it back to life so we can actually have a more palatable budget situation where we can move that money forward and around where we need it to go.

1040
01:23:10,948 --> 01:23:13,330
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to help the police department and the fire department.

1041
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:14,771
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different areas.

1042
01:23:14,811 --> 01:23:17,453
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start thinking about the school system.

1043
01:23:17,513 --> 01:23:19,555
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we need to think about the high school right now.

1044
01:23:19,715 --> 01:23:21,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, perfect example in the high school.

1045
01:23:21,436 --> 01:23:22,417
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another example.

1046
01:23:22,778 --> 01:23:24,039
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a top up in the roof.

1047
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:25,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's seen it when you go to the gym.

1048
01:23:27,421 --> 01:23:28,842
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a yellow tarp in the roof.

1049
01:23:29,382 --> 01:23:30,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the yellow tarp.

1050
01:23:30,343 --> 01:23:32,804
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tube that goes down the wall, goes into a bucket.

1051
01:23:33,144 --> 01:23:38,948
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been there for over 10 years, at least, that I can think of because I'm trying to remember when I saw it with my kids.

1052
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:45,912
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that we need to have a proactive preventative maintenance plan in every single part of each and every department of this city.

1053
01:23:46,252 --> 01:23:47,573
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't have enough of that.

1054
01:23:48,193 --> 01:23:56,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not pass a budget without it, so we need to fight it out and we need to come together and make that happen for the future of this city so we can focus on our future.

1055
01:23:56,416 --> 01:24:00,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need your vote November 7th, which is really right around the corner.

1056
01:24:00,418 --> 01:24:01,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a couple of days.

1057
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:07,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of Dave McKillop, think of November 7th, and think of the focus of the future that we have for the city of Medford.

1058
01:24:07,341 --> 01:24:08,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1059
01:24:16,591 --> 01:24:16,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

1060
01:24:16,814 --> 01:24:17,968
