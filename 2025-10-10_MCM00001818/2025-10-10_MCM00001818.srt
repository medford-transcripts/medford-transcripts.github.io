15
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:20,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Go.

16
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:21,896

19
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:42,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Joe.

20
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:43,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthony?

21
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:51,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dear, Anthony, I think you're still on mute.

22
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:02,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see.

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:13,622
[SPEAKER_08]: How about now, can you hear me?

24
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:14,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

25
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, can hear you.

26
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I am Anthony Andrea.

27
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:20,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I live on Lawrence Road in Medford.

28
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm blind and a new member of the commission.

29
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:30,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

30
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,644
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Kate.

31
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a message.

32
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:39,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I sent it in the chat, but a friend is trying to get in via the city website and cannot.

33
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,251
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be able to.

34
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:51,606
[SPEAKER_04]: The link is posted and the link is also on the... The link is from July and does not work.

35
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:55,232
[SPEAKER_04]: That should not be the link on the city website.

36
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:58,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So the same link that you guys have is the link.

37
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:00,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be continuing with the agenda.

38
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:10,040
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want, you can forward them the link that you use to get in because it should be on the events calendar.

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,662
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they should be looking at clicking right on our events calendar.

40
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It will show it will show up because you all you're all in here.

41
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:28,088
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and now I'm gonna, I think we still have Cam left to do introductions.

42
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, thanks Frances.

43
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see everybody, Cam Nabb.

44
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a commissioner.

45
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I live up in the Heights in Medford and my day job is with Mass General Brigham.

46
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.

47
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but never least, Nicholas.

48
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:51,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everyone.

49
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:57,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you all can hear me fine.

50
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Try to hear you, Nicholas.

51
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:01,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Got it.

52
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:02,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

53
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:03,416
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

54
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:04,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

55
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you all hear me now?

56
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:07,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

57
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,442
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, perfect.

58
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:13,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, hello, and good evening, everyone.

59
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,782
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Nicholas Kaikaringa.

60
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:21,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I am the disability specialist here in the office of DEI.

61
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:35,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a pretty much lifelong Medford resident, and I am excited to be here with all of you.

62
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:37,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

63
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.

64
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:45,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all so much for all your introductions.

65
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Raffaella, good to see you again.

66
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:56,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, I see that you're on and we'll bring you on as we move through our agenda.

67
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:04,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Next on the list is for somebody to make a motion to approve.

68
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:11,108
[SPEAKER_04]: the meeting minutes of June 2025 and somebody to second that.

69
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to jump off.

70
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:19,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

71
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:22,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good to see you.

72
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:23,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Susan.

73
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Go.

74
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:29,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe, I saw you raise your hand and then I heard somebody else speak.

75
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:35,077
[SPEAKER_04]: So Joe, you're making the motion, who's seconding Joe?

76
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:36,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I can second Joe.

77
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:37,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

78
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:38,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Cam.

79
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:44,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

80
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:54,716
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is I wanted to make sure that all the commissioners had the opportunity to review the open meeting law guidelines.

81
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:59,139
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, I don't deviate from that under any circumstances.

82
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We've actually had an attorney visit us a couple of times and provided us with some

83
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:16,767
[SPEAKER_04]: great trading, and I believe that I also shared the link to the presentation that was specifically created for us.

84
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:29,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Please note that the open meeting guidelines, things of that nature, they're really not up for discussion because it does not lie within our power to make changes.

85
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,032
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't know when we're doing it wrong, that's okay.

86
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:37,653
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we do know, the expectation is that we self-correct.

87
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:52,336
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody has any questions about that or things that I should see if the attorney can come back and do the presentation again, just e-mail me if you think that that would be helpful.

88
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:57,838
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same attorney group that did the one in the link for the Mass.

89
00:06:57,878 --> 00:06:59,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Municipal Association.

90
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Then just remembering that it's weird, right?

91
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:21,568
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're all in the same place and we're all getting ice cream, we must make sure that we identify that even though we're in the commission, we're simply just here to get ice cream because it's unbearably hot outside.

92
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:33,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, there are ways that quorums get triggered without intention, but we really should not be discussing commission work outside of the commission.

93
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:43,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really, really important that that is upheld because what really what we're doing by engaging in that manner is that.

94
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:49,805
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not being transparent and we're denying the public the opportunity to really see our work.

95
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:50,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

96
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, I want to just put that out there.

97
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:58,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the work that we've done so far.

98
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:06,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to keep it that way and I would like to not be in a situation where we now have a conflict as a result.

99
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

100
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,902
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting calendar review.

101
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:24,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you all know, our November meeting always falls in like the week of Thanksgiving and the December meeting falls in, if I'm not mistaken.

102
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:30,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Yom Kippur, but it's another, you know, high Jewish holiday.

103
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:39,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So historically, we've combined our November and our December meeting and always tried to hold it

104
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:45,152
[SPEAKER_04]: within the first two weeks of December.

105
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:52,917
[SPEAKER_04]: If everybody could have some level of access to a calendar, that would be great.

106
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:00,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sure you don't want to be having your meeting on Thanksgiving Eve.

107
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:04,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're more than welcome to.

108
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:21,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Did someone say something?

109
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:22,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that you, John?

110
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I said December 10th, which is a Wednesday.

111
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:27,465
[SPEAKER_04]: December 10th, okay.

112
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:28,566
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

113
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:38,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Thanksgiving Eve 1, 2, 3, 4 would be would be a typical meeting date.

114
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:44,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that date is historically interferes with people's family plans.

115
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So where typically going.

116
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:53,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Either we usually either do the 1st, Wednesday or the 2nd, Wednesday in December.

117
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying December 10th.

118
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I just do it out there.

119
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:01,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

120
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:03,119
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

121
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody have any issues or any opposition with the December 10th proposed date?

122
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:17,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

123
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:20,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we do this?

124
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:27,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't I make a motion that we combine on November and December meetings and have them on December 10th.

125
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:29,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Anthony.

126
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthony made the motion.

127
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I second.

128
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,342
[SPEAKER_04]: John, that was you that second?

129
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:38,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

130
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:38,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

131
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:42,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

132
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:43,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

133
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:45,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Anthony.

134
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,310
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

135
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,270
[SPEAKER_04]: That's perfect.

136
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:48,291
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

137
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:51,013
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Rafael.

138
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:51,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Just real quick.

139
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:57,139
[SPEAKER_15]: The link on the events calendar for today's meeting was incorrect.

140
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,621
[SPEAKER_04]: That is something that we can add at the end.

141
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:04,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot pause the agenda to address that.

142
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:12,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how everybody else got here, but the only way that folks could get here is using the link that's posted.

143
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:16,328
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the link on the meeting minutes.

144
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:21,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something that I can address that now, it's something that I have to go back and look at.

145
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Camp training.

146
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:31,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Community Access Monitoring Training.

147
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Is anybody interested?

148
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:41,085
[SPEAKER_04]: And before you say yes, I have to let you know that it is a two-day training.

149
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:49,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It is five hours each day, so it's a little bit shorter than the original, and it's virtual.

150
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:54,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hosted by the Mass Office on Disability.

151
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:17,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicholas, myself, and Susan have gone through this, and this is what really helps you or empowers you to have the ability to speak on things like measurements of, you know, width, right, gradients, variances, and things of that nature.

152
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,833
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you do not have to

153
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:21,406
[SPEAKER_04]: do it.

154
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:26,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just sharing it with you because these opportunities do come up.

155
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:37,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you are interested, there is a session happening in October and there is also a session, if I'm not mistaken, happening in November.

156
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:43,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check out the Mass Office on Disability website yourself for more information.

157
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:52,519
[SPEAKER_04]: You can reach out to me for more information, but wanted to share that.

158
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is my piece.

159
00:12:57,582 --> 00:12:59,643
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll turn it over to you, Nicholas.

160
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,785
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, thank you, Mr. Francis.

161
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:11,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, good evening, everyone.

162
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,930
[SPEAKER_09]: It is good to see all of your faces.

163
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that we are back in session.

164
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:28,920
[SPEAKER_09]: First things first, commissioners, you should have all received emails about

165
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:39,240
[SPEAKER_09]: the new stipends get given to the commissioners.

166
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations and thank you to Ms.

167
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:48,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Francis for helping that get on board.

168
00:13:52,853 --> 00:14:10,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Next thing is my funding has been secured for the renovation of the City Hall restrooms to be ADA compliant.

169
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:14,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will be a slow process.

170
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:38,279
[SPEAKER_09]: process but every bathroom in City Hall will be redone to be made compliant with the ADA laws and we are very excited about that.

171
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:46,004
[SPEAKER_09]: In regards to

172
00:14:50,140 --> 00:15:20,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess I should say in the same vein as the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very

173
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:23,824
[SPEAKER_09]: They had some access issues at their front doors.

174
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:39,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Renovations took place over the summer to make ramps in the front, and they are done, and they are looking very good, quite frankly.

175
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:47,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I went out with one of the engineering aides,

176
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:54,863
[SPEAKER_09]: to review their work.

177
00:15:55,843 --> 00:16:00,864
[SPEAKER_09]: And all that they did is completely up to standards.

178
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:05,586
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is not a ramp going up into the schools.

179
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:15,268
[SPEAKER_09]: They are still waiting to put in the railings.

180
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:33,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, not makeshift, but there are temporary, um, there are temporary, um, wood handrails right now, but those are being cast.

181
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:41,779
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, the metal handrails for the entrance ramps will be made and then will be installed.

182
00:16:48,809 --> 00:17:11,460
[SPEAKER_09]: The rails do get in the way of the benches a little bit, if you know, the benches that are in front of the, in front of the McGlynn School, so those will be,

183
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:25,203
[SPEAKER_09]: moved, not moved off of the property, but just moved elsewhere so that they can be fully accessible and not obstructed by the handrails.

184
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:46,292
[SPEAKER_09]: They are still completing work at the back of the Mimiglin.

185
00:17:47,093 --> 00:18:05,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, uh, when that is done, uh, I, I, I will go back out with the aid and I go out and, uh, and, um, uh, re-re-re-re-re-re-review those, those, those, those, those, those, um, renovations as well.

186
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

187
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's all on that one.

188
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:18,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And also in line with the schools,

189
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:48,346
[SPEAKER_09]: last time we had mentioned the gaga pit codes um for those of you that may not remember gaga is a game with the hexagonal or octagonal pit um and uh they they made codes for the

190
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:56,250
[SPEAKER_09]: of the pit, so that people don't just go in there and break stuff.

191
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:09,999
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is an accessible gate that has a code, and so they have configured a way to have people

192
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:25,654
[SPEAKER_09]: access the code after school hours.

193
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:45,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that, the way to do so will be, will be emailing the DMR Ministry Director.

194
00:19:46,441 --> 00:20:06,129
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, those instructions will not only be posted on the gate, but they will also be on our ODEI website and on the... my subpage, if I am not mistaken.

195
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I believe that's all I have.

196
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:13,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to you, Ms.

197
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:14,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Francesca.

198
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everybody.

199
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:26,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I just did a quick double check.

200
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:31,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the instructions for the Gaga code are on the website.

201
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:39,563
[SPEAKER_04]: They do look a little bit different because it is under a subsection that says parks, but on the.

202
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:45,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Commission for persons web page, it's a little bit of a larger section.

203
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:50,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually says, and I think it includes the rules and things of that nature.

204
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:58,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So that piece has been handled to very, very critical thing at this meeting.

205
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:00,275
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to pick a date.

206
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:09,759
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to pick two dates for our disability fair, which my understanding is you want this to become annually.

207
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,021
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we need to do that is because of the location.

208
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:19,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I met with the new athletics director and space is filling quickly.

209
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:26,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So historically, we've done it in May.

210
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:35,624
[SPEAKER_04]: My suggestion is we pick two different Saturdays or two different Sundays.

211
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:40,846
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, we hope that one of them would be available.

212
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:54,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Open to hearing other suggestions and looking at a tiny little calendar for 2026.

213
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:10,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick, if I call out the dates, because I'm looking at the tiny calendar, would you be able to make sure that it's not like Mother's Day or something?

214
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:19,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've got one that doesn't tell me the special day.

215
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you say that one more time?

216
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

217
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:40,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at a very tiny calendar that just gives me numbers, so I have no way of knowing if I'm falling into like a, you know, religious observance day or something.

218
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:43,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Mother's Day is on the 10th of May this upcoming year.

219
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Mother's Day is on the 10th?

220
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:51,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we'll stay away from, thank you, so we shall stay away from Sunday, May 10th?

221
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:51,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

222
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,024
[SPEAKER_04]: What does May 9th?

223
00:22:59,164 --> 00:23:02,345
[SPEAKER_04]: What do people think about May 9th and May 16th?

224
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,067
[SPEAKER_09]: May 9th sounds good.

225
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and what about May 9th?

226
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All the other commissioners that are present?

227
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:30,646
[SPEAKER_09]: The 23rd, I know that is Memorial Day weekend.

228
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,587
[SPEAKER_04]: The Memorial Day weekend, okay.

229
00:23:32,607 --> 00:23:39,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really looking at... I'm sorry, May 9th and May 16th.

230
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:46,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything that conflicts with May 16th as well?

231
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Holiday-wise, no.

232
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:52,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

233
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:53,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.

234
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:57,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we shooting for a Sunday when we used to do it on Saturday?

235
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday.

236
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,578
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

237
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:00,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

238
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:00,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Saturday.

239
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:01,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

240
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:01,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

241
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:05,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday.

242
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:09,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

243
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:13,089
[SPEAKER_09]: We could also do the 30th.

244
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,051
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still open.

245
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:24,067
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing with the 30th, it starts getting into the summer season.

246
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's true.

247
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:34,791
[SPEAKER_08]: And you may not have as many people able to attend a lot of graduations and things.

248
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's true.

249
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:38,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe in that type of thing then.

250
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:41,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Anthony.

251
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:47,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't I couldn't remember why, but there was a reason that we sort of stayed away from the very tail end of May.

252
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:58,232
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if there are no objections, I will email a hold for May 9th or May 16th or both of both happen to be available.

253
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:05,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Same location same timeframe just so that we can, you know.

254
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:08,698
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, be on the books, um, per se.

255
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:14,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, um, if there are any objections, speak now.

256
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to, I have to check in with Susan, but I think we're good.

257
00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:23,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't think we're hitting any, um, Jewish holidays around this time period.

258
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:29,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that if we were in April, we would be, um, hitting, um, some Muslim holidays.

259
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:31,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay.

260
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:32,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

261
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,893
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's on my task.

262
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:38,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

263
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:40,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe we're talking about 2026.

264
00:25:41,035 --> 00:25:42,395
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't even finished 2025.

265
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

266
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:46,537
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Rafael.

267
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:49,218
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, this was, what was the date that was expected?

268
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:50,739
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the Jewish calendar pulled up.

269
00:25:51,779 --> 00:26:01,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was May 9th and May 16th that we were- Both of those, neither of those will intersect with any Jewish holidays.

270
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:02,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

271
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:03,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Fantastic.

272
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Fantastic.

273
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:07,021
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

274
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:22,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the next thing that was a carry over that we had for a project that was a carry over from our June meeting, Commissioner Anthony had mentioned the need to review our ordinance.

275
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:36,475
[SPEAKER_04]: just throwing that out there as part of the work in addition with the disability fair that will need to happen this year.

276
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:47,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Wanted to give space to say, are there any other project ideas that you would like to see happen this year?

277
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:51,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Project ideas that we think we could do in a year.

278
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,831
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hey, go ahead.

279
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Overhaul accessible voting.

280
00:26:58,733 --> 00:26:59,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

281
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:00,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I second that.

282
00:27:02,294 --> 00:27:02,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I third it.

283
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:15,141
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and so, you know, when we say overall accessible voting, so these are areas that we would need to think about.

284
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:16,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what does that mean?

285
00:27:16,522 --> 00:27:19,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we talking about education things of that nature?

286
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:21,885
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's great to have this on here.

287
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:32,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else have any other project that they think can be done in 1 year or that, you know, they want us to, you know, you want it on the.

288
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Agenda.

289
00:27:37,377 --> 00:27:40,898
[SPEAKER_04]: and we don't think of one now, no biggie.

290
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure one will come up.

291
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:49,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I just was wondering what other people might think about this.

292
00:27:52,020 --> 00:28:05,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Frances, I know you and I have talked about this and I don't know if other people on the commission have had any experience with this or not, but the intersection of our commission with

293
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:11,748
[SPEAKER_08]: other commissions that may be involved in similar kind of activities.

294
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:33,842
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm trying to get at is some type of more improved communication or collaboration, especially around issues of handicap parking, having accessible bus stops,

295
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:48,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Things that other commissions are involved in that we're not getting the ability to provide feedback from the disability commission's perspective.

296
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:51,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that, Anthony.

297
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very valid point.

298
00:28:54,792 --> 00:29:02,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the traffic commission issuing accessible parking spots in residential streets.

299
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:15,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that the Disability Commission is going to say yes or no, but it is important to extend that request for somebody from the Disability Commission to attend.

300
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's all part of the work of the ordinance.

301
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:27,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And in so many areas, right, whether it's, you know, you mentioned traffic, and I recall something that a constituent told me that they're very concerned about.

302
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:37,729
[SPEAKER_04]: spaces that have been taken up by additional bike lanes, which pushes them further and further out into the street.

303
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:46,834
[SPEAKER_04]: The threats that they have mentioned about different meetings that they've gone to that threaten their own parking spot.

304
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:51,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is important and that is something that Nick and I continue to push.

305
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:53,497
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you call it?

306
00:29:55,277 --> 00:30:07,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's education, but really more or less raising the awareness that the Disability Commission is here and it's a solid commission that is founded on ordinance to act and do these things.

307
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:14,226
[SPEAKER_04]: There is, you know, we have a whole outdoor dining committee.

308
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:18,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is anybody from the Disability Commission?

309
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and I find out that we have one of these things after the thing has been

310
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:29,918
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, put together, you know, so these are very, very valid points, Anthony.

311
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:37,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there is a tremendous amount of intersection that goes on and I think that it's going to be continuous.

312
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:46,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Continuous education, continuous awareness and continuously showing people where that intersection is and how it is.

313
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:49,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Much better when things are approached in partnership.

314
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:51,983
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so.

315
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:54,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

316
00:30:54,923 --> 00:31:00,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I just added that and just something that's like kind of real time that I don't know if people are aware of.

317
00:31:00,987 --> 00:31:16,836
[SPEAKER_08]: There seems to be and I learned about this online an issue with the chirping crosswalk in Medford Square that is that has never worked properly in the 30 40 years that it's been there.

318
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:24,160
[SPEAKER_08]: You know if just a blind person like me were to try to cross the street by using that

319
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:43,902
[SPEAKER_08]: signal, you know, it's likely that we get killed because it doesn't allow you any, you know, way to really know who stopped, where they stopped, if you can walk or, you know, if you, you know, should take a plunge.

320
00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:47,764
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, people are talking about this, addressing it.

321
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:50,905
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not here.

322
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:54,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, in the commission where, you know,

323
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:59,031
[SPEAKER_08]: The affected community, right?

324
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:04,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was not even aware that there was an issue with that.

325
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there are.

326
00:32:06,113 --> 00:32:09,194
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, many issues with how the.

327
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:20,536
[SPEAKER_04]: The square is designed and the whole crossover from Riverside for me personally, just in terms of helping to support people navigate that area.

328
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:24,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But that hasn't been brought up to me.

329
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:30,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I could check in with a traffic engineer and see if that is an active.

330
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:37,912
[SPEAKER_04]: situation and find out where that is and get a report and report back to the commission.

331
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:42,115
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not something that has come through us directly.

332
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:58,547
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a perfect example of what you're saying, real life things are going on that require some solutions and solutions from a commission that is designed to help create those solutions.

333
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:07,620
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I will leave it at that for now.

334
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:19,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 607, but as I said, please do feel free to reach out if you think of a project that you will want to work that we should be adding.

335
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:30,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget we, you won't see anything on here about the grants that we applied for because we don't have any.

336
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:36,888
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have an update beyond the fact that they're saying that awardees will be notified in November.

337
00:33:37,368 --> 00:33:42,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're still where we were back in June during our last meeting.

338
00:33:43,173 --> 00:33:44,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I remain hopeful that.

339
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:58,568
[SPEAKER_04]: That the city will be awarded this it is, it is essential for the, in order for the city to move up if it needs to be an accessible city.

340
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:00,050
[SPEAKER_04]: It is essential.

341
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,755
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot do this work without a real transition plan.

342
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:06,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Not 1 that was written.

343
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:13,913
[SPEAKER_04]: that one cannot act on, but you must have a real genuine transition plan.

344
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:22,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, and that also includes the website because we must be compliant by April of next year.

345
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Commissioner Kate.

346
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:33,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing we could do this year is to talk to the library about accessibility and to do a formal

347
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:47,207
[SPEAKER_05]: survey of it because it's brand new, but anyone who has used it knows that there is accessibility issues there.

348
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:57,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And that the staff is not always, when you're one person, I give up.

349
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.

350
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:06,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's a great idea.

351
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:10,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know what I was looking for this document.

352
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me if I am not mistaken, I think that the library.

353
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:25,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to double check and see if the library was included in the list of city owned properties for the self evaluation plan.

354
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:29,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason that I have to double check is because I can't remember if.

355
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:35,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It was excluded because the library was new, but I think that that's a great idea.

356
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:35,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

357
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:38,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is, you know, that could be done in so many ways, right?

358
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:40,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be next.

359
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,222
[SPEAKER_05]: like the physical building is very accessible in the bathrooms.

360
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:45,963
[SPEAKER_05]: The bathrooms is amazing.

361
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:49,546
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, the mystic maker space is not accessible.

362
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:55,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And they say, Oh, well, we can we can we can bring in a table for you.

363
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,352
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want to be special.

364
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't understand that.

365
00:36:01,114 --> 00:36:07,118
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't understand that I don't want to have to ask for I just want to be and

366
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:12,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I give it up.

367
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:13,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I give it up.

368
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:22,125
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I think that that's a great suggestion.

369
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:31,430
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually think that that is something that, you know, that's from the real educational lens, right?

370
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,371
[SPEAKER_04]: What does accessibility mean?

371
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And something that you just said, Kate, right?

372
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:38,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna be special, I just wanna be.

373
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:40,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanna be.

374
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:44,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, I will definitely,

375
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:50,926
[SPEAKER_04]: do whatever you guys need Nick and I to do to bring that together.

376
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:56,476
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think that that is in form of a discussion group

377
00:36:57,317 --> 00:37:14,801
[SPEAKER_04]: if they have a staff meeting or if they have a professional development day, if you think that that is in form of a more formal, great presentations to discuss what accessibility means, you know, let's share and let's build on that.

378
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:26,824
[SPEAKER_05]: But that said, with the caveat that I am an adult and I do not have a kid, and the kid's face is a huge part of the library, so we probably need also people who have kids involved.

379
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,125
[SPEAKER_05]: The little kind of kids.

380
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:29,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

381
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:32,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the big kind of kids like me.

382
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:36,851
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not like Susan's kids are like old, you know, like.

383
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:37,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

384
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:42,195
[SPEAKER_04]: But you mean like, you know, children, toddlers and yeah.

385
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:42,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

386
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:43,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

387
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:44,396
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

388
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,498
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to field trip over there together, a few of us.

389
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:47,819
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't need everybody.

390
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:49,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hear you.

391
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:57,912
[SPEAKER_04]: John, I thought it was me, but you seem somewhat muted, but not on mute.

392
00:37:59,173 --> 00:37:59,433
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

393
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:03,475
[SPEAKER_04]: How about now?

394
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:07,697
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit better, but it doesn't sound like usual, John.

395
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:09,878
[SPEAKER_12]: My voice carries.

396
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:12,239
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

397
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,900
[SPEAKER_12]: What I said was maybe we could do a field trip together.

398
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,722
[SPEAKER_12]: A few of us go over and roll through the library.

399
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:26,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually wicked cool if you haven't seen it yet.

400
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:34,601
[SPEAKER_05]: The children's room, I bring adults into there because it's so wicked beautiful.

401
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:45,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, I don't know if there are commissioners that are interested in doing the field trip to the library.

402
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:48,426
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are, just make sure it's not all of you.

403
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:57,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe John, if you're interested in doing a field trip, you can arrange with Nick and you can both go down together.

404
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:00,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, it's entirely up to you.

405
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,501
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be great if he was there.

406
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:03,603
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if you could point out the issue.

407
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:05,685
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry say that again.

408
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:07,607
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be great if Kate was there also.

409
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:09,048
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what's going on with my phone.

410
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, if Kate is available, I mean, I think that that is great.

411
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:21,374
[SPEAKER_04]: You would be looking at this from, you know, many different lenses, right?

412
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:29,138
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be, you know, you'd be looking at it as an accessibility issue on a very, very broad lens.

413
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:34,320
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, what is, what Kate, Commissioner Kate said, right?

414
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be treated as special.

415
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:38,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to be.

416
00:39:38,562 --> 00:39:39,543
[SPEAKER_04]: That's essential.

417
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:43,108
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's essential.

418
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:49,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in my mind, I'm saying, well, why isn't the table there all the time for when they have a special event?

419
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:51,073
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't, you know, I don't even know.

420
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:59,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, like I said, in my mind, right, I'm saying this, you know, why isn't it just there?

421
00:39:59,277 --> 00:39:59,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

422
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:12,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say that I, you know, the library has been, is one of the most receptive sides.

423
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:21,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are now my primary users or acquisitionists of like ASL interpreters.

424
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:24,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always getting like something from them.

425
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you please get us ASL interpreters for this, for that, the other?

426
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:32,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will take that to say that I believe they are open and learning.

427
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:36,075
[SPEAKER_04]: On the great point, Kate.

428
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:39,936
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Nick, you want to introduce our guests?

429
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:45,938
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

430
00:40:46,498 --> 00:41:01,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we have Amanda Central with us tonight from the Community Development Board.

431
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,536
[SPEAKER_09]: She is an awesome person.

432
00:41:05,617 --> 00:41:08,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I love working with her.

433
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am excited to see her on this meeting.

434
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:22,650
[SPEAKER_09]: She is going to be talking to us about the open parks and spaces.

435
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:32,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't tell them all of your details.

436
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:33,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let you do that by yourself.

437
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:34,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to our meeting.

438
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:35,830
[SPEAKER_09]: We are glad to have you.

439
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, you're on.

440
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:51,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicholas, thank you so much.

441
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:52,184
[SPEAKER_07]: You are also awesome.

442
00:41:52,624 --> 00:41:54,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everyone.

443
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:55,446
[SPEAKER_07]: My name's Amanda.

444
00:41:55,706 --> 00:42:02,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I use she, her pronouns, and I work in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability in the city.

445
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Can everybody hear me OK?

446
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:05,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

447
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:06,672
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, cool.

448
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:07,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting thumbs up.

449
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:12,736
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to, if it's OK, I'm going to share my screen.

450
00:42:13,136 --> 00:42:16,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have a couple of accompanying slides, but I'll also just be talking through.

451
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:21,172
[SPEAKER_07]: a few things about our open space and recreation plan.

452
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to give the share screen a try.

453
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:26,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

454
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I see the co-host permission.

455
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:30,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Share.

456
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,681
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

457
00:42:33,982 --> 00:42:35,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Do people see my screen?

458
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:38,905
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I'm getting a thumbs up.

459
00:42:38,965 --> 00:42:40,867
[SPEAKER_04]: We see something quite jazzy.

460
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:44,289
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your screen.

461
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:47,412
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have to forgive all of my tabs.

462
00:42:49,477 --> 00:42:50,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I collect a lot of them.

463
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:54,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you just see the... We see your desktop.

464
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

465
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Then let me... I'm using the wrong... Sorry about that.

466
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:01,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me try once more.

467
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:04,524
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

468
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:10,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I see why you guys were laughing all of my desktop items.

469
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:16,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so just a little bit of a summary.

470
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:21,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So the city has this document called an open space and recreation plan.

471
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to call it an OSRP to save time.

472
00:43:25,357 --> 00:43:26,557
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone the mouthful.

473
00:43:26,697 --> 00:43:29,978
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you need a refresher on that, just let me know at any point.

474
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,039
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a guiding document.

475
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:40,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a big book that explains the city's vision for its parks and open spaces.

476
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:43,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And this document was developed in 2018.

477
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:54,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there was a big team of people on it and it was informed by, um, a lot of public outreach, uh, and varied public outreach.

478
00:43:54,857 --> 00:44:07,266
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, the meat of the document is, um, that it's a vision that was, uh, kind of curated or made, um, after talking to lots of community members.

479
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:13,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it also takes into account sort of like it inventories the city's open spaces and

480
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,634
[SPEAKER_07]: looks at some data around like stormwater and heat.

481
00:44:17,415 --> 00:44:23,600
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some like resiliency and environmental measures that are kind of incorporated in the document as well.

482
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:30,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have this document, it's current through 2026, and city staff and other kind of

483
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:41,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Local stewards of open space and city refer to this document to guide decisions for improvements and changes.

484
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:49,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for me, I'm an open space planner in the planning department, and it's my my bread and butter.

485
00:44:51,454 --> 00:45:06,369
[SPEAKER_07]: We have if in case anybody's curious, there's I'll send this to Francis and Nicholas to just disseminate to you guys afterwards, but there's a link to the existing plan that is available on the city website for folks to peruse.

486
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:16,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So the existing plan has six main goals, and then it kind of breaks it up into more specific objectives and actions.

487
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just quickly go through those goals.

488
00:45:21,025 --> 00:45:36,333
[SPEAKER_07]: So to serve the active recreation needs of all residents throughout Medford by expanding its open space resources and upgrading the conditions of existing facilities, to establish connections to and along the city's natural resources,

489
00:45:37,926 --> 00:45:57,137
[SPEAKER_07]: expand or diversify recreational programming for the city within the existing open space resources, improve the ecological quality of the city, develop a system for park facility management, and strengthen Medford's climate change resilience through park and open space design and preservation.

490
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:04,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So the reason I'm approaching y'all today is because, as I mentioned, the current plan is current through 2026.

491
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:10,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have an opportunity to extend this plan by three years.

492
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:19,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the reason we're extending it as opposed to doing a more robust overhaul of the plan is really, unfortunately, comes down to funding.

493
00:46:20,763 --> 00:46:22,684
[SPEAKER_07]: and availability of funding.

494
00:46:22,724 --> 00:46:33,368
[SPEAKER_07]: We did apply to a grant earlier this year, but it was very competitive, and the federal and state funding climate is pretty different than it has been in previous years.

495
00:46:35,016 --> 00:46:43,058
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of there are like two or three other grant opportunities that I would normally refer to to fund this work and they have been closed this year.

496
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:54,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as an alternative the state is making this other option available, where you can submit an extension and to inform that extension staff from our office have been.

497
00:46:55,918 --> 00:46:56,738
[SPEAKER_07]: we've been doing a lot of outreach.

498
00:46:56,758 --> 00:47:00,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Reaching out to commissions to, um and doing tabling events.

499
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,160
[SPEAKER_07]: We developed a public survey.

500
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for everyone who participated in that.

501
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:05,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Um.

502
00:47:06,581 --> 00:47:14,404
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, just basically having conversations with folks to understand what some of our priorities ought to be over the next three years.

503
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:16,485
[SPEAKER_07]: So

504
00:47:24,163 --> 00:47:27,405
[SPEAKER_07]: they felt were kind of the top priority parks for changes.

505
00:47:27,926 --> 00:47:33,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Condon Shell, Barrie Park, Playstead Park, Brooks Estate, and Tufts Park were our top five.

506
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

507
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:40,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like the graphic on here for those that are looking at the presentation is a little bit blurry.

508
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:47,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you need me to, if you have any questions about that, let me know.

509
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:52,762
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll, again, I'll follow up this meeting with materials to send to you all.

510
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:04,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, our next slide, uh, we asked, uh, participants about what kinds of activities, um, they liked to do at parks and open spaces in the city.

511
00:48:05,324 --> 00:48:16,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, our top five activities that, um, we heard from folks were like walking and using paths, hiking, biking, social gathering space and picnicking.

512
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:20,470
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are a bunch of other responses too.

513
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:24,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lastly, um,

514
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:37,436
[SPEAKER_07]: We asked about, well, we've asked a bunch of things, but as far as graphs, lastly, we have what types of amenities did participants in the survey use at our parks and open spaces?

515
00:48:38,097 --> 00:48:52,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And our top five amenities were shared use paths, natural scenery and landscaping, playgrounds, seating, and splash pads, or water features in playgrounds.

516
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,461
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a bunch of different responses.

517
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:21,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So in addition to the survey, we had many, many conversations and met with, we did some different tabling events and joined a couple of different play groups through the Medford Family Network and collected all this and kind of sorted the feedback into categories that were, they like emerged as we were kind of sorting through them.

518
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:24,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And the broad ones were just about amenities,

519
00:49:24,785 --> 00:49:31,870
[SPEAKER_07]: safety, recreational opportunities, climate resiliency, accessibility, and then public art as well.

520
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:49,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't go over all of this too, too much, but I just wanted to give a little snapshot about kind of things that came out of the feedback, common themes around, you know, an interest in bathrooms,

521
00:49:49,693 --> 00:49:59,499
[SPEAKER_07]: water fountains, parking, access to nature and landscaping, seating, and passive use of spaces, as well as lighting.

522
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:08,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And from those kind of broader objectives, we're trying to kind of extract more specific actions.

523
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:15,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So can we incorporate more public water filling stations at parks and open spaces?

524
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we be planting more native trees?

525
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,671
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, should we be making clear where parking is?

526
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:36,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Establishing new parking can be tricky and along, you know, can take more time, but we should also be, you know, as in our like medium term and long term planning, thinking about that as well.

527
00:50:39,132 --> 00:50:45,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so we've got a bunch of these for each, uh, uh, broad category.

528
00:50:45,195 --> 00:50:51,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So safety and, um, recreational opportunities, climate resiliency and accessibility.

529
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:55,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I, I want to be respectful of everybody's time.

530
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:03,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, maybe the best way to do that is to focus on, um, the feedback that we did receive

531
00:51:03,453 --> 00:51:14,316
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically around accessibility, which as you all know better than I is, you know, it is a nexus to or connects to many different things.

532
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:28,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, things that are accessible are also oftentimes climate resilient, you know, having shade and making sure that there is seating in shaded areas.

533
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:31,882
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of intersection in these other categories.

534
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't want to

535
00:51:33,464 --> 00:51:38,849
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of frame this as like, okay, this is, you know, a separate piece, it's all connected.

536
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:56,845
[SPEAKER_07]: But in pulling out some of the feedback that we asked, and this was kind of in response to questions about like, what barriers did people experience that, like prevented them from being able to enjoy or use space at the parks?

537
00:51:57,245 --> 00:51:59,147
[SPEAKER_07]: These are some of the things that we heard.

538
00:52:00,879 --> 00:52:12,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll read through them and then pause a bit and just want to make sure if folks have questions or want any clarification, we can address that.

539
00:52:12,311 --> 00:52:16,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of the things we heard or that were desires.

540
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:18,685
[SPEAKER_07]: would be to.

541
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:27,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Perform accessibility audits of playgrounds, and this would allow the city to better understand the existing conditions that we're working with and what needs to be prioritized.

542
00:52:29,132 --> 00:52:38,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Provide information on city website about accessible features at city facilities and allow visitors to make informed choices ahead of time about using the

543
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:50,081
[SPEAKER_07]: establish better accessible connections to pre existing park amenities.

544
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:59,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Connect with local groups and institutions that offer diverse perspectives and expertise on accessible public spaces when making improvements.

545
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:05,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm actually going to strike this next one, but I'll read it out for accountability.

546
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:11,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So balance the use of engineered wood fiber wood chips at playgrounds with more accessible surfacing.

547
00:53:12,513 --> 00:53:15,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's come to my attention since drafting this up that

548
00:53:16,314 --> 00:53:20,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure wood chips are not considered an ADA-compliant surface at playgrounds anyway.

549
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:28,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Adopt accessibility guidelines and templates for signage at parks and open spaces.

550
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:32,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Advocate for inclusion of an accessible viewing pad at the condon shell stage.

551
00:53:33,484 --> 00:53:36,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Support the construction of the access drive to the Brooks Estate.

552
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:41,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And advocate for more paved pathways for existing trails on state-owned open space.

553
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that was kind of a lot.

554
00:53:47,328 --> 00:53:56,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to pause here and just see if folks have questions or anything they kind of want to hone in on based on what I've talked about.

555
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:58,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if we want to go back to anything, I'm happy to do that.

556
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,050
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can just ask.

557
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

558
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:10,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to extend this and keep this work going for three more years.

559
00:54:11,825 --> 00:54:17,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the goal so it's kind of this is just kind of extending the, uh, the timeframe.

560
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to achieve these goals is that right?

561
00:54:21,372 --> 00:54:23,914
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct and I'll add that, um.

562
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:32,781
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be looking for fun, like, seeking out grant opportunities to do a more robust overhaul of.

563
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:39,426
[SPEAKER_07]: The, um, of the existing plan, uh, in within that 3 years.

564
00:54:39,806 --> 00:54:40,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can.

565
00:54:41,398 --> 00:54:50,945
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it might be that we find a funding opportunity sometime next year, and we can, you know, redo this a little bit sooner than three years.

566
00:54:52,426 --> 00:55:07,456
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an effort, a stopgap effort because to kind of keep the city, you know, on track and like with, you know, set priorities and goals in the interim.

567
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:19,576
[SPEAKER_07]: while we wait for or seek out other funding to kind of do a bigger effort change to the plan.

568
00:55:19,596 --> 00:55:20,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

569
00:55:30,048 --> 00:55:34,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll add one more thing, which is that having an updated plan.

570
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:41,591
[SPEAKER_07]: So something that's current makes the city eligible for certain state grant opportunities too.

571
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:45,773
[SPEAKER_07]: So, besides it being the right thing to do, it's an important.

572
00:55:47,273 --> 00:56:00,258
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, lever for allowing the city and to, you know, pursue different funding options and other options, program options in the meantime.

573
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:15,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I wonder if folks have any reactions to some of the feedback that we received

574
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:24,065
[SPEAKER_07]: particularly around access, but anything or anything that intersects with access to.

575
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:29,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll stop talking.

576
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:41,052
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your relationship with the mystic

577
00:56:43,207 --> 00:57:11,077
[SPEAKER_05]: river watershed peoples because I did some meetings with them this spring and they're making, if they can get the money, a new path from like Boston Ave all the way up, all the way up

578
00:57:13,107 --> 00:57:15,668
[SPEAKER_05]: to the beach.

579
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:20,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes by Duggar Park.

580
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:24,612
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know who owns Duggar Park.

581
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:45,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Mystic River Watershed Association, another mouthful, they are like a regional planning agency, I guess, that does work around the Mystic River Watershed.

582
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:55,717
[SPEAKER_07]: And the city often, and specifically our office, is often talking to them about different projects.

583
00:57:56,638 --> 00:58:04,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And these projects touch Medford, but also nearby municipalities, just like the one that you're describing.

584
00:58:04,222 --> 00:58:10,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was the Mystic Lower Lakes Path.

585
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:14,387
[SPEAKER_07]: They were doing some outreach about, yeah, earlier this year,

586
00:58:16,865 --> 00:58:19,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, is it Carl?

587
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:22,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the name Carl sounds familiar.

588
00:58:22,267 --> 00:58:26,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he is a familiar figure.

589
00:58:28,248 --> 00:58:44,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so I guess to answer your question, our office will work sometimes with Myra or consult with them, especially when projects or plans are not necessarily just contained to Medford.

590
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:55,482
[SPEAKER_05]: What I am confused about is that Duggar Park is on your list.

591
00:58:57,423 --> 00:59:05,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Duggar Park is in Medford and it is partially state-owned or it is state-owned.

592
00:59:06,737 --> 00:59:08,578
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have an agreement.

593
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:15,361
[SPEAKER_07]: The city has an agreement with the state and is allowed to, within that agreement, make certain changes.

594
00:59:16,662 --> 00:59:33,150
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a little bit more cumbersome than for parks or open space that aren't on state land in the city, because there's more, for lack of a better word, there's just more red tape and oversight that needs to happen.

595
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,351
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that can be challenging.

596
00:59:37,723 --> 00:59:39,205
[SPEAKER_07]: but we can make changes.

597
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you have any oversight over the PELs?

598
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

599
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:46,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So the PELs

600
00:59:47,414 --> 00:59:49,215
[SPEAKER_07]: is more state land.

601
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:53,837
[SPEAKER_07]: But the city can advocate for certain things.

602
00:59:54,117 --> 01:00:06,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we could partner with, I was just talking to, there's a nonprofit called the Friends of the Fells that does a lot of awesome programming and work within the fells.

603
01:00:07,323 --> 01:00:10,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could, in theory, partner with them on certain things.

604
01:00:12,105 --> 01:00:14,787
[SPEAKER_07]: But we would need state permission.

605
01:00:15,867 --> 01:00:17,988
[SPEAKER_07]: at the end of the day to do most stuff.

606
01:00:19,669 --> 01:00:24,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so big, but not a single accessible trail.

607
01:00:29,756 --> 01:00:36,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think the Fells, I was chatting with somebody in DCR this week about the Fells.

608
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:44,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think one of the things on their to do list, which is not solving the problem,

609
01:00:45,563 --> 01:01:04,877
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is something, and I wonder how folks here would feel about it, is to be much better and clearer about what types of facilities are on state land and the types of what is and is not accessible.

610
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:21,010
[SPEAKER_07]: on those facilities or even like just a description of what's available so that folks before getting there can understand and make informed choices about, you know, what works for them and what does not.

611
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:30,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you so much, Amanda.

612
01:01:31,652 --> 01:01:37,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, do you have anything else that you would like to ask Amanda?

613
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:44,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And if no commissioners have any questions for Amanda, I do see one public participant.

614
01:01:44,928 --> 01:01:48,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Raffaello, do you have any questions for Amanda?

615
01:01:50,397 --> 01:01:51,638
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I do not, but thank you.

616
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:52,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

617
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:55,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much Amanda.

618
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:02,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And if commissioners do have questions and they send them to me, is it all right for myself or Nick to forward them to you?

619
01:02:04,541 --> 01:02:06,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, absolutely.

620
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And could I put 1 shameless plug in Francis?

621
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:13,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

622
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:15,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute commissioners.

623
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we charge a fee for shameless plugs?

624
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:18,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know now.

625
01:02:18,733 --> 01:02:21,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear the plug 1st.

626
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:25,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you can decide.

627
01:02:25,539 --> 01:02:33,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm working on with some staffs, a project at Riverbend Park, which is, it's called a COVID Memorial Grove.

628
01:02:35,107 --> 01:02:40,311
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a project that was kind of raised to the city by a community group called Trees Medford.

629
01:02:40,892 --> 01:02:43,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, we're in the design phase now.

630
01:02:43,914 --> 01:02:43,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And

631
01:02:46,698 --> 01:02:54,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone who is interested, we're having a public workshop on October 5, 1.30 to 3.30 PM.

632
01:02:54,243 --> 01:02:59,526
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Sunday that will be on site in Riverbend Park.

633
01:02:59,907 --> 01:03:12,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be talking about the design, planting selections and tree selections, seeding ideas, as well as with the City's Poet Laureate Max Heinig.

634
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:13,996
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be thinking.

635
01:03:14,576 --> 01:03:21,898
[SPEAKER_07]: as a group a little bit about what type of maybe poetry engraved we would like as art in the space.

636
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:25,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So just want to extend the invitation.

637
01:03:25,298 --> 01:03:32,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll follow up with Frances and Nicholas with some information about that and about the OSRP stuff.

638
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And also just want to thank everybody for your time tonight.

639
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:40,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming.

640
01:03:41,676 --> 01:03:58,187
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a flyer, that would be great because we also, I know that on Facebook, there is a Medford Disability Facebook group that may be interested as well.

641
01:03:59,508 --> 01:04:04,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry, I'm not sure what all that noise is that's happening out there.

642
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:07,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody dropped a giant pen.

643
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:11,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, thank you so much.

644
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:17,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when you say it will be outside, are there areas to sit?

645
01:04:17,303 --> 01:04:24,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to, is there like a, there's like a place to sit and stuff like that?

646
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:37,632
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be so the there's a parking lot in the rear of McLean school, and then from there, there's a paved pathway from the parking lot to the area in question.

647
01:04:38,092 --> 01:04:39,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll work on getting some seating.

648
01:04:40,933 --> 01:04:45,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's the path itself and like a lawn area.

649
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:53,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll have some boards and visuals as well as staff there to kind of help facilitate conversation.

650
01:04:56,455 --> 01:05:04,440
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a very important chat that's just come through that I think you should hear.

651
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:18,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Rafaela, who's participating, says that he's in connection with a lot of people that are still COVID-19 in the area and would like to pass the information along.

652
01:05:19,528 --> 01:05:32,393
[SPEAKER_04]: as soon as you have something it would be great because I feel like this is very meaningful to people and we should give as many people as possible the opportunity to

653
01:05:35,062 --> 01:05:36,683
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, be involved, so.

654
01:05:36,883 --> 01:05:37,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, yes.

655
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Raffaello.

656
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:45,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a flyer, and yeah, I guess I'll send it to you, Frances, to share with folks.

657
01:05:45,805 --> 01:05:46,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, send it to me.

658
01:05:46,946 --> 01:05:53,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send it to everybody on here, all the commissioners, and then also send to Raffaello as well.

659
01:05:53,828 --> 01:06:02,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, if it's a JPEG, I can drop it in the disability, the Medford Disability Facebook group.

660
01:06:04,056 --> 01:06:04,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

661
01:06:04,697 --> 01:06:05,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

662
01:06:06,481 --> 01:06:07,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us.

663
01:06:09,648 --> 01:06:10,891
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so the.

664
01:06:14,848 --> 01:06:24,377
[SPEAKER_04]: James was going to join us today, but they have a six o'clock start time for the elections committee meeting.

665
01:06:25,038 --> 01:06:26,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So James isn't here.

666
01:06:26,659 --> 01:06:32,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a brief chat with him based on information that I had received.

667
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:37,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to read this out to you.

668
01:06:40,016 --> 01:06:47,401
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from James, just want to take a minute to address some of the accessible voting machine questions.

669
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:57,068
[SPEAKER_04]: The machines we have are quite old, so they need to be continuously, continually tested every election.

670
01:06:57,869 --> 01:07:03,293
[SPEAKER_04]: The company that does the repair is quite quick in their response time.

671
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if there are any problems prior to the election day, those issues can be solved.

672
01:07:11,701 --> 01:07:23,473
[SPEAKER_04]: On election day, myself and the wardens and clerks at the precinct are the most well-versed individuals on the automark machines.

673
01:07:24,413 --> 01:07:26,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Most issues are easy to solve.

674
01:07:27,116 --> 01:07:36,967
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if there was ever a true mechanical problem on election day, we have several spare machines that can be deployed.

675
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:46,472
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest problem is most voters slash residents do not know about these machines and their purpose.

676
01:07:47,093 --> 01:07:51,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are rarely used at the polling locations.

677
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:53,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So they sit idle.

678
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The largest help the commission could

679
01:07:58,913 --> 01:08:18,079
[SPEAKER_04]: The largest help the commission could help the elections department with is during testing coming in and helping us evaluate these machines capabilities, especially individuals with disabilities that affect their vision or physical ability to hold a pen.

680
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:22,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Slash cast their vote using a writing instrument.

681
01:08:23,843 --> 01:08:38,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, if the commission is looking to advocate the secretary of the Commonwealth needs to certify new machines so that we can replace the current accessible voting machine.

682
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:50,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the commission wants to sign a letter asking the secretary to accelerate that process, that would be extremely helpful.

683
01:08:50,964 --> 01:09:03,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking to state senators and representatives about the need for new machines is also helpful, especially when it comes to funding the new machines.

684
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:13,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be happy to attend the next meeting if possible to answer any additional questions I wasn't able to address with this letter.

685
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:15,584
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

686
01:09:15,644 --> 01:09:15,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

687
01:09:18,005 --> 01:09:18,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless you.

688
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:21,007
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

689
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:28,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So does anybody have any other things?

690
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:28,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

691
01:09:29,613 --> 01:09:33,155
[SPEAKER_05]: That letter is his experience.

692
01:09:34,465 --> 01:09:39,291
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not my experience as somebody who actually uses.

693
01:09:39,311 --> 01:09:45,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yeah, he's just issuing a response that I'm sharing with you.

694
01:09:45,638 --> 01:09:46,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you.

695
01:09:47,366 --> 01:09:52,109
[SPEAKER_04]: get like everybody's experience is going to be different, right?

696
01:09:52,469 --> 01:09:55,791
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not the end zone.

697
01:09:56,151 --> 01:10:01,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this really falls into that large project that you want to do, right?

698
01:10:01,934 --> 01:10:02,954
[SPEAKER_04]: The overhaul.

699
01:10:03,435 --> 01:10:11,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's like, okay, we're kind of like all on the same page, but we've got to move from the, it's not working, it's broken.

700
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, November is literally a month and a half, a month,

701
01:10:17,082 --> 01:10:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: away.

702
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,485
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do now?

703
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:25,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Long range, yes, we want new machines, not in the state's hands.

704
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:26,870
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Secretary Galvin.

705
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:37,279
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do now to start spreading the word, to start ensuring that whatever supply of machines we have can work?

706
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:43,093
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see your project, Kate, that you mentioned as ongoing.

707
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:46,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see it as having an end of life.

708
01:10:46,315 --> 01:10:49,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this is really ongoing.

709
01:10:49,117 --> 01:10:54,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't even started to think about new technology that could be coming down the pike.

710
01:10:55,962 --> 01:11:01,706
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's just a response to, okay, do folks know about this?

711
01:11:01,766 --> 01:11:04,568
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the process of dealing with broken machines?

712
01:11:05,777 --> 01:11:07,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually didn't know.

713
01:11:07,378 --> 01:11:12,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was each town or city buys their own machines.

714
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:17,723
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't know that this was something that the Secretary of State needs to certify.

715
01:11:17,783 --> 01:11:22,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess most of Massachusetts has been waiting for quite some time.

716
01:11:26,288 --> 01:11:26,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

717
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:37,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that neurotypicals would say that he is not lying, but it feels like he is lying to me because what he is saying happens at elections does not happen.

718
01:11:38,655 --> 01:11:42,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I have had problems with those machines for years.

719
01:11:42,677 --> 01:11:45,198
[SPEAKER_05]: The clerks like.

720
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:48,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

721
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:55,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to stop talking because I don't want to be on public.

722
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:00,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Oopsie hold on.

723
01:12:00,915 --> 01:12:01,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

724
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:04,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even realize that my camera was off.

725
01:12:04,457 --> 01:12:06,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I'm so sorry commissioners.

726
01:12:06,459 --> 01:12:10,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought my camera was back on after I returned back.

727
01:12:10,942 --> 01:12:13,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Nicholas for pointing that out to me.

728
01:12:13,904 --> 01:12:14,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

729
01:12:14,765 --> 01:12:18,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I see this like this is an ongoing issue.

730
01:12:18,366 --> 01:12:22,866
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not going to be a, we're going to be a one and done.

731
01:12:23,427 --> 01:12:29,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we have a, you know, a few problems that I'm really hearing, right?

732
01:12:30,148 --> 01:12:42,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if these things, like when you tell me that they need to be used frequently, I imagine something like a wheel that if it doesn't get greased, it's going to get stuck.

733
01:12:43,885 --> 01:12:45,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think.

734
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:48,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go ahead, Anthony.

735
01:12:48,788 --> 01:12:55,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say I was able to use the accessible voting machine this year and it worked.

736
01:12:56,433 --> 01:13:11,462
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the only issue that I have that he didn't address in the letter is that last year when I went to use the machine, nobody knew where it was out to.

737
01:13:12,673 --> 01:13:14,194
[SPEAKER_08]: how how to use it.

738
01:13:14,614 --> 01:13:26,058
[SPEAKER_08]: The poll workers this year whoever was there we we took the time to you know to figure it out.

739
01:13:26,598 --> 01:13:38,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I was able to figure out how to use the machine and vote with the know the audio described you know features and it they do work.

740
01:13:39,093 --> 01:13:45,737
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I could speak for blind people, can't use the current machines.

741
01:13:46,878 --> 01:13:48,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we have new updated ones?

742
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:50,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, probably someday.

743
01:13:50,720 --> 01:14:04,549
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just wanted to add that if people know how to use them, and if there's someone at the polling place that's trained and able to assist the person.

744
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:07,251
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the only issue that I had is that

745
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:23,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I had somebody look at my, you know, my sheet before I went in the machine to make sure that it worked correctly, you know, so I didn't really have a secret ballot.

746
01:14:24,609 --> 01:14:35,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone else verified the punches just because I didn't have confidence after hearing some of the things I've heard, but it worked fine.

747
01:14:37,011 --> 01:14:51,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to add that but people at the polling places need to know how to help a disabled person who may want to use one of these machines who doesn't have the time like I did to kind of you know teach myself.

748
01:14:53,644 --> 01:14:58,948
[SPEAKER_04]: the better education for poor workers is one of the things I'm hearing.

749
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:08,155
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that I was made aware of, thank you so much, Anthony, is because I remember last year there was a group that tested the machines.

750
01:15:09,096 --> 01:15:12,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy because the machines were tested and they worked.

751
01:15:12,599 --> 01:15:18,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Then when a couple of commissioners came in on the test today,

752
01:15:19,179 --> 01:15:28,364
[SPEAKER_04]: The accessible 1 decided it wasn't going to work and we had, and it was the 1 that was on loan from the state and we had to call the state and say.

753
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:29,904
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on with this?

754
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:30,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clunked out.

755
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:36,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now my understanding that much of this stuff deals with calibration.

756
01:15:37,168 --> 01:15:40,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So I say this because I want it to be known.

757
01:15:41,331 --> 01:15:49,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so the machines are calibrated so there's a little thing and that you can barely see.

758
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:57,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And once that thing gets knocked off, which can happen, I could bump into it, somebody could carry it the wrong way.

759
01:15:57,088 --> 01:16:00,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It could occur during being transported.

760
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:07,166
[SPEAKER_04]: it can cause the machine to default and basically not function, which is insane.

761
01:16:07,186 --> 01:16:11,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So these, and it was something in the- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Frances.

762
01:16:12,111 --> 01:16:13,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You do not have to use that word.

763
01:16:13,552 --> 01:16:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Please use a different word that's a slur.

764
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:16,915
[SPEAKER_05]: How?

765
01:16:17,956 --> 01:16:19,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Use a different word that's a slur?

766
01:16:19,957 --> 01:16:20,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

767
01:16:21,138 --> 01:16:22,219
[SPEAKER_04]: For calibration?

768
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:26,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Or insane, you just used insane as a slur.

769
01:16:27,451 --> 01:16:43,819
[SPEAKER_04]: okay all right understand it is it's just it's incredibly annoying because when you take a look at what it was that was knocked off it is a very very fine almost like a hairline

770
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:53,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Thing in the back and so this, I found out this year, but I would, I would not have known that for last year.

771
01:16:53,345 --> 01:16:59,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are many of these other things that can be really, really disturbing.

772
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:02,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you ask yourself, well, how much.

773
01:17:04,072 --> 01:17:05,833
[SPEAKER_04]: How much education, right?

774
01:17:06,594 --> 01:17:10,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Does 1 provides to folks that are working the elections and.

775
01:17:13,757 --> 01:17:14,698
[SPEAKER_04]: are they going to remember?

776
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:18,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not, elections are not happening every day and all the time.

777
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:21,182
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that this is where we come in.

778
01:17:21,282 --> 01:17:29,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we have, there are many great ways to keep this going during elections and non-election time, you know.

779
01:17:29,768 --> 01:17:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: But John, I noticed that you're off mute.

780
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:32,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Go right ahead, please.

781
01:17:34,091 --> 01:17:35,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

782
01:17:36,973 --> 01:17:39,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bit better, but it's still not John-like.

783
01:17:40,175 --> 01:17:40,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

784
01:17:40,616 --> 01:17:41,776
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my,

785
01:17:42,988 --> 01:17:45,529
[SPEAKER_10]: concerns was people not knowing that the machines exist.

786
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,851
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is like our fair last year.

787
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:52,953
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we let people know that it exists?

788
01:17:53,453 --> 01:17:59,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would mean being targeting people who are disabled, which means a HIPAA violation.

789
01:18:00,697 --> 01:18:07,540
[SPEAKER_10]: But is there a way to reach out to the state people who have the contacts to let people know these machines are there?

790
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:13,246
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a problem if nobody knows the exists.

791
01:18:14,447 --> 01:18:17,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, to be honest with you, John, I don't, you know, I don't know.

792
01:18:18,088 --> 01:18:24,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, it's not a. Situation that I faced before in terms of.

793
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:35,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks not knowing that a, a function or an item that is.

794
01:18:38,985 --> 01:18:41,950
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to assist, right, is available to them.

795
01:18:42,705 --> 01:18:45,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't know.

796
01:18:45,526 --> 01:18:49,889
[SPEAKER_04]: We could always ask James, is this something that one would reach out to the state for?

797
01:18:50,289 --> 01:19:07,778
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I also think, do we just make sure that we create a little, a little info, I don't know what it's called, an info flyer or something that just informs on, what do you call it?

798
01:19:07,838 --> 01:19:11,500
[SPEAKER_04]: That just informs on, hey, did you know that, you know,

799
01:19:11,933 --> 01:19:14,014
[SPEAKER_04]: There are accessible voting machines.

800
01:19:14,954 --> 01:19:19,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that you can vote via email?

801
01:19:20,696 --> 01:19:25,338
[SPEAKER_04]: That was something else that was new for me this year.

802
01:19:25,718 --> 01:19:31,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you get a link sent to you so you can actually, you know, for folks that really don't

803
01:19:32,421 --> 01:19:40,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Unable to leave the house or who are really, really compromised for whatever reason, if they're comfortable, they can do it that way.

804
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:43,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be something like that.

805
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:43,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

806
01:19:43,724 --> 01:19:50,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we make sure that that stuff, you know, how Medford community media has programming and stuff.

807
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:53,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets run as an advert in between.

808
01:19:53,467 --> 01:19:54,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we do that?

809
01:19:54,997 --> 01:19:58,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I voted via email this year because it got, it was too hard.

810
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was hard?

811
01:20:01,002 --> 01:20:02,843
[SPEAKER_05]: It was too hard to go in.

812
01:20:03,184 --> 01:20:17,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to deal with another machine and the city clerk office was very nice and they walked me through how to register and stuff over the phone and exactly like, even like how to vote over the phone.

813
01:20:17,655 --> 01:20:19,216
[SPEAKER_05]: They were wicked helpful.

814
01:20:20,657 --> 01:20:22,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, you can vote over the phone too?

815
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:23,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Not over the phone but like,

816
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:27,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I pre-vote, what's the word?

817
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:46,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I voted in advance and I was able to call them and when I was confused about stuff, they could, obviously without them seeing my vote, which I don't know how it integrates with Dragon or anything because my Dragon is broken right now.

818
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:52,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that is, you know,

819
01:20:53,702 --> 01:20:55,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's amazing, right?

820
01:20:56,302 --> 01:21:03,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We could, I mean, I feel like there's something that can be done between now and November.

821
01:21:04,404 --> 01:21:17,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe like, do I talk to comms and say, hey, can you come up with a quick thing for us that we can put on our, well, it's not ours, but the Medford Disability Facebook page, right?

822
01:21:18,387 --> 01:21:19,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Put on the,

823
01:21:21,027 --> 01:21:35,692
[SPEAKER_04]: DEI webpage, put on the commission's webpage, and then figure out how to turn that into something that Medford Community Media can show as an advert in between their programming.

824
01:21:36,132 --> 01:21:38,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I can make flyers here for City Hall.

825
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:44,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get those flyers out to the senior center, some of our housing.

826
01:21:45,957 --> 01:21:46,917
[SPEAKER_04]: locations.

827
01:21:47,517 --> 01:21:47,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.

828
01:21:48,477 --> 01:21:49,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what are you?

829
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:53,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the election department already does it because I've used that.

830
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:56,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done that a couple of years ago.

831
01:21:56,879 --> 01:22:00,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that started right after during the pandemic.

832
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:14,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Once they started the, you know, the, you know, for early voting, that that's been something that they they push out because I, I learned about it and I didn't go looking for it.

833
01:22:14,682 --> 01:22:15,542
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that came

834
01:22:15,995 --> 01:22:16,336
[SPEAKER_08]: to me.

835
01:22:16,636 --> 01:22:20,182
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, it is a lot.

836
01:22:20,362 --> 01:22:21,384
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a lot easier.

837
01:22:21,444 --> 01:22:27,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And it allows people, you know, the same access as people that do mail voting.

838
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,177
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they vote by mail.

839
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:32,031
[SPEAKER_08]: know, especially blind folks.

840
01:22:33,072 --> 01:22:33,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

841
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:38,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so sorry, I should have added this, Kate, when you first brought this up.

842
01:22:39,396 --> 01:22:54,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remembered now last week, I attended my monthly ADA group, and Mass Office on Disability actually has updated the voting

843
01:22:55,547 --> 01:22:59,429
[SPEAKER_04]: They're voting educational, educational materials for voting.

844
01:22:59,469 --> 01:23:01,210
[SPEAKER_04]: My gosh, why could that not come out?

845
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

846
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:05,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was something that had been mentioned in our group.

847
01:23:05,051 --> 01:23:16,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could take a peek at that website, but I do feel that a simple 1 hit wonder is probably going to be the best than a lot of different materials.

848
01:23:17,636 --> 01:23:19,977
[SPEAKER_04]: What I notice, I don't know what you mean by that.

849
01:23:20,057 --> 01:23:21,118
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a 1 hit wonder?

850
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:28,351
[SPEAKER_04]: like one, like one, like one flyer, one item that contains the information.

851
01:23:28,371 --> 01:23:34,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you put some, you know, you put some of it in the visual so that it's, it's sort of, it's intuitive.

852
01:23:34,953 --> 01:23:44,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I keep hearing people are just overwhelmed with getting like five different things about the same, five different designs about the same thing, you know.

853
01:23:46,638 --> 01:24:01,312
[SPEAKER_04]: but if we can get something about how you, the traditional voting style or the initial voting style, and then the accessible voting style, and then the email link voting style, I think that that's going to be very, very helpful.

854
01:24:01,432 --> 01:24:10,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be a great start in the educational campaign, I guess, is really what we're talking about.

855
01:24:14,589 --> 01:24:27,616
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel, again, this is just the thought about reaching out at some point in time to state reps.

856
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:32,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was one of the things that were mentioned, your state reps as a commission.

857
01:24:34,259 --> 01:24:37,341
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another option as well.

858
01:24:41,223 --> 01:24:43,544
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so there's the voting.

859
01:24:45,888 --> 01:24:48,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have other and correspondence.

860
01:24:49,789 --> 01:24:52,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have anything else to share.

861
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:54,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've shared everything.

862
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:58,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick, anybody else?

863
01:24:58,451 --> 01:25:01,132
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the other and correspondence section.

864
01:25:01,152 --> 01:25:06,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe, are you speaking?

865
01:25:06,933 --> 01:25:08,434
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're speaking, you're on mute.

866
01:25:10,374 --> 01:25:11,515
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were saying something.

867
01:25:11,715 --> 01:25:12,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

868
01:25:12,235 --> 01:25:12,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

869
01:25:13,863 --> 01:25:18,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I don't see anything from anybody else and we have public participation.

870
01:25:20,286 --> 01:25:23,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Rafael, do you have anything to share with us that, um.

871
01:25:24,528 --> 01:25:27,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we make an emotion.

872
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:48,691
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually think I had sent this, Francis, to you a little while back, but I have a friend on the Somerville Commission for Persons with Disabilities who said that they were able to, a couple of years ago, reach a deal with their city so that

873
01:25:52,034 --> 01:26:07,372
[SPEAKER_15]: So that any parking violations, specifically for handicapped parking spot violations, any fines from that now go to the commission instead of going to the general whatever city fund that is.

874
01:26:08,635 --> 01:26:24,454
[SPEAKER_15]: And they said that they've been doing that for a couple of years and I was in Somerville that they the commission rate we're getting something like $10,000 a year, which goes to outreach activities, you know community resources and such.

875
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,622
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that Medford has such a thing.

876
01:26:32,344 --> 01:26:47,215
[SPEAKER_15]: And if not, the chair of the Somerville Commission, Holly Simone, offered to pass along the information of how she petitioned it, how she brought it up, what arguments they made, and what was successful there.

877
01:26:49,136 --> 01:26:51,378
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought that might be something that Medford might want to try.

878
01:26:53,498 --> 01:26:54,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Raphael.

879
01:26:54,599 --> 01:26:56,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's a great idea.

880
01:26:56,540 --> 01:27:07,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I just asked that before we move forward, allow me to 1st of all, a find out our, our, our ordinances the same rate.

881
01:27:07,246 --> 01:27:10,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this anything that's governed by ordinance or charter?

882
01:27:10,228 --> 01:27:12,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I don't know how to answer that.

883
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:15,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And then do we have anything like that?

884
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:17,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember.

885
01:27:17,993 --> 01:27:21,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this what, like, the water sewer, something or rather.

886
01:27:22,867 --> 01:27:31,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember watching a city council meeting once and somebody saying something about receiving their water bill and they get to check and elect.

887
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:44,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if they want to make an extra donation granted is different from what we're discussing, but it shows me that if we're able to do that, then the infrastructure is partially in place.

888
01:27:46,414 --> 01:27:46,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I have to.

889
01:27:47,788 --> 01:27:56,053
[SPEAKER_04]: find out from either the chief of staff or our mayor, is there a reason why we're not doing this?

890
01:27:56,373 --> 01:27:59,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I think we can move from there, but that's such a great idea.

891
01:27:59,735 --> 01:28:13,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly would prefer all the $300 tickets that I've called on behalf of people who can't park because somebody felt that it was okay to park in the graded area.

892
01:28:14,684 --> 01:28:20,091
[SPEAKER_04]: or to use the accessible parking spot because there were only going to be five minutes.

893
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:29,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I would prefer knowing that those $300 tickets have gone to the Commission on Persons with Disabilities.

894
01:28:29,862 --> 01:28:34,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, Raphael, I just wanted to be sure there was soul commission, right?

895
01:28:34,806 --> 01:28:36,808
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not a nonprofit, right?

896
01:28:37,088 --> 01:28:38,549
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the city.

897
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,831
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the person's disabilities.

898
01:28:40,871 --> 01:28:41,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

899
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:41,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

900
01:28:41,812 --> 01:28:42,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely.

901
01:28:42,532 --> 01:28:43,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

902
01:28:43,173 --> 01:28:44,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for that.

903
01:28:47,116 --> 01:28:47,396
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

904
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:48,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else?

905
01:28:48,637 --> 01:28:52,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, it's up to you commissioners, Nick and I can't do this part.

906
01:28:55,282 --> 01:28:56,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.

907
01:28:59,333 --> 01:28:59,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I second.

908
01:29:01,356 --> 01:29:02,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

909
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much and we'll see you next month.

910
01:29:07,646 --> 01:29:08,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

911
01:29:08,347 --> 01:29:09,128
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next month.

912
01:29:09,709 --> 01:29:10,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

913
01:29:11,712 --> 01:29:12,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night everybody.

914
01:29:12,574 --> 01:29:13,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for everybody.
