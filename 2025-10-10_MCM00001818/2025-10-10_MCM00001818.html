    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=319.315">It</a>  was really good to see you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=322.358">Go</a>  ahead, Susan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=323.359">Go.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=325.121">Joe,</a>  I saw you raise your hand and then I heard somebody else speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=331.773">So</a>  Joe, you're making the motion, who's seconding Joe? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=335.097">I</a>  can second Joe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=337.38">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=337.761">Thank</a>  you, Cam.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=338.522">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=346.209">The</a>  other thing is I wanted to make sure that all the commissioners had the opportunity to review the open meeting law guidelines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=354.816">As</a>  you know, I don't deviate from that under any circumstances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=360.26">We've</a>  actually had an attorney visit us a couple of times and provided us with some <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=366.564">great</a>  trading, and I believe that I also shared the link to the presentation that was specifically created for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=377.908">Please</a>  note that the open meeting guidelines, things of that nature, they're really not up for discussion because it does not lie within our power to make changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=390.111">If</a>  we don't know when we're doing it wrong, that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=393.072">But</a>  when we do know, the expectation is that we self-correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=398.873">If</a>  anybody has any questions about that or things that I should see if the attorney can come back and do the presentation again, just e-mail me if you think that that would be helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=413.156">It's</a>  the same attorney group that did the one in the link for the Mass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=417.878">Municipal</a>  Association. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=424.58">Then</a>  just remembering that it's weird, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=428.922">If</a>  we're all in the same place and we're all getting ice cream, we must make sure that we identify that even though we're in the commission, we're simply just here to get ice cream because it's unbearably hot outside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=442.328">Um,</a>  you know, there are ways that quorums get triggered without intention, but we really should not be discussing commission work outside of the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=454.656">And</a>  it's really, really important that that is upheld because what really what we're doing by engaging in that manner is that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=463.621">We're</a>  not being transparent and we're denying the public the opportunity to really see our work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=469.825">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=472.175">I</a>  just, you know, I want to just put that out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=474.716">I</a>  like the work that we've done so far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=478.037">I</a>  would like to keep it that way and I would like to not be in a situation where we now have a conflict as a result. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=487.56">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=489.422">meeting</a>  calendar review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=491.382">So</a>  as you all know, our November meeting always falls in like the week of Thanksgiving and the December meeting falls in, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=505.465">It's</a>  not Yom Kippur, but it's another, you know, high Jewish holiday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=511.166">So</a>  historically, we've combined our November and our December meeting and always tried to hold it <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=519.768">within</a>  the first two weeks of December. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=525.592">If</a>  everybody could have some level of access to a calendar, that would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=536.299">Because</a>  I'm sure you don't want to be having your meeting on Thanksgiving Eve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=543.184">I</a>  mean, you're more than welcome to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=557.449">Did</a>  someone say something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=561.796">Was</a>  that you, John? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=562.918">Yes,</a>  I said December 10th, which is a Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=565.962">December</a>  10th, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=568.206">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=571.609">Yeah,</a>  Thanksgiving Eve 1, 2, 3, 4 would be would be a typical meeting date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=578.992">And,</a>  you know, that date is historically interferes with people's family plans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=584.334">So</a>  where typically going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=588.716">Either</a>  we usually either do the 1st, Wednesday or the 2nd, Wednesday in December. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=594.598">So</a>  you're saying December 10th.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=619.884">Why</a>  don't we do this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=620.604">Why</a>  don't I make a motion that we combine on November and December meetings and have them on December 10th.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=628.895">Thank</a>  you, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=630.136">Anthony</a>  made the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=631.477">I</a>  second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=636.041">John,</a>  that was you that second? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=637.862">It</a>  is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=638.263">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=638.543">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=643.147">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=643.607">Thank</a>  you so much, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=645.269">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=646.41">That's</a>  perfect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=647.771">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=649.873">This</a>  is Rafael.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=651.234">Just</a>  real quick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=652.275">The</a>  link on the events calendar for today's meeting was incorrect.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=658.939">That</a>  is something that we can add at the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=661.721">I</a>  cannot pause the agenda to address that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=664.702">I</a>  don't know how everybody else got here, but the only way that folks could get here is using the link that's posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=672.726">That's</a>  the link on the meeting minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=677.248">It's</a>  not something that I can address that now, it's something that I have to go back and look at. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=681.85">Camp</a>  training. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=688.233">Community</a>  Access Monitoring Training. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=692.777">Is</a>  anybody interested? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=694.779">And</a>  before you say yes, I have to let you know that it is a two-day training. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=701.105">It</a>  is five hours each day, so it's a little bit shorter than the original, and it's virtual. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=710.593">It's</a>  hosted by the Mass Office on Disability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=715.26">Nicholas,</a>  myself, and Susan have gone through this, and this is what really helps you or empowers you to have the ability to speak on things like measurements of, you know, width, right, gradients, variances, and things of that nature. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=737.512">No,</a>  you do not have to <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=741.066">do</a>  it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=742.087">I'm</a>  just sharing it with you because these opportunities do come up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=747.614">But</a>  if you are interested, there is a session happening in October and there is also a session, if I'm not mistaken, happening in November. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=757.812">You</a>  can check out the Mass Office on Disability website yourself for more information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=765.036">You</a>  can reach out to me for more information, but wanted to share that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=774.74">And</a>  that is my piece. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=777.582">So</a>  I'll turn it over to you, Nicholas.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=784.623">All</a>  right, well, thank you, Mr. Francis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=790.007">Once</a>  again, good evening, everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=791.728">It</a>  is good to see all of your faces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=794.01">I'm</a>  glad that we are back in session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=799.293">First</a>  things first, commissioners, you should have all received emails about <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=812.558">the</a>  new stipends get given to the commissioners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=820.38">Congratulations</a>  and thank you to Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=822.801">Francis</a>  for helping that get on board. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=832.853">Next</a>  thing is my funding has been secured for the renovation of the City Hall restrooms to be ADA compliant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=851.678">And</a>  it will be a slow process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=861.307">process</a>  but every bathroom in City Hall will be redone to be made compliant with the ADA laws and we are very excited about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=885.024">In</a>  regards to <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=890.14">Well,</a>  I guess I should say in the same vein as the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=920.582">They</a>  had some access issues at their front doors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=926.725">Renovations</a>  took place over the summer to make ramps in the front, and they are done, and they are looking very good, quite frankly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=939.273">I</a>  went out with one of the engineering aides, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=950.222">to</a>  review their work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=955.843">And</a>  all that they did is completely up to standards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=961.305">So</a>  there is not a ramp going up into the schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=968.306">They</a>  are still waiting to put in the railings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=977.72">Um,</a>  not makeshift, but there are temporary, um, there are temporary, um, wood handrails right now, but those are being cast. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=994.353">So,</a>  um, the metal handrails for the entrance ramps will be made and then will be installed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1008.809">The</a>  rails do get in the way of the benches a little bit, if you know, the benches that are in front of the, in front of the McGlynn School, so those will be, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1033.118">moved,</a>  not moved off of the property, but just moved elsewhere so that they can be fully accessible and not obstructed by the handrails. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1060.567">They</a>  are still completing work at the back of the Mimiglin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1067.093">And</a>  so, uh, when that is done, uh, I, I, I will go back out with the aid and I go out and, uh, and, um, uh, re-re-re-re-re-re-review those, those, those, those, those, those, um, renovations as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1085.669">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1089.46">I</a>  think that's all on that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1092.421">And</a>  also in line with the schools, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1102.314">last</a>  time we had mentioned the gaga pit codes um for those of you that may not remember gaga is a game with the hexagonal or octagonal pit um and uh they they made codes for the <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1130.526">of</a>  the pit, so that people don't just go in there and break stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1137.191">But</a>  there is an accessible gate that has a code, and so they have configured a way to have people <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1160.569">access</a>  the code after school hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1166.454">And</a>  so that, the way to do so will be, will be emailing the DMR Ministry Director. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1186.441">And</a>  then, those instructions will not only be posted on the gate, but they will also be on our ODEI website and on the... my subpage, if I am not mistaken. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1206.85">So,</a>  I believe that's all I have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1212.512">Back</a>  to you, Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1213.733">Francesca.</a> </p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1223.455">Thank</a>  you everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1224.435">I</a>  just did a quick double check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1227.157">Um,</a>  the instructions for the Gaga code are on the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1231.719">They</a>  do look a little bit different because it is under a subsection that says parks, but on the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1241.345">Commission</a>  for persons web page, it's a little bit of a larger section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1245.867">It</a>  actually says, and I think it includes the rules and things of that nature. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1251.59">So</a>  that piece has been handled to very, very critical thing at this meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1258.794">We</a>  need to pick a date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1260.995">We</a>  need to pick two dates for our disability fair, which my understanding is you want this to become annually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1270.279">The</a>  reason we need to do that is because of the location. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1273.181">I</a>  met with the new athletics director and space is filling quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1280.944">So</a>  historically, we've done it in May. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1288.062">My</a>  suggestion is we pick two different Saturdays or two different Sundays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1296.345">So</a>  that way, we hope that one of them would be available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1304.907">Open</a>  to hearing other suggestions and looking at a tiny little calendar for 2026. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1321.939">Nick,</a>  if I call out the dates, because I'm looking at the tiny calendar, would you be able to make sure that it's not like Mother's Day or something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1330.366">Because</a>  I've got one that doesn't tell me the special day.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1339.973">Can</a>  you say that one more time? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1342.976">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1344.269">I'm</a>  looking at a very tiny calendar that just gives me numbers, so I have no way of knowing if I'm falling into like a, you know, religious observance day or something.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1360.573">Mother's</a>  Day is on the 10th of May this upcoming year.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1363.594">Oh,</a>  Mother's Day is on the 10th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1365.235">Okay,</a>  so we'll stay away from, thank you, so we shall stay away from Sunday, May 10th?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1371.616">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1377.843">What</a>  does May 9th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1379.164">What</a>  do people think about May 9th and May 16th?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1384.967">May</a>  9th sounds good.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1387.928">Okay,</a>  and what about May 9th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1392.09">All</a>  the other commissioners that are present?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1398.623">The</a>  23rd, I know that is Memorial Day weekend.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1410.666">The</a>  Memorial Day weekend, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1412.607">So</a>  we're really looking at... I'm sorry, May 9th and May 16th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1423.349">Is</a>  there anything that conflicts with May 16th as well?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1429.13">Holiday-wise,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1431.092">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1432.853">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1433.794">Are</a>  we shooting for a Sunday when we used to do it on Saturday?</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1437.637">Saturday.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1459.806">The</a>  thing with the 30th, it starts getting into the summer season. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1464.087">Yeah,</a>  that's true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1465.848">And</a>  you may not have as many people able to attend a lot of graduations and things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1474.891">Yeah,</a>  that's true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1476.491">I</a>  believe in that type of thing then.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1566.581">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1567.341">Now,</a>  the next thing that was a carry over that we had for a project that was a carry over from our June meeting, Commissioner Anthony had mentioned the need to review our ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1585.312">just</a>  throwing that out there as part of the work in addition with the disability fair that will need to happen this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1596.495">Wanted</a>  to give space to say, are there any other project ideas that you would like to see happen this year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1607.379">Project</a>  ideas that we think we could do in a year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1613.03">All</a>  right, hey, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1615.891">Overhaul</a>  accessible voting.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1618.733">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1619.533">I</a>  second that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1622.294">I</a>  third it.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1627.157">All</a>  right, and so, you know, when we say overall accessible voting, so these are areas that we would need to think about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1635.181">So,</a>  what does that mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1636.522">Are</a>  we talking about education things of that nature? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1639.703">But</a>  it's great to have this on here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1642.565">Anybody</a>  else have any other project that they think can be done in 1 year or that, you know, they want us to, you know, you want it on the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1653.49">Agenda.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1657.377">and</a>  we don't think of one now, no biggie. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1661.618">I'm</a>  sure one will come up.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1666.479">I</a>  just was wondering what other people might think about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1672.02">Frances,</a>  I know you and I have talked about this and I don't know if other people on the commission have had any experience with this or not, but the intersection of our commission with <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1686.244">other</a>  commissions that may be involved in similar kind of activities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1695.85">What</a>  I'm trying to get at is some type of more improved communication or collaboration, especially around issues of handicap parking, having accessible bus stops, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1715.119">Things</a>  that other commissions are involved in that we're not getting the ability to provide feedback from the disability commission's perspective.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1730.749">Thank</a>  you for that, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1732.07">It's</a>  a very valid point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1734.792">Like</a>  the traffic commission issuing accessible parking spots in residential streets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1743.977">It's</a>  not that the Disability Commission is going to say yes or no, but it is important to extend that request for somebody from the Disability Commission to attend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1755.181">I</a>  mean, it's all part of the work of the ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1757.361">And</a>  in so many areas, right, whether it's, you know, you mentioned traffic, and I recall something that a constituent told me that they're very concerned about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1768.945">spaces</a>  that have been taken up by additional bike lanes, which pushes them further and further out into the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1777.749">The</a>  threats that they have mentioned about different meetings that they've gone to that threaten their own parking spot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1787.394">So</a>  it is important and that is something that Nick and I continue to push. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1791.476">What</a>  do you call it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1795.277">I</a>  don't know if it's education, but really more or less raising the awareness that the Disability Commission is here and it's a solid commission that is founded on ordinance to act and do these things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1808.483">There</a>  is, you know, we have a whole outdoor dining committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1815.846">Where</a>  is anybody from the Disability Commission? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1818.067">And,</a>  you know, and I find out that we have one of these things after the thing has been <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1824.677">You</a>  know, put together, you know, so these are very, very valid points, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1829.938">I</a>  mean, there is a tremendous amount of intersection that goes on and I think that it's going to be continuous. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1837.84">Continuous</a>  education, continuous awareness and continuously showing people where that intersection is and how it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1846.861">Much</a>  better when things are approached in partnership. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1851.202">You</a>  know, so.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1852.023">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1854.923">I</a>  just added that and just something that's like kind of real time that I don't know if people are aware of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1860.987">There</a>  seems to be and I learned about this online an issue with the chirping crosswalk in Medford Square that is that has never worked properly in the 30 40 years that it's been there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1877.756">You</a>  know if just a blind person like me were to try to cross the street by using that <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1884.616">signal,</a>  you know, it's likely that we get killed because it doesn't allow you any, you know, way to really know who stopped, where they stopped, if you can walk or, you know, if you, you know, should take a plunge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1903.942">But,</a>  you know, people are talking about this, addressing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1909.784">But</a>  it's not here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1911.065">And,</a>  you know, in the commission where, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1916.306">The</a>  affected community, right?</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1920.493">Yeah,</a>  I was not even aware that there was an issue with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1924.24">I</a>  mean, there are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1926.113">You</a>  know, many issues with how the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1929.914">The</a>  square is designed and the whole crossover from Riverside for me personally, just in terms of helping to support people navigate that area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1941.137">But</a>  that hasn't been brought up to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1944.758">I</a>  could check in with a traffic engineer and see if that is an active. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1951.668">situation</a>  and find out where that is and get a report and report back to the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1957.932">But</a>  that's not something that has come through us directly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1964.397">But</a>  it's a perfect example of what you're saying, real life things are going on that require some solutions and solutions from a commission that is designed to help create those solutions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1983.054">All</a>  right, so I will leave it at that for now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=1987.8">It's</a>  607, but as I said, please do feel free to reach out if you think of a project that you will want to work that we should be adding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2000.774">Don't</a>  forget we, you won't see anything on here about the grants that we applied for because we don't have any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2010.362">We</a>  don't have an update beyond the fact that they're saying that awardees will be notified in November. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2017.368">So</a>  we're still where we were back in June during our last meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2023.173">I</a>  remain hopeful that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2026.756">That</a>  the city will be awarded this it is, it is essential for the, in order for the city to move up if it needs to be an accessible city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2038.588">It</a>  is essential. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2040.21">We</a>  cannot do this work without a real transition plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2044.995">Not</a>  1 that was written. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2048.429">that</a>  one cannot act on, but you must have a real genuine transition plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2054.013">So</a>  again, and that also includes the website because we must be compliant by April of next year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2063.28">Go</a>  ahead, Commissioner Kate.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2064.921">Another</a>  thing we could do this year is to talk to the library about accessibility and to do a formal <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2075.357">survey</a>  of it because it's brand new, but anyone who has used it knows that there is accessibility issues there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2087.227">And</a>  that the staff is not always, when you're one person, I give up.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2099.917">And</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2105.037">I</a>  think that that's a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2106.978">I,</a>  you know what I was looking for this document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2112.66">Let</a>  me if I am not mistaken, I think that the library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2117.222">I've</a>  got to double check and see if the library was included in the list of city owned properties for the self evaluation plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2125.789">And</a>  the reason that I have to double check is because I can't remember if. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2130.272">It</a>  was excluded because the library was new, but I think that that's a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2135.196">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2135.736">And</a>  that is, you know, that could be done in so many ways, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2139.459">It</a>  could be next.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2140.9">like</a>  the physical building is very accessible in the bathrooms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2144.663">The</a>  bathrooms is amazing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2146.024">But</a>  like, the mystic maker space is not accessible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2151.007">And</a>  they say, Oh, well, we can we can we can bring in a table for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2155.91">But</a>  I don't want to be special. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2158.872">And</a>  they don't understand that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2161.114">They</a>  don't understand that I don't want to have to ask for I just want to be and <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2171.471">I</a>  give it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2172.495">I</a>  give it up.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2176.783">All</a>  right, I think that that's a great suggestion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2183.066">And</a>  I actually think that that is something that, you know, that's from the real educational lens, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2191.59">What</a>  does accessibility mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2193.491">And</a>  something that you just said, Kate, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2196.072">I</a>  don't wanna be special, I just wanna be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2198.753">I</a>  just wanna be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2202.295">So</a>  yes, I will definitely, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2206.137">do</a>  whatever you guys need Nick and I to do to bring that together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2211.467">If</a>  you think that that is in form of a discussion group <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2217.317">if</a>  they have a staff meeting or if they have a professional development day, if you think that that is in form of a more formal, great presentations to discuss what accessibility means, you know, let's share and let's build on that.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2234.961">But</a>  that said, with the caveat that I am an adult and I do not have a kid, and the kid's face is a huge part of the library, so we probably need also people who have kids involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2248.145">The</a>  little kind of kids.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2249.766">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2251.287">Not</a>  the big kind of kids like me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2253.809">No,</a>  not like Susan's kids are like old, you know, like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2257.111">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2257.691">But</a>  you mean like, you know, children, toddlers and yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2262.215">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2263.155">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2263.936">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2264.436">We're</a>  going to field trip over there together, a few of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2266.578">We</a>  don't need everybody.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2268.988">I</a>  can't hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2270.109">John,</a>  I thought it was me, but you seem somewhat muted, but not on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2279.173">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2281.194">How</a>  about now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2283.655">It's</a>  a little bit better, but it doesn't sound like usual, John.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2289.057">My</a>  voice carries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2290.938">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2292.719">What</a>  I said was maybe we could do a field trip together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2294.96">A</a>  few of us go over and roll through the library.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2304.157">It's</a>  actually wicked cool if you haven't seen it yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2306.938">The</a>  children's room, I bring adults into there because it's so wicked beautiful.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2315.101">I</a>  would say, I don't know if there are commissioners that are interested in doing the field trip to the library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2326.206">If</a>  there are, just make sure it's not all of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2330.67">Maybe</a>  John, if you're interested in doing a field trip, you can arrange with Nick and you can both go down together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2337.417">I,</a>  you know, it's entirely up to you.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2340.58">I'll</a>  be great if he was there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2341.521">So,</a>  if you could point out the issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2344.624">I'm</a>  sorry say that again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2345.705">It</a>  would be great if Kate was there also. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2347.627">I</a>  don't know what's going on with my phone.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2352.77">Yeah,</a>  I mean, if Kate is available, I mean, I think that that is great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2356.892">You</a>  would be looking at this from, you know, many different lenses, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2362.655">You'd</a>  be, you know, you'd be looking at it as an accessibility issue on a very, very broad lens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2370.459">But,</a>  you know, what is, what Kate, Commissioner Kate said, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2374.5">I</a>  don't want to be treated as special. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2376.722">I</a>  just want to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2378.562">That's</a>  essential. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2381.387">you</a>  know, that's essential. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2383.128">Like</a>  in my mind, I'm saying, well, why isn't the table there all the time for when they have a special event? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2389.612">But</a>  I don't, you know, I don't even know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2392.734">Again,</a>  like I said, in my mind, right, I'm saying this, you know, why isn't it just there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2399.277">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2404.84">But</a>  I will say that I, you know, the library has been, is one of the most receptive sides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2414.045">And</a>  they are now my primary users or acquisitionists of like ASL interpreters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2422.029">I'm</a>  always getting like something from them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2424.83">Can</a>  you please get us ASL interpreters for this, for that, the other? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2429.192">So</a>  I will take that to say that I believe they are open and learning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2434.695">On</a>  the great point, Kate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2437.616">All</a>  right, Nick, you want to introduce our guests?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2445.498">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2446.498">Well,</a>  we have Amanda Central with us tonight from the Community Development Board. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2463.795">She</a>  is an awesome person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2465.617">I</a>  love working with her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2469.8">And</a>  I am excited to see her on this meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2475.504">She</a>  is going to be talking to us about the open parks and spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2486.743">I</a>  won't tell them all of your details. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2492.107">I'll</a>  let you do that by yourself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2493.808">Welcome</a>  to our meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2494.929">We</a>  are glad to have you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2495.85">Amanda,</a>  you're on.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2525.652">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2562.308">That's</a>  your screen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2564.329">You'll</a>  have to forgive all of my tabs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2569.477">I</a>  collect a lot of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2571.158">Do</a>  you just see the... We see your desktop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2574.82">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2575.98">Then</a>  let me... I'm using the wrong... Sorry about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2579.762">Let</a>  me try once more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2584.044">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2585.209">Now</a>  I see why you guys were laughing all of my desktop items. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2591.391">Okay,</a>  so just a little bit of a summary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2596.994">So</a>  the city has this document called an open space and recreation plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2601.976">I'm</a>  going to call it an OSRP to save time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2605.357">everyone</a>  the mouthful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2606.697">But</a>  if you need a refresher on that, just let me know at any point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2611.619">It's</a>  a guiding document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2613.079">It's</a>  like a big book that explains the city's vision for its parks and open spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2621.321">And</a>  this document was developed in 2018. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2625.61">Um,</a>  there was a big team of people on it and it was informed by, um, a lot of public outreach, uh, and varied public outreach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2634.857">So,</a>  you know, the meat of the document is, um, that it's a vision that was, uh, kind of curated or made, um, after talking to lots of community members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2647.946">Um,</a>  it also takes into account sort of like it inventories the city's open spaces and <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2653.651">looks</a>  at some data around like stormwater and heat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2657.415">So</a>  there's some like resiliency and environmental measures that are kind of incorporated in the document as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2665.582">And</a>  so we have this document, it's current through 2026, and city staff and other kind of <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2672.959">Local</a>  stewards of open space and city refer to this document to guide decisions for improvements and changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2682.746">So,</a>  for me, I'm an open space planner in the planning department, and it's my my bread and butter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2691.454">We</a>  have if in case anybody's curious, there's I'll send this to Francis and Nicholas to just disseminate to you guys afterwards, but there's a link to the existing plan that is available on the city website for folks to peruse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2707.837">So</a>  the existing plan has six main goals, and then it kind of breaks it up into more specific objectives and actions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2718.803">I'll</a>  just quickly go through those goals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2721.025">So</a>  to serve the active recreation needs of all residents throughout Medford by expanding its open space resources and upgrading the conditions of existing facilities, to establish connections to and along the city's natural resources, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2737.926">expand</a>  or diversify recreational programming for the city within the existing open space resources, improve the ecological quality of the city, develop a system for park facility management, and strengthen Medford's climate change resilience through park and open space design and preservation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2758.712">So</a>  the reason I'm approaching y'all today is because, as I mentioned, the current plan is current through 2026. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2765.017">And</a>  we have an opportunity to extend this plan by three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2771.081">Now,</a>  the reason we're extending it as opposed to doing a more robust overhaul of the plan is really, unfortunately, comes down to funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2780.763">and</a>  availability of funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2782.724">We</a>  did apply to a grant earlier this year, but it was very competitive, and the federal and state funding climate is pretty different than it has been in previous years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2795.016">A</a>  lot of there are like two or three other grant opportunities that I would normally refer to to fund this work and they have been closed this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2804.159">So,</a>  as an alternative the state is making this other option available, where you can submit an extension and to inform that extension staff from our office have been. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2815.918">we've</a>  been doing a lot of outreach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2816.758">Reaching</a>  out to commissions to, um and doing tabling events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2820.82">We</a>  developed a public survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2822.26">Thank</a>  you for everyone who participated in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2825.521">Um.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2826.581">And</a>  you know, just basically having conversations with folks to understand what some of our priorities ought to be over the next three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2836.325">So</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2844.163">they</a>  felt were kind of the top priority parks for changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2847.926">Condon</a>  Shell, Barrie Park, Playstead Park, Brooks Estate, and Tufts Park were our top five. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2854.49">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2855.21">I</a>  feel like the graphic on here for those that are looking at the presentation is a little bit blurry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2860.354">So</a>  if you need me to, if you have any questions about that, let me know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2867.779">And</a>  I'll, again, I'll follow up this meeting with materials to send to you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2875.38">Um,</a>  our next slide, uh, we asked, uh, participants about what kinds of activities, um, they liked to do at parks and open spaces in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2885.324">And</a>  again, our top five activities that, um, we heard from folks were like walking and using paths, hiking, biking, social gathering space and picnicking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2897.969">But</a>  there are a bunch of other responses too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2903.131">And</a>  then lastly, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2905.452">We</a>  asked about, well, we've asked a bunch of things, but as far as graphs, lastly, we have what types of amenities did participants in the survey use at our parks and open spaces? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2918.097">And</a>  our top five amenities were shared use paths, natural scenery and landscaping, playgrounds, seating, and splash pads, or water features in playgrounds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2935.46">We</a>  got a bunch of different responses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2937.501">So</a>  in addition to the survey, we had many, many conversations and met with, we did some different tabling events and joined a couple of different play groups through the Medford Family Network and collected all this and kind of sorted the feedback into categories that were, they like emerged as we were kind of sorting through them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2961.714">And</a>  the broad ones were just about amenities, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2964.785">safety,</a>  recreational opportunities, climate resiliency, accessibility, and then public art as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2975.172">I</a>  won't go over all of this too, too much, but I just wanted to give a little snapshot about kind of things that came out of the feedback, common themes around, you know, an interest in bathrooms, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=2989.693">water</a>  fountains, parking, access to nature and landscaping, seating, and passive use of spaces, as well as lighting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3000.24">And</a>  from those kind of broader objectives, we're trying to kind of extract more specific actions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3009.486">So</a>  can we incorporate more public water filling stations at parks and open spaces? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3015.95">Should</a>  we be planting more native trees? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3020.51">you</a>  know, should we be making clear where parking is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3024.392">Establishing</a>  new parking can be tricky and along, you know, can take more time, but we should also be, you know, as in our like medium term and long term planning, thinking about that as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3039.132">Um,</a>  so we've got a bunch of these for each, uh, uh, broad category. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3045.195">So</a>  safety and, um, recreational opportunities, climate resiliency and accessibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3051.798">Um,</a>  and I, I want to be respectful of everybody's time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3055.74">So,</a>  um, maybe the best way to do that is to focus on, um, the feedback that we did receive <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3063.453">specifically</a>  around accessibility, which as you all know better than I is, you know, it is a nexus to or connects to many different things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3075.217">So,</a>  you know, things that are accessible are also oftentimes climate resilient, you know, having shade and making sure that there is seating in shaded areas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3089.581">There's</a>  a lot of intersection in these other categories. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3091.922">So</a>  I don't want to <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3093.464">kind</a>  of frame this as like, okay, this is, you know, a separate piece, it's all connected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3100.51">But</a>  in pulling out some of the feedback that we asked, and this was kind of in response to questions about like, what barriers did people experience that, like prevented them from being able to enjoy or use space at the parks? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3117.245">These</a>  are some of the things that we heard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3120.879">I'll</a>  read through them and then pause a bit and just want to make sure if folks have questions or want any clarification, we can address that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3132.311">So</a>  some of the things we heard or that were desires. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3138.385">would</a>  be to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3138.705">Perform</a>  accessibility audits of playgrounds, and this would allow the city to better understand the existing conditions that we're working with and what needs to be prioritized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3149.132">Provide</a>  information on city website about accessible features at city facilities and allow visitors to make informed choices ahead of time about using the <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3165.999">establish</a>  better accessible connections to pre existing park amenities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3171.302">Connect</a>  with local groups and institutions that offer diverse perspectives and expertise on accessible public spaces when making improvements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3180.847">Um,</a>  I'm actually going to strike this next one, but I'll read it out for accountability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3186.09">So</a>  balance the use of engineered wood fiber wood chips at playgrounds with more accessible surfacing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3192.513">I</a>  think it's come to my attention since drafting this up that <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3196.314">I'm</a>  pretty sure wood chips are not considered an ADA-compliant surface at playgrounds anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3203.918">Adopt</a>  accessibility guidelines and templates for signage at parks and open spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3208.961">Advocate</a>  for inclusion of an accessible viewing pad at the condon shell stage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3213.484">Support</a>  the construction of the access drive to the Brooks Estate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3217.066">And</a>  advocate for more paved pathways for existing trails on state-owned open space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3223.787">So</a>  I know that was kind of a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3227.328">I'm</a>  going to pause here and just see if folks have questions or anything they kind of want to hone in on based on what I've talked about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3236.309">Or</a>  if we want to go back to anything, I'm happy to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3240.91">If</a>  I can just ask.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3242.63">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3243.931">So</a>  you're going to extend this and keep this work going for three more years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3251.825">Is</a>  the goal so it's kind of this is just kind of extending the, uh, the timeframe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3258.51">I'm</a>  trying to achieve these goals is that right?</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3261.372">That</a>  is correct and I'll add that, um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3264.815">We</a>  will be looking for fun, like, seeking out grant opportunities to do a more robust overhaul of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3273.381">The,</a>  um, of the existing plan, uh, in within that 3 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3279.806">So</a>  if we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3281.398">you</a>  know, it might be that we find a funding opportunity sometime next year, and we can, you know, redo this a little bit sooner than three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3292.426">This</a>  is an effort, a stopgap effort because to kind of keep the city, you know, on track and like with, you know, set priorities and goals in the interim. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3309.13">while</a>  we wait for or seek out other funding to kind of do a bigger effort change to the plan.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3319.596">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3330.048">I'll</a>  add one more thing, which is that having an updated plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3334.529">So</a>  something that's current makes the city eligible for certain state grant opportunities too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3341.831">So,</a>  besides it being the right thing to do, it's an important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3347.273">you</a>  know, lever for allowing the city and to, you know, pursue different funding options and other options, program options in the meantime. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3366.8">So</a>  yeah, I wonder if folks have any reactions to some of the feedback that we received <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3376.502">particularly</a>  around access, but anything or anything that intersects with access to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3384.985">Yeah,</a>  I'll stop talking.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3396.35">What</a>  is your relationship with the mystic <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3403.207">river</a>  watershed peoples because I did some meetings with them this spring and they're making, if they can get the money, a new path from like Boston Ave all the way up, all the way up <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3433.107">to</a>  the beach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3437.169">And</a>  that goes by Duggar Park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3442.571">But</a>  I don't know who owns Duggar Park.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3446.319">So</a>  the Mystic River Watershed Association, another mouthful, they are like a regional planning agency, I guess, that does work around the Mystic River Watershed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3465.692">And</a>  the city often, and specifically our office, is often talking to them about different projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3476.638">And</a>  these projects touch Medford, but also nearby municipalities, just like the one that you're describing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3484.222">I</a>  think it was the Mystic Lower Lakes Path. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3490.905">They</a>  were doing some outreach about, yeah, earlier this year, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3496.865">And</a>  I think, is it Carl? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3500.126">I</a>  don't know if the name Carl sounds familiar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3502.267">Yeah,</a>  he is a familiar figure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3508.248">Yes,</a>  so I guess to answer your question, our office will work sometimes with Myra or consult with them, especially when projects or plans are not necessarily just contained to Medford.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3530.62">What</a>  I am confused about is that Duggar Park is on your list.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3537.423">Duggar</a>  Park is in Medford and it is partially state-owned or it is state-owned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3546.737">But</a>  we have an agreement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3548.838">The</a>  city has an agreement with the state and is allowed to, within that agreement, make certain changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3556.662">It</a>  is a little bit more cumbersome than for parks or open space that aren't on state land in the city, because there's more, for lack of a better word, there's just more red tape and oversight that needs to happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3573.27">And</a>  so that can be challenging. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3577.723">but</a>  we can make changes.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3579.867">So</a>  do you have any oversight over the PELs?</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3584.414">Not</a>  really. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3586.016">So</a>  the PELs <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3587.414">is</a>  more state land. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3589.755">But</a>  the city can advocate for certain things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3594.117">Or</a>  we could partner with, I was just talking to, there's a nonprofit called the Friends of the Fells that does a lot of awesome programming and work within the fells. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3607.323">So</a>  we could, in theory, partner with them on certain things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3612.105">But</a>  we would need state permission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3615.867">at</a>  the end of the day to do most stuff.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3619.669">It's</a>  so big, but not a single accessible trail.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3629.756">Yes,</a>  I think the Fells, I was chatting with somebody in DCR this week about the Fells. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3636.78">And</a>  I think one of the things on their to do list, which is not solving the problem, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3645.563">But</a>  this is something, and I wonder how folks here would feel about it, is to be much better and clearer about what types of facilities are on state land and the types of what is and is not accessible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3666.08">on</a>  those facilities or even like just a description of what's available so that folks before getting there can understand and make informed choices about, you know, what works for them and what does not.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3688.368">Okay,</a>  thank you so much, Amanda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3691.652">Commissioners,</a>  do you have anything else that you would like to ask Amanda? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3698.12">And</a>  if no commissioners have any questions for Amanda, I do see one public participant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3704.928">Raffaello,</a>  do you have any questions for Amanda?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3710.397">No,</a>  I do not, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3712.278">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3713.339">Thank</a>  you so much Amanda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3715.92">And</a>  if commissioners do have questions and they send them to me, is it all right for myself or Nick to forward them to you?</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3724.541">So,</a>  yes, absolutely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3726.823">And</a>  could I put 1 shameless plug in Francis?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3731.647">Wait</a>  a minute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3734.049">Wait</a>  a minute commissioners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3735.59">Do</a>  we charge a fee for shameless plugs? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3737.792">Let</a>  me know now.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3738.733">Let's</a>  hear the plug 1st.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3742.276">Okay,</a>  you can decide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3745.539">So</a>  I'm working on with some staffs, a project at Riverbend Park, which is, it's called a COVID Memorial Grove. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3755.107">It's</a>  a project that was kind of raised to the city by a community group called Trees Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3760.892">And</a>  basically, we're in the design phase now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3763.914">And</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3766.698">Anyone</a>  who is interested, we're having a public workshop on October 5, 1.30 to 3.30 PM. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3774.243">It's</a>  a Sunday that will be on site in Riverbend Park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3779.907">And</a>  we'll be talking about the design, planting selections and tree selections, seeding ideas, as well as with the City's Poet Laureate Max Heinig. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3793.355">We'll</a>  be thinking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3794.576">as</a>  a group a little bit about what type of maybe poetry engraved we would like as art in the space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3802.838">So</a>  just want to extend the invitation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3805.298">I'll</a>  follow up with Frances and Nicholas with some information about that and about the OSRP stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3813.52">And</a>  also just want to thank everybody for your time tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3817.834">Thank</a>  you for coming.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3821.676">If</a>  you have a flyer, that would be great because we also, I know that on Facebook, there is a Medford Disability Facebook group that may be interested as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3839.508">I'm</a>  so sorry, I'm not sure what all that noise is that's happening out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3844.491">I</a>  think somebody dropped a giant pen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3848.591">But,</a>  you know, thank you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3851.515">Now,</a>  when you say it will be outside, are there areas to sit? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3857.303">Is</a>  it going to, is there like a, there's like a place to sit and stuff like that?</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3865.81">There</a>  will be so the there's a parking lot in the rear of McLean school, and then from there, there's a paved pathway from the parking lot to the area in question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3878.092">I'll</a>  work on getting some seating. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3880.933">And</a>  then there's the path itself and like a lawn area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3885.214">And</a>  we'll have some boards and visuals as well as staff there to kind of help facilitate conversation.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3896.455">There's</a>  a very important chat that's just come through that I think you should hear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3904.46">Rafaela,</a>  who's participating, says that he's in connection with a lot of people that are still COVID-19 in the area and would like to pass the information along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3919.528">as</a>  soon as you have something it would be great because I feel like this is very meaningful to people and we should give as many people as possible the opportunity to <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3935.062">you</a>  know, be involved, so.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3936.883">Absolutely,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3938.063">Thank</a>  you, Raffaello. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3939.603">I</a>  do have a flyer, and yeah, I guess I'll send it to you, Frances, to share with folks.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3945.805">Yep,</a>  send it to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3946.946">I'll</a>  send it to everybody on here, all the commissioners, and then also send to Raffaello as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3953.828">Hopefully,</a>  if it's a JPEG, I can drop it in the disability, the Medford Disability Facebook group.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3964.056">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3964.697">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3966.481">Thank</a>  you for joining us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3969.648">All</a>  right, so the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3974.848">James</a>  was going to join us today, but they have a six o'clock start time for the elections committee meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3985.038">So</a>  James isn't here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3986.659">I</a>  had a brief chat with him based on information that I had received. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=3994.266">So</a>  I'm just going to read this out to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4000.016">This</a>  is from James, just want to take a minute to address some of the accessible voting machine questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4008.142">The</a>  machines we have are quite old, so they need to be continuously, continually tested every election. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4017.869">The</a>  company that does the repair is quite quick in their response time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4023.953">So,</a>  if there are any problems prior to the election day, those issues can be solved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4031.701">On</a>  election day, myself and the wardens and clerks at the precinct are the most well-versed individuals on the automark machines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4044.413">Most</a>  issues are easy to solve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4047.116">However,</a>  if there was ever a true mechanical problem on election day, we have several spare machines that can be deployed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4059.666">The</a>  biggest problem is most voters slash residents do not know about these machines and their purpose. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4067.093">So</a>  they are rarely used at the polling locations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4072.198">So</a>  they sit idle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4074.26">The</a>  largest help the commission could <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4078.913">The</a>  largest help the commission could help the elections department with is during testing coming in and helping us evaluate these machines capabilities, especially individuals with disabilities that affect their vision or physical ability to hold a pen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4098.659">Slash</a>  cast their vote using a writing instrument. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4103.843">Additionally,</a>  if the commission is looking to advocate the secretary of the Commonwealth needs to certify new machines so that we can replace the current accessible voting machine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4119.715">So</a>  if the commission wants to sign a letter asking the secretary to accelerate that process, that would be extremely helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4130.964">Speaking</a>  to state senators and representatives about the need for new machines is also helpful, especially when it comes to funding the new machines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4145.117">I</a>  would be happy to attend the next meeting if possible to answer any additional questions I wasn't able to address with this letter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4155.123">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4155.644">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4158.005">Bless</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4160.447">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4164.649">So</a>  does anybody have any other things? <a

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4169.613">That</a>  letter is his experience. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4174.465">It</a>  is not my experience as somebody who actually uses.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4179.311">Actually,</a>  yeah, he's just issuing a response that I'm sharing with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4185.638">So</a>  now you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4187.366">get</a>  like everybody's experience is going to be different, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4192.469">But</a>  it's not the end zone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4196.151">Like</a>  this really falls into that large project that you want to do, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4201.934">The</a>  overhaul. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4203.435">So</a>  now it's like, okay, we're kind of like all on the same page, but we've got to move from the, it's not working, it's broken. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4212.32">Unfortunately,</a>  November is literally a month and a half, a month, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4217.082">away.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4218.423">What</a>  can we do now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4220.805">Long</a>  range, yes, we want new machines, not in the state's hands. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4225.669">That's</a>  Secretary Galvin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4227.491">What</a>  can we do now to start spreading the word, to start ensuring that whatever supply of machines we have can work? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4238.21">So</a>  I see your project, Kate, that you mentioned as ongoing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4243.273">I</a>  don't see it as having an end of life. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4246.315">I</a>  feel like this is really ongoing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4249.117">We</a>  haven't even started to think about new technology that could be coming down the pike. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4255.962">But</a>  I think it's just a response to, okay, do folks know about this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4261.766">What's</a>  the process of dealing with broken machines? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4265.777">I</a>  actually didn't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4267.378">I</a>  thought it was each town or city buys their own machines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4272.26">No,</a>  I didn't know that this was something that the Secretary of State needs to certify. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4277.783">And</a>  I guess most of Massachusetts has been waiting for quite some time.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4286.288">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4287.148">I</a>  know that neurotypicals would say that he is not lying, but it feels like he is lying to me because what he is saying happens at elections does not happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4298.655">I</a>  have had problems with those machines for years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4302.677">The</a>  clerks like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4308.34">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4313.189">I'm</a>  going to stop talking because I don't want to be on public.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4319.314">Oopsie</a>  hold on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4320.915">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4321.936">I</a>  didn't even realize that my camera was off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4324.457">I</a>  thought I'm so sorry commissioners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4326.459">I</a>  thought my camera was back on after I returned back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4330.942">So</a>  thank you, Nicholas for pointing that out to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4333.904">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4334.765">So,</a>  I see this like this is an ongoing issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4338.366">This</a>  is not going to be a, we're going to be a one and done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4343.427">I</a>  think that we have a, you know, a few problems that I'm really hearing, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4350.148">So,</a>  if these things, like when you tell me that they need to be used frequently, I imagine something like a wheel that if it doesn't get greased, it's going to get stuck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4363.885">So</a>  I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4365.666">Yeah,</a>  go ahead, Anthony.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4368.788">I</a>  just want to say I was able to use the accessible voting machine this year and it worked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4376.433">You</a>  know, the only issue that I have that he didn't address in the letter is that last year when I went to use the machine, nobody knew where it was out to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4392.673">how</a>  how to use it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4394.614">The</a>  poll workers this year whoever was there we we took the time to you know to figure it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4406.598">I</a>  was able to figure out how to use the machine and vote with the know the audio described you know features and it they do work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4419.093">You</a>  know, I could speak for blind people, can't use the current machines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4426.878">Should</a>  we have new updated ones? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4428.679">Yeah,</a>  probably someday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4430.72">But</a>  I just wanted to add that if people know how to use them, and if there's someone at the polling place that's trained and able to assist the person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4445.31">No,</a>  the only issue that I had is that <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4448.045">I</a>  had somebody look at my, you know, my sheet before I went in the machine to make sure that it worked correctly, you know, so I didn't really have a secret ballot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4464.609">Someone</a>  else verified the punches just because I didn't have confidence after hearing some of the things I've heard, but it worked fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4477.011">I</a>  just wanted to add that but people at the polling places need to know how to help a disabled person who may want to use one of these machines who doesn't have the time like I did to kind of you know teach myself.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4493.644">the</a>  better education for poor workers is one of the things I'm hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4501.01">The</a>  other thing that I was made aware of, thank you so much, Anthony, is because I remember last year there was a group that tested the machines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4509.096">It</a>  was crazy because the machines were tested and they worked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4512.599">Then</a>  when a couple of commissioners came in on the test today, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4519.179">The</a>  accessible 1 decided it wasn't going to work and we had, and it was the 1 that was on loan from the state and we had to call the state and say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4528.904">What's</a>  going on with this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4530.025">It's</a>  clunked out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4531.665">It's</a>  now my understanding that much of this stuff deals with calibration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4537.168">So</a>  I say this because I want it to be known. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4541.331">So,</a>  so the machines are calibrated so there's a little thing and that you can barely see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4550.08">And</a>  once that thing gets knocked off, which can happen, I could bump into it, somebody could carry it the wrong way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4557.088">It</a>  could occur during being transported. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4561.621">it</a>  can cause the machine to default and basically not function, which is insane. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4567.186">So</a>  these, and it was something in the- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Frances.</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4572.111">You</a>  do not have to use that word. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4573.552">Please</a>  use a different word that's a slur. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4576.614">How?</a> </p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4577.956">Use</a>  a different word that's a slur? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4579.957">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4581.138">For</a>  calibration?</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4582.239">Or</a>  insane, you just used insane as a slur.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4587.451">okay</a>  all right understand it is it's just it's incredibly annoying because when you take a look at what it was that was knocked off it is a very very fine almost like a hairline <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4604.539">Thing</a>  in the back and so this, I found out this year, but I would, I would not have known that for last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4613.345">So</a>  there are many of these other things that can be really, really disturbing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4619.849">And</a>  then you ask yourself, well, how much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4624.072">How</a>  much education, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4626.594">Does</a>  1 provides to folks that are working the elections and. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4633.757">are</a>  they going to remember? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4634.718">Because</a>  it's not, elections are not happening every day and all the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4638.921">So</a>  I think that this is where we come in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4641.282">I</a>  think that we have, there are many great ways to keep this going during elections and non-election time, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4649.768">But</a>  John, I noticed that you're off mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4651.81">Go</a>  right ahead, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4654.091">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4656.973">It's</a>  a bit better, but it's still not John-like.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001753_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4660.175">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4660.616">One</a>  of my, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4662.988">concerns</a>  was people not knowing that the machines exist. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4666.51">And</a>  this is like our fair last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4668.951">How</a>  do we let people know that it exists? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4673.453">So</a>  that would mean being targeting people who are disabled, which means a HIPAA violation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4680.697">But</a>  is there a way to reach out to the state people who have the contacts to let people know these machines are there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4691.686">There's</a>  a problem if nobody knows the exists.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4694.447">Yeah,</a>  to be honest with you, John, I don't, you know, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4698.088">It's,</a>  you know, it's not a. Situation that I faced before in terms of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4708.35">Folks</a>  not knowing that a, a function or an item that is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4718.985">supposed</a>  to assist, right, is available to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4722.705">You</a>  know, I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4725.526">We</a>  could always ask James, is this something that one would reach out to the state for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4730.289">But</a>  then I also think, do we just make sure that we create a little, a little info, I don't know what it's called, an info flyer or something that just informs on, what do you call it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4747.838">That</a>  just informs on, hey, did you know that, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4751.933">There</a>  are accessible voting machines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4754.954">Did</a>  you know that you can vote via email? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4760.696">That</a>  was something else that was new for me this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4765.718">Yeah,</a>  you get a link sent to you so you can actually, you know, for folks that really don't <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4772.421">Unable</a>  to leave the house or who are really, really compromised for whatever reason, if they're comfortable, they can do it that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4780.703">It</a>  may be something like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4783.344">Right?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4783.724">And</a>  then we make sure that that stuff, you know, how Medford community media has programming and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4790.486">It</a>  gets run as an advert in between. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4793.467">Do</a>  we do that?</p>

    <p>[Kate Ryan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4794.997">I</a>  voted via email this year because it got, it was too hard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4798.68">Oh,</a>  it was hard? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4801.002">It</a>  was too hard to go in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4803.184">I</a>  didn't want to deal with another machine and the city clerk office was very nice and they walked me through how to register and stuff over the phone and exactly like, even like how to vote over the phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4817.655">They</a>  were wicked helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4820.657">Wait,</a>  you can vote over the phone too? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4822.439">Not</a>  over the phone but like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4824.967">I</a>  pre-vote, what's the word? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4828.05">I</a>  voted in advance and I was able to call them and when I was confused about stuff, they could, obviously without them seeing my vote, which I don't know how it integrates with Dragon or anything because my Dragon is broken right now.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4846.925">I</a>  think that that is, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4853.702">I</a>  think that that's amazing, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4856.302">We</a>  could, I mean, I feel like there's something that can be done between now and November. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4864.404">And</a>  maybe like, do I talk to comms and say, hey, can you come up with a quick thing for us that we can put on our, well, it's not ours, but the Medford Disability Facebook page, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4878.387">Put</a>  on the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4881.027">DEI</a>  webpage, put on the commission's webpage, and then figure out how to turn that into something that Medford Community Media can show as an advert in between their programming. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4896.132">I</a>  can make flyers here for City Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4899.033">I</a>  can get those flyers out to the senior center, some of our housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4905.957">locations.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4907.517">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4908.477">I</a>  mean, what are you?</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4909.318">I</a>  think the election department already does it because I've used that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4914.458">I've</a>  done that a couple of years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4916.879">I</a>  think that started right after during the pandemic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4921.44">Once</a>  they started the, you know, the, you know, for early voting, that that's been something that they they push out because I, I learned about it and I didn't go looking for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4934.682">It's</a>  something that came <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4935.995">to</a>  me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4936.636">So,</a>  yeah, it is a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4940.362">It</a>  is a lot easier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4941.444">And</a>  it allows people, you know, the same access as people that do mail voting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4947.875">You</a>  know, they vote by mail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4949.59">know,</a>  especially blind folks.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4953.072">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4954.333">And</a>  I'm so sorry, I should have added this, Kate, when you first brought this up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4959.396">Just</a>  remembered now last week, I attended my monthly ADA group, and Mass Office on Disability actually has updated the voting <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4975.547">They're</a>  voting educational, educational materials for voting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4979.469">My</a>  gosh, why could that not come out? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4981.27">Right?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4981.91">So</a>  that was something that had been mentioned in our group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4985.051">So</a>  I could take a peek at that website, but I do feel that a simple 1 hit wonder is probably going to be the best than a lot of different materials. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=4997.636">What</a>  I notice, I don't know what you mean by that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5000.057">What's</a>  a 1 hit wonder? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5001.729">like</a>  one, like one, like one flyer, one item that contains the information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5008.371">And</a>  then you put some, you know, you put some of it in the visual so that it's, it's sort of, it's intuitive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5014.953">Because</a>  I keep hearing people are just overwhelmed with getting like five different things about the same, five different designs about the same thing, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5026.638">but</a>  if we can get something about how you, the traditional voting style or the initial voting style, and then the accessible voting style, and then the email link voting style, I think that that's going to be very, very helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5041.432">And</a>  that would be a great start in the educational campaign, I guess, is really what we're talking about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5054.589">How</a>  do you feel, again, this is just the thought about reaching out at some point in time to state reps. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5067.696">I</a>  think it was one of the things that were mentioned, your state reps as a commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5074.259">That's</a>  another option as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5081.223">All</a>  right, so there's the voting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5085.888">Now</a>  we have other and correspondence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5089.789">I</a>  don't have anything else to share. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5092.83">I</a>  think I've shared everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5094.11">Nick,</a>  anybody else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5098.451">We're</a>  in the other and correspondence section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5101.152">Joe,</a>  are you speaking? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5106.933">If</a>  you're speaking, you're on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5110.374">If</a>  you were saying something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5111.715">Oh,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5112.235">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5113.863">Okay,</a>  I don't see anything from anybody else and we have public participation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5120.286">Rafael,</a>  do you have anything to share with us that, um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5124.528">Yeah,</a>  we make an emotion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5129.262">I</a>  actually think I had sent this, Francis, to you a little while back, but I have a friend on the Somerville Commission for Persons with Disabilities who said that they were able to, a couple of years ago, reach a deal with their city so that <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5152.034">So</a>  that any parking violations, specifically for handicapped parking spot violations, any fines from that now go to the commission instead of going to the general whatever city fund that is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5168.635">And</a>  they said that they've been doing that for a couple of years and I was in Somerville that they the commission rate we're getting something like $10,000 a year, which goes to outreach activities, you know community resources and such. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5187.56">I</a>  don't think that Medford has such a thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5192.344">And</a>  if not, the chair of the Somerville Commission, Holly Simone, offered to pass along the information of how she petitioned it, how she brought it up, what arguments they made, and what was successful there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5209.136">And</a>  I thought that might be something that Medford might want to try.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5213.498">Thank</a>  you, Raphael. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5214.599">I</a>  think that that's a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5216.54">I</a>  just asked that before we move forward, allow me to 1st of all, a find out our, our, our ordinances the same rate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5227.246">Is</a>  this anything that's governed by ordinance or charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5230.228">Just</a>  because I don't know how to answer that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5233.25">And</a>  then do we have anything like that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5236.131">I</a>  do remember. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5237.993">Isn't</a>  this what, like, the water sewer, something or rather. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5242.867">I</a>  remember watching a city council meeting once and somebody saying something about receiving their water bill and they get to check and elect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5252.51">Like,</a>  if they want to make an extra donation granted is different from what we're discussing, but it shows me that if we're able to do that, then the infrastructure is partially in place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5266.414">Then</a>  I have to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5267.788">find</a>  out from either the chief of staff or our mayor, is there a reason why we're not doing this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5276.373">Then</a>  I think we can move from there, but that's such a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5279.735">I</a>  certainly would prefer all the $300 tickets that I've called on behalf of people who can't park because somebody felt that it was okay to park in the graded area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5294.684">or</a>  to use the accessible parking spot because there were only going to be five minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5301.713">Yeah,</a>  so I would prefer knowing that those $300 tickets have gone to the Commission on Persons with Disabilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5309.862">And,</a>  um, Raphael, I just wanted to be sure there was soul commission, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5314.806">They're</a>  not a nonprofit, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5317.088">This</a>  is the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5319.23">This</a>  is the person's disabilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5320.871">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5321.291">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5321.812">Lovely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5322.532">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5323.173">Thank</a>  you so much for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5327.116">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5327.536">Anybody</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5328.637">And</a>  if not, it's up to you commissioners, Nick and I can't do this part.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5335.282">Motion</a>  to adjourn.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5339.333">I</a>  second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5341.356">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/commission-for-persons-with-disabilities-09-24-25&start=5343.68">Thank</a>  you so much and we'll see you next month.</p>
