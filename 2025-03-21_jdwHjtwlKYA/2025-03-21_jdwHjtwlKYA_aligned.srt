2
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:14,594
Mr. Skerry, would you please call the roll?

6 present, 1 absent.

00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,739
We have a forum to connect meeting.

20
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:39,562
We're going to start with item number 1, approval of the minutes of March 7, 2016.

21
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:40,583
Move approval.

22
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,205
Move approval for Mr. Skerry, all in favor?

23
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:43,505
Second.

24
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,766
All opposed?

25
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:46,207
Motion passes.

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,591
Mr. Cuneo.

27
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:00,831
Yes.

28
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:01,451
Mr. Benedetto.

29
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:01,952
Yes.

30
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:02,052

Mr. McStone.

34
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:03,593
Yes.

35
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:04,153
Mr. Skerry.

36
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:04,314

00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:04,374

00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:04,814
Vander Kloot.

39
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:05,314
Yes.

40
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:05,955
Mayor Burke.

41
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:06,876
Yep.

42
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,978
She's right there.

43
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,300
Approval of payrolls.

44
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,681
Motion of approval.

45
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:17,604
Do we call the roll?

46
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:17,784
Yes.

47
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:19,205
Yes.

48
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:20,666
We'll call the roll.

49
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:21,167
Mr. Cuneo.

50
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:21,247
Yes.

51
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:21,727
Mr. Benedetto.

52
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:21,967
Yes.

53
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:22,027
Ms.

54
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:22,488
Kretz.

55
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:22,668
Yes.

56
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,849
Mr. McStone.

57
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:24,229
Yes.

58
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,009
Mr. Skerry.

59
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,310
Yes.

60
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:25,510
Ms.

61
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,130
Vander Kloot.

62
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,391
Yes.

63
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:36,323
I'd like to move so Mayor Burke can please note on the agenda that Mayor Burke is in attendance and I'll step aside.

64
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:37,224
Thank you very much.

65
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,646
Report of the Secretary.

66
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:01,387
There's none.

67
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:02,267
None.

68
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:04,748
Report of the Committee.

69
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:07,069
Committee of the Whole report, March 9, 2016.

70
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,169
Mr. Superintendent.

71
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:15,711
We can either waive the reading or the Secretary can read it or someone else can read it.

72
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:16,612
Waive the reading.

73
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:19,613
Mr. Superintendent, the notes were included in the file.

74
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,173
I believe all the members have read them.

75
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,694
If there's any questions, we'll let them take them.

76
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:24,634
Motion to waive the reading.

77
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:24,974
Second.

78
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:26,655
It's been moved, seconded.

79
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:27,815
All those in favor?

80
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:27,935
Aye.

81
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,761
approval of the minutes of March 9, Committee of the Whole.

82
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,141
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

83
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,622
Aye.

84
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:36,622
All those opposed?

85
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:38,002
Motion carries.

86
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,745
Community participation.

87
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:49,426
Hearing and seeing none.

88
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:53,287
Reports of the superintendent.

89
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:55,808
Report on EOS Healthy Start Award.

90
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:56,708
Mr. Superintendent.

91
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:59,789
Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we'll call in our assistant superintendent.

92
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,897
Dwayne Caldwell to deliver this report.

93
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:04,580
Good evening.

94
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,721
Good evening.

95
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:13,809
We are very proud that the Columbus Elementary School is the recipient of the 5-year College of Health and Humanity award.

96
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:21,437
This award is going to be used in our mission to develop a quality foundation that is great in the psychological quality of our children.

97
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:31,226
is mass school-based leaders who contributed to the educational success by addressing their nutritional needs.

98
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:40,393
So more than 80% of the children at the Columbus Elementary School participated in a breakfast program.

99
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:47,178
So these successful breakfast programs require the investment and the collaboration of a group of people.

100
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,759
It is the secretary,

101
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:55,672
the administrators, the teachers, the school cafeteria workers, and the school nurse.

102
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:59,013
So it was a team effort done by everybody.

103
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:07,557
The following members of the Columbus Elementary team will be going to an award ceremony on May 5th at the Statehouse.

104
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:10,699
And the people that will be attending

105
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:22,461
are Nancy Sherman Hudson, the assistant principal, Rory Douglas, who is head of the cafeteria at the Columbus Elementary School, and Karen Roberto, who is the Columbus School nurse.

106
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:32,003
Medford State representatives Paul Donato, Christine Barber, and Sean Garberlee, and State Senator Patricia Jalen will also be in attendance.

107
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,964
So we're very proud of the Columbus Elementary School.

108
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:40,005
This is an unrestricted $500 that they get to spend as they wish.

109
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:42,523
have to take any questions.

110
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:43,364
Ms.

111
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:43,905
Cuno?

112
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,047
No, I'm all set.

113
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:49,691
Thank you.

114
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:50,352
Ms.

115
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:50,892
Mastone?

116
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,114
No, you're good.

117
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:55,018
Mr. Benedetto.

118
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:55,578
Thank you.

119
00:04:55,859 --> 00:05:01,704
I just want to comment that this just shows what teamwork does in our community.

120
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:07,108
I'm so happy to hear that everybody works together to make this such a great success.

121
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,053
Our children really, some children really, the only place they get food in the morning is at school.

122
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:17,097
Either they're too quickly out the door or some families might not have the money.

123
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,600
So these things really do matter to everyday life of our children.

124
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:26,109
And as we all know, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so it's great that our kids get started.

125
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,731
The McGlynn Elementary School also has a breakfast program, and the Roberts School now qualifies for a breakfast program.

126
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,412
That's great.

127
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:36,633
I hope someday all our schools can get breakfast for us, too.

128
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:41,675
Well, we do serve breakfast, but this is Universal Free Breakfast, so it's a great thing.

129
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:43,012
Thank you.

130
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:43,593
Thank you.

131
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:45,755
Is there a motion to receive the report?

132
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:48,316
Motion to receive the report and seconded by Ms.

133
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:48,837
Vandekloot.

134
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:49,858
All those in favor?

135
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:51,179
All those opposed?

136
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,819
Motion passes.

137
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,383
Report on Park MCAS 2016 schedule and related matter.

138
00:05:57,443 --> 00:05:58,845
Mr. Superintendent.

139
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,567
Members of the committee, we're in the middle of MCAS season.

140
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:03,088
Park season is on the way.

141
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:05,390
And there are a number of issues associated with it.

142
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:12,275
Our director of curriculum, Bernadette Riccardelli, will be giving you this report and informing you how things are going.

143
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:18,684
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Bellson, and members of the Medford School Committee.

144
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:24,385
So I'm here tonight to give you some information on the standardized testing schedule.

145
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:36,249
So in your report, the first page is a cover page, and then beyond that, the next six pages, front and back, is the statewide testing schedule put out by the Department of Education.

146
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:42,241
It was put out on January 26th, so it is the most current schedule that is available.

147
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:47,131
So it identifies PARCC testing dates as well as MCAS testing dates.

148
00:06:49,573 --> 00:07:01,961
Following that publication from the Department of Education, so on the following page, where it says 2016 Park MCAS testing dates, that's for our district, for Medford.

149
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:11,528
So what I've done is I've gotten the information from each one of the principals, and I've put it in a succinct form so that you can see the testing dates for each one of the schools.

150
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:17,592
On that first page, we have the Brooks, McGlynn, Columbus, and Roberts Elementary School.

151
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:27,716
For English Language Arts and Mathematics, PARC will be taken and for Science, MCAS will be taken for those dates.

152
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:38,920
You will see that there are also dates in several cases for makeup testing and in some cases the makeup testing dates are still TBD to be determined.

153
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,601
On the next page, we have the schedule for the middle schools and the high school.

154
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:52,663
And as you probably know, because I think it was mentioned before, the Andrews Middle School is the only school in the district that is going to do computer-based testing.

155
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,184
The McGlynn Middle School is doing paper-based testing.

156
00:07:57,204 --> 00:08:06,726
Again, both schools are administering the PARC for English Language Arts and Mathematics and MCAS for Science.

157
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:13,442
Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, and the Curtis Tufts School are all administering MCAS.

158
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:22,968
Last week, we had the English Language Arts test that took place on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of the month.

159
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:27,031
In May, we have mathematics, and in June, we have science.

160
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:33,515
And the makeup test dates for that assessment at the high school level are to be determined.

161
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:47,782
Moving on to the second part of my report, which has to do with the Park MCAS opt-out option, if you will, or information.

162
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:53,346
Much of this report comes directly from the Department of Education, from Commissioner Chester.

163
00:08:55,628 --> 00:09:03,233
So in his publication, in the commissioner's update that he puts out, he has identified state law as the basis

164
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:11,690
for saying that participation in standardized testing is mandatory.

165
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:19,174
The statute, he writes, does not contain an opt-out provision for parents to remove their children from participating.

166
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:25,658
So he's citing Mass General Law's Chapter 69, Section 11 for that statement.

167
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,883
And he references the landmark 1993 Massachusetts Education Reform Act as the basis.

168
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,812
As you know and as I've mentioned, we have selected PARCC for 2016.

169
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:52,595
So again, grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are administering PARCC for English Language Arts, Arts and Mathematics, and Science for MCAS.

170
00:09:54,656 --> 00:09:55,776
So we had that option.

171
00:09:56,437 --> 00:10:00,198
We are held harmless for our participation in PARCC.

172
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:08,344
So I'm going to go down to the next part of the report where, and I'm going to read this verbatim because it comes directly, again, from the commissioner.

173
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,184
So in his guidance, he has written the following.

174
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:20,445
In some instances, a student may refuse to take a test either of his or own volition or at the direction of a parent.

175
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:33,888
In these cases, the Department of Ed, or I should say the Board of Education, asks principals to encourage parents to rethink their refusal and remind them that the assessments are a valuable gauge of their students' and schools' progress.

176
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:39,640
We ask principals and test proctors to handle refusals with sensitivity.

177
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:47,289
Students should not be pressured to take the test, nor should they be punished for not taking the test.

178
00:10:48,243 --> 00:11:00,790
They may sit quietly and read in the testing room, but if they are distracting others in the class who are taking the test, it would be appropriate for them to move to another location within the school with adult supervision.

179
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:06,654
There is no requirement to provide formal or informal instruction to these students during the test period.

180
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:13,418
Having them do work or read a book is sufficient, provided that the material is separate from the content being assessed on that day.

181
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:26,794
So he issued this guidance in response to a number of inquiries about whether or not opting out of mandated state assessment was required.

182
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:35,319
He then identifies why student participation in these tests is essential, as you can see in your report.

183
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:45,726
The results of these assessments provide valuable feedback to districts, to administrators, and to students and parents about

184
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:50,574
about their achievement or lack thereof.

185
00:11:52,402 --> 00:12:00,848
They write, he writes, legislators and taxpayers expect an objective assessment of student and school performance in return for very significant investment of public funds.

186
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:04,591
So in other words, the public wants to know how our students are doing.

187
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:07,753
We are concerned about the following.

188
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:16,339
A low participation rate on the statewide assessments can adversely affect a district's performance rating in the state and federal accountability system.

189
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,963
So we are concerned that if our accountability, excuse me, if our attendance

190
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,163
participation rate is low, it could affect our accountability.

191
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:30,006
We don't anticipate that the high school will be a problem.

192
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:41,415
They are taking MCAS, but in the event that a parent were to opt out of the MCAS test for a grade 10 student, they would have a very difficult time earning a competency determination.

193
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:50,003
Towards the end of the report, I reiterate that concern or that effect on accountability.

194
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:58,442
So it is important to keep in mind it is a mandated test backed up by law.

195
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:08,572
However, as I have identified for you, the Commissioner of Education is cognizant of parent concerns and that's why he has issued the guidance that I presented to you.

196
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,734
I'd be happy to take any questions at this time.

197
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:14,440
Mr. Benedetto.

198
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:25,150
Um, through you to the superintendent, when we voted for the park, one of our, one of my colleagues had mentioned that we voted for our schools to take pen and pencil.

199
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,994
Is the Andrews taking it electronically and do we need to revote if that's the case?

200
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:35,980
The Andrews opted to take it on the computer because they felt they had the capacity to do it.

201
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:40,650
We allowed it because it would give us an opportunity to see how it would work.

202
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,394
Paul DeLave is very good with computers and technology.

203
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:49,738
We felt that it would give us a chance to explore the use of computers.

204
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:53,682
I believe we mentioned it to you at one point.

205
00:13:54,428 --> 00:14:00,013
I think that we voted for a pen-and-pen paper, so I think we might have to re-vote in order for that to happen.

206
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:06,980
I think we voted in general to do that, and I think we did tell you that the answer was, but if we didn't, we can always vote.

207
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:10,032
I think we should.

208
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:13,514
But I think it's a good idea to have at least one school try it so we can understand.

209
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:13,974
I agree.

210
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:29,582
And if we have a principal with that expertise and willing to take that on, and then we can determine what we need as a school department to move forward to have all of our tests done this way, I think it's a really good idea.

211
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:37,806
But I just want to make sure that we follow the procedures and the will of the school committee as directed is carried out.

212
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:38,446
Sure.

213
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:48,012
So I would like to make a motion at this time to allow the Iandros School to take the park test using computers.

214
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:48,772
Ms.

215
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:49,252
Cuno.

216
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:57,057
Well, point of information, I believe I was the colleague that was discussing it because I was part of the committee at the ASC.

217
00:14:57,617 --> 00:15:01,780
The discussion was the frustration of schools taking the test at the time.

218
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,549
that were being told to take it via computer when they didn't have the facilities or the capability of doing it.

219
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:15,339
I believe the discussion here was to allow our schools, if they have the capability of

220
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:18,581
do it online, then they should do it online.

221
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:29,813
And I really don't think that there's a need of a motion because it's the principal who actually has requested that he does want to do this online, because they are able to do it with the computer systems that they have.

222
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:33,857
The frustration was the opposite side of DESC just selecting or

223
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,540
I don't know if that's a good way to put it.

224
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:57,714
So thank you, Ann Marie, for that clarification.

225
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,415
That makes a lot of sense.

226
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:08,462
So technically, you know, I don't necessarily think we have to vote on it, but if my colleague wants to vote on it, there's no reason not to just vote on it and take it off, get it off our deck.

227
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:11,404
So I'll second her motion so we vote on it.

228
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:19,390
On the motion that the Andrews School be allowed to take the park exam this spring now on the computer as opposed to pen and paper.

229
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,311
As planned.

230
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:22,493
On the motion,

231
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,829
All those in favor?

232
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:25,529
Aye.

233
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:26,370
All those opposed?

234
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,190
The motion passes.

235
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,091
Is there a motion on the floor to receive this report and place it on file?

236
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:33,111
I had a question.

237
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:33,391
Ms.

238
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:34,111
Vandeply.

239
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:44,914
So at this point, our principals have all been informed about how they should respond to a parent who requests that their child should not take the test.

240
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:51,496
So yes, at our last full administrative meeting, guidance was provided with the principal.

241
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,979
I would defer to the language of the commissioner.

242
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,321
It's pretty straightforward.

243
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:57,562
It's public.

244
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:58,383
It's on the site.

245
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,621
Again, our position is it's, we think it's an important test to take.

246
00:17:06,102 --> 00:17:06,742
Bernadette, yeah.

247
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:14,185
I just, I guess, I just want to make sure that if a family does come forward and not want their child to take the test, that it's handled.

248
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:23,829
And I did appreciate the line, you know, with sensitivity, so that neither the parent or the child is made to feel guilty about their choice not to take the test.

249
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:32,112
So I believe this exact text was presented to the administrators.

250
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:33,412
I'd be happy to send it to them again.

251
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:40,655
Do parents need to put it in writing that they don't want their child to take the test?

252
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:52,720
Actually, they should put it in writing, and the commissioner would like principals to keep track of any request to opt out.

253
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:58,864
So again, there is concern that it could affect the accountability.

254
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:04,067
But in one correspondence from the commissioner, he said document it.

255
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:10,851
So I'm not sure if there is a great amount, if that would affect any decision.

256
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:20,317
But parents should submit a letter to the principal stating an opt-out preference if that's what they want.

257
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,900
OK, we don't have a form that they sign.

258
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:31,284
So I understand how important it is and we encourage parents to take it.

259
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,987
I also understand all the arguments of the opt-out people.

260
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:40,732
So I just want to make sure that students and that it is handled appropriately.

261
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:44,795
And I would also like this committee to receive

262
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:56,440
after the testing cycle is done, obviously not names, but simply numbers at each school, if there are opt-outs at the schools, if we could receive a report.

263
00:18:58,581 --> 00:19:00,842
And at grade levels, please.

264
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:03,263
Thank you.

265
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:12,313
On the motion as amended to receive a report subsequent to test taking of those, the numbers that opt out versus take.

266
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:13,254
All those in favor?

267
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:13,734
Aye.

268
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:14,815
All those opposed?

269
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:15,636
The motion passes.

270
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:16,877
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

271
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,333
Mr. Benedetto?

272
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,335
It's about items that we request.

273
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:27,699
Can I make a motion at this point to put that on our agenda?

274
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:42,531
Requested items and any items that are tabled so that way they're a list of things every week and that way when someone requests something it's on the list and as we receive those documents it would come off the list.

275
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:43,992
It's much easier to track.

276
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:53,790
On the motion to keep track of papers that are pending as well as papers that have been tabled, it would become part of the committee's meeting agenda.

277
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,051
All those in favor?

278
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:55,472
Aye.

279
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:56,633
All those opposed?

280
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:57,614
Motion passes.

281
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:03,979
There's a recommendation to approve vocational school MSBA statement of interest.

282
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:04,920
Mr. Superintendent.

283
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:12,907
Madam Mayor and members of the committee, this is the season where the Massachusetts School Building Authority

284
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:18,300
asks us to submit a statement of interest if we're contemplating possibly submitting a project.

285
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,703
And the project we're contemplating submitting deals with the vocational school.

286
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:31,268
Our director of the vocational school, Dr. Heidi Riccio, is here, and I'm going to ask her to come up and talk about the SOI that we want to submit with your approval.

287
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:33,009
Ms.

288
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,449
Riccio.

289
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,792
Thank you, Superintendent Belson, Mayor Burke, and District Committee.

290
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:53,190
Medford Vocational Technical High School is seeking school committee approval to submit a statement of interest to the Massachusetts Building Association for the renovation of existing space and the increase of lab space for the STEM-related fields.

291
00:20:54,511 --> 00:21:02,638
Medford Public Schools opened the vocational school in 1970 after a major build that included the high school being on the same complex.

292
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:08,748
Throughout the years, MVTHS has added new programs based on workforce demands.

293
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:16,710
However, there was not a strategic plan created to develop and grow programs or logistically place programs with like clusters.

294
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:28,172
MVTHS intends to implement a strategic plan that would reorganize the vocational campus to embrace the need to move programs in cluster or academy type models.

295
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,196
The following are the potential academies.

296
00:21:33,237 --> 00:21:40,161
The Construction Academy would house carpentry, construction and craft labors, electrical, and HVAC.

297
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:56,130
The Design and Visual Academy would include graphic communications, design and visual communications, media technology, which is also often known as TV production, computer programming, and web development.

298
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:03,253
In the Human Services Academy, it would house Health Assisting, Early Education and Childhood.

299
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:12,535
In the Service Academy, it would house Business Technology, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Hospitality and Marketing.

300
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:23,498
And the STEM Academy would include Biotechnology, Environmental Science, Robotics, Engineering, Metal Fabrication and Advanced Manufacturing.

301
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:43,821
MVTHS is planning to seek funding under priority number seven of the MSBA priorities, which states replacement of or addition to obsolete buildings in order to provide a full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements.

302
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:47,882
This can also be found on the msba.org website.

303
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:55,866
Medford Public Schools believes that the following reasons are in order to seek funding under priority number seven.

304
00:22:57,347 --> 00:22:58,748
Number one, technology.

305
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:11,861
As the workforce has changed into the technological age within all technical areas, MVTHS must be able to provide access to its students and the community to sound technology advances.

306
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:23,669
Additionally, appropriate security of the equipment and updated shutoffs are needed to ensure the safe operation of the building during school hours and through our growing adult education program.

307
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:25,597
Equipment.

308
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:32,181
As part of this renovation and add-on space comes equipment that meets the demands of a changing workforce.

309
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:50,250
While the district committee has been generous in its support of programs and the school has done a fabulous job of accessing grant funding and other alternative funding sources, there is a significant need to replace existing equipment that is obsolete with equipment that is currently used in industry.

310
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:57,745
Being a vocational high school in Massachusetts, it is essential to meet the needs of the existing and future workforce.

311
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:08,191
To do this, MVTHS is seeking MSBA funding to add equipment that is part of each program and is consistent with other vocational schools across the commonwealth.

312
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:11,013
ADA compliance.

313
00:24:11,873 --> 00:24:14,535
Accessibility to the building is in need of enhancement.

314
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:20,258
Currently, the door handles, locks, and some areas of building access are not ADA compliant.

315
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:28,140
Additionally, hallway doors are in need of replacement, and doors leading into and through vocational programs need appropriate access points.

316
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:35,646
Flooring in the vocational programs are mixed, as some have tile, which is in disrepair, and others have concrete.

317
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:44,153
The intention is to replace the floors to meet current standards, and put appropriate flooring in vocational programs that meet industry needs.

318
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:49,397
An example of this would be epoxy flooring in the auto technology program.

319
00:24:50,832 --> 00:25:05,737
Additional space, MBTHS would like to add on to the existing third floor science lab space above the vocational main entrance to increase vocational offerings to both vocational and high school students.

320
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,758
Currently, two programs are situated in one lab space.

321
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:14,400
As enrollment grows, the need for additional space is necessary.

322
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:28,012
Adding to the third floor space would offer new labs and classrooms for biotechnology, environmental science, robotics and engineering, and give the option to add other STEM-related programs.

323
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,395
Existing space reorganization.

324
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:43,000
When programs were added to MVTHS, Medford Public Schools considered open space that was available and not necessarily what was in the best interest of the program or service to the community.

325
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,341
One example of this was the Construction and Craft Laborers Program.

326
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:53,083
This program was situated above academic classrooms, yet they were using heavy equipment.

327
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:58,905
The school plans to reorganize space so that it is logical and makes sense for all programs.

328
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:19,229
MSBA funding would provide the opportunity to incorporate deeper collaboration with the high school, expand our adult education offerings, and make certain programs like cosmetology, culinary arts, hospitality, and marketing accessible to the general public with separate entrance space.

329
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:24,453
That is actually the first part of our MSBA.

330
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:28,596
So we're going to save the second part on the studio until the next report.

331
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:29,777
OK.

332
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:30,838
Thank you.

333
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:32,420
Ms.

334
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:32,880
Cuno.

335
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,986
First and foremost, let me just say how amazed and thrilled I am.

336
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:44,049
This is great news.

337
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:55,219
The other things I do want to ask is, I know when we did the science labs in the science building, that particular grant was for that particular area.

338
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,000
However, if there was anything that

339
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,325
overlapped or touched that building, it also was refurnished or redone.

340
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:15,972
I remember the lights in the office of the high school because the ceiling of the high school office was actually the floor that abutted the science buildings.

341
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:18,053
was redone.

342
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:21,154
So in this particular project, is it like that too?

343
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:28,655
Is there anything above the other parts of a room that maybe isn't technically under the vocational school?

344
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:32,896
Will they get redone?

345
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,077
The first part is the intent to apply.

346
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,377
So for us, it's to seek that intent.

347
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:45,599
And then we would go into that phase of the actual space and what we would be looking at in altering or changing.

348
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:53,906
And when you're looking into this, are we going to make sure that everything matches?

349
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:59,911
So since we have the science labs done, I know we're going to call them the new science labs probably for 50 years.

350
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:06,817
But are we going to match that with the new renovations at the vocational side?

351
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:09,239
So everything starts looking coincidentally the same.

352
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:10,199
Absolutely.

353
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,685
I think if you've walked down the building of the vocational school in the past couple of years, I do like matching.

354
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:33,988
Furniture and matching colors and we actually have a color scheme that is now specific to the school, which is nice because now you're not looking at a variety of different colors that may not be complementary to the eye.

355
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:45,439
However, an example of that is when we redid the health assisting lab, that door is actually the same door, and the keys are keyed the same as the science labs.

356
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,065
So yes, the doors would look the same, the same color grain, et cetera, and the color schemes would be similar.

357
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:53,227
Okay, that's great.

358
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:56,430
And the other thing, I guess, because we are going to be touching

359
00:28:58,357 --> 00:28:59,198
The cable station.

360
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,662
How would that work out while it's under renovation?

361
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:03,683
That would be the next topic.

362
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:04,764
We're doing it in the next section?

363
00:29:05,105 --> 00:29:05,465
That's fine.

364
00:29:06,126 --> 00:29:06,546
Thank you.

365
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:07,968
Thank you.

366
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:08,148
Ms.

367
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:08,648
Vander Kloof.

368
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:10,130
So, Ms.

369
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:16,557
Rich here, once again, you have brought us to the point where you have just pushed us forward and now have us...

370
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:27,802
headed into a direction for the future of our students and the well-being of them and what we offer in Medford or the possibilities of what we offer.

371
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:29,903
Obviously, this is just the first step.

372
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:31,623
First, a technical question.

373
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:36,045
When do you have to file this statement of interest?

374
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:38,186
What's the first deadline?

375
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,467
April 10th.

376
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:46,509
And could you need our approval on saying, yes, we're interested in moving forth?

377
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:51,454
There is no, obviously, no dollar amount or anything at this point.

378
00:29:51,534 --> 00:29:53,476
It's just simply we're interested.

379
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:56,539
And what is the next step?

380
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:11,694
complete the letter of intent, the next step would for the MSBA to actually look at that letter of intent and look at the needs of the school and the why we are seeking it.

381
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:18,397
And the vote, I believe, is not until 2017 for us to then move forward into the next phase.

382
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,219
Does this need to go before the city council?

383
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:22,159
Eventually.

384
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:22,859
Yes.

385
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,142
Eventually, but not before the letter of intent on April 10th.

386
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:34,935
I believe that we will, um, I'm going to let, I'm going to defer because I haven't been through this before in Medford.

387
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:45,381
So the way it works is, is that the statement of interest goes in state, you know, to this, to the state, they determine whether or not it's even eligible, whether they would be willing to entertain it.

388
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:51,725
We then, if we get to the next round, we'll start to put some other plans together and little by little, it'll move forward.

389
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:55,807
If we get invited to submit some design, then we have to go to the,

390
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:59,406
to the City Council for money for design.

391
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:05,387
And then if we get beyond design and they accept that, then we would go to construction documents.

392
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:10,948
But right now, simply for tonight and to be able to move on, it's just, we can vote on this.

393
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:14,148
And so I make a recommendation, a motion to approve.

394
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:17,049
There's a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

395
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:18,329
Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

396
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:18,909
Cuno.

397
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:19,749
Mr. Benedetto.

398
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:23,030
I just want to thank you for all your hard work in taking

399
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:26,751
us to these great opportunities.

400
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:32,801
I know you've brought in a huge amount of grant funds already for our vocational school.

401
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,347
I appreciate the work of yourself and your staff.

402
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:38,948
The school looks great.

403
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:40,289
I was up there recently.

404
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,291
All the colors do look great.

405
00:31:42,892 --> 00:31:52,960
And I hope that someone pays attention and sees our need and comes and really gives us money to help us build this, because this is a dream come true.

406
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:53,841
Thank you.

407
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:54,642
Thank you.

408
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,149
Thank you for being here.

409
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:05,654
I also want to just make note that our staff member Richard Cormier did email all of us telling us how supportive he was.

410
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:11,659
He unfortunately couldn't be here, but I just want to make note that he's excited and supports this project.

411
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:18,944
The question I was hoping maybe by the next school committee is that I know vocational schools are becoming more popular.

412
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:24,168
I hope that out of my six, half will be at the vocational school to have a

413
00:32:25,368 --> 00:32:26,269
a trade after that.

414
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:33,732
Is it possible to have a number of students in each program in what the capacity is?

415
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:38,915
So if you have 10 in business technology, but what's the capacity if you've got a full house?

416
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:46,524
So the Department of Ed comes out with a recommendation per square footage and per program, and I can email that to you.

417
00:32:46,604 --> 00:32:48,124
It's pretty black and white.

418
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:58,130
I would want all six of your children actually at the vocational school, because as you can see by the programs, they are college and career ready.

419
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,851
And I thank Rich Cormier.

420
00:33:00,911 --> 00:33:02,272
I also have a culinary arts.

421
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:03,793
I don't know if you saw her in the paper.

422
00:33:04,513 --> 00:33:33,733
yesterday, but it was in the paper as well as in the Boston paper, but the Culinary Arts Program has been very helpful out in the community, and I can't, any of these grants were all co-written by the experts that are in the field, so I just have fairly good grammar, but really they're the ones that are giving me the content for the grant, so I have to thank all of the teachers and staff, because they've also renovated all of the space up until now, so everything you see was done by the staff and our students.

423
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:36,308
Good, thank you.

424
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,570
There's a motion on the floor for approval.

425
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,532
Roll call vote, please, Mr. Skerry.

426
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,194
Yes.

427
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:46,798
Yes.

428
00:33:46,898 --> 00:33:47,158
Yes.

429
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,139
Yes.

430
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,700
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

431
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,601
The motion passes.

432
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:51,462
Good luck.

433
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:51,942
Thank you.

434
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:53,183
We await the answers.

435
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:57,788
Report on the construction status of the multimedia community access channel.

436
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:58,649
Mr. Superintendent.

437
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:00,130
Madam Mayor and members of the committee,

438
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:17,745
We've been working on this project for a little while now in conjunction with City Hall, Louise Miller, Scott Payette from the architectural firm, and Dr. Riccio and members of our media and technology staff to put together various aspects of this program.

439
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,047
We're about to begin

440
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:25,391
some early construction with abatement process during the school vacation, so that we can get things going.

441
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:39,202
You see from the charts up there, we have a timeline that we hope to finish construction sometime by the end of the summer, and then begin the process of populating the place and getting things operational sometime in early October.

442
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:47,949
So we're going to turn it over to Dr. Riccio again to tell you a little bit about how that's going to proceed, so that you get an idea of where we are with the multimedia,

443
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:49,771
and with the Access Channel.

444
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:51,833
Thank you again.

445
00:34:51,853 --> 00:35:07,630
I will say that when we did start this process, we went out to at least five different schools across the Commonwealth to look at what their TV studio looked like, and many of them did have the public education and government component within those.

446
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:18,859
programs and that kind of jump started our thought process on location and what they learned from having it on site at a school.

447
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:22,402
So we did get some very helpful information that started two years ago.

448
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:28,646
Over the course of the last two years, we worked with the former mayor as well as the new mayor, Mayor Burke.

449
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:33,788
school department and other members of the community to really look at what we need.

450
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:39,671
We knew that we wanted to start a Chapter 74 vocational program.

451
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:50,996
The actual certification is called radio and TV production or broadcasting, but we wanted to incorporate media technology as well into it, knowing that this is really a digital world.

452
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:58,121
and how we could do as many crossovers within the curricular as we could with other programs, including design and visual.

453
00:35:58,181 --> 00:36:05,146
So as you saw in my last report, looking at that whole entire academy model, the TV studio would encompass that.

454
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:15,333
So the report on the TV studio is that MVTHS is excited to report that construction will begin on the new access television studio in April.

455
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,722
During April's school vacation, the studio will receive abatement of asbestos.

456
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:25,965
Timing was determined for April break as to minimize the disruption in programming.

457
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:31,909
Plans are in the final stages of development, as you can see in your packet, as well as on the storyboards.

458
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:37,952
And the bulk of the work will be done during the summer months, with the studio scheduled to open in September of 2016.

459
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:49,784
In 2014, MVTHS applied for program approval through the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Chapter 74 process.

460
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:56,152
This approval was put on hold until there was progress with the TV studio renovation due to classroom space.

461
00:36:57,314 --> 00:37:10,587
While the high school currently has strong media courses, the intention is to work collaboratively with them to increase availability of courses and offer students a program where students can get certified in various software platforms.

462
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:19,776
MVTHS will also be working closely with the local Access TV to bring educational programs to the community when it is fully operational.

463
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:28,454
The current plan is to have day access for students and evening access for local access, so there is no scheduling conflicts.

464
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:43,621
Since the renovation project has a timeline for completion of September of 2016, MVTHS has posted for a teacher position that is dual licensed in TV production, but also design and visual communications.

465
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:53,790
We will be having an advisory board meeting for this program on April 26th in conjunction with the annual spring advisory meeting for other programs.

466
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:59,653
The intent of this meeting is to receive final guidance as we move toward this program approval.

467
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:09,643
Once the licensed teacher is hired and the studio is near completion, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will be scheduled to come in for a site inspection.

468
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:21,408
It is during this site inspection that the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education reviews the facility, curriculum, and instruction in support of the community for the program.

469
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:26,170
And as you can, I think you have it all in your packets.

470
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:26,890
It's a color.

471
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:33,627
duplicate of what these storyboards state and we can certainly review those if you would like.

472
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:39,970
So the first section is the timeline, as you can see in your packet.

473
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:46,994
We are scheduling the construction and the first phase would be the asbestos.

474
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:58,899
And we chose to do this during April vacation when students are out of the building, but we will be completely containing that area so there is no access to that area while we are doing that.

475
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:19,748
We will then move into, obviously I can't speak for the whole RFP of contractors because that's all done through the City Hall and Louise Miller's office, but once that is complete, the idea is to begin construction since we do have the final phase drawings in the summer of 2016 with completion of September of 2016.

476
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:19,828
Ms.

477
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:20,008
Cuneo?

478
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:31,890
Again, this is wonderful news.

479
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,894
I know before we had discussed it, it was going to be open to both sides.

480
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:43,679
I just want to make sure that both the high school side and the vocational students have the opportunity to work in this studio.

481
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,460
So that's one that I want to confirm.

482
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:46,361
Absolutely.

483
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:50,885
And the other thing is that I know that it's also open to our public.

484
00:39:52,005 --> 00:39:59,350
And in the lieu of it being renovated, is there another place where anybody could go to use any of the equipment per se?

485
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:09,077
Maybe not in the whole realm of the spectacular way that we're going to be doing it, but at least some place where our students and maybe even the public could go and do something.

486
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:26,026
So I'm going to defer, because where I'm the director of the vocational school, my primary focus is to start programs within the school setting, so the educational component of it, and not necessarily the government or public access.

487
00:40:26,186 --> 00:40:26,947
All right.

488
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:30,510
So through the mayor to the superintendent, yes?

489
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,171
What was your question again, please?

490
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:38,633
It was just basically, is there any place that anyone could go to while this is under renovation so they could do it?

491
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:44,015
There's no equipment set up right now, so it will be upon the opening, which we're projecting October.

492
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,436
OK.

493
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:48,317
Mr. Benedetto.

494
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:49,017
Thank you.

495
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:52,158
Do we have any cost estimates of this?

496
00:40:54,988 --> 00:41:05,637
through you, Madam Mayor, to the superintendent, what the estimated cost of all of this is gonna be and how we're funding this.

497
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:09,380
I just want it to be clear and out there so all questions are answered.

498
00:41:11,027 --> 00:41:17,770
We have quite a bit of funding in our community access account, and that's what we would be using to build out this, because that is the purpose.

499
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,911
That's what I assumed.

500
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:19,571
I just didn't.

501
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,772
So there's no cost to the taxpayers.

502
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:28,175
So that way, it's on record that this isn't coming out of the school-specific budget.

503
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:36,078
It's a program that's going to generate education and value to both our school and to our community.

504
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:54,133
And I think it's a great program for our students and a great educational value because there are a lot of jobs that we can send people out and a lot of students will study this forward in college as well as use it as a technical skill if they choose not to go to college.

505
00:41:55,123 --> 00:42:01,604
So I think it's a great opportunity for both the school district as well as the city as a whole.

506
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:14,927
I know at some point it's not gonna be just the school committee that decides on all of this and we're gonna have to work either with the city council or bring it forward to them after we do our share.

507
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:16,467
Is that correct?

508
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,347
The contract lies with the mayor's office.

509
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:20,168
Okay.

510
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:21,588
Thank you.

511
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:21,868
Thank you.

512
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,797
Are there any other questions from the members?

513
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:27,298
Ms.

514
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:27,899
Biandiclu?

515
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:28,719
I'll hold mine.

516
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,680
Excuse me?

517
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,281
I'll hold it.

518
00:42:30,421 --> 00:42:30,961
You'll hold.

519
00:42:32,502 --> 00:42:32,923
Thank you, Ms.

520
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:33,143
Riccio.

521
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:33,883
Thank you.

522
00:42:33,944 --> 00:42:35,685
I believe there's a citizen that would like to speak.

523
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:42,590
Name and address for the record, please.

524
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,731
Yes, Your Honor.

525
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:46,033
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

526
00:42:46,073 --> 00:42:46,754
I want to thank Ms.

527
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:48,195
Riccio for her presentation.

528
00:42:49,553 --> 00:42:57,179
As many know that I've been fighting for this, and I've spoken to the school committee for many years, I'm a little shocked that it's going to take until September or October.

529
00:42:57,899 --> 00:42:59,180
We need access TV now.

530
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:05,125
We have students playing sports that are just not going taped, not going preserved.

531
00:43:05,906 --> 00:43:12,151
There's many, many reasons why we need public access television in the city, and I propose that we have a satellite office.

532
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,461
Very simple, we get a van, very small van.

533
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,702
We work with the library and the Chevalier.

534
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:22,103
We can get $7,000 cameras, very inexpensive.

535
00:43:22,123 --> 00:43:23,944
They run over the cellular lines.

536
00:43:24,624 --> 00:43:30,326
So I've been at the mass access conference and I met with many dealers there.

537
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:31,526
They have this equipment.

538
00:43:31,606 --> 00:43:33,387
We could be up and running immediately.

539
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:35,748
We could have a city-operated station.

540
00:43:35,808 --> 00:43:41,349
We could have a privately-operated station, a nonprofit as we had before, only one that runs correctly.

541
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,970
I know that the mayor is on board with this.

542
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,611
I think we really owe it to the public to expedite this.

543
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:53,332
Now, a van with these cameras, these beautiful new cameras, would fit perfectly with what you're doing.

544
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,373
So we're not altering the plan at all.

545
00:43:55,393 --> 00:43:57,413
We're just adding to it, having a small van.

546
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:00,014
I estimate we need about $60,000, $70,000 for two or three of these $7,000 cameras.

547
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:15,325
Maybe put some computers at the library, and I did speak to Barbara Kerr about this, and I said it would be very easy because you can help renovate the library with some of the access monies we have.

548
00:44:16,026 --> 00:44:21,070
Have two or three computers here so the kids can edit, but they can tape from the van.

549
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:25,434
I just asked this honorable school committee to consider it.

550
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,044
It's important.

551
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:28,966
We would have access right away.

552
00:44:28,986 --> 00:44:32,990
We would work with the Chevalier, the library, and then it would fit so nicely.

553
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,672
It's perfect synergy with the high school.

554
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:35,653
Thank you.

555
00:44:36,654 --> 00:44:36,954
Thank you.

556
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:37,234
Ms.

557
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:37,755
Zantaclou.

558
00:44:39,321 --> 00:44:44,966
No, I just wanted to express my thanks to Heidi once again for bringing forth our report.

559
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:57,956
I think that the proposal from Mr. Biglioni sort of almost goes outside of the school committee purview at this time, because right now our project and our sites are really looking forward to

560
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,780
what we're doing at the school and the educational benefits to the students.

561
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:10,246
And I don't want to throw something together even if it has merit that we're not really quite ready to do at this point.

562
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,851
know how quickly the rest of the school year will go.

563
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:33,577
And while I know it's been very, very frustrating for you and many in the community who are looking forward to a broader access TV, I think that, you know, I'm really putting, I want to put my eggs in this basket right now.

564
00:45:34,777 --> 00:45:47,122
Again, I don't know because there's a lot of things I simply don't know about the proposal, how much a van would cost, who would drive the van, all of those sorts of issues, and I think that goes actually beyond us right at the moment.

565
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:48,142
Thank you.

566
00:45:48,742 --> 00:45:52,123
There's a motion on the floor for approval, receive and place on file.

567
00:45:52,464 --> 00:45:53,264
All those in favor?

568
00:45:53,444 --> 00:45:53,804
Aye.

569
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:54,684
All those opposed?

570
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:56,105
Motion passes.

571
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:04,295
Report on the construction status, I'm sorry, report on new opiate bill House 4056 and Medford implementation.

572
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:05,175
Mr. Superintendent.

573
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,398
Madam Mayor and members of the committee, I passed out this evening some additional documents.

574
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:20,346
One is from the legal office of the MASS, along with the Detroit LLP, Leslie Carey being the particular writer.

575
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:23,509
Another is a document that I gave you.

576
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:43,955
two-sided, that update some of the substance abuse programs that we have put in place this year based on last year's budget, including the Michigan model, and other things, programs that are coming up, including mention of April 2nd's meeting on the addiction program that will be held in the Caron Theater.

577
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:45,836
But we'll go into that a little bit.

578
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:47,197
So there's additional programs.

579
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:49,799
and things that I want you to pay attention to.

580
00:46:50,119 --> 00:47:02,954
There's also an item on the city council tomorrow night asking for some information on what we're doing and, with the mayor's permission, I might send some of this material along to them to keep them involved and perhaps invite them to the

581
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:05,952
Angle's second presentation.

582
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:07,833
Dr. Robert Brooks is there.

583
00:47:07,873 --> 00:47:11,975
Dr. Robert Brooks is perhaps one of the most eminent psychologists in the area.

584
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:20,960
We're dealing with adolescents and children, and he was the director of McLean's, but he's also very well known for all his other work, including with substance abuse.

585
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,062
So... Point of information, Mr. Benedetto.

586
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:32,760
So today was the deadline for registering for the April 2nd.

587
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:34,701
So you may just want to call.

588
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:37,142
It's wide open.

589
00:47:37,282 --> 00:47:40,824
I called today just to register to make sure that I had space.

590
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:43,165
But that's what the brochure says.

591
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:46,146
So if there is more room, we should let people know.

592
00:47:46,186 --> 00:47:47,327
We'll just put out more information.

593
00:47:47,887 --> 00:47:56,632
they should at least call and register that they're coming and that they plan to attend and which of the five speakers they want to hear.

594
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:02,556
So it's just helpful to them for planning purposes for Saturday.

595
00:48:03,156 --> 00:48:04,037
We'll put that up.

596
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:04,417
OK.

597
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:05,097
Thank you.

598
00:48:05,378 --> 00:48:05,818
Put that up.

599
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:16,204
Now, on March 14, 2016, Governor Baker signed House 4056, which is entitled NAC, relative to substance use treatment

600
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,288
education, and prevention.

601
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:22,372
The legislation passed both House and Senate unanimously.

602
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:25,576
The act is more popularly known as the Opium Bill.

603
00:48:26,597 --> 00:48:39,289
It's formally listed as Chapter 52 of the Acts of 2016, and with a few exceptions, it became effective immediately, and a preamble to it that makes it effective immediately.

604
00:48:40,658 --> 00:48:44,600
So I've attached the legislative bulletin that you would normally receive from MASC.

605
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,104
You may already have it, but just in case you haven't seen it yet, it's attached as well from legal counsel Stephen J. Finnegan.

606
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:55,627
It highlights the pertinent portions of the new law that impact the schools of the commonwealth.

607
00:48:56,788 --> 00:49:04,352
So I'm going to talk about some of the specific elements that affect public schools and provide you with a status update as to where we stand as a school district.

608
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:06,534
Schools are required,

609
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:12,529
to notify parents, guardians, and all attending students regarding our substance abuse policy.

610
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,792
This policy must also be posted on our website.

611
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:18,574
This policy must be filed with DESE.

612
00:49:19,315 --> 00:49:21,697
We will be posting our policy after tonight.

613
00:49:22,518 --> 00:49:29,284
And of course, we'll also hold a meeting to review it and see if we want to make any changes to it, or adjustments to it, or upgrade at any given point in time.

614
00:49:29,324 --> 00:49:34,028
But we'll use the current policy to at least meet that immediate requirement after this evening.

615
00:49:35,952 --> 00:49:40,634
And then when Destiny gives us some more guidance, we will follow up the policy to them.

616
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:46,856
They have some of their own ideas, and I'm sure that we will try to incorporate them as well.

617
00:49:49,177 --> 00:49:53,238
It's in the handbooks, distributed to students and families.

618
00:49:53,698 --> 00:49:56,199
It's also contained within our online policy manual.

619
00:49:56,845 --> 00:50:08,071
And we'll highlight that policy to make it more prominent and visible to students and parents by putting some kind of thing on the front page so people will go to it without having to go into each school.

620
00:50:08,832 --> 00:50:21,459
Dessie, in consultation with the Department of Public Health, is instructed to provide guidance and recommendations to assist schools with the development of effective school policies and practices regarding substance abuse prevention and education.

621
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:26,662
ESRI tells me that DESI will take five, six months to get there.

622
00:50:26,682 --> 00:50:31,265
Because that's typical, you know, as they convene meetings and so on and so forth.

623
00:50:31,826 --> 00:50:37,150
So we can generally expect a five to six month time frame for DESI to give us real guidance.

624
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,373
They may give us some preliminary things, but real guidance will take a few months.

625
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:44,676
And we'll continue to work cooperatively with DESI and DBH as we go forward.

626
00:50:48,388 --> 00:50:54,234
Currently, we have taken the following steps with DPH, and this is done through Tony Vento's office.

627
00:50:54,274 --> 00:51:00,780
Some of this you already know, but I'm going to repeat it so that everyone has a chance to hear it as well while we're listening at home.

628
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:04,704
All nurses are now trained to administer Narcan.

629
00:51:05,986 --> 00:51:08,428
Narcan supplies are available at each of our schools.

630
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:12,272
Training was provided by Armstrong Ambulance at no cost.

631
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:20,524
Narcan was purchased through CVS at a reduced cost using grant funding from our Central School Health Services grant funding.

632
00:51:21,004 --> 00:51:22,144
It's a grant we get every year.

633
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:25,166
Naturally, we track it in the budget.

634
00:51:25,546 --> 00:51:30,068
It's in there right now in the governor's budget, but we'll see what happens when it goes through the legislature.

635
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:34,350
I would expect them to sustain that particular line item.

636
00:51:37,932 --> 00:51:41,634
We also got a grant from the Central Schools Health Services grant.

637
00:51:43,082 --> 00:51:47,663
of $9,700 for support student screening planning costs under HESPR.

638
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:52,504
That's the screening tool where parents can opt out if they want.

639
00:51:53,125 --> 00:52:01,947
It's like a five to 10 minute screening and we would keep it confidential and we report to people who have need as to what they can do.

640
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:11,369
High school nurses have been trained on this particular screening procedure to meet initial DBH requirements, working with grade nine students to start

641
00:52:12,402 --> 00:52:21,449
We expect to implement the training and screening during the 2016-2017 year at the high school as per DPH recommendations.

642
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:30,015
Now, if you go into the actual state law, most schools don't have to do it in 2017, but we're ahead of the curve.

643
00:52:30,035 --> 00:52:31,956
We're going to start a little bit earlier.

644
00:52:33,557 --> 00:52:37,300
We're planning to train middle school nurses to meet the 2017 mandate for grade seven students.

645
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:47,250
Additional training to elementary nurses is possible, depending upon DPH mandates and recommendations.

646
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:50,312
We don't know what their, what their preference is at this time.

647
00:52:51,093 --> 00:53:02,422
At our professional day on March 1st, 2016, we provided motivational interviewing training to our nurses to get them to work with the students and others to get them to be forthcoming.

648
00:53:02,902 --> 00:53:09,087
And we'll continue to prioritize social and emotional learning as one of our key initiatives in the school district.

649
00:53:11,029 --> 00:53:14,631
We have to do this on an annual basis at two different grade levels by law.

650
00:53:15,832 --> 00:53:17,133
Parents can opt out in writing.

651
00:53:17,873 --> 00:53:22,776
All information obtained through the screening is confidential, except in case of medical emergencies.

652
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:27,599
If something happens in a medical emergency, obviously you can't keep it confidential, you have to deal with it.

653
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:30,067
We're well ahead of the act.

654
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:32,948
As explained above, we're moving in the direction of the law.

655
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:41,271
The implementation of screening is subject to state appropriation and will not be generally required until 2017, 2018, if it's funded.

656
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:46,213
So again, unfunded mandates are often the case in the Commonwealth.

657
00:53:46,774 --> 00:53:54,457
If they don't fund it, it may not be required, but we will try to keep it in place, and like I said, we're ahead of the curve right now.

658
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:56,878
There is a good Samaritan cause.

659
00:53:58,122 --> 00:54:09,642
Section 12FF that absolves any person who in good faith attempts to render emergency care by Narcan from liability except for gross negligence and or willful or wanton misconduct.

660
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,081
So I've attached additional information for you.

661
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:27,506
On Sunday, April 2nd, 2016, the Medford Public Schools, through the Bloomberg Center for Civic and Social Responsibility, will offer a workshop program on addiction, and Dr. Robert Brooks is the featured speaker.

662
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:31,687
I have his resume and some information here for you.

663
00:54:32,548 --> 00:54:37,149
As you know, the Medford Public Schools has implemented the Michigan model curriculum.

664
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:41,411
The program is a comprehensive approach to health, wellness, and good decision-making.

665
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:44,717
We're giving great emphasis to social and emotional learning.

666
00:54:45,177 --> 00:54:49,781
We've added counseling assistance to our faculty, and we're close with many external agencies.

667
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:54,225
So we're committed to working with the community to move this forward.

668
00:54:54,245 --> 00:54:56,867
I'll call your attention to some of the things that I brought to you tonight.

669
00:54:58,649 --> 00:55:05,154
This document is a memo from me, an update, and I just bring a couple of things to you.

670
00:55:05,174 --> 00:55:08,937
The Michigan model is piloted in all our elementary schools this year.

671
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:10,979
There are 13 teachers who are

672
00:55:11,573 --> 00:55:12,994
piloting it at this point in time.

673
00:55:14,735 --> 00:55:20,199
They're also comparing it to second step and to see which things cross over.

674
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:25,743
They'll evaluate each lesson and choose lessons that they think will be most effective with the students.

675
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:30,767
Middle school and high school students are in full implementation of the MidMichigan model at this time.

676
00:55:32,148 --> 00:55:37,992
If only a Wahlberg Foundation opiate awareness video was added to the sophomore curriculum at the high school.

677
00:55:39,411 --> 00:55:43,573
Vaping, more dangerous than you think, or vaping, if you will.

678
00:55:44,113 --> 00:55:46,214
Video is added to the sophomore curriculum as well.

679
00:55:46,715 --> 00:55:47,755
Youngsters who inhale things.

680
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:50,256
Presentations.

681
00:55:51,137 --> 00:55:52,257
End the stigma of addiction.

682
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:57,240
Substance abuse prevention projects were unveiled at an event at Memphis C Hall on February 3rd, 2016.

683
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:07,145
Michael Sporker of the MHS team and MHS students of the Gay-Straight Alliance shared their stories of family and friends with addictions.

684
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:13,418
There's an addiction symposium on the second, I've already referenced that.

685
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:21,967
Grants, partnership for success grant for preparation, prevention of prescription drug misuse among youth was awarded to the city of Bedford.

686
00:56:22,888 --> 00:56:25,050
Penny Bonioli, Brooke Hoyt.

687
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:40,409
Lisa Van Doyen, Rachel Perry, John Perot, and Heidi Riccio, Amelia Jensen, and Tony Vento are working on a plan to implement evidence-based prevention programs, policies, and practices to reduce prescription drug misuse amongst persons age 12 to 25 years old.

688
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:42,970
So another initiative underway.

689
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:47,233
The Safe and Supportive School Grant, we applied for this at the end of November 2015.

690
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:51,095
It's yet to be awarded for all four elementary schools.

691
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:52,956
We'll wait to hear what happens with that.

692
00:56:53,796 --> 00:56:59,618
We've got an MIA workshop, The Face of Addiction, The Opioid Crisis, The Journey from Painkillers to Addiction.

693
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:05,300
It'll be led by health teacher Ellen Ridden, and it'll be done in May of 2016.

694
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:16,565
There's another program called Heat Heroin Education Awareness Task Force Conference on Friday, June 17th, and we will have people from our staff attend that conference.

695
00:57:16,985 --> 00:57:18,245
So we're very active right now.

696
00:57:18,525 --> 00:57:19,566
There's a lot going on.

697
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:22,507
This is something that we take very seriously,

698
00:57:23,612 --> 00:57:31,054
whether it's drugs, alcohol, whatever it is, we're taking it very, very seriously, and we believe we're ahead of the curve.

699
00:57:31,634 --> 00:57:33,855
I'm willing to answer any questions you may have.

700
00:57:33,895 --> 00:57:34,335
Mr. Skerry.

701
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:42,757
And if I may, through you to the superintendent, Mr. Belson, I would suggest that a copy of this package be given to our director of public information.

702
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:47,158
I found this package to be very stimulating and

703
00:57:48,364 --> 00:58:04,293
I think that we should have a concerted effort with our media to get this message out to parents and concerned citizens and anyone that might have missed it and to reassure them that we are working towards hopefully not having any tragic cases here in Medford.

704
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:17,960
But if they do, at least they'll know where to go to get information and they know that we do have a substance abuse policy in place and who they might contact or how they might gain further information to help their own children.

705
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,631
It will be on the website this week.

706
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:22,693
It will also be out to the media this week.

707
00:58:23,353 --> 00:58:28,457
And we will also be sending things with the permission of the mayor to the council tomorrow night.

708
00:58:33,618 --> 00:58:35,279
This is absolutely wonderful.

709
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:41,321
This is something that I know is a collaboration of the school district and with the help of everyone in the community.

710
00:58:41,341 --> 00:58:57,507
This is something that we've all been waiting for because, again, it's wonderful that people do things and we have different clubs and organizations that do things separately, but I think the power in this is that we do it all together and I think this is a great program to start with, or not actually start with because I know

711
00:58:57,947 --> 00:59:00,888
We've been doing quite a lot for quite a while.

712
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:08,352
I just wanted to clarify, Mr. Superintendent, you said Sunday, April 2nd, and I just want to make sure that people understand it's Saturday.

713
00:59:08,452 --> 00:59:09,332
Saturday the 2nd.

714
00:59:09,352 --> 00:59:09,772
We'll clean up.

715
00:59:10,152 --> 00:59:10,473
Thank you.

716
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,073
You're welcome.

717
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:12,153
Ms.

718
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:12,593
Mastone?

719
00:59:12,934 --> 00:59:21,237
I know at the Roberts, some of my kids have the Michigan model, and it's just that the classroom teaches when she has time to fit it in.

720
00:59:21,297 --> 00:59:21,918
It's not really

721
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:24,398
It's up to the classroom teacher.

722
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:27,780
But when does the middle school and high school get Michigan model?

723
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,700
Is it more structured?

724
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,541
They have it part of their health classes.

725
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:30,601
OK.

726
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:32,181
So is that once a week or?

727
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:35,182
Depends on how the schedule is set up, but generally once a week.

728
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:37,303
So it's probably more consistent than?

729
00:59:37,403 --> 00:59:38,223
It's consistent.

730
00:59:38,303 --> 00:59:41,404
Each school has a little bit different approach to delivering the health program.

731
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:41,845
OK.

732
00:59:42,385 --> 00:59:43,585
But they schedule it generally once a week.

733
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:47,327
OK.

734
00:59:47,347 --> 00:59:48,067
Mr. Benedetto.

735
00:59:48,107 --> 00:59:48,727
Thank you.

736
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,588
Mr. Bell said?

737
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:55,543
I didn't see a copy of our policy.

738
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:56,983
We'll send it along.

739
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:58,403
We didn't encode it with this.

740
00:59:58,483 --> 00:59:59,704
Yeah, I'm asking you to please.

741
00:59:59,784 --> 01:00:01,664
It's a little different to school to school.

742
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:04,125
I mean, from high school to now.

743
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:07,325
OK, I'd like to see that before it's posted.

744
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:09,166
You can send it up.

745
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:09,786
OK.

746
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:13,506
Thank you.

747
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:17,647
On the motion to receive and place on file, all those in favor?

748
01:00:17,687 --> 01:00:18,287
Aye.

749
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:19,208
All those opposed?

750
01:00:19,228 --> 01:00:20,828
The motion passes.

751
01:00:22,805 --> 01:00:24,686
Report on Brooks Maintenance Issue.

752
01:00:24,906 --> 01:00:26,007
Mr. Superintendent.

753
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:31,830
Okay, we're going to call on our assistant superintendent, Diane Caldwell, to deliver this report.

754
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:39,394
It was partially put together by John McLaughlin, who's covering you on camera, so if you need John, he's on the other end.

755
01:00:39,454 --> 01:00:40,295
Okay?

756
01:00:41,854 --> 01:00:46,118
Maybe I could do the cameras and John could do the microphone out here.

757
01:00:46,138 --> 01:00:50,983
I just wanted to provide you with a timeline on the Brooks maintenance issue that we had.

758
01:00:51,923 --> 01:01:02,013
On Wednesday, March 9th at 8.30, water began to come up through the floors in the student bathrooms and in the kitchen of the Brooks Elementary School.

759
01:01:02,974 --> 01:01:10,201
Mr. Kevin Andrews is the principal of the school, and he contacted me immediately, as well as John McLaughlin and the superintendent.

760
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:14,285
And we decided to call in the drain doctor to see if it would be a quick fix.

761
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:27,341
Mr. Andrews contacted Medford School Food Services after we realized that it was going to take a little more time, and we knew that we had to have lunches prepared by the food service.

762
01:01:28,061 --> 01:01:40,768
Jewel Bradley and her staff, very quickly, this was maybe at 10 o'clock, Mr. Andrews and I decided it was time to provide 300 lunches for our students at the Brooks Elementary School.

763
01:01:41,668 --> 01:01:44,510
And they were sandwiches and yogurt and other fruits.

764
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:45,907
Ms.

765
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:53,704
Kim Fowler from the Board of Health investigated the Brooks School site, reviewed the food preparation, and then recommended next steps for us.

766
01:01:55,513 --> 01:02:08,059
Mr. Andrews was very good at sending emails out to the families of the Brooks School, and he also sent a hard copy letter home just to inform our families of what was going on.

767
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,641
And overnight, the blockage was cleared.

768
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:15,063
It was determined that a large amount of paper towels were stuck in the waistline.

769
01:02:15,783 --> 01:02:21,006
The evening custodians clean the remaining water on the kitchen floor and in the first floor bathrooms.

770
01:02:21,086 --> 01:02:24,849
And I really have to congratulate the custodial staff at the Brooks School.

771
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:29,492
They work very hard, the day custodial staff as well as the evening.

772
01:02:31,272 --> 01:02:33,533
So on Thursday, March 10th, Ms.

773
01:02:33,573 --> 01:02:37,375
Fowler visited again to review what needed to be completed in the storeroom.

774
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:53,905
The principal and John McLaughlin developed a work plan that was approved by the Board of Health, and this included using plastic to block off the storeroom and kitchen office, removing wallboard and insulation, allowing it to dry, and then replacing it with wallboard and insulation.

775
01:02:54,545 --> 01:03:02,369
Mr. Andrews sent another email out to families just to notify them that the kitchen would still not be available and would remain closed.

776
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:07,752
So for the next few days, we communicated with Ms.

777
01:03:07,772 --> 01:03:15,557
Jewel Bradley, and she was able to prepare lunches for our kids, peanut butter and jelly and yogurt, as I said before.

778
01:03:17,058 --> 01:03:17,238
Ms.

779
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:20,301
Fowler returned on March 15th for another inspection.

780
01:03:20,921 --> 01:03:30,330
She determined that the unpainted wall board would need to be covered with plastic and taped to the floor, and all the surfaces needed to be re-cleaned.

781
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:33,513
At 3.30 p.m., the school was cleared for food preparation.

782
01:03:33,993 --> 01:03:43,676
And Mr. Andrews then sent an email out to the school families at 7 o'clock that evening to inform them that food preparation was good to go for the next day.

783
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:51,399
I'd like to call your attention to the attached report, which is from John McLaughlin, our Director of Buildings and Grounds.

784
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:57,401
And he could tell you a little more about the maintenance and the cleanup and the cost.

785
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:02,683
In the last week, all drains connected to our schools have been inspected and flushed.

786
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:08,326
This preventative measure should help to avoid a similar situation going forward.

787
01:04:10,687 --> 01:04:11,128
Thank you, Ms.

788
01:04:11,188 --> 01:04:11,668
Caldwell.

789
01:04:11,788 --> 01:04:12,589
Are there any questions?

790
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:14,630
Hi, Madam Mayor.

791
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:15,050
Mr. Skerry.

792
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,331
To either Ms.

793
01:04:16,391 --> 01:04:22,835
Caldwell or the superintendent, was there any investigation as to why there was a large amount of paper towels stuck in the waistline?

794
01:04:23,495 --> 01:04:26,377
This is probably a John McLaughlin question, but

795
01:04:28,238 --> 01:04:29,459
I don't know the answer to that.

796
01:04:29,479 --> 01:04:35,721
I mean, they tried to get it out with just the drain doctor, and that didn't work, so they had to call in Paulette.

797
01:04:35,861 --> 01:04:39,243
It seems like an awfully large amount of paper towels to be where they're not supposed to be.

798
01:04:39,263 --> 01:04:41,204
It was an awfully large bill for the city.

799
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:42,905
There was work being done on the street.

800
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,005
Excuse me, Mr. Scott.

801
01:04:45,266 --> 01:04:52,229
There was work being done on the street as well, so I was wondering if that had any input, but I was told no, it didn't.

802
01:04:54,473 --> 01:05:02,738
I just want to comment, if I can, that with the help of the DPW and the mayor's office, we had all the drains cleared going into every school.

803
01:05:03,218 --> 01:05:17,407
So it became a preventative kind of thing in case it was happening someplace or about to happen someplace else.

804
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,011
I can certainly do that for you, Mr. Skerry.

805
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:35,752
Thank you.

806
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:37,053
Ms.

807
01:05:37,093 --> 01:05:37,453
Krentz?

808
01:05:37,693 --> 01:05:44,718
I have a point of information that I know at the vocational school, they have some of the power dryers now in some of the bathrooms.

809
01:05:45,038 --> 01:05:51,283
So that might be a nice thing, a nice change for the future, instead of the because they were having problems with paper towels.

810
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:52,544
So yeah.

811
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:57,447
Thank you, Ms.

812
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:57,888
Caldwell.

813
01:05:57,908 --> 01:05:58,248
Thank you.

814
01:05:58,528 --> 01:06:00,349
Is there a motion to receive in place on file?

815
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:02,973
Seconded by Ms.

816
01:06:03,013 --> 01:06:03,413
Cuno.

817
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:04,294
All those in favor?

818
01:06:05,315 --> 01:06:06,076
All those opposed?

819
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:07,237
Motion passes.

820
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:11,440
We also have a few announcements that the superintendent wants to comment on.

821
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,681
Mr. Superintendent.

822
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,223
Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.

823
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:18,967
You have a paper in your folder about the field trip to Washington and the reimbursements.

824
01:06:18,987 --> 01:06:20,749
The checks are out there.

825
01:06:24,904 --> 01:06:26,184
And we'll find out if they didn't.

826
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:34,470
But right now, Pat did a great job pulling it together, and we're sitting all to ensure that everyone got their check.

827
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,711
And the total amount was $3,680.

828
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:38,412
Thank you, Pat.

829
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:39,813
That's one.

830
01:06:40,874 --> 01:06:44,436
The second thing is, is that the day on the Hill is in 2016.

831
01:06:44,476 --> 01:06:47,918
There's now a paper in your folder.

832
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:48,999
It's April 26.

833
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:51,801
If you want to go, you've got to let us know so we can make

834
01:06:52,676 --> 01:07:07,269
arrangements for you to sign up, and I want you to go to the Day on the Hill as a registered member as opposed to somebody who just walks in and has to leave, okay?

835
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:08,690
You did it yourself?

836
01:07:09,471 --> 01:07:10,332
You didn't ask permission?

837
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:11,493
I'm just kidding.

838
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:12,113
No, it's okay.

839
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:17,158
I just wanted to know what happened from the Day on the Hill.

840
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:31,264
On the day on the hill, basically it's a day for the school committee members to meet legislators, to talk about issues, and to perhaps share with other school committee members from other communities things that are of mutual concern.

841
01:07:32,505 --> 01:07:46,408
You know, Ann Marie is former president of NASC, Paul Wetzel has been a member of the executive board for a period of time, and they can certainly share ideas with you as to how to make that day effective if you want to come.

842
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:46,608
Okay?

843
01:07:53,011 --> 01:08:11,515
So Then we've got something on the Mathematics middle school mathematics and pathways to high school mathematics on Thursday April 14th from 7 to 8 p.m.

844
01:08:11,915 --> 01:08:19,537
The science lecture hall we're inviting up Middle high school students up to see things and to talk about

845
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:33,073
It's scheduled for the middle school.

846
01:08:33,674 --> 01:08:37,817
So middle school students can see our science labs and see what's going on.

847
01:08:37,917 --> 01:08:38,377
It's April 14th.

848
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:56,773
It's listed here, it's 7 to 8 p.m.

849
01:08:57,253 --> 01:08:58,834
Thursday, April 14th.

850
01:08:58,854 --> 01:09:00,615
Okay, so that's that.

851
01:09:01,015 --> 01:09:07,999
And you also have in your packet a copy of the latest teacher's contract that's been made, so in case you need a copy of that.

852
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,280
We can't get these on the city side.

853
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:09,420
What?

854
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,142
I said we can't get these on the city side.

855
01:09:13,162 --> 01:09:14,663
It's quite nice.

856
01:09:18,485 --> 01:09:19,486
Name was spelled incorrectly?

857
01:09:20,731 --> 01:09:22,912
It must be the Teachers Association did this.

858
01:09:22,973 --> 01:09:23,993
Blame the Teachers Association.

859
01:09:24,654 --> 01:09:25,234
Where's Shelby?

860
01:09:27,756 --> 01:09:30,057
All right, so we'll try and correct it.

861
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:30,718
Mr. Benedetto.

862
01:09:31,218 --> 01:09:39,964
I also wanted to announce that the Method Against Addiction annual, second annual candlelight vigil is April 17th.

863
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:45,468
And just to keep people up to date what's going on within the city.

864
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:51,213
We have a meeting next week and the week after.

865
01:09:51,494 --> 01:09:53,175
So we have a number of things coming to you.

866
01:09:54,116 --> 01:09:56,639
And we'll be working on that over the next few days.

867
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:02,625
So we've got a busy schedule over the next two weeks for the holiday break.

868
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:05,308
And we're giving you stuff as well.

869
01:10:05,649 --> 01:10:08,792
Mayor Byrd, last item on the agenda is negotiation.

870
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:11,450
Okay, so that's a subcommittee.

871
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:12,231
Well, it's up to you.

872
01:10:12,271 --> 01:10:13,631
Let me know and we'll schedule it.

873
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:41,157
So we'll schedule it whenever you schedule the last one.

874
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:46,225
Whatever you want to schedule, we'll schedule it.

875
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:47,848
I'll talk to you.

876
01:10:53,506 --> 01:10:53,786
Ms.

877
01:10:53,806 --> 01:10:54,246
Cuno.

878
01:10:54,426 --> 01:11:13,697
I just want to recognize a couple of things that happened that we haven't had the opportunity to speak about, but I did receive a few emails today stating that parents had gone up to the high school and they were very impressed with the fact that they had to buzz themselves in and that they needed to get guest passes to go where they needed to go.

879
01:11:13,777 --> 01:11:17,379
So they were very pleased and the feedback on that has been very positive.

880
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:19,880
The other thing I just want to throw in is,

881
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:26,464
We sit here this evening and we listen to what's happening as far as these projects that are coming.

882
01:11:27,285 --> 01:11:32,688
And you go outside of the district and then you see really how lucky we are.

883
01:11:33,408 --> 01:11:37,251
I've been on the college tour right now with my twins.

884
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:49,486
And we just went to a smaller college, but it was really interesting seeing the reaction of students when the students that are there are saying that they're graduating in about a month and a half.

885
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:53,351
And they're so excited because they're going to be building a new project.

886
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:56,393
And that building is going to be about $5 million or $6 million.

887
01:11:56,693 --> 01:12:00,376
And it happened to be adjacent to one of their science buildings.

888
01:12:00,836 --> 01:12:04,698
So I kindly sat there proudly and said, you know, we're from Medved.

889
01:12:05,539 --> 01:12:07,400
And we just built one for $17 million.

890
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:18,668
So it just opens up your eyes of what we have, where we're going, and how fortunate we are on many things that sometimes we really don't see the big picture.

891
01:12:19,832 --> 01:12:20,232
Very good.

892
01:12:20,613 --> 01:12:22,515
There's a motion to go into executive session.

893
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:24,256
Moved by Mr. Scarry, seconded by Ms.

894
01:12:24,276 --> 01:12:24,837
Van de Kloot.

895
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:26,118
Roll call, please.

896
01:12:32,024 --> 01:12:33,806
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

897
01:12:33,826 --> 01:12:35,287
We are entering executive session.

898
01:12:35,808 --> 01:12:37,770
We may possibly come back out to the floor.
