    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=193.829s">This</a>  award is going to be used in our mission to develop a quality foundation that is great in the psychological quality of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=203.941s">is</a>  mass school-based leaders who contributed to the educational success by addressing their nutritional needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=212.007s">So</a>  more than 80% of the children at the Columbus Elementary School participated in a breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=221.454s">So</a>  these successful breakfast programs require the investment and the collaboration of a group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=227.699s">It</a>  is the secretary, <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=229.929s">the</a>  administrators, the teachers, the school cafeteria workers, and the school nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=236.092s">So</a>  it was a team effort done by everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=239.914s">The</a>  following members of the Columbus Elementary team will be going to an award ceremony on May 5th at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=248.338s">And</a>  the people that will be attending <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=251.399s">are</a>  Nancy Sherman Hudson, the assistant principal, Rory Douglas, who is head of the cafeteria at the Columbus Elementary School, and Karen Roberto, who is the Columbus School nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=263.121s">Medford</a>  State representatives Paul Donato, Christine Barber, and Sean Garberlee, and State Senator Patricia Jalen will also be in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=272.583s">So</a>  we're very proud of the Columbus Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=275.344s">This</a>  is an unrestricted $500 that they get to spend as they wish. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=281.462s">have</a>  to take any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=283.204s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=283.404s">Cuno?</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=295.178s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=295.859s">I</a>  just want to comment that this just shows what teamwork does in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=302.044s">I'm</a>  so happy to hear that everybody works together to make this such a great success. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=308.169s">Our</a>  children really, some children really, the only place they get food in the morning is at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=313.334s">Either</a>  they're too quickly out the door or some families might not have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=317.517s">So</a>  these things really do matter to everyday life of our children.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=321.167s">And</a>  as we all know, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so it's great that our kids get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=326.589s">The</a>  McGlynn Elementary School also has a breakfast program, and the Roberts School now qualifies for a breakfast program.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=332.291s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=333.472s">I</a>  hope someday all our schools can get breakfast for us, too.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=337.713s">Well,</a>  we do serve breakfast, but this is Universal Free Breakfast, so it's a great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=342.512s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=343.092s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=343.713s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive the report? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=345.775s">Motion</a>  to receive the report and seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=348.357s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=349.097s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=350.498s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=351.199s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=353.42s">Report</a>  on Park MCAS 2016 schedule and related matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=357.443s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=358.985s">Members</a>  of the committee, we're in the middle of MCAS season. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=361.687s">Park</a>  season is on the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=363.648s">And</a>  there are a number of issues associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=365.45s">Our</a>  director of curriculum, Bernadette Riccardelli, will be giving you this report and informing you how things are going.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=373.582s">Good</a>  evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Bellson, and members of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=379.244s">So</a>  I'm here tonight to give you some information on the standardized testing schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=385.126s">So</a>  in your report, the first page is a cover page, and then beyond that, the next six pages, front and back, is the statewide testing schedule put out by the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=396.709s">It</a>  was put out on January 26th, so it is the most current schedule that is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=402.281s">So</a>  it identifies PARCC testing dates as well as MCAS testing dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=409.573s">Following</a>  that publication from the Department of Education, so on the following page, where it says 2016 Park MCAS testing dates, that's for our district, for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=422.442s">So</a>  what I've done is I've gotten the information from each one of the principals, and I've put it in a succinct form so that you can see the testing dates for each one of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=432.108s">On</a>  that first page, we have the Brooks, McGlynn, Columbus, and Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=438.752s">For</a>  English Language Arts and Mathematics, PARC will be taken and for Science, MCAS will be taken for those dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=448.176s">You</a>  will see that there are also dates in several cases for makeup testing and in some cases the makeup testing dates are still TBD to be determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=460.88s">On</a>  the next page, we have the schedule for the middle schools and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=465.281s">And</a>  as you probably know, because I think it was mentioned before, the Andrews Middle School is the only school in the district that is going to do computer-based testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=474.083s">The</a>  McGlynn Middle School is doing paper-based testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=477.204s">Again,</a>  both schools are administering the PARC for English Language Arts and Mathematics and MCAS for Science. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=487.798s">Medford</a>  High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, and the Curtis Tufts School are all administering MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=494.422s">Last</a>  week, we had the English Language Arts test that took place on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=503.929s">In</a>  May, we have mathematics, and in June, we have science. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=507.091s">And</a>  the makeup test dates for that assessment at the high school level are to be determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=516.615s">Moving</a>  on to the second part of my report, which has to do with the Park MCAS opt-out option, if you will, or information. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=528.523s">Much</a>  of this report comes directly from the Department of Education, from Commissioner Chester. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=535.628s">So</a>  in his publication, in the commissioner's update that he puts out, he has identified state law as the basis <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=545.026s">for</a>  saying that participation in standardized testing is mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=552.53s">The</a>  statute, he writes, does not contain an opt-out provision for parents to remove their children from participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=559.715s">So</a>  he's citing Mass General Law's Chapter 69, Section 11 for that statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=567.639s">And</a>  he references the landmark 1993 Massachusetts Education Reform Act as the basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=575.97s">As</a>  you know and as I've mentioned, we have selected PARCC for 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=582.292s">So</a>  again, grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are administering PARCC for English Language Arts, Arts and Mathematics, and Science for MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=594.656s">So</a>  we had that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=596.437s">We</a>  are held harmless for our participation in PARCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=601.698s">So</a>  I'm going to go down to the next part of the report where, and I'm going to read this verbatim because it comes directly, again, from the commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=609.443s">So</a>  in his guidance, he has written the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=612.824s">In</a>  some instances, a student may refuse to take a test either of his or own volition or at the direction of a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=620.905s">In</a>  these cases, the Department of Ed, or I should say the Board of Education, asks principals to encourage parents to rethink their refusal and remind them that the assessments are a valuable gauge of their students' and schools' progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=635.094s">We</a>  ask principals and test proctors to handle refusals with sensitivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=640.581s">Students</a>  should not be pressured to take the test, nor should they be punished for not taking the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=648.243s">They</a>  may sit quietly and read in the testing room, but if they are distracting others in the class who are taking the test, it would be appropriate for them to move to another location within the school with adult supervision. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=661.571s">There</a>  is no requirement to provide formal or informal instruction to these students during the test period. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=667.294s">Having</a>  them do work or read a book is sufficient, provided that the material is separate from the content being assessed on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=677.788s">So</a>  he issued this guidance in response to a number of inquiries about whether or not opting out of mandated state assessment was required. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=689.756s">He</a>  then identifies why student participation in these tests is essential, as you can see in your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=696.32s">The</a>  results of these assessments provide valuable feedback to districts, to administrators, and to students and parents about <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=706.863s">about</a>  their achievement or lack thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=712.402s">They</a>  write, he writes, legislators and taxpayers expect an objective assessment of student and school performance in return for very significant investment of public funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=721.729s">So</a>  in other words, the public wants to know how our students are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=726.252s">We</a>  are concerned about the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=727.933s">A</a>  low participation rate on the statewide assessments can adversely affect a district's performance rating in the state and federal accountability system. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=737.48s">So</a>  we are concerned that if our accountability, excuse me, if our attendance <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=742.74s">participation</a>  rate is low, it could affect our accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=747.524s">We</a>  don't anticipate that the high school will be a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=750.546s">They</a>  are taking MCAS, but in the event that a parent were to opt out of the MCAS test for a grade 10 student, they would have a very difficult time earning a competency determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=764.298s">Towards</a>  the end of the report, I reiterate that concern or that effect on accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=771.895s">So</a>  it is important to keep in mind it is a mandated test backed up by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=779.082s">However,</a>  as I have identified for you, the Commissioner of Education is cognizant of parent concerns and that's why he has issued the guidance that I presented to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=788.972s">I'd</a>  be happy to take any questions at this time.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=793.699s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=794.92s">Um,</a>  through you to the superintendent, when we voted for the park, one of our, one of my colleagues had mentioned that we voted for our schools to take pen and pencil. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=805.43s">Is</a>  the Andrews taking it electronically and do we need to revote if that's the case?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=810.595s">The</a>  Andrews opted to take it on the computer because they felt they had the capacity to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=816.827s">We</a>  allowed it because it would give us an opportunity to see how it would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=820.73s">Paul</a>  DeLave is very good with computers and technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=824.914s">We</a>  felt that it would give us a chance to explore the use of computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=829.798s">I</a>  believe we mentioned it to you at one point.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=834.428s">I</a>  think that we voted for a pen-and-pen paper, so I think we might have to re-vote in order for that to happen.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=840.053s">I</a>  think we voted in general to do that, and I think we did tell you that the answer was, but if we didn't, we can always vote.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=849.372s">I</a>  think we should.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=850.052s">But</a>  I think it's a good idea to have at least one school try it so we can understand.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=853.534s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=854.034s">And</a>  if we have a principal with that expertise and willing to take that on, and then we can determine what we need as a school department to move forward to have all of our tests done this way, I think it's a really good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=869.622s">But</a>  I just want to make sure that we follow the procedures and the will of the school committee as directed is carried out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=877.826s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=879.787s">So</a>  I would like to make a motion at this time to allow the Iandros School to take the park test using computers.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=888.612s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=888.812s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=890.133s">Well,</a>  point of information, I believe I was the colleague that was discussing it because I was part of the committee at the ASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=897.617s">The</a>  discussion was the frustration of schools taking the test at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=902.2s">that</a>  were being told to take it via computer when they didn't have the facilities or the capability of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=908.93s">I</a>  believe the discussion here was to allow our schools, if they have the capability of <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=916.238s">do</a>  it online, then they should do it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=918.981s">And</a>  I really don't think that there's a need of a motion because it's the principal who actually has requested that he does want to do this online, because they are able to do it with the computer systems that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=929.873s">The</a>  frustration was the opposite side of DESC just selecting or <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=934.718s">I</a>  don't know if that's a good way to put it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=955.512s">So</a>  thank you, Ann Marie, for that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=958.434s">That</a>  makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=959.475s">So</a>  technically, you know, I don't necessarily think we have to vote on it, but if my colleague wants to vote on it, there's no reason not to just vote on it and take it off, get it off our deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=969.523s">So</a>  I'll second her motion so we vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=972.725s">On</a>  the motion that the Andrews School be allowed to take the park exam this spring now on the computer as opposed to pen and paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=979.551s">As</a>  planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=981.912s">On</a>  the motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=984.069s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=985.209s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=985.729s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=986.39s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=988.37s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor to receive this report and place it on file?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=992.431s">I</a>  had a question.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=993.271s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=993.411s">Vandeply.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=994.611s">So</a>  at this point, our principals have all been informed about how they should respond to a parent who requests that their child should not take the test.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1005.83s">So</a>  yes, at our last full administrative meeting, guidance was provided with the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1012.257s">I</a>  would defer to the language of the commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1015.18s">It's</a>  pretty straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1017.001s">It's</a>  public. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1017.682s">It's</a>  on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1020.019s">Again,</a>  our position is it's, we think it's an important test to take.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1026.102s">Bernadette,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1027.462s">I</a>  just, I guess, I just want to make sure that if a family does come forward and not want their child to take the test, that it's handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1034.485s">And</a>  I did appreciate the line, you know, with sensitivity, so that neither the parent or the child is made to feel guilty about their choice not to take the test.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1044.889s">So</a>  I believe this exact text was presented to the administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1052.172s">I'd</a>  be happy to send it to them again.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1053.632s">Do</a>  parents need to put it in writing that they don't want their child to take the test?</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1061.175s">Actually,</a>  they should put it in writing, and the commissioner would like principals to keep track of any request to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1074.981s">So</a>  again, there is concern that it could affect the accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1079.104s">But</a>  in one correspondence from the commissioner, he said document it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1084.727s">So</a>  I'm not sure if there is a great amount, if that would affect any decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1091.532s">But</a>  parents should submit a letter to the principal stating an opt-out preference if that's what they want.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1102.239s">OK,</a>  we don't have a form that they sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1107.041s">So</a>  I understand how important it is and we encourage parents to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1111.985s">I</a>  also understand all the arguments of the opt-out people. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1116.468s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that students and that it is handled appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1121.332s">And</a>  I would also like this committee to receive <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1125.775s">after</a>  the testing cycle is done, obviously not names, but simply numbers at each school, if there are opt-outs at the schools, if we could receive a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1138.581s">And</a>  at grade levels, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1142.983s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1146.068s">On</a>  the motion as amended to receive a report subsequent to test taking of those, the numbers that opt out versus take. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1152.533s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1153.534s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1154.215s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1154.855s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1155.916s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1158.592s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1160.233s">It's</a>  about items that we request. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1163.076s">Can</a>  I make a motion at this point to put that on our agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1168.079s">Requested</a>  items and any items that are tabled so that way they're a list of things every week and that way when someone requests something it's on the list and as we receive those documents it would come off the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1182.851s">It's</a>  much easier to track.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1185.423s">On</a>  the motion to keep track of papers that are pending as well as papers that have been tabled, it would become part of the committee's meeting agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1194.291s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1195.152s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1195.912s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1196.933s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1199.776s">There's</a>  a recommendation to approve vocational school MSBA statement of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1204.019s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1204.94s">Madam</a>  Mayor and members of the committee, this is the season where the Massachusetts School Building Authority <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1213.757s">asks</a>  us to submit a statement of interest if we're contemplating possibly submitting a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1219.08s">And</a>  the project we're contemplating submitting deals with the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1223.223s">Our</a>  director of the vocational school, Dr. Heidi Riccio, is here, and I'm going to ask her to come up and talk about the SOI that we want to submit with your approval.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1232.849s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1233.029s">Riccio.</a>  <a

Technical High School is seeking school committee approval to submit a statement of interest to the Massachusetts Building Association for the renovation of existing space and the increase of lab space for the STEM-related fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1254.511s">Medford</a>  Public Schools opened the vocational school in 1970 after a major build that included the high school being on the same complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1263.867s">Throughout</a>  the years, MVTHS has added new programs based on workforce demands. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1269.848s">However,</a>  there was not a strategic plan created to develop and grow programs or logistically place programs with like clusters. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1277.97s">MVTHS</a>  intends to implement a strategic plan that would reorganize the vocational campus to embrace the need to move programs in cluster or academy type models. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1289.915s">The</a>  following are the potential academies. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1293.237s">The</a>  Construction Academy would house carpentry, construction and craft labors, electrical, and HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1301.622s">The</a>  Design and Visual Academy would include graphic communications, design and visual communications, media technology, which is also often known as TV production, computer programming, and web development. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1318.012s">In</a>  the Human Services Academy, it would house Health Assisting, Early Education and Childhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1324.514s">In</a>  the Service Academy, it would house Business Technology, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Hospitality and Marketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1333.816s">And</a>  the STEM Academy would include Biotechnology, Environmental Science, Robotics, Engineering, Metal Fabrication and Advanced Manufacturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1345.595s">MVTHS</a>  is planning to seek funding under priority number seven of the MSBA priorities, which states replacement of or addition to obsolete buildings in order to provide a full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements. <a

following reasons are in order to seek funding under priority number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1377.347s">Number</a>  one, technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1380.053s">As</a>  the workforce has changed into the technological age within all technical areas, MVTHS must be able to provide access to its students and the community to sound technology advances. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1392.962s">Additionally,</a>  appropriate security of the equipment and updated shutoffs are needed to ensure the safe

href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1406.278s">As</a>  part of this renovation and add-on space comes equipment that meets the demands of a changing workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1413.121s">While</a>  the district committee has been generous in its support of programs and the school has done a fabulous job of accessing grant funding and other alternative funding sources, there is a significant need to replace existing equipment that is obsolete with equipment that is currently used in industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1431.422s">Being</a>  a vocational high school in Massachusetts, it is essential to meet the needs of the existing and future workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1438.626s">To</a>  do this, MVTHS is seeking MSBA funding to add equipment that is part of each program and is consistent with other vocational schools across the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1449.912s">ADA</a>  compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1451.873s">Accessibility</a>  to the building is in need of enhancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1455.335s">Currently,</a>  the door handles, locks, and some areas of building access are not ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1461.115s">Additionally,</a>  hallway doors are in need of replacement, and doors leading into and through vocational programs need appropriate access points. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1469.381s">Flooring</a>  in the vocational programs are mixed, as some have tile, which is in disrepair, and others have concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1476.687s">The</a>  intention is to replace the floors to meet current standards, and put appropriate flooring in vocational programs that meet industry needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1485.113s">An</a>  example of this would be epoxy flooring in the auto technology program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1490.832s">Additional</a>  space, MBTHS would like to add on to the existing third floor science lab space above the vocational main entrance to increase vocational offerings to both vocational and high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1506.797s">Currently,</a>  two programs are situated in one lab space. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1510.819s">As</a>  enrollment grows, the need for additional space is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1515.604s">Adding</a>  to the third floor space would offer new labs and classrooms for biotechnology, environmental science, robotics and engineering, and give the option to add other STEM-related programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1529.594s">Existing</a>  space reorganization. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1532.537s">When</a>  programs were added to MVTHS, Medford Public Schools considered open space that was available and not necessarily what was in the best interest of the program or service to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1544.0s">One</a>  example of this was the Construction and Craft Laborers Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1548.162s">This</a>  program was situated above academic classrooms, yet they were using heavy equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1553.963s">The</a>  school plans to reorganize space so that it is logical and makes sense for all programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1560.315s">MSBA</a>  funding would provide the opportunity to incorporate deeper collaboration with the high school, expand our adult education offerings, and make certain programs like cosmetology, culinary arts, hospitality, and marketing accessible to the general public with separate entrance space. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1581.751s">That</a>  is actually the first part of our MSBA.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1586.074s">So</a>  we're going to save the second part on the studio until the next report.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1589.537s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1590.398s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1592.179s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1592.46s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1596.063s">First</a>  and foremost, let me just say how amazed and thrilled I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1601.948s">This</a>  is great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1605.751s">The</a>  other things I do want to ask is, I know when we did the science labs in the science building, that particular grant was for that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1615.279s">However,</a>  if there was anything that <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1618.14s">overlapped</a>  or touched that building, it also was refurnished or redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1625.365s">I</a>  remember the lights in the office of the high school because the ceiling of the high school office was actually the floor that abutted the science buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1637.433s">was</a>  redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1638.453s">So</a>  in this particular project, is it like that too? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1641.214s">Is</a>  there anything above the other parts of a room that maybe isn't technically under the vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1648.995s">Will</a>  they get redone?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1652.916s">The</a>  first part is the intent to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1655.277s">So</a>  for us, it's to seek that intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1657.617s">And</a>  then we would go into that phase of the actual space and what we would be looking at in altering or changing.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1667.401s">And</a>  when you're looking into this, are we going to make sure that everything matches? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1674.367s">So</a>  since we have the science labs done, I know we're going to call them the new science labs probably for 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1680.412s">But</a>  are we going to match that with the new renovations at the vocational side? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1686.857s">So</a>  everything starts looking coincidentally the same.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1689.659s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1690.24s">I</a>  think if you've walked down the building of the vocational school in the past couple of years, I do like matching. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1697.606s">Furniture</a>  and matching colors and we actually have a color scheme that is now specific to the school, which is nice because now you're not looking at a variety of different colors that may not be complementary to the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1714.688s">However,</a>  an example of that is when we redid the health assisting lab, that door is actually the same door, and the keys are keyed the same as the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1726.08s">So</a>  yes, the doors would look the same, the same color grain, et cetera, and the color schemes would be similar.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1732.085s">Okay,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1733.367s">And</a>  the other thing, I guess, because we are going to be touching <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1738.357s">The</a>  cable station. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1740.139s">How</a>  would that work out while it's under renovation? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1742.682s">That</a>  would be the next topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1743.723s">We're</a>  doing it in the next section? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1745.105s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1746.126s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1747.667s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1748.008s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1748.188s">Vander</a>  Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1749.309s">So,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1750.15s">Rich</a>  here, once again, you have brought us to the point where you have just pushed us forward and now have us... <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1757.738s">headed</a>  into a direction for the future of our students and the well-being of them and what we offer in Medford or the possibilities of what we offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1768.302s">Obviously,</a>  this is just the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1770.343s">First,</a>  a technical question. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1772.063s">When</a>  do you have to file this statement of interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1776.945s">What's</a>  the first deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1778.986s">April</a>  10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1781.347s">And</a>  could you need our approval on saying, yes, we're interested in moving forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1787.189s">There</a>  is no, obviously, no dollar amount or anything at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1791.534s">It's</a>  just simply we're interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1795.438s">And</a>  what is the next step?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1800.589s">complete</a>  the letter of intent, the next step would for the MSBA to actually look at that letter of intent and look at the needs of the school and the why we are seeking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1812.435s">And</a>  the vote, I believe, is not until 2017 for us to then move forward into the next phase.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1819.318s">Does</a>  this need to go before the city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1821.779s">Eventually.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1822.599s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1823.4s">Eventually,</a>  but not before the letter of intent on April 10th.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1828.892s">I</a>  believe that we will, um, I'm going to let, I'm going to defer because I haven't been through this before in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1834.975s">So</a>  the way it works is, is that the statement of interest goes in state, you know, to this, to the state, they determine whether or not it's even eligible, whether they would be willing to entertain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1845.982s">We</a>  then, if we get to the next round, we'll start to put some other plans together and little by little, it'll move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1852.265s">If</a>  we get invited to submit some design, then we have to go to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1857.165s">to</a>  the City Council for money for design. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1860.126s">And</a>  then if we get beyond design and they accept that, then we would go to construction documents.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1865.487s">But</a>  right now, simply for tonight and to be able to move on, it's just, we can vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1871.028s">And</a>  so I make a recommendation, a motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1874.168s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for approval by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1877.069s">Van</a>  der Kloot, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1878.369s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1878.949s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1880.489s">I</a>  just want to thank you for all your hard work in taking <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1884.768s">us</a>  to these great opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1886.852s">I</a>  know you've brought in a huge amount of grant funds already for our vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1894.144s">I</a>  appreciate the work of yourself and your staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1897.927s">The</a>  school looks great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1898.988s">I</a>  was up there recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1900.85s">All</a>  the colors do look great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1902.892s">And</a>  I hope that someone pays attention and sees our need and comes and really gives us money to help us build this, because this is a dream come true. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1913.481s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1914.261s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1917.248s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1918.349s">I</a>  also want to just make note that our staff member Richard Cormier did email all of us telling us how supportive he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1926.215s">He</a>  unfortunately couldn't be here, but I just want to make note that he's excited and supports this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1932.199s">The</a>  question I was hoping maybe by the next school committee is that I know vocational schools are becoming more popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1940.365s">I</a>  hope that out of my six, half will be at the vocational school to have a <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1945.368s">a</a>  trade after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1946.989s">Is</a>  it possible to have a number of students in each program in what the capacity is? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1953.772s">So</a>  if you have 10 in business technology, but what's the capacity if you've got a full house?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1959.7s">So</a>  the Department of Ed comes out with a recommendation per square footage and per program, and I can email that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1966.604s">It's</a>  pretty black and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1969.305s">I</a>  would want all six of your children actually at the vocational school, because as you can see by the programs, they are college and career ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1978.15s">And</a>  I thank Rich Cormier. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1980.911s">I</a>  also have a culinary arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1982.332s">I</a>  don't know if you saw her in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1984.513s">yesterday,</a>  but it was in the paper as well as in the Boston paper, but the Culinary Arts Program has been very helpful out in the community, and I can't, any of these grants were all co-written by the experts that are in the field, so I just have fairly good grammar, but really they're the ones that are giving me the content for the grant, so I have to thank all of the teachers and staff, because they've also renovated all of the space up until now, so everything you see was done by the staff and our students.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2015.587s">Good,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2016.768s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2018.95s">Roll</a>  call vote, please, Mr. Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2021.813s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2025.316s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2026.898s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2027.859s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2028.179s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2029.76s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2031.142s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2031.502s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2031.962s">We</a>  await the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2034.345s">Report</a>  on the construction status of the multimedia community access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2037.828s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2038.849s">Madam</a>  Mayor and members of the committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2041.311s">We've</a>  been working on this project for a little while now in conjunction with City Hall, Louise Miller, Scott Payette from the architectural firm, and Dr. Riccio and members of our media and technology staff to put together various aspects of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2058.166s">We're</a>  about to begin <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2059.887s">some</a>  early construction with abatement process during the school vacation, so that we can get things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2065.772s">You</a>  see from the charts up there, we have a timeline that we hope to finish construction sometime by the end of the summer, and then begin the process of populating the place and getting things operational sometime in early October. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2079.702s">So</a>  we're going to turn it over to Dr. Riccio again to tell you a little bit about how that's going to proceed, so that you get an idea of where we are with the multimedia, <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2088.529s">and</a>  with the Access Channel.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2091.212s">Thank</a>  you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2091.853s">I</a>  will say that when we did start this process, we went out to at least five different schools across the Commonwealth to look at what their TV studio looked like, and many of them did have the public education and government component within those. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2108.332s">programs</a>  and that kind of jump started our thought process on location and what they learned from having it on site at a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2118.959s">So</a>  we did get some very helpful information that started two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2123.342s">Over</a>  the course of the last two years, we worked with the former mayor as well as the new mayor, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2129.106s">school</a>  department and other members of the community to really look at what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2134.208s">We</a>  knew that we wanted to start a Chapter 74 vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2139.831s">The</a>  actual certification is called radio and TV production or broadcasting, but we wanted to incorporate media technology as well into it, knowing that this is really a digital world. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2151.576s">and</a>  how we could do as many crossovers within the curricular as we could with other programs, including design and visual. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2158.181s">So</a>  as you saw in my last report, looking at that whole entire academy model, the TV studio would encompass that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2165.906s">So</a>  the report on the TV studio is that MVTHS is excited to report that construction will begin on the new access television studio in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2176.22s">During</a>  April's school vacation, the studio will receive abatement of asbestos. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2181.583s">Timing</a>  was determined for April break as to minimize the disruption in programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2186.706s">Plans</a>  are in the final stages of development, as you can see in your packet, as well as on the storyboards. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2192.529s">And</a>  the bulk of the work will be done during the summer months, with the studio scheduled to open in September of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2200.412s">In</a>  2014, MVTHS applied for program approval through the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Chapter 74 process. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2210.665s">This</a>  approval was put on hold until there was progress with the TV studio renovation due to classroom space. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2217.314s">While</a>  the high school currently has strong media courses, the intention is to work collaboratively with them to increase availability of courses and offer students a program where students can get certified in various software platforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2231.768s">MVTHS</a>  will also be working closely with the local Access TV to bring educational programs to the community when it is fully operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2240.75s">The</a>  current plan is to have day access for students and evening access for local access, so there is no scheduling conflicts. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2249.574s">Since</a>  the renovation project has a timeline for completion of September of 2016, MVTHS has posted for a teacher position that is dual licensed in TV production, but also design and visual communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2264.845s">We</a>  will be having an advisory board meeting for this program on April 26th in conjunction with the annual spring advisory meeting for other programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2274.49s">The</a>  intent of this meeting is to receive final guidance as we move toward this program approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2280.76s">Once</a>  the licensed teacher is hired and the studio is near completion, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will be scheduled to come in for a site inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2290.604s">It</a>  is during this site inspection that the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education reviews the facility, curriculum, and instruction in support of the community for the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2303.088s">And</a>  as you can, I think you have it all in your packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2306.27s">It's</a>  a color. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2308.945s">duplicate</a>  of what these storyboards state and we can certainly review those if you would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2316.068s">So</a>  the first section is the timeline, as you can see in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2320.531s">We</a>  are scheduling the construction and the first phase would be the asbestos. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2327.693s">And</a>  we chose to do this during April vacation when students are out of the building, but we will be completely containing that area so there is no access to that area while we are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2340.377s">We</a>  will then move into, obviously I can't speak for the whole RFP of contractors because that's all done through the City Hall and Louise Miller's office, but once that is complete, the idea is to begin construction since we do have the final phase drawings in the summer of 2016 with completion of September of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2359.788s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2359.848s">Cugno?</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2368.267s">Again,</a>  this is wonderful news. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2371.91s">I</a>  know before we had discussed it, it was going to be open to both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2376.954s">I</a>  just want to make sure that both the high school side and the vocational students have the opportunity to work in this studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2383.719s">So</a>  that's one that I want to confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2385.741s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2387.722s">And</a>  the other thing is that I know that it's also open to our public. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2392.005s">And</a>  in the lieu of it being renovated, is there another place where anybody could go to use any of the equipment per se? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2399.47s">Maybe</a>  not in the whole realm of the spectacular way that we're going to be doing it, but at least some place where our students and maybe even the public could go and do something.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2410.573s">So</a>  I'm going to defer, because where I'm the director of the vocational school, my primary focus is to start programs within the school setting, so the educational component of it, and not necessarily the government or public access.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2426.186s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2427.067s">So</a>  through the mayor to the superintendent, yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2430.99s">What</a>  was your question again, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2432.771s">It</a>  was just basically, is there any place that anyone could go to while this is under renovation so they could do it?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2438.653s">There's</a>  no equipment set up right now, so it will be upon the opening, which we're projecting October.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2444.075s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2447.476s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2448.577s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2450.077s">Do</a>  we have any cost estimates of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2454.988s">through</a>  you, Madam Mayor, to the superintendent, what the estimated cost of all of this is gonna be and how we're funding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2465.737s">I</a>  just want it to be clear and out there so all questions are answered.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2471.027s">We</a>  have quite a bit of funding in our community access account, and that's what we would be using to build out this, because that is the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2478.11s">That's</a>  what I assumed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2479.051s">I</a>  just didn't.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2479.611s">So</a>  there's no cost to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2481.792s">So</a>  that way, it's on record that this isn't coming out of the school-specific budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2488.295s">It's</a>  a program that's going to generate education and value to both our school and to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2497.965s">And</a>  I think it's a great program for our students and a great educational value because there are a lot of jobs that we can send people out and a lot of students will study this forward in college as well as use it as a technical skill if they choose not to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2515.123s">So</a>  I think it's a great opportunity for both the school district as well as the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2522.144s">I</a>  know at some point it's not gonna be just the school committee that decides on all of this and we're gonna have to work either with the city council or bring it forward to them after we do our share. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2535.847s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2537.667s">The</a>  contract lies with the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2539.868s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2541.248s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2541.608s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2544.416s">Are</a>  there any other questions from the members? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2547.138s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2547.458s">Biandiclu?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2548.099s">I'll</a>  hold mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2549.28s">Excuse</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2549.76s">I'll</a>  hold it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2550.421s">You'll</a>  hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2552.502s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2552.983s">Riccio.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2553.163s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2553.944s">I</a>  believe there's a citizen that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2561.189s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2562.77s">Yes,</a>  Your Honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2564.332s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2566.073s">I</a>  want to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2566.794s">Riccio</a>  for her presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2569.553s">As</a>  many know that I've been fighting for this, and I've spoken to the school committee for many years, I'm a little shocked that it's going to take until September or October. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2577.899s">We</a>  need access TV now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2580.041s">We</a>  have students playing sports that are just not going taped, not going preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2585.906s">There's</a>  many, many reasons why we need public access television in the city, and I propose that we have a satellite office. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2593.1s">Very</a>  simple, we get a van, very small van. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2596.041s">We</a>  work with the library and the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2599.162s">We</a>  can get $7,000 cameras, very inexpensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2602.123s">They</a>  run over the cellular lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2604.624s">So</a>  I've been at the mass access conference and I met with many dealers there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2610.366s">They</a>  have this equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2611.606s">We</a>  could be up and running immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2613.867s">We</a>  could have a city-operated station. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2615.808s">We</a>  could have a privately-operated station, a nonprofit as we had before, only one that runs correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2621.789s">I</a>  know that the mayor is on board with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2624.61s">I</a>  think we really owe it to the public to expedite this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2627.931s">Now,</a>  a van with these cameras, these beautiful new cameras, would fit perfectly with what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2633.732s">So</a>  we're not altering the plan at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2635.393s">We're</a>  just adding to it, having a small van. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2638.074s">I</a>  estimate we need about $60,000, $70,000 for two or three of these $7,000 cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2643.215s">Maybe</a>  put some computers at the library, and I did speak to Barbara Kerr about this, and I said it would be very easy because you can help renovate the library with some of the access monies we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2656.026s">Have</a>  two or three computers here so the kids can edit, but they can tape from the van. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2661.791s">I</a>  just asked this honorable school committee to consider it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2666.263s">It's</a>  important. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2667.464s">We</a>  would have access right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2668.986s">We</a>  would work with the Chevalier, the library, and then it would fit so nicely. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2673.05s">It's</a>  perfect synergy with the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2675.272s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2676.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2676.974s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2677.334s">Zantaclou.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2679.321s">No,</a>  I just wanted to express my thanks to Heidi once again for bringing forth our report. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2685.646s">I</a>  think that the proposal from Mr. Biglioni sort of almost goes outside of the school committee purview at this time, because right now our project and our sites are really looking forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2699.358s">what</a>  we're doing at the school and the educational benefits to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2703.381s">And</a>  I don't want to throw something together even if it has merit that we're not really quite ready to do at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2714.13s">know</a>  how quickly the rest of the school year will go. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2717.611s">And</a>  while I know it's been very, very frustrating for you and many in the community who are looking forward to a broader access TV, I think that, you know, I'm really putting, I want to put my eggs in this basket right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2734.777s">Again,</a>  I don't know because there's a lot of things I simply don't know about the proposal, how much a van would cost, who would drive the van, all of those sorts of issues, and I think that goes actually beyond us right at the moment.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2747.782s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2748.742s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for approval, receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2752.464s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2753.444s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2754.064s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2755.325s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2758.09s">Report</a>  on the construction status, I'm sorry, report on new opiate bill House 4056 and Medford implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2764.375s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2765.596s">Madam</a>  Mayor and members of the committee, I passed out this evening some additional documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2770.879s">One</a>  is from the legal office of the MASS, along with the Detroit LLP, Leslie Carey being the particular writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2780.947s">Another</a>  is a document that I gave you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2784.128s">two-sided,</a>  that update some of the substance abuse programs that we have put in place this year based on last year's budget, including the Michigan model, and other things, programs that are coming up, including mention of April 2nd's meeting on the addiction program that will be held in the Caron Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2804.536s">But</a>  we'll go into that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2805.856s">So</a>  there's additional programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2808.377s">and</a>  things that I want you to pay attention to. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2810.119s">There's</a>  also an item on the city council tomorrow night asking for some information on what we're doing and, with the mayor's permission, I might send some of this material along to them to keep them involved and perhaps invite them to the <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2823.831s">Angle's</a>  second presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2826.592s">Dr.</a>  Robert Brooks is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2827.873s">Dr.</a>  Robert Brooks is perhaps one of the most eminent psychologists in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2832.015s">We're</a>  dealing with adolescents and children, and he was the director of McLean's, but he's also very well known for all his other work, including with substance abuse.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2842.0s">So...</a>  Point of information, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2848.198s">So</a>  today was the deadline for registering for the April 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2853.201s">So</a>  you may just want to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2854.721s">It's</a>  wide open. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2857.282s">I</a>  called today just to register to make sure that I had space. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2860.904s">But</a>  that's what the brochure says. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2863.805s">So</a>  if there is more room, we should let people know.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2866.186s">We'll</a>  just put out more information.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2867.887s">they</a>  should at least call and register that they're coming and that they plan to attend and which of the five speakers they want to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2878.253s">So</a>  it's just helpful to them for planning purposes for Saturday.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2883.156s">We'll</a>  put that up.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2884.137s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2884.477s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2885.378s">Put</a>  that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2885.958s">Now,</a>  on March 14, 2016, Governor Baker signed House 4056, which is entitled NAC, relative to substance use treatment <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2896.927s">education,</a>  and prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2899.209s">The</a>  legislation passed both House and Senate unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2903.373s">The</a>  act is more popularly known as the Opium Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2906.597s">It's</a>  formally listed as Chapter 52 of the Acts of 2016, and with a few exceptions, it became effective immediately, and a preamble to it that makes it effective immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2920.658s">So</a>  I've attached the legislative bulletin that you would normally receive from MASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2924.64s">You</a>  may already have it, but just in case you haven't seen it yet, it's attached as well from legal counsel Stephen J. Finnegan. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2931.124s">It</a>  highlights the pertinent portions of the new law that impact the schools of the commonwealth. <a

href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2956.573s">This</a>  policy must be filed with DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2959.315s">We</a>  will be posting our policy after tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2962.518s">And</a>  of course, we'll also hold a meeting to review it and see if we want to make any changes to it, or adjustments to it, or upgrade at any given point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2969.324s">But</a>  we'll use the current policy to at least meet that immediate requirement after this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2975.952s">And</a>  then when Destiny gives us some more guidance, we will follow up the policy to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2980.694s">They</a>  have some of their own ideas, and I'm sure that we will try to incorporate them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2989.177s">It's</a>  in the handbooks, distributed to students and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2993.698s">It's</a>  also contained within our online policy manual. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2996.845s">And</a>  we'll highlight that policy to make it more prominent and visible to students and parents by putting some kind of thing on the front page so people will go to it without having to go into each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3008.832s">Dessie,</a>  in consultation with the Department of Public Health, is instructed to provide guidance and recommendations to assist schools with the development of effective school policies and practices regarding substance abuse prevention and education. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3023.439s">ESRI</a>  tells me that DESI will take five, six months to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3026.682s">Because</a>  that's typical, you know, as they convene meetings and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3031.826s">So</a>  we can generally expect a five to six month time frame for DESI to give us real guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3037.19s">They</a>  may give us some preliminary things, but real guidance will take a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3041.454s">And</a>  we'll continue to work cooperatively with DESI and DBH as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3048.388s">Currently,</a>  we have taken the following steps with DPH, and this is done through Tony Vento's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3054.274s">Some</a>  of this you already know, but I'm going to repeat it so that everyone has a chance to hear it as well while we're listening at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3061.701s">All</a>  nurses are now trained to administer Narcan. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3065.986s">Narcan</a>  supplies are available at each of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3069.109s">Training</a>  was provided by Armstrong Ambulance at no cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3073.16s">Narcan</a>  was purchased through CVS at a reduced cost using grant funding from our Central School Health Services grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3081.004s">It's</a>  a grant we get every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3082.164s">Naturally,</a>  we track it in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3085.546s">It's</a>  in there right now in the governor's budget, but we'll see what happens when it goes through the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3090.468s">I</a>  would expect them to sustain that particular line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3097.932s">We</a>  also got a grant from the Central Schools Health Services grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3103.082s">of</a>  $9,700 for support student screening planning costs under HESPR. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3108.243s">That's</a>  the screening tool where parents can opt out if they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3113.125s">It's</a>  like a five to 10 minute screening and we would keep it confidential and we report to people who have need as to what they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3122.887s">High</a>  school nurses have been trained on this particular screening procedure to meet initial DBH requirements, working with grade nine students to start <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3132.402s">We</a>  expect to implement the training and screening during the 2016-2017 year at the high school as per DPH recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3141.849s">Now,</a>  if you go into the actual state law, most schools don't have to do it in 2017, but we're ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3150.035s">We're</a>  going to start a little bit earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3153.557s">We're</a>  planning to train middle school nurses to meet the 2017 mandate for grade seven students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3161.866s">Additional</a>  training to elementary nurses is possible, depending upon DPH mandates and recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3167.27s">We</a>  don't know what their, what their preference is at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3171.093s">At</a>  our professional day on March 1st, 2016, we provided motivational interviewing training to our nurses to get them to work with the students and others to get them to be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3182.902s">And</a>  we'll continue to prioritize social and emotional learning as one of our key initiatives in the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3191.029s">We</a>  have to do this on an annual basis at two different grade levels by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3195.832s">Parents</a>  can opt out in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3197.873s">All</a>  information obtained through the screening is confidential, except in case of medical emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3202.876s">If</a>  something happens in a medical emergency, obviously you can't keep it confidential, you have to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3208.886s">We're</a>  well ahead of the act. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3210.467s">As</a>  explained above, we're moving in the direction of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3213.368s">The</a>  implementation of screening is subject to state appropriation and will not be generally required until 2017, 2018, if it's funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3222.512s">So</a>  again, unfunded mandates are often the case in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3226.774s">If</a>  they don't fund it, it may not be required, but we will try to keep it in place, and like I said, we're ahead of the curve right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3235.297s">There</a>  is a good Samaritan cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3238.122s">Section</a>  12FF that absolves any person who in good faith attempts to render emergency care by Narcan from liability except for gross negligence and or willful or wanton misconduct. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3252.1s">So</a>  I've attached additional information for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3254.921s">On</a>  Sunday, April 2nd, 2016, the Medford Public Schools, through the Bloomberg Center for Civic and Social Responsibility, will offer a workshop program on addiction, and Dr. Robert Brooks is the featured speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3268.226s">I</a>  have his resume and some information here for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3272.548s">As</a>  you know, the Medford Public Schools has implemented the Michigan model curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3277.67s">The</a>  program is a comprehensive approach to health, wellness, and good decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3282.235s">We're</a>  giving great emphasis to social and emotional learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3285.177s">We've</a>  added counseling assistance to our faculty, and we're close with many external agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3290.582s">So</a>  we're committed to working with the community to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3294.245s">I'll</a>  call your attention to some of the things that I brought to you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3298.649s">This</a>  document is a memo from me, an update, and I just bring a couple of things to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3305.174s">The</a>  Michigan model is piloted in all our elementary schools this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3309.558s">There</a>  are 13 teachers who are <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3311.573s">piloting</a>  it at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3314.735s">They're</a>  also comparing it to second step and to see which things cross over. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3320.279s">They'll</a>  evaluate each lesson and choose lessons that they think will be most effective with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3326.824s">Middle</a>  school and high school students are in full implementation of the MidMichigan model at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3332.148s">If</a>  only a Wahlberg Foundation opiate awareness video was added to the sophomore curriculum at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3339.411s">Vaping,</a>  more dangerous than you think, or vaping, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3344.113s">Video</a>  is added to the sophomore curriculum as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3346.715s">Youngsters</a>  who inhale things. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3349.516s">Presentations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3351.137s">End</a>  the stigma of addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3352.297s">Substance</a>  abuse prevention projects were unveiled at an event at Medford C Hall on February 3rd, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3358.321s">Michael</a>  Sporker of the MHS team and MHS students of the Gay-Straight Alliance shared their stories of family and friends with addictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3368.132s">There's</a>  an addiction symposium on the second, I've already referenced that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3374.519s">Grants,</a>  partnership for success grant for preparation, prevention of prescription drug misuse among youth was awarded to the city of Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3382.888s">Penny</a>  Bonioli, Brooke Hoyt. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3385.641s">Lisa</a>  Van Doyen, Rachel Perry, John Perot, and Heidi Riccio, Amelia Jensen, and Tony Vento are working on a plan to implement evidence-based prevention programs, policies, and practices to reduce prescription drug misuse amongst persons age 12 to 25 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3400.989s">So</a>  another initiative underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3402.99s">The</a>  Safe and Supportive School Grant, we applied for this at the end of November 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3407.873s">It's</a>  yet to be awarded for all four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3411.115s">We'll</a>  wait to hear what happens with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3413.796s">We've</a>  got an MIA workshop, The Face of Addiction, The Opioid Crisis, The Journey from Painkillers to Addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3420.539s">It'll</a>  be led by health teacher Ellen Ridden, and it'll be done in May of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3425.36s">There's</a>  another program called Heat Heroin Education Awareness Task Force Conference on Friday, June 17th, and we will have people from our staff attend that conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3436.985s">So</a>  we're very active right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3438.525s">There's</a>  a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3440.466s">This</a>  is something that we take very seriously, <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3443.612s">whether</a>  it's drugs, alcohol, whatever it is, we're taking it very, very seriously, and we believe we're ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3451.634s">I'm</a>  willing to answer any questions you may have.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3453.895s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3454.375s">And</a>  if I may, through you to the superintendent, Mr. Belson, I would suggest that a copy of this package be given to our director of public information. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3463.297s">I</a>  found this package to be very stimulating and <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3468.364s">I</a>  think that we should have a concerted effort with our media to get this message out to parents and concerned citizens and anyone that might have missed it and to reassure them that we are working towards hopefully not having any tragic cases here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3484.313s">But</a>  if they do, at least they'll know where to go to get information and they know that we do have a substance abuse policy in place and who they might contact or how they might gain further information to help their own children.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3499.19s">It</a>  will be on the website this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3501.071s">It</a>  will also be out to the media this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3503.353s">And</a>  we will also be sending things with the permission of the mayor to the council tomorrow night.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3513.618s">This</a>  is absolutely wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3515.519s">This</a>  is something that I know is a collaboration of the school district and with the help of everyone in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3521.341s">This</a>  is something that we've all been waiting for because, again, it's wonderful that people do things and we have different clubs and organizations that do things separately, but I think the power in this is that we do it all together and I think this is a great program to start with, or not actually start with because I know <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3537.947s">We've</a>  been doing quite a lot for quite a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3541.429s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify, Mr. Superintendent, you said Sunday, April 2nd, and I just want to make sure that people understand it's Saturday.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3548.452s">Saturday</a>  the 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3549.352s">We'll</a>  clean up. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3550.152s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3550.673s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3552.113s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3552.173s">Mastone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3552.934s">I</a>  know at the Roberts, some of my kids have the Michigan model, and it's just that the classroom teaches when she has time to fit it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3561.297s">It's</a>  not really <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3563.318s">It's</a>  up to the classroom teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3564.499s">But</a>  when does the middle school and high school get Michigan model? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3567.96s">Is</a>  it more structured? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3568.72s">They</a>  have it part of their health classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3570.561s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3570.621s">So</a>  is that once a week or? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3572.201s">Depends</a>  on how the schedule is set up, but generally once a week.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3575.742s">So</a>  it's probably more consistent than? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3577.403s">It's</a>  consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3578.303s">Each</a>  school has a little bit different approach to delivering the health program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3581.585s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3582.385s">But</a>  they schedule it generally once a week.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3587.247s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3587.347s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3588.107s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3589.167s">Mr.</a>  Bell said? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3592.342s">I</a>  didn't see a copy of our policy.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3596.223s">We'll</a>  send it along. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3597.083s">We</a>  didn't encode it with this.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3598.483s">Yeah,</a>  I'm asking you to please.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3599.784s">It's</a>  a little different to school to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3601.724s">I</a>  mean, from high school to now.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3605.125s">OK,</a>  I'd like to see that before it's posted.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3607.345s">You</a>  can send it up.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3609.566s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3611.906s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3613.526s">On</a>  the motion to receive and place on file, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3617.687s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3618.567s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3619.228s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3622.805s">Report</a>  on Brooks Maintenance Issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3624.906s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3627.928s">Okay,</a>  we're going to call on our assistant superintendent, Diane Caldwell, to deliver this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3631.93s">It</a>  was partially put together by John McLaughlin, who's covering you on camera, so if you need John, he's on the other end. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3639.454s">Okay?</a> </p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3641.854s">Maybe</a>  I could do the cameras and John could do the microphone out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3646.138s">I</a>  just wanted to provide you with a timeline on the Brooks maintenance issue that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3651.923s">On</a>  Wednesday, March 9th at 8.30, water began to come up through the floors in the student bathrooms and in the kitchen of the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3662.974s">Mr.</a>  Kevin Andrews is the principal of the school, and he contacted me immediately, as well as John McLaughlin and the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3670.801s">And</a>  we decided to call in the drain doctor to see if it would be a quick fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3675.635s">Mr.</a>  Andrews contacted Medford School Food Services after we realized that it was going to take a little more time, and we knew that we had to have lunches prepared by the food service. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3688.061s">Jewel</a>  Bradley and her staff, very quickly, this was maybe at 10 o'clock, Mr. Andrews and I decided it was time to provide 300 lunches for our students at the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3701.668s">And</a>  they were sandwiches and yogurt and other fruits. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3705.706s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3705.987s">Kim</a>  Fowler from the Board of Health investigated the Brooks School site, reviewed the food preparation, and then recommended next steps for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3715.513s">Mr.</a>  Andrews was very good at sending emails out to the families of the Brooks School, and he also sent a hard copy letter home just to inform our families of what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3728.8s">And</a>  overnight, the blockage was cleared. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3730.661s">It</a>  was determined that a large amount of paper towels were stuck in the waistline. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3735.783s">The</a>  evening custodians clean the remaining water on the kitchen floor and in the first floor bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3741.086s">And</a>  I really have to congratulate the custodial staff at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3744.869s">They</a>  work very hard, the day custodial staff as well as the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3751.272s">So</a>  on Thursday, March 10th, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3753.573s">Fowler</a>  visited again to review what needed to be completed in the storeroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3758.376s">The</a>  principal and John McLaughlin developed a work plan that was approved by the Board of Health, and this included using plastic to block off the storeroom and kitchen office, removing wallboard and insulation, allowing it to dry, and then replacing it with wallboard and insulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3774.545s">Mr.</a>  Andrews sent another email out to families just to notify them that the kitchen would still not be available and would remain closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3783.03s">So</a>  for the next few days, we communicated with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3787.772s">Jewel</a>  Bradley, and she was able to prepare lunches for our kids, peanut butter and jelly and yogurt, as I said before. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3797.058s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3797.278s">Fowler</a>  returned on March 15th for another inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3800.921s">She</a>  determined that the unpainted wall board would need to be covered with plastic and taped to the floor, and all the surfaces needed to be re-cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3810.37s">At</a>  3.30 p.m., the school was cleared for food preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3813.993s">And</a>  Mr. Andrews then sent an email out to the school families at 7 o'clock that evening to inform them that food preparation was good to go for the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3823.696s">I'd</a>  like to call your attention to the attached report, which is from John McLaughlin, our Director of Buildings and Grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3832.099s">And</a>  he could tell you a little more about the maintenance and the cleanup and the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3838.401s">In</a>  the last week, all drains connected to our schools have been inspected and flushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3843.463s">This</a>  preventative measure should help to avoid a similar situation going forward.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3850.687s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3851.188s">Caldwell.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3851.788s">Are</a>  there any questions?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3854.07s">Hi,</a>  Madam Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3854.65s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3855.09s">To</a>  either Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3856.391s">Caldwell</a>  or the superintendent, was there any investigation as to why there was a large amount of paper towels stuck in the waistline?</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3863.495s">This</a>  is probably a John McLaughlin question, but <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3868.238s">I</a>  don't know the answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3869.479s">I</a>  mean, they tried to get it out with just the drain doctor, and that didn't work, so they had to call in Paulette.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3875.861s">It</a>  seems like an awfully large amount of paper towels to be where they're not supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3879.263s">It</a>  was an awfully large bill for the city.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3881.224s">There</a>  was work being done on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3883.925s">Excuse</a>  me, Mr. Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3885.266s">There</a>  was work being done on the street as well, so I was wondering if that had any input, but I was told no, it didn't.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3894.473s">I</a>  just want to comment, if I can, that with the help of the DPW and the mayor's office, we had all the drains cleared going into every school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3903.218s">So</a>  it became a preventative kind of thing in case it was happening someplace or about to happen someplace else.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3931.969s">I</a>  can certainly do that for you, Mr. Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3935.371s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3936.833s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3937.093s">Krentz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3937.693s">I</a>  have a point of information that I know at the vocational school, they have some of the power dryers now in some of the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3945.038s">So</a>  that might be a nice thing, a nice change for the future, instead of the because they were having problems with paper towels. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3951.323s">So</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3956.987s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3957.487s">Caldwell.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3957.908s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3958.528s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive in place on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3962.272s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3963.013s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3963.473s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3965.315s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3966.376s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3968.077s">We</a>  also have a few announcements that the superintendent wants to comment on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3971.46s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3972.702s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor and members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3974.263s">You</a>  have a paper in your folder about the field trip to Washington and the reimbursements. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3978.987s">The</a>  checks are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3984.904s">And</a>  we'll find out if they didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3986.765s">But</a>  right now, Pat did a great job pulling it together, and we're sitting all to ensure that everyone got their check. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3994.57s">And</a>  the total amount was $3,680.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3997.772s">Thank</a>  you, Pat.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3999.273s">That's</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4000.874s">The</a>  second thing is, is that the day on the Hill is in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4004.476s">There's</a>  now a paper in your folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4007.978s">It's</a>  April 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4009.559s">If</a>  you want to go, you've got to let us know so we can make <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4012.676s">arrangements</a>  for you to sign up, and I want you to go to the Day on the Hill as a registered member as opposed to somebody who just walks in and has to leave, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4027.629s">You</a>  did it yourself? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4029.471s">You</a>  didn't ask permission? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4030.792s">I'm</a>  just kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4031.533s">No,</a>  it's okay.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4032.193s">I</a>  just wanted to know what happened from the Day on the Hill.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4038.001s">On</a>  the day on the hill, basically it's a day for the school committee members to meet legislators, to talk about issues, and to perhaps share with other school committee members from other communities things that are of mutual concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4052.505s">You</a>  know, Ann Marie is former president of NASC, Paul Wetzel has been a member of the executive board for a period of time, and they can certainly share ideas with you as to how to make that day effective if you want to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4066.428s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4073.011s">So</a>  Then we've got something on the Mathematics middle school mathematics and pathways to high school mathematics on Thursday April 14th from 7 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4091.915s">The</a>  science lecture hall we're inviting up Middle high school students up to see things and to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4101.464s">It's</a>  scheduled for the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4113.674s">So</a>  middle school students can see our science labs and see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4117.917s">It's</a>  April 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4134.251s">It's</a>  listed here, it's 7 to 8 p.m.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4137.253s">Thursday,</a>  April 14th.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4138.854s">Okay,</a>  so that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4141.015s">And</a>  you also have in your packet a copy of the latest teacher's contract that's been made, so in case you need a copy of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4148.019s">We</a>  can't get these on the city side.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4149.3s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4149.44s">I</a>  said we can't get these on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4153.162s">It's</a>  quite nice.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4158.485s">Name</a>  was spelled incorrectly? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4160.731s">It</a>  must be the Teachers Association did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4162.973s">Blame</a>  the Teachers Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4164.654s">Where's</a>  Shelby? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4167.756s">All</a>  right, so we'll try and correct it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4170.137s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4171.218s">I</a>  also wanted to announce that the Method Against Addiction annual, second annual candlelight vigil is April 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4181.285s">And</a>  just to keep people up to date what's going on within the city.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4188.19s">We</a>  have a meeting next week and the week after. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4191.494s">So</a>  we have a number of things coming to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4194.116s">And</a>  we'll be working on that over the next few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4197.42s">So</a>  we've got a busy schedule over the next two weeks for the holiday break. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4202.645s">And</a>  we're giving you stuff as well.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4205.649s">Mayor</a>  Byrd, last item on the agenda is negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4209.89s">Okay,</a>  so that's a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4211.49s">Well,</a>  it's up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4212.271s">Let</a>  me know and we'll schedule it.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4236.79s">So</a>  we'll schedule it whenever you schedule the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4243.301s">Whatever</a>  you want to schedule, we'll schedule it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4247.147s">I'll</a>  talk to you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4253.506s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4253.806s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4254.426s">I</a>  just want to recognize a couple of things that happened that we haven't had the opportunity to speak about, but I did receive a few emails today stating that parents had gone up to the high school and they were very impressed with the fact that they had to buzz themselves in and that they needed to get guest passes to go where they needed to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4273.777s">So</a>  they were very pleased and the feedback on that has been very positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4277.399s">The</a>  other thing I just want to throw in is, <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4281.041s">We</a>  sit here this evening and we listen to what's happening as far as these projects that are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4287.285s">And</a>  you go outside of the district and then you see really how lucky we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4293.408s">I've</a>  been on the college tour right now with my twins. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4298.472s">And</a>  we just went to a smaller college, but it was really interesting seeing the reaction of students when the students that are there are saying that they're graduating in about a month and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4309.966s">And</a>  they're so excited because they're going to be building a new project. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4313.791s">And</a>  that building is going to be about $5 million or $6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4316.693s">And</a>  it happened to be adjacent to one of their science buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4320.836s">So</a>  I kindly sat there proudly and said, you know, we're from Medved. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4325.539s">And</a>  we just built one for $17 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4327.44s">So</a>  it just opens up your eyes of what we have, where we're going, and how fortunate we are on many things that sometimes we really don't see the big picture.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4339.832s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4340.613s">There's</a>  a motion to go into executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4342.535s">Moved</a>  by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4344.276s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4345.357s">Roll</a>  call, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4352.024s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4353.826s">We</a>  are entering executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=4355.808s">We</a>  may possibly come back out to the floor.</p>
