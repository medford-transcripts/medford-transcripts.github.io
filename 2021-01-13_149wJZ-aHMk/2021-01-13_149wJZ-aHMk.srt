yeah yeah yeah

3
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:31,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone, we're just going to give one more minute to member Graham.

4
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:20,776
[SPEAKER_01]: There she is.

5
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:22,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, I think we're ready to go.

00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, thank you.

13
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law,

[SPEAKER_00]: The meeting could be viewed through

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if we actually are on metric community media on Comcast Channel 22, Verizon 43.

22
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:24,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that actually is the case today, but since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in or call, log or call in by using the following link or call in number.

[SPEAKER_00]: The call in number, if you want to call in, which you obviously would be able to do, because you can hear it.

25
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:53,651
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of this chicken and egg thing about this posting, but it's, where's the phone number?

26
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,532
[SPEAKER_00]: My apologies.

27
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:57,274
[SPEAKER_00]: 312-626-6799, meeting ID 97562725,

28
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:21,805
[SPEAKER_00]: 433.

29
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:21,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, if you have any additional questions or comments, you can submit them via email by sending them to me as the chair to pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us.

30
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:26,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Please include your first and last name, your Medford Street address and your question or comment.

31
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:31,190
[SPEAKER_00]: The agenda for tonight is that Wednesday, January 13th,

32
00:06:34,206 --> 00:07:00,240
[SPEAKER_00]: we will be meeting to begin work on a periodic report schedule referred to committee on February 2nd, 2020 by the motion, given that several periodic reports are required by law and regulation, past practice and best practice, the rules, policy and equity subcommittee shall promulgate an annual schedule of such reports to provide the superintendent, the school committee and the public a transparent and concise understanding of when to expect these reports.

33
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:03,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we should probably take attendance.

34
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodness.

35
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:10,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

36
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably getting that one.

37
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:13,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And Member Graham.

38
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:14,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

39
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:17,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And Member Ruseau, present, three present.

40
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

41
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:23,664
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent an email earlier this week.

42
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone for coming, by the way.

43
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:28,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent an email earlier this week, all of the members asking that

44
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:38,020
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email with any suggestions for reports that they know we already get, or reports that they think we should be getting.

45
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:49,265
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also reached out to school committees across the state through our distribution list to ask the same question and did get a couple of responses from other districts.

46
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:53,167
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the superintendent and her staff have their own

47
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:58,637
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule and calendar as well for when certain reports will be created.

48
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:16,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the motivation for this, it was to, excuse me, was to, well, there was lots of motivations, but one of the motivations was that, you know, when new members come in, they might wanna know something, an entirely reasonable thing.

49
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:20,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you come in and if you ask for that report,

50
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:44,095
[SPEAKER_00]: it might seem perfectly timely to do so right then and there, but if it's an already scheduled report with a time and date that it was going to arrive, adding more work to the superintendent's plate for a report that she will also have to give us that, you know, if it's a November report, asking for it in February doesn't make a lot of sense.

51
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:46,576
[SPEAKER_00]: So efficiency was certainly part of it.

52
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:51,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have, I have a,

53
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,836
[SPEAKER_00]: spreadsheet that I can share, if that makes sense.

54
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,516
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a screen share.

55
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:13,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a very interesting advanced options on my share button.

56
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:13,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.

57
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we go.

58
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

59
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you all see my spreadsheet that I have up?

60
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:33,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

61
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:34,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind request.

62
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:40,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you just make the font maybe 125 or 150, just so it will appear a little larger?

63
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:41,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

64
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:43,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

65
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:44,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

66
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:46,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

67
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on one second.

68
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's scrolled on the wrong way.

69
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:50,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

70
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:53,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is that look okay to you?

71
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:53,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

72
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

73
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:54,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

74
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

75
00:09:56,141 --> 00:10:08,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, um, this, this is sort of a draft and, um, many of our reports may not have official names, which is a challenge, I think, for, uh, you know, I call it one thing and you call it another.

76
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:16,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we do need to name our reports so that we can, um, accurately discuss them.

77
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:21,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I received an email from, um, member Van der Kloot,

78
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:28,806
[SPEAKER_00]: our most senior member, of course, who has probably seen more reports than the rest of us will ever see in our lives.

79
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:41,808
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've added those to this list as well, the superintendent, and I believe, and certainly her executive assistant, and perhaps others have added a few things as well.

80
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:49,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really clear what people think on how we should approach this.

81
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that

82
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:58,910
[SPEAKER_00]: We should try to worry about getting a complete list before we get too into the weeds about the frequency.

83
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the frequency for many reports will not be very exciting.

84
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:04,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, the scrolling is.

85
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:09,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just lose the sharing?

86
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:16,341
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it just moved, I think, to the right.

87
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:20,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you could slide back to the left, we could see it.

88
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the sharing.

89
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:26,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Try that again.

90
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:32,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe because I asked you to enlarge it, but yeah.

91
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:37,010
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.

92
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom is not allowing me to even click around on the spreadsheet right now.

93
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:45,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, right now we can see it, Member Ruseau.

94
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:50,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So in a moment ago, it just went to the right and we couldn't see the first column, which is sort of the critical one.

95
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:52,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now it's good.

96
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:53,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

97
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,074
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be bouncing around going on and I'm not clicking.

98
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,075
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can talk.

99
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:01,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, may I ask a question?

100
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:02,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, please.

101
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:07,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just trying to get up to speed on the origin of this list.

102
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:17,540
[SPEAKER_07]: And is this the first time, sorry, if this wasn't an attachment in an email and I missed it, is this the first time that this entire list is being shared?

103
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:19,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.

104
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was no attachment in an email that I missed, right?

105
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:23,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

106
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:24,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

107
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:24,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

108
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:31,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I am curious about the origin of many of the items on this list.

109
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:47,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something that was a layover from previously requested reports that were formerly listed in old business as part of the, um, uh, I know when I came on board in January, there was a list of several

110
00:12:48,479 --> 00:13:02,882
[SPEAKER_07]: reports that were sort of under old business for school committee that, you know, we agreed upon at some point that, you know, we could go off and defer to the rules policy and to the subcommittee.

111
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:11,164
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this that in addition to other requests that you had, or is this, yeah, can you give me some orientation, please?

112
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:11,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

113
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:12,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yes.

114
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:17,586
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, at least as I intend it, is

115
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:21,287
[SPEAKER_00]: explicitly not including anything that's an ad hoc report.

116
00:13:21,528 --> 00:13:27,349
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything like, you know, we've got some question that comes up in the meeting, and we want to get answers to it.

117
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,109
[SPEAKER_00]: That aren't things that we probably should have been asking every year, for instance.

118
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:41,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those reports that were on that are on that list, I think are ad hoc reports, but some of them are not some of them are like, why isn't this just an annual report?

119
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:47,472
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't a, it's not a black and white, as to what this list is.

120
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,488
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure.

121
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:51,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, just a follow up.

122
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:58,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So then, yeah, I would love it just a definition of what the report actually is a periodic reports for school committee.

123
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:04,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just love to know, you know, could we add the ad hoc reports here as well?

124
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:04,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know.

125
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:07,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not understanding the difference between the reports.

126
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:10,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if I could respectfully request that

127
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:26,833
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, maybe we just have some, we can talk about some, you know, continuity in the way that they're listed, whether it's alphabetically or categorized or what have you, just so that we can, I need some sense of where things are, if I could.

128
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:39,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say that the ad hocs probably shouldn't be on here because similar to the effort we did in December with the holiday, you know, the holiday events, it's, you know, here's the list

129
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,544
[SPEAKER_00]: the superintendent annually will go through and play it forward.

130
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:55,326
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will know that there's two meetings in February and these two things have to happen in February and she's gonna put them on the agenda ahead of time.

131
00:14:56,806 --> 00:15:08,428
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that became evident as I worked on this list today and as the superintendent and Susie added a bunch of other items is that this is a, well, frankly, it's a massive list.

132
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:20,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I just dawned on me is we don't have a column for whether or not it's actually just in our packets, or is it an actual conversation on the agenda?

133
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:30,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of these things may well be things that are just like, here's this document that goes in your packet and is available to the public, but we don't necessarily have to have a presentation.

134
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these things, of course, do need presentations.

135
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:37,754
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we quickly end up with far more

136
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:45,034
[SPEAKER_00]: reports that we all agree we need to get, then there are days in the week kind of thing.

137
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:55,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll have to either prioritize and take some off the list or identify them as being, you know, FYIs that are in our packet.

138
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,021
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe there have been a couple that, you know, have just been in our packets.

139
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,522
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not on the agenda per se.

140
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:03,303
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not conversation points.

141
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:09,429
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can, of course, make them conversation points if there's something about that particular one.

142
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:19,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, we talk quite a bit about enrollment, attendance, which has often been sort of wrapped up in that conversation.

143
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:24,293
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always found it very confusing that they're together, because to me, attendance and enrollment are not the same.

144
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:28,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless, of course, we're talking about doing the enrollment report, then attendance matters.

145
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:33,015
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to know things about, you know, our attendance throughout the year.

146
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:35,689
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very different than enrollment.

147
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:54,515
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether or not we would have an attendance report at every meeting or every couple of months that is simply at the elementary level, attendance was at 96% or whatever, that seems to me like on the surface, like a report that would just be in our packets as an FYI.

148
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:09,048
[SPEAKER_07]: May I just as a follow up, so just so that I understand, so you're definite, what would be, how would you define ad hoc reports and how would you define what is on this document?

149
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,212
[SPEAKER_00]: An ad hoc report is a report that's a one-off.

150
00:17:14,953 --> 00:17:24,620
[SPEAKER_07]: that is asked for on the floor on one occasion during a school committee meeting, as opposed to these, which would be annual presentations.

151
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:25,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that right?

152
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:26,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yes.

153
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:32,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the ad hoc report would follow the ad hoc report policy we passed, I think a year, I think a year back.

154
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:39,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these would not be conversation pieces in that when we approve the schedule,

155
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:49,040
[SPEAKER_00]: When this goes forward to the full school committee and we approve it, we're not gonna ask the superintendent to put a CPAC presentation on the agenda.

156
00:17:49,401 --> 00:18:04,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we say the CPAC agenda presentation will happen the first meeting of March, I'm just making that up, then we don't have to remember to ask her every year, every first meeting of March, she will put it on the agenda because this is our expectation.

157
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just making up those dates off the top of my head.

158
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:16,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the difference is that this is the, here's what you're gonna get through the year, both as a new member and frankly as a not new member.

159
00:18:17,912 --> 00:18:31,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes I know I get questions from constituents that ask me a specific question and to be able to have a list of reports and go, oh, that answer would have been in the district improvement plan and that comes out.

160
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:37,175
[SPEAKER_05]: But it has been stolen from him by the radical left.

161
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:40,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop the steal.

162
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:42,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop the steal.

163
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think Susan has something to say.

164
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:50,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop the steal.

165
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop the steal.

166
00:18:52,167 --> 00:19:01,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I muted myself.

167
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Melanie, were you still talking?

168
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:05,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

169
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have more questions.

170
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, member Ruseau.

171
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:15,428
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just respectfully request that maybe we give this a very clear title at the top.

172
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:21,010
[SPEAKER_07]: So as opposed to periodic reports for school committee, which frankly could also be an ad hoc report, cause they are periodic.

173
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:29,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I would suggest, you know, something to the effect of annual slash biannual reports for school committee.

174
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:30,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

175
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, some of them are quarterly.

176
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:36,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, if it is periodic in any way, shape or form to me, it is definitely not ad hoc.

177
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:38,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

178
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:50,306
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be yet that if we consider it periodic, but like if, if we designed an ad hoc report the first time and at the conclusion of the report, we're all like, yes, this was good.

179
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:50,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

180
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:55,307
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely should have had this information on a quarterly basis or annual basis.

181
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it to me no longer ad hoc reports should be.

182
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:09,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you ask for the report, you go through the whole ad hoc report process, which I would never wanna do if it's a report we should get quarterly or annually even.

183
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I just wanna make sure that we're really clear and maybe that's part of this process.

184
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:24,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what is the goal that you would like to achieve in today's meeting?

185
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would like to achieve getting the list as complete as possible.

186
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:39,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we, some of these things, like the wider results, I vaguely remember those being presented.

187
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:41,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about the scrolling.

188
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,526
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know what the problem is.

189
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try my other.

190
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:47,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

191
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:48,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And,

192
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:58,134
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting the list as complete as possible and the superintendent and Susie, and frankly, I think other administrators might want to weigh in on that.

193
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:06,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, some of these will need names that are a little more understood.

194
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:17,761
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this, you know, some of these I've taken off of other school committees, websites, and some of the email responses I got today, like, you know, the prior year fiscal year,

195
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:29,918
[SPEAKER_00]: draft audit, and then the final, you know, on the shore collaborative where I'm the chairman, we actually do exactly those two things each year.

196
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:36,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming we do that here too, and I just don't remember, or we don't call it that.

197
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:47,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the school committee seems like it should have to approve the annual audit, but I don't know, maybe that's, but I mean, this came from another school committee and they do this.

198
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:55,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if it's not necessary and they just like to do more, then I'm okay with removing items here.

199
00:21:55,761 --> 00:22:00,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we do have to acknowledge the bandwidth involved with a lot of this stuff.

200
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:07,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, there were plenty of other items that were not, that are not on this list that I got from other school committees.

201
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:15,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, when Cambridge has many other reports, well, Cambridge also has, um,

202
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:20,076
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a different set of resources to really do anything any member probably asks.

203
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:23,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's part of it.

204
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:29,922
[SPEAKER_00]: So but getting this list as complete as possible, I'm gonna try to scroll over, see what happens.

205
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:33,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

206
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:33,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

207
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:48,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think we might be able to start, you know, at the either, you know, bottom or top or wherever you want to start at the list and go through them so that we understand, like I, you know, the acronym WIDA, I think you said, is lost on me.

208
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:59,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to, I guess I'd like to go through and just find out, is Peter on here monitoring?

209
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:03,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Dr. Cushing, are you here monitoring, please?

210
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,491
[SPEAKER_07]: We have people we have.

211
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:07,512
[SPEAKER_07]: We have somebody's hacking in.

212
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:11,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that I'm gonna, um, see if we can get him on the call.

213
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:12,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

214
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:13,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna work right now.

215
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,678
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very upsetting on a day like today, frankly.

216
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:20,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, anyway, I'm sorry, Mr. Member Ruseau.

217
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:25,804
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering if we might be able to go through the line items, especially as a new member.

218
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:29,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I need some orientation for each of the line items so that I can better understand.

219
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:30,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

220
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:33,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

221
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:42,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop my share and maybe that's the chat is maybe the chat is causing some of this.

222
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:18,194
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

223
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:19,935
[SPEAKER_00]: One moment, my apologies.

224
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:47,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

225
00:24:47,043 --> 00:24:51,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair, are you able to see it all now?

226
00:24:56,552 --> 00:24:57,473
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I should say.

227
00:24:57,793 --> 00:24:59,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

228
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:01,295
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that makes sense to go through it.

229
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:07,638
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other columns in here, I, you know, I've been adding columns, frankly, as the day has gone on.

230
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:20,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the report name, the report, the meeting type, I realized that when I added the MCAS results and accountability overview, we actually have a meeting every year on this, and it is a committee of the whole.

231
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:22,987
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized

232
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,921
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and some of these other meetings may well make more sense to be committees of the whole than a regular meeting.

233
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:44,485
[SPEAKER_00]: The type, I just sort of made this up, but like finance, special education, HR, presented by, you know, I just added that, but, cause I thought, you know, the PTOs do the PTO report presentation.

234
00:25:44,866 --> 00:25:50,107
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not anybody in the administration, whether they're statutory or not, I think it's something we,

235
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,720
[SPEAKER_00]: can get answers to.

236
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really think we have to talk about it necessarily unless we have a disagreement.

237
00:25:56,403 --> 00:26:00,765
[SPEAKER_00]: The frequency is obviously a conversation.

238
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:09,169
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the warrants and payrolls, all of our meetings right now do have it, but my understanding is that the law says we only need it actually once a month.

239
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:17,533
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna perhaps recommend we reduce that so that every meeting isn't sitting there going over these when we could just do it once every other meeting.

240
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:37,653
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of effort is a nod to, I think, understanding the hours of effort will be helpful should we need to cut anything out, or if the superintendent says, I like it all, there's literally, I need four more staff or something like, if that's what the superintendent says.

241
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:47,177
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's expected is sort of related to the frequency, but some things are due in the fall, some are due in the spring,

242
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:55,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the description that's, I think really gets to the heart of what member McLaughlin, what you were speaking to.

243
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:01,122
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that needs to be filled out dramatically on most things.

244
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:13,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I did add it for four reports here that, you know, I have a technology report, a health report, burn report, which is how much of our money have we spent so far this year in an HR report.

245
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:26,538
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like with our ad hoc report policy, I think it, you know, for some of these reports, it might be good to actually identify exactly what it is we wanna know.

246
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Because frankly, there's nothing worse than getting there to the meeting.

247
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has spent an obviously spent a lot of time preparing a report.

248
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:44,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the first thing we do is ask a question for which the report doesn't answer, especially when it's something that they probably actually already did know, but they didn't know we would want to know.

249
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:48,230
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think a lot of those things we as members can put it out ahead of time.

250
00:27:48,250 --> 00:28:02,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do we really want to go through, I mean, I'm fine with we can go through each of these quickly and just make sure we understand what they are.

251
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,598
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense?

252
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:05,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

253
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

254
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,420
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only 427.

255
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like it was later because it got dark suddenly.

256
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So the enrollment report is the,

257
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:19,360
[SPEAKER_00]: two reports that are done each year that are sent to DESE that say, how many students do we have?

258
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:32,944
[SPEAKER_00]: These are critical reports from a financial perspective where we, all of September, I think it's the building principals, work feverishly to identify every student that they actually have so that we can get that report right.

259
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:36,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I believe it's done again in March.

260
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:37,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct, Superintendent?

261
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:39,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I believe you're close.

262
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:41,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's for October.

263
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:42,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

264
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:47,008
[SPEAKER_06]: In, um, the first meeting of April, uh, we have to do it twice to Desi.

265
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:56,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I can confirm, uh, the dates I'd prefer to confirm the specific date with Kim miles, but, um, to present it in April, that sounds about right.

266
00:28:57,996 --> 00:28:58,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

267
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:07,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the, um, the April one, you know, may just be one of those things where we throw it in the packet, if it's not a really worthy of a conversation, but, um,

268
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:13,190
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall one is a very important thing.

269
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Attendance, again- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

270
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:16,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

271
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:34,542
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the purpose description, it'll be written so that a lay person, so that I am, or I'm happy to help if somebody needs it or if this needs it, but that a lay person or a community member can read this and know exactly what is being said, right?

272
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:35,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

273
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:46,357
[SPEAKER_00]: key and part of, I believe that was part of the language and why we did this was, you know, we will publish this and the public should be able to read it, understand what it is.

274
00:29:46,877 --> 00:30:01,583
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the field that includes all the data elements, the public may, you know, their eyes may glass over on some of those, but, you know, the description of what the report is definitely needs to be easily understood.

275
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:06,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, warrants and payrolls are pretty obvious.

276
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:07,407
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not.

277
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:08,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

278
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:09,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sorry.

279
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:09,728
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

280
00:30:10,068 --> 00:30:11,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So attendance is obvious, right?

281
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:14,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's what our attendance rates are, I assume, right?

282
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:17,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

283
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:17,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you repeat that?

284
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:18,953
[SPEAKER_00]: My phone was ringing in my ear.

285
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:19,974
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

286
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:24,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Attendance, I assume, is what our attendance rates are or dropout.

287
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:25,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that sort of?

288
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:26,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

289
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:26,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

290
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:28,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Warrants?

291
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:28,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what warrants is.

292
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:30,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the bills.

293
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:33,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a fancy name for bills.

294
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:35,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just, you know.

295
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:39,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'll put that in the description, but warrants are a little different than the bills.

296
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:45,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Some school committees, the secretary will literally sign every check.

297
00:30:46,964 --> 00:30:58,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And my understanding is the law changed some number of years ago to allow the secretary to sign a piece of paper that says what all the checks are and not have to sign every check by hand.

298
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:03,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that a warrant is different than signing the payment directly.

299
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:09,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so maybe we could just put warranted in parentheses bills so that people sort of sure.

300
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

301
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, payrolls are payrolls.

302
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the.

303
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Open house schedule for the schools.

304
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:18,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

305
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:21,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I know that's in one of the subcommittees.

306
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:29,612
[SPEAKER_00]: that.

307
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:33,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Um the CPAC annual CPAC presentation.

308
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:35,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a better name for that, Mayor McLaughlin, that you're aware of?

309
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:39,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just actually, um, spell out the acronym.

310
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:43,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever we have an acronym, I would spell it out first, and then in parentheses, the CPAC.

311
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:46,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yep, I'll go through and do all that, um, for sure.

312
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:57,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the final year update, uh, from the final update from the prior year fiscal year, um, that actually, uh,

313
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:02,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Murphy gave us that this year, and I thought it was excellent and crystal clear.

314
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:04,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if there was a name on it.

315
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:13,721
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't take each of these and go through our last couple of years of packets, even though I have them, to find out whether there's a real name that is preferred.

316
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:20,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't to try and get us to a nice, happy name on everything.

317
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:22,872
[SPEAKER_00]: committee goals.

318
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so for the final update prior fiscal fiscal year.

319
00:32:26,994 --> 00:32:31,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just ask that we again just use some very elementary language?

320
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:35,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, final budget update prior physical fiscal year.

321
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not budget, but yes.

322
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:39,878
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this one.

323
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,879
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was like, you know the accounts.

324
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,799
[SPEAKER_00]: What's what's in the money?

325
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:46,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the money that we have counting final update?

326
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay.

327
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:48,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Final update some more.

328
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:50,742
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the familiar word to everyone.

329
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:51,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

330
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:53,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

331
00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:58,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so this one I found actually a couple of different committees do this.

332
00:32:58,385 --> 00:33:02,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that from our, um, sorry.

333
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:05,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we can one of our members.

334
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:07,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see everybody.

336
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:12,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jenny.

337
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:12,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

338
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you unmute yourself?

339
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:15,552
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't unmute.

340
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:19,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can make you a, um, I cannot make you.

341
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,791
[SPEAKER_00]: well, actually ask to unmute.

342
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:26,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will give you the freedom to, there you are.

343
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:29,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're unmuted now, Jenny.

344
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:29,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

345
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:40,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have a question about the enrollment report, which I've been like waving my hand like a crazy person all this time and nobody could clearly see me.

346
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:46,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have talked on a number of occasions about, you know,

347
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:54,969
[SPEAKER_09]: desiring, wanting, needing information about our charter school enrollments and students.

348
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:58,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't have any visibility into that right now.

349
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:06,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not suggesting necessarily that that is part of the enrollment report because the enrollment report means something very specific to DESE.

350
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:17,214
[SPEAKER_09]: But on this same frequency, I believe that we should have visibility into how many students we are paying to send to charter schools from Medford Public Schools.

351
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:22,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So and I what I don't know, I don't think it necessarily has to be at the same time.

352
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:26,717
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think, you know, on a similar interval, that is a report.

353
00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:30,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was looking back to the old list of reports that was definitely on there.

354
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:39,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And that really should be presented to us because it has significant budget impacts.

355
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:41,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.

356
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:42,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

357
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:44,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

358
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:49,170
[SPEAKER_07]: So two things, if I may, through a member or so.

359
00:34:49,670 --> 00:35:04,459
[SPEAKER_07]: When we're talking about looking back at the old list of reports, I'm wondering what old list of reports, if you're talking about an aggregation of looking through all previous meetings, or is there actually a list of old reports?

360
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just looking at an old agenda.

361
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:07,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.

362
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:08,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

363
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:15,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other was regarding enrollment as well to member Graham's point, charter school enrollment.

364
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:17,459
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would also say out of district.

365
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:31,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think when you talk about the enrollment report,

366
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:44,125
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, whatever Jesse is requires is one thing, but I think from a from a usefulness perspective for for us and really for the public.

367
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:48,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I think our enrollment reports really should reflect

368
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:52,852
[SPEAKER_09]: some number of years of history.

369
00:35:53,512 --> 00:35:56,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I don't know if that's the same report.

370
00:35:56,295 --> 00:35:58,438
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like you can get that information.

371
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,620
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to go digging around on the DESE website.

372
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:10,531
[SPEAKER_09]: But you'll will we regularly hear in the community people making assumptions about our enrollment

373
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,491
[SPEAKER_09]: being one thing or another.

374
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:23,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And we shouldn't have to like dig or even spend a minute to ask somebody for something special to be able to answer those questions.

375
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:27,357
[SPEAKER_09]: It should just be really clear, like, you know, has our enrollment changed?

376
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:28,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes or no.

377
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:33,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And it should be just one of those things that's available on the report.

378
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:41,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it can all be kind of pulled together at the same time, I think that will allow everyone sort of that opportunity to understand our

379
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,516
[SPEAKER_09]: our current context as it relates to like past history.

380
00:36:46,596 --> 00:36:58,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we talk about budget changes versus enrollment versus all those other things, having some sort of historical data there, I think would be really valuable.

381
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:09,392
[SPEAKER_09]: So that may move it like really far from like the DSEE report in terms of its creation, I don't know, but I think it would be very useful.

382
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:12,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.

383
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:28,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that a lot of these reports, frankly, all of these reports should have sort of a background document similar to we did for the ad hoc report.

384
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:34,394
[SPEAKER_00]: In the ad hoc report policy, we ask the person submitting it to say, well, what do you wanna know?

385
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:36,836
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your questions that you're trying to get answers to?

386
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:39,358
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know,

387
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:50,028
[SPEAKER_00]: There, you know, as a member, I know I care very much about the historical context around, you know, is our enrollment growing or shrinking, or is it kind of just fluctuating normal?

388
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:52,369
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those are all really important questions.

389
00:37:52,909 --> 00:38:04,295
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than having a report that comes before us, we ask a pile of questions for which the answers aren't available because, you know, that person isn't sitting in front of an Excel spreadsheet.

390
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:08,737
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are, I think many of these reports

391
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:17,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which obviously I think is a little outside of the scope of this particular listing that we're working on, but should be its own effort.

392
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:25,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, should include a list of what are the data elements we want to know, you know, and what are the questions we as members are trying to get at?

393
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:32,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think there's anything particularly unique about, I say it out loud, everybody's always like Medford special and everybody's special.

394
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:38,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, the questions we want to ask about enrollment and all these other questions are the same questions that

395
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:42,189
[SPEAKER_00]: school committees across the country, frankly, probably ask.

396
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:53,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think all of that can easily be listed, and then we can work on the format of each of these.

397
00:38:53,278 --> 00:39:00,464
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the superintendent is, I can't say she's new anymore, but she's still pretty new and she has new staff.

398
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:05,408
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in just the last year, they have really made changes to some of the reports we get.

399
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:10,115
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel our significant improvements and look forward to more of those.

400
00:39:11,276 --> 00:39:19,161
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree that we need to include the historical data on many of these things, frankly, I mean, attendance.

401
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:28,507
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will go through and fix the titles of any of these acronyms that are here for the moment.

402
00:39:29,748 --> 00:39:30,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee goals.

403
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,211
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is we're supposed to actually have committee goals.

404
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:36,015
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.

405
00:39:37,697 --> 00:39:42,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ask me what our committee goals are for the last couple of years, I'm not sure I can answer that question.

406
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:47,064
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I put this on here.

407
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,046
[SPEAKER_00]: These are committee of the whole actually.

408
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:51,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if that one is.

409
00:39:53,509 --> 00:40:04,698
[SPEAKER_00]: So seems like we should really be doing that, whether it's annually or biannually, I don't know, but let's see, that's annually.

410
00:40:06,642 --> 00:40:09,844
[SPEAKER_00]: The district improvement plan, the school improvement plans, we get those.

411
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:11,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, I believe, are statutory.

412
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:12,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?

413
00:40:13,686 --> 00:40:15,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and they're done annually as well.

414
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:16,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

415
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:22,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiscal year draft.

416
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:25,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, didn't I already cover the draft audits?

417
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:31,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was I just... I may have talked... No, that's not the audit.

418
00:40:31,336 --> 00:40:32,756
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the... Okay, these are the audits.

419
00:40:35,272 --> 00:40:42,954
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty common to see a draft and then expect the auditor to issue a final report.

420
00:40:43,094 --> 00:40:46,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So I could see why both of those things would be listed.

421
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:47,275
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

422
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:51,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know for the shore, we have those.

423
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are statutory, actually.

424
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:54,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the draft wouldn't be.

425
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:57,338
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to find and approve one.

426
00:40:58,118 --> 00:41:02,460
[SPEAKER_00]: The school calendar, I mean, whether it's statutory or not, we obviously have to have one.

427
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:11,214
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this year we had a little trouble getting our school committee calendar actually set for this year until after the year had already begun.

428
00:41:11,775 --> 00:41:31,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So I added that here as not as part of the school calendar per se, it's not in that policy and it's not in the work we just did in December, but you know, that the superintendent will say, here's my recommendation for when you all should meet in the next year prior to the actual year beginning, I think it's good to have on the list.

429
00:41:33,301 --> 00:41:33,781
[SPEAKER_00]: school him.

430
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:34,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

431
00:41:35,622 --> 00:41:38,443
[SPEAKER_07]: So for school calendar and schedule of school committee meetings.

432
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:42,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, those mean we're considering those reports.

433
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:53,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they not just calendars like I don't understand how those reports so maybe if you guys well, that's a really good as I was working on the list.

434
00:41:53,648 --> 00:41:58,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to get very sort of spinning a bit.

435
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what is a report?

436
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:05,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this calendar is a document that will be presented that we have to approve.

437
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it technically, I mean, I feel like it is a report.

438
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:16,639
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a report of what the superintendent, when she took the policy we passed in December, she played it forward and gave us a pile of dates.

439
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:25,626
[SPEAKER_00]: The physical manifestation, in whatever format it ends up being, doesn't look like a report, but it feels to me like a report.

440
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:35,166
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that when I was talking, I talked to the superintendent earlier today, when we looked at this with Ms.

441
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Presser from MASC last year, was it last year?

442
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:43,107
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, it's all so long before times.

443
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:49,469
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this stuff is really about populating the annual calendar for the purposes of our agendas.

444
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:54,530
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I left it in here, even though it feels weird that it's

445
00:42:54,997 --> 00:42:57,780
[SPEAKER_00]: and listed as a report, but it will be presented.

446
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the recommendation from the superintendent and we would vote to approve the calendar unless we look through it and there's something about it we want to change.

447
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,434
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as crystal clear, I think, as it could be.

448
00:43:13,495 --> 00:43:19,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe report is part of the problem, the word report, but it's all I got for the moment.

449
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:24,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So the school handbook presentation, that's a thing, right?

450
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making that up, I remember that, correct?

451
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:28,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is correct.

452
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:44,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are tweaks and adjustments made, for example, if a bullying policy or something else may be added or adjusted, such as the discipline adjustments that we made for next school year.

453
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:48,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So those kinds of changes would be added to the handbook.

454
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:58,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the presentation of changes or other, you know, technical changes would be presented as a report.

455
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:14,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think for the purpose of people being able to easily identify, maybe we can highlight the sections that were either added or deleted from the previous version, just to make it easier to see the modifications that were made.

456
00:44:15,872 --> 00:44:16,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

457
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:16,592
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.

458
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:21,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that's why I actually included the word changes because, you know, the handbooks are substantial.

459
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:33,363
[SPEAKER_00]: The elementary ones are all look pretty much the same and the middle school ones are the same, but like as a total number of pages to read it, I think it would be great to be able to see a highlight of what did change year to year.

460
00:44:33,483 --> 00:44:36,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I included that word.

461
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:43,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Community schools, we got this report, I believe last year, or we asked for it.

462
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:45,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, not 100% sure where we are.

463
00:44:46,824 --> 00:44:50,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that I just felt like we needed a name better than community schools.

464
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:54,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes.

465
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:57,544
[SPEAKER_07]: May I make a suggestion?

466
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:00,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know some of these are reports and some of these are presentations.

467
00:45:00,486 --> 00:45:05,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know, maybe it's, you know, periodic presentations for school committee.

468
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:11,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So because a report, you know, falls under a presentation as well, but a presentation isn't necessarily a report.

469
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:18,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So just, yeah, I know it's sort of, you know, just wordsmithing a little bit, but maybe that would be.

470
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:37,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually think of community schools as a report because it should include our current rates for the various things that we offer, our fee structures for athletics, everything else that goes through community schools.

471
00:45:37,928 --> 00:45:44,673
[SPEAKER_09]: It should include some description of everything that flows into and out of that revolving account.

472
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:46,334
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is one of those places where

473
00:45:48,188 --> 00:45:51,831
[SPEAKER_09]: those revolving accounts are very murky at best.

474
00:45:53,052 --> 00:46:05,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've only ever heard and not, we haven't talked about it recently, but I've only ever heard people say it's complicated and that is not good enough when we are responsible for public funds.

475
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:14,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So getting to a point of clarity around that, I think that to me, community schools is like a legitimate report with lots of data on it.

476
00:46:14,847 --> 00:46:17,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree with member Graham on that.

477
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:22,333
[SPEAKER_07]: That is definitely a report and needs a lot of data.

478
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:38,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would also ask that we consider looking at what the demographic of participation is as well in our community schools so that we're seeing who is participating and who is or is not able to be included on that would be really helpful.

479
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:40,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, good stuff.

480
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:46,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Professional development, I believe there's an annual report that's done for us of what professional development was done.

481
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:48,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that statutory or just?

482
00:46:50,178 --> 00:46:52,299
[SPEAKER_06]: We normally present it in March.

483
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:06,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's something that has been past practice, but it gives a explanation and like a catalog, an overview of all the professional development that took place over the course of the year.

484
00:47:07,552 --> 00:47:08,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, ma'am.

485
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:09,913
[SPEAKER_07]: We're so thank you.

486
00:47:10,433 --> 00:47:15,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I actually just asked about that for the superintendent and, um, um, Dr Rick Adelie.

487
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:31,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a chance to look at this last year and on a spreadsheet form, and actually, I was going to respond to the superintendent had responded that we could present they could present in March with this, but I would actually advocate if I'm my superintendent.

488
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:34,344
[SPEAKER_07]: that this be presented at the beginning of the year.

489
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:40,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that a lot of times it is already planned at the beginning of the year, although there are some instances where it may not be.

490
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:43,208
[SPEAKER_07]: But generally, I believe that Dr. Riccidale does it

491
00:47:44,032 --> 00:48:03,956
[SPEAKER_07]: this spring before if I'm not mistaken, and I understand things might shift obviously with COVID and what have you, but I think it really gives a good opportunity at the beginning of the year for school committee, for the community, for other folks to see what the trajectory is for professional development for the year and sort of wrap their minds around what other resources and support might be there for that.

492
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:10,617
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would really, instead of the end of the year, I would like to see this if we could in October.

493
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:36,452
[SPEAKER_06]: like to kindly counter with what you just explained to say, because we have the actual professional development session spread out, you know, in the fall, then the last actual PD that takes place is in March, to give an update in terms of what happened that year.

494
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:40,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And then either, you know, September,

495
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:48,657
[SPEAKER_06]: say this is the trajectory of what will be presented for the following school year.

496
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:51,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can see what's coming down the pike.

497
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:58,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the end of the year, late spring here, how, how it went, et cetera.

498
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:02,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Two different, two different asks.

499
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:04,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

500
00:49:05,672 --> 00:49:13,455
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that I would wanna know every time I've ever seen a PD report, it's just sort of a list of classes.

501
00:49:15,156 --> 00:49:25,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also interested in our compliance rate when we identify something as mandatory and our participation rates for optional classes.

502
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:33,683
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we talked in the curriculum subcommittee meeting recently about some professional development that's being offered by

503
00:49:34,863 --> 00:49:54,966
[SPEAKER_09]: um massachusetts partnership for you no um suzanna campbell um and i think that's really important work but it's optional pd so for us to say that we are offering it um my question is really about like

504
00:49:56,034 --> 00:50:03,159
[SPEAKER_09]: it's fine if it's optional and we have really high participation, we're not meeting our objectives if it's optional and we have no participation.

505
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:21,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So even for things that are optional, particularly because I think there's a lot of really important things that end up in the optional bucket given the structure of our, or the availability of how much PD time we have in our calendar and in our contract, I think it's really important to understand

506
00:50:22,514 --> 00:50:34,183
[SPEAKER_09]: where the participation is so that we can make good decisions about funding and prioritization of those kinds of things when we're trying to figure out what those goals are and how we move forward to meet them.

507
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:48,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, yes, and I think you hit upon a point though also that, one second, I accidentally used the back button and that took everything out.

508
00:50:50,035 --> 00:50:51,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it take all of the things I just typed out?

509
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:55,403
[SPEAKER_00]: It did.

510
00:50:59,405 --> 00:51:15,352
[SPEAKER_00]: But the issue of, you know, if we think things should be, if we want things to be mandatory, but we are not building enough time and spending enough money in our contracts to even make it possible, then that's how we can find out.

511
00:51:15,432 --> 00:51:18,213
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can say that the committee thinks this is critically important.

512
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:23,165
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody should do it, but then there's not enough time to technically even do it.

513
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:27,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need that when we're talking about contract negotiations and at budgeted time.

514
00:51:27,686 --> 00:51:28,567
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta right this whole.

515
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:34,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

516
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to mention also two things.

517
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:43,835
[SPEAKER_07]: One is that the disability awareness curriculum that Susanna Campbell is doing commences tomorrow.

518
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:50,598
[SPEAKER_07]: And she said I could extend an invitation for school committee members to attend the four o'clock

519
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:54,316
[SPEAKER_07]: presentation on disability rights as human rights.

520
00:51:55,536 --> 00:52:00,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Full disclosure, I do the presentation, I share the presentation, but it's a really powerful presentation.

521
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanted to put that out for you folks, if you're able to attend, it's at four o'clock tomorrow.

522
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:11,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to sort of see the similarities across all areas of equity.

523
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:18,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other is regarding professional development and to your point, or to Member Graham's point around

524
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:21,941
[SPEAKER_07]: mandatory or not mandatory.

525
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:24,942
[SPEAKER_07]: There is also some opportunities that have been presented.

526
00:52:24,962 --> 00:52:35,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if they're part of Dr. Riccadeli's report or if they will be, superintendent, but the Special Education Parent Advisory Council, thank you to the superintendent and to Dr. Riccadeli.

527
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:45,627
[SPEAKER_07]: There are now professional development points that can be earned through those meetings that are appropriate, whether they're presented by the Federation for Children with Special Needs, such as basic,

528
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:51,010
[SPEAKER_07]: rights or tonight transition meeting with Attorney Sindala or what have you.

529
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:57,094
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are also professional development opportunities that are not mandatory, but that do earn professional development points.

530
00:52:57,754 --> 00:53:03,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just suggest also that those opportunities be included if they might be in the report.

531
00:53:03,658 --> 00:53:06,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm wondering what the superintendent's take on that might be.

532
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:14,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely, for the additional professional development,

533
00:53:16,202 --> 00:53:30,682
[SPEAKER_06]: with any CPAC course offerings, I would definitely be willing to present that data and say how many staff we've had taking advantage of this additional professional development.

534
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:36,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

535
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

536
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:41,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to pay attention to the time.

537
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:43,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I put short collaborative on here.

538
00:53:43,745 --> 00:54:00,096
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the chairman of the board there, and we receive a quarterly report that we can bring, sort of the goal is to just bring it back and give it to our committees and our packets, just as a heads up, this is what's going on.

539
00:54:00,116 --> 00:54:04,719
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that the last report that I got,

540
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,319
[SPEAKER_00]: I had not done that before, which is on me.

541
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:14,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin, you're muted now.

542
00:54:17,086 --> 00:54:19,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I need $5 for every time I'm told that.

543
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:27,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if we have, uh, if we're getting reports from other out of district collaboratives.

544
00:54:28,925 --> 00:54:32,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Um and if so, uh, or should we?

545
00:54:33,047 --> 00:54:34,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this begs the question.

546
00:54:34,168 --> 00:54:40,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering why we're getting them from short collaborative or have we been historically or maybe you guys can give me some

547
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:50,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, can you unmute yourself, Loni?

548
00:54:55,373 --> 00:54:55,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

549
00:54:56,814 --> 00:55:00,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So Melanie, Medford was one of the key districts.

550
00:55:01,736 --> 00:55:09,578
[SPEAKER_08]: There were either six, there's been one that went in and out and whatever, but was one of the original districts that started Shore Collaborative.

551
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:13,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we had a very special relationship with them for a long time.

552
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,802
[SPEAKER_08]: We also had far more students than our present enrollment.

553
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:32,694
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the number of students has fallen as we've brought more kids back into our own programs, for example, and either sought different alternatives.

554
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:42,538
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things about SURE was that it started out because the costs for outplacements were so high and districts working together

555
00:55:42,995 --> 00:55:47,960
[SPEAKER_08]: determined that they could provide better quality programs for a lot less expense.

556
00:55:49,902 --> 00:55:52,645
[SPEAKER_08]: SURE was originally directed under Hank Owens.

557
00:55:52,665 --> 00:56:01,213
[SPEAKER_08]: You may know the SURE Center is called the Hank Owens Report, who was a very dynamic leader for many, many years.

558
00:56:02,134 --> 00:56:04,437
[SPEAKER_08]: But that, you know, the,

559
00:56:06,288 --> 00:56:18,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really a terrific opportunity when you are the rep, because you get to meet monthly with a school committee member from each of the member districts.

560
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:23,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And I always know when I was the rep, as Paul is now, that that was a great thing.

561
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:27,644
[SPEAKER_08]: But our membership has fallen a lot.

562
00:56:28,244 --> 00:56:29,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So we still have that position.

563
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:35,910
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still one of the founding members and whatever, but we've never had that with any other out

564
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:37,530
[SPEAKER_08]: out placement.

565
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:40,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

566
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,031
[SPEAKER_07]: That's helpful.

567
00:56:41,071 --> 00:56:45,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm just thinking in terms of Oh, no.

568
00:56:46,513 --> 00:56:47,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I just worked quickly.

569
00:56:47,313 --> 00:56:50,654
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were almost out of time and I want to try and plow through these.

570
00:56:51,614 --> 00:57:00,337
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we can, if it's okay with you, member McLaughlin, I'll just put here and put, you know, a question mark and other out of district

571
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and move on to the out of district placement reports.

572
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:13,228
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we have them and can get them and I don't know that other, you know, do other, um, our district placements even have this kind of a thing.

573
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:16,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Do their boards put this together or not?

574
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:16,631
[SPEAKER_00]: But.

575
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:18,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that okay?

576
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:20,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Great bullying.

577
00:57:20,734 --> 00:57:23,897
[SPEAKER_00]: We did just pass a new policy, which will be one of our next

578
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe bullying is an actual report, and I believe it is statutory.

579
00:57:35,413 --> 00:57:36,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, well, we can confirm that.

580
00:57:36,894 --> 00:57:38,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin?

581
00:57:38,796 --> 00:57:42,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, would discipline fall in that category as well, just a data on discipline?

582
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:44,941
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but thank you.

583
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:50,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Discipline.

584
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:56,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely want that, especially after the thing we did.

585
00:57:57,472 --> 00:57:57,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.

586
00:57:59,202 --> 00:58:02,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I'm getting so many alerts for trying to run this meeting.

587
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:04,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'll add that.

588
00:58:04,844 --> 00:58:12,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of those I believe are, the discipline I believe is a canned report from DESE that, I mean, obviously we don't have to make it look like they can report.

589
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:16,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And bullying I think is a similar thing.

590
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:27,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Before and after school, I think that's sort of along the same lines as community schools, the fee structure, enrollment,

591
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:42,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only thing I would say about the timing of, and maybe it applies for community schools as well, is we should be voting to set rates.

592
00:58:43,878 --> 00:58:51,502
[SPEAKER_09]: So that annual cadence should be in advance enough that the school committee can formally vote

593
00:58:52,665 --> 00:58:56,748
[SPEAKER_09]: on the rates which Howard said we should be doing and we haven't done.

594
00:58:57,368 --> 00:59:01,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to do it before the rates are set and communicated out.

595
00:59:02,191 --> 00:59:08,656
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know with afterschool in particular, it's a big deal to get that registration out.

596
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:10,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we've talked about it in our kindergarten.

597
00:59:12,678 --> 00:59:14,358
[SPEAKER_09]: work and other places.

598
00:59:14,398 --> 00:59:27,541
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know there's just a timeline there that we need to be watchful of so that those rates can be set well in advance of the rollout, which seems like it's getting earlier and earlier every year.

599
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:31,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So just that one in particular has a timing implication.

600
00:59:31,882 --> 00:59:40,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Community schools maybe isn't quite so early in the year, but also time sensitive if we're talking about rate setting.

601
00:59:41,564 --> 00:59:43,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, thank you.

602
00:59:44,065 --> 00:59:50,386
[SPEAKER_00]: The student representative report, I saw this on, I think, two other school committee lists.

603
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:52,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul?

604
00:59:52,246 --> 00:59:52,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

605
00:59:52,866 --> 01:00:05,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I had put that on because, so over the years it's differed, but there were some years when we've had the student rep has asked to give a report, and it's maybe been a couple of them.

606
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:09,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time they do, we've asked them, say, this is terrific, this is great.

607
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,152
[SPEAKER_08]: and we ask them to continue to do it.

608
01:00:12,512 --> 01:00:19,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the students change, unless we're asking for it, I don't think that they'll, the students won't necessarily know.

609
01:00:19,697 --> 01:00:27,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put, I was one of the people who put it on saying that we've done it in the past and when we do, it's great.

610
01:00:27,802 --> 01:00:32,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So we should ask that it be done at least on an annual basis.

611
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:37,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the student reps obviously are always there to be able to contribute, but I think that sometimes

612
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: asking for them to give us a report has been very helpful.

613
01:00:42,911 --> 01:00:43,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

614
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:43,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

615
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:45,453
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent background.

616
01:00:45,493 --> 01:00:50,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll look for an existing older report sort of to give a sort of some context there.

617
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:51,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Food service.

618
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is obviously the financials.

619
01:00:57,163 --> 01:00:59,745
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also gonna be participation rates.

620
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:02,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, Paul.

621
01:01:04,017 --> 01:01:08,478
[SPEAKER_08]: With food service, it was my understanding that we were supposed to have just the way we have a PAC.

622
01:01:09,618 --> 01:01:23,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I think with food service, unless it's changed, we were also supposed to have a inclusive committee for food service that would also give feedback to the committee.

623
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:27,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe we met, obviously last year isn't a good comparison.

624
01:01:31,173 --> 01:01:39,739
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly for many years, we would meet yearly for food service report, which was also inclusive of issues with food service.

625
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:47,445
[SPEAKER_08]: We might have asked for some feedback about the quality of the food, what we're seeing.

626
01:01:47,885 --> 01:01:49,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually there were students included.

627
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:52,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's kind of dropped off recently.

628
01:01:52,328 --> 01:01:55,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry, my other phone is ringing, so I'll mute myself.

629
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:55,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

630
01:01:55,911 --> 01:01:57,312
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great, yeah.

631
01:02:00,077 --> 01:02:06,720
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely a lot of need for more looking into what's going on in food service and making sure we understand.

632
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,821
[SPEAKER_00]: The PTO reports, we've had those before.

633
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:11,802
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can just leave that as is.

634
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:14,904
[SPEAKER_00]: The access testing report, is that the WIDA results?

635
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:16,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

636
01:02:17,565 --> 01:02:24,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm gonna delete that because it's down there further and I'll put that in the access results.

637
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:27,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, can someone tell me what WIDA is?

638
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:29,490
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

639
01:02:30,057 --> 01:02:32,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the ELL testing right now.

640
01:02:34,419 --> 01:02:46,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a second and I'll get the actual, it's the equivalent of the MCAS, the WIDA exam, access WIDA testing for our ELL students from DESE.

641
01:02:46,885 --> 01:02:57,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a much larger, this year they gave a longer testing window and it assesses their speaking and

642
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:01,973
[SPEAKER_06]: It will provide their ELV levels.

643
01:03:02,013 --> 01:03:06,676
[SPEAKER_06]: It impacts how students move through the English language development levels.

644
01:03:07,456 --> 01:03:07,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

645
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:11,659
[SPEAKER_07]: May I add ELL to that, Member Ruseau?

646
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:12,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

647
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:19,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'll give that a much better name because I know I forgot it as well.

648
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:24,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Department reports, I have this generic thing because I think many of the departments give a report.

649
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that is during the budget season.

650
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:27,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just leave that for now.

651
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:31,642
[SPEAKER_00]: We are out of time and I just want to try and plow through these real quick.

652
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:33,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology report.

653
01:03:33,783 --> 01:03:36,604
[SPEAKER_00]: We get something along the lines of this during the budget.

654
01:03:37,264 --> 01:03:39,785
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of these reports may end up being part of the budget process.

655
01:03:40,645 --> 01:03:48,467
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that in the last budget process, we were very concerned about all the gory details about our technology and end of life and all that.

656
01:03:48,507 --> 01:03:49,287
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can plan.

657
01:03:50,047 --> 01:03:51,048
[SPEAKER_00]: A health report.

658
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:53,748
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a major topic last year.

659
01:03:53,828 --> 01:03:56,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that next year,

660
01:03:57,675 --> 01:04:10,060
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the issues around how many students have not been vaccinated once they can be and all that other business will become a new, it will become the new measles, mumps and rubella and conversation.

661
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,841
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured we should get it on here.

662
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:17,663
[SPEAKER_00]: The burn report, which I know needs a better name, because sometimes even finance people are like, what's that?

663
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:21,464
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I have an example from the shore.

664
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:26,406
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you know, last month we spent this much money, the budget was this much.

665
01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:29,336
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of our year to date utilization.

666
01:04:30,216 --> 01:04:36,039
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know early on if we are burning through money faster than we expected.

667
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:40,621
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course in public education, things are always wacky.

668
01:04:40,721 --> 01:04:45,823
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you might spend all your money in the first couple of months for the year or all of it at the end of the year.

669
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:55,427
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not quite as simple as it would be for like a normal business, but EKL send out, I've never seen this in my life.

670
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Superintendent, what is EKL, do you know?

671
01:05:01,372 --> 01:05:06,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the PTO registration, Emily K. Lazzaro.

672
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:07,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

673
01:05:08,317 --> 01:05:10,158
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where the EKL came from.

674
01:05:10,178 --> 01:05:10,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

675
01:05:11,118 --> 01:05:13,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just saying to myself, I think it's PTO as well.

676
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the other letters mean for.

677
01:05:16,442 --> 01:05:17,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.

678
01:05:17,102 --> 01:05:17,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

679
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:18,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take the EKL off.

680
01:05:20,364 --> 01:05:21,245
[SPEAKER_06]: That is classic.

681
01:05:23,346 --> 01:05:24,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety report.

682
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:30,330
[SPEAKER_00]: get that I think every December and, you know, the content of that we'll have to work on.

683
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:34,894
[SPEAKER_00]: The grades 5-6 transition middle school lottery report and plan.

684
01:05:35,174 --> 01:05:39,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a plan, frankly, but there is usually a report as well.

685
01:05:40,638 --> 01:05:41,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Transportation.

686
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, lots of money there.

687
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:45,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 74 updates.

688
01:05:48,622 --> 01:05:50,523
[SPEAKER_00]: again, the wider, the pre-budget.

689
01:05:51,064 --> 01:05:53,426
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably gonna be a bunch of different things here for budget.

690
01:05:53,506 --> 01:05:54,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get into those at all.

691
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:59,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And the budget legal notice is, I'm not even sure that is a report.

692
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:00,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

693
01:06:03,657 --> 01:06:10,339
[SPEAKER_06]: The legal notice has to be officially posted in advance, 14 days in advance.

694
01:06:10,379 --> 01:06:11,719
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's like the law.

695
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:19,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had to push back a budget meeting once because we weren't able to get to the 14 days.

696
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:22,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we have it down.

697
01:06:22,682 --> 01:06:26,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're making sure we're posting it well ahead of the deadline.

698
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:28,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.

699
01:06:29,024 --> 01:06:31,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor McLaughlin, did you have your hand up?

700
01:06:32,142 --> 01:06:33,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm, I did.

701
01:06:34,443 --> 01:06:37,225
[SPEAKER_07]: The Coordinated Program Review, Special Education.

702
01:06:38,005 --> 01:06:38,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

703
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:45,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do we, the CPR, hi there, Ms.

704
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:46,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen, I see your hand up.

705
01:06:49,512 --> 01:06:52,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, it's called the tiered focus monitoring now.

706
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:55,835
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no longer CPR, so it is tiered focus monitoring.

707
01:06:55,855 --> 01:07:00,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, now I finally figured out what it's called.

708
01:07:01,193 --> 01:07:01,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, right?

709
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:03,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just put special education with that.

710
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:20,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I would also just respectfully ask that that include information also as a subcategory for the discipline, but any civil rights complaints, data on problem resolution.

711
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is problem resolution called now, Ms.

712
01:07:22,797 --> 01:07:23,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Bowen?

713
01:07:23,817 --> 01:07:24,837
[SPEAKER_07]: They changed that name too.

714
01:07:24,857 --> 01:07:25,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still PRS.

715
01:07:27,017 --> 01:07:28,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was PQA, it's PRS.

716
01:07:28,598 --> 01:07:30,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm dating myself now.

717
01:07:30,783 --> 01:07:43,010
[SPEAKER_07]: So problem resolution and then a subcategory for legal fees or any lawsuits that have been filed under that account.

718
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I'm not following.

719
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:45,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this part of this report?

720
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:47,053
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving me data elements?

721
01:07:48,854 --> 01:07:49,755
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not part of the report.

722
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:52,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I would expand this report to include those items respectfully.

723
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:55,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, that's fine.

724
01:07:55,558 --> 01:07:58,680
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna just send those to me, we're over and I wanna let people run.

725
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:08,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I will share this document with the members here so we can have another meeting once we've really filled it all the way out.

726
01:08:10,165 --> 01:08:15,028
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can fill it all the way out prior to our next meeting, I will make this just one of the items on the agenda.

727
01:08:15,228 --> 01:08:18,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham, are you able to unmute?

728
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:20,550
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let me do that for you.

729
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:21,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now try.

730
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:23,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

731
01:08:24,005 --> 01:08:27,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I muted myself because the printer was going and then evidently I was stuck.

732
01:08:28,547 --> 01:08:29,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I have several other things.

733
01:08:29,547 --> 01:08:33,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want me just to send them to you since we're out of time or?

734
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:37,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Several like two or twelve?

735
01:08:38,972 --> 01:08:39,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Three.

736
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead.

737
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:47,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the first one we talked about kindergarten enrollment reporting in June.

738
01:08:47,683 --> 01:09:11,177
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, to look at that comparatively over time in terms of like where we are with kindergarten enrollment in June of every year, as well as, you know, sort of where we are in June versus where we land in maybe October or something like that to be able to sort of fill out the history of what our kindergarten enrollment looks like.

739
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:24,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also like to make sure that we add a summary of our early literacy testing results.

740
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:29,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are testing K to two students.

741
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:30,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it three times a year?

742
01:09:30,945 --> 01:09:33,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And we,

743
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:49,143
[SPEAKER_09]: we should be receiving results from each of those testing periods so that we can be informed about where the results are at, is progress being made, report over report, et cetera.

744
01:09:49,163 --> 01:09:57,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the final thing I have, which is maybe something that would only be able to be shared in executive session, but I don't,

745
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:21,673
[SPEAKER_09]: um feel like we have any visibility into the number of grievances that are filed by our union membership um and since we are the holders of those contracts um I think we need to have some sort of visibility into like are we you know is it one grievance is it a hundred grievances um so we obviously like need to sort of

746
01:10:22,414 --> 01:10:24,118
[SPEAKER_09]: navigate the details carefully.

747
01:10:24,138 --> 01:10:28,128
[SPEAKER_09]: But as we talk about contract,

748
01:10:30,407 --> 01:10:39,611
[SPEAKER_09]: management and hygiene, like if we have contracts where we have high numbers of grievances, those are sort of indicators that we should be watching as a school committee and the holder of those contracts.

749
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:49,995
[SPEAKER_09]: So some sort of report of grievances and like, I don't know, maybe it's just, are they settling for the member or not?

750
01:10:50,755 --> 01:10:57,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there maybe some sort of categorization or something that would help us be informed

751
01:10:58,115 --> 01:11:00,836
[SPEAKER_09]: as we think about go forward negotiations.

752
01:11:01,937 --> 01:11:02,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, I like those.

753
01:11:02,957 --> 01:11:04,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my three.

754
01:11:05,338 --> 01:11:05,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

755
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody else have any last moments, any last comments?

756
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,403
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly email me and I will share this with everybody here.

757
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

758
01:11:15,983 --> 01:11:17,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a second?

759
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:18,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

760
01:11:20,105 --> 01:11:21,946
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, member Graham.
