1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:11,802
We are getting started on the Medford Charter Study Committee Ethics Subcommittee meeting on July 1st, 2024.

2
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:13,463
It's just you and me today, Eunice.

3
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:15,945
Our other two members were unable.

4
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:20,009
We might see Maury, but do you want to get things going?

5
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:26,763
Um, yeah, I mean, I think this was brought about, um, I had done some, uh.

6
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:34,226
Research, um, as part of, uh, taking a look at article 9 general provisions, um, on what.

7
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:38,548
You know, other charters include, um, looking at maybe 20 or 30 other charters.

8
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:52,549
And this was one particular topic that I unearthed from Framingham's charter, where they have an ethics provision to have

9
00:00:55,843 --> 00:01:19,148
both candidates running for office, and then when they're seated, of course, as well as specific department heads like DPW, procurement, finance, and so forth, complete and submit a statement of financial interest.

10
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:25,290
I haven't been able to see yet what their form actually is.

11
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:33,315
If it's the will of this group to pursue this, I will probably give somebody in Framingham a call and see if I can find it.

12
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:42,620
But they did say that in their text that it would be substantially similar to what the state requires.

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,061
And I looked at that form.

14
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:45,662
Right.

15
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,563
And that's pretty intense.

16
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:49,864
Let me see.

17
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:51,584
I'm not good at this sharing stuff.

18
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,325
I think I can share it.

19
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:54,745
Yes.

20
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:57,666
I put it in our drive last night.

21
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:11,930
But that particular form is 42 pages long and it is required of state officials and state and county elected officials.

22
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,391
It's very, very comprehensive.

23
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:15,932
Yeah, it sure is.

24
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:25,901
I understand the point of it and I think it certainly belongs as is at the state level.

25
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:31,463
I'm not sure if something quite like that should be used at the local level.

26
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:44,889
But I think where I'm going with all of this after having, and I did some homework yesterday as well, went to about 20 or 30.

27
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:55,266
communities also, most communities don't have anything like this at all.

28
00:02:57,407 --> 00:03:15,977
Framingham, of the 20 or 30 that I looked at, and I could have looked at more and ran out of time, Framingham is the only one that I could see that includes any sort of statement of financial interest in their charter.

29
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,758
Yeah, it's done via ordinance.

30
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:23,339
I believe Boston.

31
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,931
Cambridge, Somerville, and I think Springfield.

32
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:28,771
Springfield.

33
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:29,671
I found Springfield.

34
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,572
Yeah.

35
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:35,433
OK, then I think that might have been the one that you put in the thing.

36
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,553
So I'm like, where'd that come from?

37
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:38,554
And those are all by ordinance.

38
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:39,774
All by ordinance.

39
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:46,776
I think where I'm kind of going with this, because our job is not to write ordinances.

40
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:50,797
It's to put it in the charter.

41
00:03:54,021 --> 00:04:02,846
uh, that, and I think what we should do is identify that who, what, and when.

42
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:20,134
So, so the, what being in two parts, what is that there will be a financial statement of financial disclosure completed, um, by whom I think we need to define who,

43
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:41,854
will be required to complete that by when, a certain timeframe from when either taking office or becoming employed.

44
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:48,936
Then the other part of the what is, what is the form going to look like?

45
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:54,644
Yeah, I'm just trying to see what they say about the actual form.

46
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:57,645
Is this Framingham's?

47
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:58,766
Yeah, this is Framingham's.

48
00:04:59,426 --> 00:04:59,626
Yeah.

49
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,806
Let me see.

50
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:11,430
So it says, this form is prescribed by the city clerk, and it's similar to the state ethics.

51
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,330
D, I think.

52
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,650
Yeah.

53
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:18,952
So basically, they give the authority to the city clerk, is what it looks like.

54
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,027
Right.

55
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,830
So I think we need to put something.

56
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:38,240
And then the mayor shall propose an ordinance to implement this section of the charter, which is unclear exactly what that means, because they do say who it has to be.

57
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,983
They don't actually say, do they say that the clerk is actually reviewing it?

58
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,741
They're just issuing receipt verification.

59
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:59,907
And they don't say anything about making it public.

60
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:01,448
No.

61
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:10,593
I mean, I was talking to a friend of mine over the weekend who ran for office at one point, and that person

62
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:25,320
said you know that this seems to be sort of the kind of thing that you submit and it doesn't maybe get another look unless somebody raises an issue.

63
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:36,490
you know, somebody comes along and says, seems like this person has some sort of a conflict or, you know, right, your hand in the cookie jar or something like that.

64
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,611
And then you go and look at their form.

65
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:45,954
And oh, yeah, lo and behold, you know, they're, you know, they're in bed with the developer or something like that.

66
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:52,659
Um, you know, to me, this is the kind of thing that would be sort of similar to a quarry where.

67
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,043
It goes into a repository somewhere and.

68
00:06:57,943 --> 00:07:00,585
Only a very small set of eyes gets to look at it.

69
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:00,645
So.

70
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:07,119
Um, yeah, you know, I mean, I've worked in schools.

71
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,559
I've been queried a ton of times.

72
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,880
So people get to see them.

73
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:12,940
Right?

74
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,640
This is a little more.

75
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,961
Comprehensive, usually a core, you just have to.

76
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:19,801
They just do it on you.

77
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:22,502
You don't I mean, this form is pretty intense.

78
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:27,503
Well, that's just it and, you know, kind of looking through this.

79
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:32,754
I, I guess getting back to kind of something that David said.

80
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:38,116
And, you know, I was smelling this over over the weekend.

81
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:42,998
Is the idea of it.

82
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:48,501
Discouraging candidates does concern me.

83
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:53,663
I don't think this should be asked of candidates.

84
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:57,365
I mean, in a way, I, I mean, I.

85
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:03,735
I think that, well, if it's not going to be public, you're right.

86
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:18,967
Part of the reason for asking for it from candidates is so that, I mean, if we're talking about transparency, which was what was mentioned during the meeting, you would think that these would be available to the public, but that's not necessarily what we're talking about, right?

87
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,813
So if they're not going to be available to the public, then I guess candidates don't matter.

88
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:47,862
But I think when the elections office prepares their packets for people running for office, if I go in next June and I want to pull papers to run for city council, to my knowledge, and your kid ran, maybe you know a little bit more about this than I do.

89
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:51,064
But I think you get a packet of stuff.

90
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:52,945
You get your nomination papers to fill out.

91
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:54,506
You get your finance.

92
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:58,582
Information and sort of a how to.

93
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:05,865
I would want this included somehow.

94
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:13,087
Either the mention of this, or even a copy of whatever the form is going to look like.

95
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:16,569
With the mention that.

96
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,814
You don't need to fill this out now.

97
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:31,096
But if you win a seat, you will be required to complete this within 90 days of being sworn in or something like that.

98
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:37,417
So that if you lose, you run, you lose, no harm, no foul.

99
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:41,318
But if you win a seat, you're going to have to submit this.

100
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,540
No, I'm just looking at Cambridge's ordinance.

101
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:55,270
I mean, they don't maybe necessarily post the statements, but they do mention public access to the state.

102
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,480
Well, it could be if you do a FOIA for it.

103
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:08,298
Or of course, if you do a FOIA for something, I've done FOIAs for stuff.

104
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:12,299
And when I get the information, I post it on Facebook.

105
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:18,720
Once somebody does a FOIA, then who knows where that stuff goes.

106
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,801
And they do require candidates in Cambridge to do it.

107
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:26,402
I think Taveed had a good point.

108
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:36,101
To maybe talk to some candidates or some potential candidates and say, maybe show them in the form from the state.

109
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:42,483
And say, yeah, I'm trying to see if we can get the forms that the other communities use and say.

110
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:54,347
Yeah, I think that in order to, I mean, we can, the Framingham Charter says that their form will be, you know, that the state form is the model.

111
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:57,329
So that, I think, could be used.

112
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:03,353
But I guess I would be interested in what Cambridge, Boston, and Springfield are using.

113
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:06,055
Cambridge's ordinance is very long.

114
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,056
Yeah.

115
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:09,857
You know, and it's very,

116
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:25,248
I should hope that the instructions they're giving to the people who have to fill out the form are a little bit easier to wade through than this ordinance.

117
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:32,875
Assuming they have a form, they just outline in this ordinance what is required to be included in the report.

118
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:47,023
I looked on, I think, both Cambridge and Somerville's websites yesterday, and I didn't see any form downloaded or anything.

119
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:48,305
It doesn't mean they didn't have one.

120
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:56,354
So they maybe don't have a form because they are very, it's outlined in a very detailed way what has to be reported.

121
00:11:56,694 --> 00:12:09,226
So I suppose, you know, if you went through the ordinance one by one and said, okay, identity of equity in a business to which the reported reporting person is associated, which has been transferred.

122
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,128
So, I mean, uh,

123
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:21,407
Equity and if you don't have any equity in a business, then okay, skip that one, et cetera.

124
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:34,252
And then they say enforcement, they say the election commission shall determine whether any reporting person has failed to file a statement or has filed a deficient statement.

125
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:42,035
And then the election commission notifies the delinquent if they determine that.

126
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:53,061
And the election commission outlines the penalties for failure to file a correct statement, whatever those are.

127
00:12:53,081 --> 00:13:05,430
And a fine, they can get fined not more than $300 a day.

128
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,053
That adds up.

129
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:12,736
And the city may commence a civil action to collect the fine.

130
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:20,089
And they report the failure to file to the Attorney General and the VA.

131
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:37,898
And then they talk about the penalties for a false statement of interest and discipline, including suspension, termination, or censure, consistent with any requirements of the state civil service law and city charter and ordinances.

132
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:38,318
Okay.

133
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:45,447
You know, Cambridge's ordinance is pretty comprehensive.

134
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,430
I imagine Boston's is as well.

135
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,273
Yeah, it's probably a lot like Cambridge's.

136
00:13:56,496 --> 00:14:05,043
And then the thing that I found for Springfield was just this whole manual that they had, which talked about, they have a whole ethics commission, right?

137
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:08,445
And then, oh wait, and they say their forms are in here.

138
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:12,249
We could look at Springfield's forms.

139
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:34,462
I wonder if we could make a recommendation in the charter or maybe, I don't know, this would have to go back to the full group, but recommend or require

140
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:41,046
Um, or maybe in the final report that the city establish an ethics commission.

141
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,467
Um, okay, so.

142
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:50,548
You know, by ordinance.

143
00:14:52,428 --> 00:15:01,170
So, I feel like we have a couple of things we, we have, um, David suggestion, which I think is a good 1 and we probably should follow up on it too.

144
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:17,073
talk to some people who could potentially be affected by this, elected candidates and employees, department heads or whatever, and see what their thoughts are.

145
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:26,936
I mean, this is purely a transparency issue because the state laws govern the conflict of, oh, here's more.

146
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:30,298
State laws govern conflict of interest.

147
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:38,236
It's not like this would be to find, you know, theoretically that's covered under state law, right?

148
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:49,881
So this would be more, maybe it would reveal some more subtle issues and it would be information for people to look at.

149
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,303
So let's say if you want to decide, should I vote for this person?

150
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:58,045
I'm going to look at their financial statement and see if I think they have any conflicts of interest.

151
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:04,141
I'd be curious to see, hey Mari, you're on mute.

152
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:08,463
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:22,391
To that end then, I would be curious to see, I was playing around on the state site yesterday, took me a long time to find that form, but you can go in and see

154
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,699
who filed a form.

155
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,821
So I picked Mr. Donato, for starters.

156
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,763
He's probably the one most well-known to us.

157
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:49,549
And I was able to see that he filed his most recently required form, but then you have to go through another hoop to be able to look at it.

158
00:16:50,127 --> 00:17:01,834
Yeah, so I imagine, so it's not like, so if people filed these things, they're not going to be publicly posted, but somebody who really wanted to see them could, there's a way for them to access it.

159
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:07,437
Right, now I suppose if I wanted to do a FOIA for Mr. Donato's form,

160
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:22,435
or go through whatever extra hoop is required, I could download that or photocopy it or scan it or take a picture of it or whatever and post it to Kingdom Come if I wanted to.

161
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:23,075
Yeah.

162
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:29,496
That was one of the concerns that was mentioned at the meeting is on a certain level, it's pretty intrusive.

163
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:31,497
Yeah.

164
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:34,057
I mean, Devine had a good way of putting it.

165
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:35,377
Yeah, exactly.

166
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:37,258
Like going outside in your underwear.

167
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:39,355
Yeah, exactly.

168
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:44,218
And so, you know, I mean, I personally have nothing to hide.

169
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:45,579
I own a home and that's about it.

170
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,660
But, you know, somebody did have, you know, a lot of

171
00:17:53,284 --> 00:18:00,046
you know, business interests and annuities and equities, and they're asking of the spouse, too.

172
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:05,947
Yeah, because, or some of the forms even mention family, other family members.

173
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:15,710
Yeah, you're, you know, if you have an adult kid at home with you, I don't think anybody would want, you know,

174
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:19,666
that floating around if you have a house on the Cape.

175
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:29,349
What if maybe the house on the Cape is in your spouse's name and not yours because he or she inherited it from her or his parents or something like that?

176
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,890
Yeah.

177
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,730
It's funny to me.

178
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:43,353
Maury, just to review, the only charter that we could find or that Eunice found, because Eunice is doing the research,

179
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:47,236
is Framingham that actually includes this in the charter.

180
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:56,565
And then the only communities that we could find that have such an ethics reporting requirement were Boston, Cambridge, and Springfield, but they don't put it in the charter.

181
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,427
Oh, Somerville has it as well?

182
00:18:58,807 --> 00:18:58,988
Yeah.

183
00:18:59,588 --> 00:18:59,889
Okay.

184
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,871
Is Somerville also by ordinance?

185
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,313
Yeah, they're all by ordinance.

186
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:04,994
Yeah.

187
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:08,377
So they all do it by ordinance and not in the charter.

188
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:25,286
Now, as we've seen, sort of the advantage to ordinances is it can be changed more easily than some would say the advantage to charter is that it can't.

189
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:38,293
And then David also had this, David couldn't come, but he suggested that we talk to some candidates, electives, department heads, or people who

190
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:47,992
maybe could be candidates just to sort of get their sense of how this would affect their, I feel like it's a little bit hard to do that.

191
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:54,015
I mean, it's a good idea, but would you say, yeah, yeah, sure, we should do that?

192
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:54,955
I don't know.

193
00:19:55,336 --> 00:20:06,462
It's hard to, you know, I mean, the question that he was, that I think he was saying we would be seeking to answer is, would this discourage people from running for office?

194
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:15,962
That's the question that we would be putting forth.

195
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:28,837
I wonder if we could just come up with a quick survey, three, four questions, including

196
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:54,709
either the state form or if we find a form from one of the other communities, that might be a little less intrusive because we would go with the less intrusive angle, I think, and just send it out to the current seated and maybe the former electeds from

197
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:28,979
the last election or two, you know, along with former mayors Burke and McGlynn, and then maybe, you know, I don't know if they would be allowed to reply either, but like the DPW director, building commissioner, you know, a few other people like that, and just say, you know, if you were required to fill out this form,

198
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:38,467
would this discourage you from taking a position or running for office?

199
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:40,809
I mean, we could do that.

200
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:45,231
I guess I just don't feel like it would be the most reliable information.

201
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,972
I agree fully with that, Nova.

202
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:54,716
I think you're going to get, if you send out nine different requests, you're going to get nine different answers.

203
00:21:55,997 --> 00:22:13,052
I kind of like the ordinance idea, but maybe you put it in a charter that an ordinance must be undertaken by the city council, let's say, on some sort of an ethics package, something that might produce something like that.

204
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:19,358
One of the things that we did notice is that Springfield has an ethics commission.

205
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:36,241
So you could put it in the charter that an ethics commission would be created by established by ordinance and be somehow put in.

206
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:42,703
I mean, that wouldn't require the ethics commission to institute a reporting requirement.

207
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:48,345
So if that was something that the committee wanted to ensure that that would have to be included too.

208
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:54,004
The one thing that I'm thinking about, you know, the ethics commission.

209
00:22:54,024 --> 00:23:02,387
I'd be curious to see from Springfield and maybe any other communities that do it who sits on an ethics commission.

210
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:05,168
I mean, if it's, you know, the city council.

211
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:14,372
You know, something that I said, you know, a while back on maybe this topic or another topic, you know, that's the Fox guarding the hen house.

212
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:16,213
So this is the.

213
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:20,477
manual of the ethics commission.

214
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:21,978
Let's see what they say.

215
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:24,040
What is the role of the ethics commission?

216
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,081
Make it a little bit bigger.

217
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:31,205
You could say in the charter that it would not include elected officials.

218
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:40,131
City clerk is the main point of contact for this ordinance.

219
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:45,607
What is the purpose of the Ethics Ordinance?

220
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:57,210
The Ethics Ordinance establishes a local ethics commission for Springfield and a standard of conduct for city officials and employees as well as candidates and municipal agents and lobbyists.

221
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:01,771
It also establishes a requirement for the filing of a statement of financial interest.

222
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:08,013
And these supplement the conflict of interest provisions of the state ethics law.

223
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:30,165
So, you know, if this was something that we wanted to put in the charter, we would probably say that an ethics mission shall be established by ordinance that, you know, and maybe use some of this.

224
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:43,472
But as I said, if we didn't specifically say that it would include an ethics reporting requirement, a financial statement, then they wouldn't necessarily do that.

225
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:44,484
Right.

226
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:48,006
Can you make that a bit bigger, Melva, please?

227
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:48,887
Oh, yeah.

228
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:49,287
Sorry.

229
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:53,630
Down the bottom.

230
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:55,491
Thank you.

231
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,232
I'm like, I've done this a million times.

232
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:57,992
How come I can't?

233
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:02,615
But don't you think this is just any candidates?

234
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:04,716
You're compounding the paperwork.

235
00:25:04,776 --> 00:25:11,941
I mean, as it stands right now, they have X amount of reporting they have to do, which is, you know,

236
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:15,710
seems to go well with the state.

237
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:24,397
Now, if we want to fine-tune it a little bit, fine, but I wouldn't get into, you know, all kinds of red tape here, and that, to me, would discourage people from running.

238
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:26,049
Yeah.

239
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,915
So, I mean, did you take a look at the ethics form, Maury?

240
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:32,637
No, I haven't had a chance.

241
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,739
This is, it's 42 pages.

242
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,640
Yeah.

243
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:46,612
So this is the form that state, so in Framingham in the charter, they, or they, the Framingham also charter states that there should be an ordinance, right?

244
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:48,258
Yeah.

245
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:50,060
Yeah.

246
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:55,767
And we haven't been able to get their form, but they say that it will be materially similar to the state form.

247
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:58,050
And this is a state form, and it's 42 pages.

248
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,234
It's pretty big.

249
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:05,479
It's very extensive, and it is time consuming.

250
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:10,591
Well, I mean, Maury, you're somebody that's owned a business, probably.

251
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:15,255
I don't know about Melva, but I know you've owned businesses over the years.

252
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:20,740
I mean, if you were to run for office, how would you feel about submitting something like that?

253
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:23,003
To me, it's no big deal.

254
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,684
I mean, you got nothing to hide.

255
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:26,466
I mean, everyone knows what you do.

256
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:33,075
To me, what's the big deal?

257
00:26:34,415 --> 00:26:43,099
To me, if I'm running for office, I want to know that I'm going to have the time to run for that position and take it away from my business.

258
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:50,603
But if you can, and you have the time, and you have the desire, I don't think it matters what you have for assets.

259
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,984
They're going to find out anyway.

260
00:26:53,704 --> 00:26:56,305
There's no hiding any of this stuff anymore.

261
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:05,367
So I recorded in the Secretary of State's office, I recorded in the DOR and taxes and all that stuff.

262
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,910
They do all the work for you basically, just look up and see what's going on.

263
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:14,868
So it says now here how members of the Ethics Commission are appointed.

264
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:18,351
One is appointed by the mayor, one by the city council, and one by the school committee.

265
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:19,832
So that's 3-3.

266
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:34,644
We were proposing on some of our committees on the multi-member boards that everyone has an opportunity to put a candidate or a member onto the committee.

267
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:38,310
This doesn't say that I'm elected.

268
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,071
Are there any restrictions?

269
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:40,791
Okay.

270
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:41,272
Yeah.

271
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:42,092
You can't be.

272
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:43,953
Yeah.

273
00:27:44,554 --> 00:27:47,075
Good.

274
00:27:47,956 --> 00:28:04,347
Anyway, I guess the first question is, it seems like we like the ordinance route, but the idea of potentially putting it in the charter with the instruction that it will be

275
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:07,412
administered by ordinance?

276
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:33,992
I like the idea of requiring an ethics commission, um, uh, you know, um, and appointed, um, just similar to how Springfield does theirs, you know, maybe adding a couple of other people on there with none of them,

277
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:42,274
being either an elected or an employee of the city.

278
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:55,084
And I think we probably need another meeting in a week or so, so that we all have a chance maybe to look through that, what Springfield has to say.

279
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:08,293
Indicate that, you know, 1 of the duties of the commission would be to establish.

280
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:11,896
A financial disclosure ordinance.

281
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,581
And then kind of let them figure it out.

282
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:22,325
Perhaps, because they're going to do the same research that I just did.

283
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:43,781
So, what I think would be helpful then is if one of us would call Springfield and maybe talk to one of the ethics commissioners about, because I think they did also refer to an, well, you know, Springfield doesn't have it in their charter, so it's completely by ordinance.

284
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:46,423
So, they were created by ordinance.

285
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:51,886
So, we can't really ask them about the charter, but we can ask them about how it works,

286
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:56,236
you know, I mean, what do you think?

287
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:59,237
Could also call somebody in Framingham.

288
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:17,224
Yeah, I was thinking of, you know, trying to touch base with most, if not all of those communities, you know, to get, find out how it's working out for them.

289
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:20,586
Does it encourage, discourage,

290
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:24,982
You know, candidate activity.

291
00:30:27,684 --> 00:30:29,986
What form do they actually use?

292
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:36,271
Do they use the state form or have they modified it in some balance on your credit card?

293
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:40,775
You want to make it just fine.

294
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:41,195
Thank you.

295
00:30:42,316 --> 00:30:44,358
So, would you be willing to do that?

296
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:45,959
I can do some of them.

297
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:46,299
Sure.

298
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:46,399
Okay.

299
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,481
You know, so.

300
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:53,755
Maybe Framingham first since they actually have it in their charter.

301
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:55,556
Yeah.

302
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,578
I'm going down.

303
00:30:57,598 --> 00:31:01,000
I've made a bunch of notes here.

304
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:10,026
With Springfield, the only one that actually has a commission that I could find or that I found actually.

305
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:11,487
Yeah.

306
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:15,270
That makes Framingham and Springfield unique in their own ways.

307
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:35,507
So we contact communities to get any forms to find out how it's received by candidates and potential employees.

308
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,133
OK, that would be awesome, because that will help a lot.

309
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:53,490
And what about talking to people in Medford about how, I mean, it's not just people running for office.

310
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,452
It's also people applying for a job, right?

311
00:31:56,532 --> 00:32:01,996
Or people like, you know, because this would also cover potentially department heads like this.

312
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:05,178
I wonder if a place to start might be

313
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,623
our somewhat new HR director with her name's Lisa Crowley.

314
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,424
That would actually be a good idea.

315
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,806
I think she's worked in other municipalities.

316
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:19,188
Yeah.

317
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,550
I don't think she's new to municipal government.

318
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:33,479
If she's not new to municipal government, she probably belongs to trade group,

319
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:40,510
Mass municipal association or whatever trade group is is out there.

320
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:45,392
To see, you know, to get some feedback.

321
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:47,874
That's a good idea.

322
00:32:47,894 --> 00:32:51,475
Oh, okay.

323
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:52,015
Sorry.

324
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:53,336
I felt like I had to sneeze.

325
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:57,452
So you have a lot on your list already.

326
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:01,875
Let me just take a quick glance through here.

327
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:13,164
So the contacting communities to request their form, find out how it impacts candidates and employees.

328
00:33:16,572 --> 00:33:27,420
I think my other thought was, you know, if we did a form, you know, to, you know, require it, you know, only after they're elected.

329
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:42,892
And then I think my other, if we did a form, I would maybe think we would modify it.

330
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:45,534
Well, I guess,

331
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:56,559
If we were to do a form, I would want to look and see what the other communities do and then maybe possibly modify it so that it's not quite so intrusive.

332
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:57,079
Right.

333
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:59,521
But I don't think the form would be in the charter.

334
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:05,865
I mean, Framingham doesn't have the form in the charter.

335
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:08,046
The charter, we would just have to sort of

336
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:15,451
What we have to figure out what recommendation we're going to make to the whole committee about whether to include any of this.

337
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,973
And if so, what and I don't think the form would actually go in the charter.

338
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:25,057
No, but they do say that it will be substantially similar to state form.

339
00:34:25,137 --> 00:34:27,039
So that, I mean, to me, basically means.

340
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:36,562
you know, just taking that form and crossing out, you know, state of Massachusetts and putting in, you know, community name here.

341
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:39,482
But that's an easy thing to say.

342
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:45,524
I mean, if you wanted it to be less, you know, what would you say if you wanted it to be not as comprehensive?

343
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:48,445
It would be harder to phrase that, you know?

344
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:50,866
Well, I mean, you want, you know,

345
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,483
information about spouses?

346
00:34:53,603 --> 00:35:02,045
Do you want your kid's bank account in there or whatever they have in there that's such a deep dive?

347
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:03,086
How much of it?

348
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:06,307
Yeah.

349
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:07,407
All right.

350
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,148
Well, let's start by talking.

351
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,508
You're going to talk to the communities.

352
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:19,291
I'm wondering if we should ask David if he'll talk to the HR director and maybe some of the other people that he had the idea to talk to.

353
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,871
Let me see what his email said.

354
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:26,455
I think he, yeah.

355
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:36,623
David, David, David, David, where are you?

356
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:43,108
He said, talk to some politicians and department heads about whether this would greatly affect their decision to run.

357
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,526
Well, I think, yeah.

358
00:35:46,806 --> 00:36:07,854
And he also thinks leaving implementation to the city council, which would be, you know, having it, um, just say that it would be created by ordinance and it doesn't have to be like, so the ethics commission, I mean, if you want to, if your ethics commission is another layer on what, cause we were just talking about this ethics reporting requirement.

359
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:11,435
So the ethics commission is another layer, right?

360
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:18,293
Well, I mean, if you're if we're going to make it as an ordinance, then it goes to city council.

361
00:36:18,313 --> 00:36:23,536
Which basically means it's like, I keep saying it's the Fox guarding the house.

362
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:31,147
If you bring it to an ethics commission of residents, then- Well, no, no.

363
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:33,889
It only goes to the city council to create the ordinance.

364
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:37,052
To create the ordinance, yeah.

365
00:36:37,132 --> 00:36:41,015
The charter can lay out who's elected to it, like we talked about.

366
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:44,578
I think the charter must says that an ordinance

367
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:50,441
Uh, must be established and then that would go to the city council with the parameters of it.

368
00:36:50,621 --> 00:37:01,166
And then you move forward and if they have it on there that, you know, elected officials, department heads and all that ineligible to be seated on this commission, then that covers that.

369
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,907
You know, it's yeah, I don't think it any harder than it is.

370
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:05,608
You know, it's.

371
00:37:06,902 --> 00:37:19,173
So I guess what I would be interested in is, I think just going through the Cambridge one, it looks like the clerk, I think it was the clerk that collects the financial statements.

372
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:28,082
You know, the thing about the Ethics Commission is it gives you an appointed body that's kind of responsible for taking care of this as opposed to the city clerk.

373
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:38,989
So, maybe find out when you talk to the municipalities, you know, how are the forms collected?

374
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:41,070
Do you make them available to the public?

375
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,871
Who reviews them?

376
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:47,693
What's the feedback been?

377
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,094
You know, just things like that, I guess.

378
00:37:52,198 --> 00:38:04,310
So I feel like since our scope here was very narrow, it was just to look at whether to institute this financial statement provision.

379
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:16,942
In regard to that, the Ethics Commission would be basically, if we decided to recommend an Ethics Commission, it would be because that would be the body that would kind of be in charge of that.

380
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:24,534
One other thing I'm curious about about the Springfield Ethics Commission is if it's a volunteer commission or if they're stipended.

381
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:32,618
Most, I mean, most of our commissions aren't stipended and the ones that are pretty small.

382
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:35,759
So, but it's something to think about.

383
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:36,832
Oh, yeah.

384
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:41,174
And I know that the city council has talked repeatedly about wanting to stipend all of them.

385
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:43,995
You know, if we had a money tree in the backyard.

386
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:45,876
Right.

387
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:47,097
Yeah.

388
00:38:47,197 --> 00:38:50,578
I would love to have been compensated.

389
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,419
Anybody should have been compensated.

390
00:38:52,439 --> 00:39:00,663
No, we wouldn't have, we wouldn't have been compensated in any way, because even if they created an ordinance, we're ad hoc.

391
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:01,864
So yeah.

392
00:39:05,075 --> 00:39:13,941
But I was just, yeah, we have that I, I counted all our meetings and all the, because I'm starting to work on the final report and I was like, wow, we've got a lot of meetings.

393
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:15,802
Exactly.

394
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:22,087
And not to mention the time that we've all put in, you know, yeah.

395
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:23,247
I think the other.

396
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:41,802
ones that might warrant financial disclosure forms, you know, when you're sort of getting into the realm of any sort of conflicts or possibilities of double dipping or anything like that or

397
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:52,889
favors or anything would be the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Community Development Board.

398
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:56,090
Are those people paid?

399
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,571
Are those positions that people get hired for?

400
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:02,612
No, those are the Community Development Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals.

401
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:10,875
I think they get stipends, but they're a board or a commission just like

402
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:17,753
A bunch of the other ones, but those are that are no, you're right.

403
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:19,555
That's making decisions.

404
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:24,141
You know, that effect, you know, that are in perpetuity.

405
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:26,263
Here in Medford, right?

406
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:28,726
At the same time, it's very difficult to.

407
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:44,530
make somebody who's basically doing a volunteer position jump through all those hoops, but which I mean we Beyond like what we did which was You know those trainings the open meeting law and the conflict of interest law.

408
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:52,112
I mean, I assume they're doing those yeah, I think all the boards are required to do those but I mean right and

409
00:40:53,041 --> 00:41:15,491
See, and that's the thing is all this stuff, anything that this conflict, that this financial statement would potentially reveal is covered by the conflict of interest law, which theoretically every single person who would be required to fill out that financial statement would have been trained in the conflict of interest law and would have known that it applies to them, right?

410
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:19,473
So this is not, this would be just,

411
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:25,382
We just want the public to, we just want this information to be on file for the public, basically.

412
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:40,933
Because it doesn't have to do with, you know, it's not creating any rules or, I mean, unless the Cambridge or ordinance, the Cambridge ordinance is pretty, pretty long.

413
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:44,196
But I think it's just about reporting.

414
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:45,157
It's not saying,

415
00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:58,766
what they can or can't have, that I think is defined in the conflict of interest law, or what they can, you know, what counts as a conflict of interest, what they have to recuse themselves from, et cetera.

416
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:03,670
That's all defined in state law, right?

417
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:11,096
So this would just be, as I think, and as David said, the transparency going out in your underwear, but it would create that.

418
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:12,937
That would be the goal of it.

419
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:15,759
That would be the, that's how I see it anyway.

420
00:42:17,874 --> 00:42:40,035
You know, I think, you know, the transparency is certainly an important piece, but, you know, to his point, I mean, you're, you know, for transparency, if you were to put this on the city website or whatever, you're basically

421
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:51,696
I mean, I guess the electeds and the department heads and things that have to fill this out, know what they're getting into when they're doing this.

422
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,660
So, you know, I guess.

423
00:42:57,568 --> 00:42:59,989
And I suppose people in other communities do it too.

424
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,351
So, yeah, I mean, certainly we've discovered that some of them do.

425
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:05,512
Well, I mean, it's not common, right?

426
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:10,495
We found, I mean, and the places that we found that do it are pretty big cities, right?

427
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:13,256
Boston, Cambridge, Springfield, and Somerville.

428
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:13,997
Yeah.

429
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:15,938
Yeah.

430
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:19,159
Right, they're definitely all bigger than us.

431
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,601
If we looked at cities of our size,

432
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:25,866
We can see if anybody, I mean, that would be like Maldon.

433
00:43:25,886 --> 00:43:27,486
I did look at Maldon.

434
00:43:27,506 --> 00:43:28,727
Waltham.

435
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:37,129
I could actually tell you the ones that I did look at that didn't seem to have this either via charter or ordinance.

436
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:51,473
Brockton, Chelsea, Gloucester, Holyoke, Lawrence, Lemonster, Ludlow, Maldon, New Bedford, Newburyport, Peabody, Revere, Salem,

437
00:43:52,051 --> 00:43:54,352
Shrewsbury, Westfield, and Winthrop.

438
00:43:55,053 --> 00:43:57,494
I basically went through everybody that's on MuniCode.

439
00:43:58,555 --> 00:43:58,935
Okay.

440
00:43:58,975 --> 00:44:03,318
So, I mean, we know that it's unusual, but it's not unheard of.

441
00:44:04,278 --> 00:44:06,319
It's definitely done in some communities.

442
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:20,448
So, I think the plan of talking to these other communities, finding things out about maybe even how long they've been doing it, that's, you know, this might be something that's going to become more common.

443
00:44:20,668 --> 00:44:21,008
Who knows?

444
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:38,495
And then what do you guys think if I just ask Naveed if he's willing to talk to the HR director and follow through with his, in whatever way he thinks he should follow through with his suggestion that he made on email?

445
00:44:40,115 --> 00:44:42,476
About putting funds on the agenda?

446
00:44:44,293 --> 00:44:56,240
Yeah, I think he can introduce himself to Lisa Crowley via email if he's not around and maybe suggest that he watch this meeting first.

447
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,020
All right.

448
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,423
I'll ask David to do that.

449
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:12,289
Then the question is, and then we'll reconvene with all that data and material and we'll make a decision about what recommendation we want to make to the whole committee.

450
00:45:15,108 --> 00:45:17,570
So is there anything else that we want to do?

451
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:21,174
I mean, maybe what I might do is just ask the Collins Center.

452
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:26,118
Maybe, I mean, what do you think?

453
00:45:26,138 --> 00:45:26,899
Do we want to do that?

454
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:27,840
Ask the Collins Center?

455
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:36,248
You know, is this, because a lot of times they'll tell us, you know, it's not common, but newer charters are starting to do that, et cetera.

456
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:47,338
Yeah, I mean, I wonder if, I mean, I know they worked with Framingham to do their charter, and they may have worked with Somerville, too, because Somerville's charter is fairly new.

457
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:49,860
I don't know if they worked with the other communities.

458
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,242
But did Somerville's charter actually get voted on?

459
00:45:53,683 --> 00:46:00,208
I thought they submitted their, the charter committee submitted their draft charter, and it was getting bogged down.

460
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:02,850
I think it's just sitting there, and they haven't moved on it.

461
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,311
Oh, really?

462
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:05,512
I don't know if it's actually,

463
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:14,003
So, I mean, it's in an ordinance in Somerville anyway.

464
00:46:14,043 --> 00:46:26,406
It's not in the charter, but as far as I know, their charter, the committee's product is not, has not been made official.

465
00:46:27,226 --> 00:46:27,946
Yeah.

466
00:46:29,146 --> 00:46:32,707
So they're still working with their like 1886 or something charter.

467
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:34,988
That's how old their charter is.

468
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:36,428
They're worse off than we are.

469
00:46:36,448 --> 00:46:37,088
Yeah.

470
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:49,671
So talk to the communities, Framingham, Springfield, Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and ask the questions.

471
00:46:51,071 --> 00:46:51,832
Number two.

472
00:46:53,232 --> 00:47:00,155
I'll ask David to talk to HR director and whoever else he thinks would be helpful.

473
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:06,898
I will ask the Collins Center if they know of any other charters that have it.

474
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:19,147
what their thoughts are, and then we can, is there anything else we should do before we reconvene one more time to make a decision about what recommendation we're going to make?

475
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:33,456
The question that we're asking ourselves at this point is, do we want anything involving a statement of financial disclosure,

476
00:47:34,821 --> 00:47:38,342
Or do we want to establish an ethics commission?

477
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:44,003
And I'm trying to figure out what.

478
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:48,244
You know, what it is that we're coming back to the group.

479
00:47:49,685 --> 00:47:57,966
What it is that we're why we are investigating what we're investigating between now and our next meeting to bring back to the group by August.

480
00:47:58,046 --> 00:47:58,207
So.

481
00:48:00,615 --> 00:48:05,177
Well, we said we would, as I said, we started with a very narrow scope.

482
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,738
The Ethics Commission adds another layer to it.

483
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:17,282
But if we believe the Ethics Commission should be created to administrate the financial disclosures, then it's connected.

484
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:23,864
But basically, it's whether we want to mandate financial disclosures in the charter.

485
00:48:24,925 --> 00:48:27,146
So that has to be,

486
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:30,857
That question has to be answered first.

487
00:48:31,017 --> 00:48:42,646
Do we want to recommend to the committee that we mandate financial disclosures for candidates, electeds, and certain employees or any combination of those?

488
00:48:44,344 --> 00:48:53,290
And if so- Well, if I'm not mistaken, on their papers that they have to submit with the state, they have to disclose all their financials and so forth.

489
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,412
I mean, I don't know.

490
00:48:56,132 --> 00:49:09,962
I think our position would be in the charter is to, by ordinance, establish an ethics commission and let the ordinance dictate what the requirements are.

491
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,467
If you follow me, am I saying it correctly?

492
00:49:14,008 --> 00:49:14,188
Yeah.

493
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:14,429
Yeah.

494
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:14,709
Yeah.

495
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:15,691
No, you make sense.

496
00:49:16,132 --> 00:49:19,739
I don't I don't think we should be here setting up, you know.

497
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:25,575
nine items for everything that the Ethics Commission should be doing.

498
00:49:25,835 --> 00:49:41,168
We should just say that one needs to be established, it'll be established through ordinance, which the city council would do that, and figure out, I don't know if we get involved in how many members and who's gonna get there, or would that all be done by the ordinance?

499
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:42,949
What do you think?

500
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:47,893
I think that if we decided, so, again, this,

501
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:58,356
So Maury, are you suggesting that we mandate an ethics commission be created by ordinance and then just let the ethics committee?

502
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:03,040
I mean, the ethics commission has to have some sort of charge, like what are they doing?

503
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:06,263
Right?

504
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:07,945
Yeah, I suppose so.

505
00:50:08,761 --> 00:50:23,608
And just, so again, going back to this financial disclosures, which is what we, we got sidetracked on that because Springfield actually has an ethics commission to administrate their financial disclosures.

506
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:51,010
So if we put in the charter that there would be an ethics commission would be formed by ordinance, which would, you know, have one person appointed by the mayor, one person by the school committee, one person by the city council, and could not include any current or former, I don't know, elected officials or employees of the city, and then say,

507
00:50:55,281 --> 00:51:06,366
and part of the tasks of the ethics commission would be to administrate a financial disclosure requirement.

508
00:51:06,826 --> 00:51:09,148
Details of which would be established by ordinance.

509
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:12,049
I'd say you're spot on.

510
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:14,330
That's really where we want to go.

511
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:18,652
I understand what you're saying as far as everything else goes.

512
00:51:18,752 --> 00:51:19,292
I don't know.

513
00:51:25,203 --> 00:51:35,896
Maybe I don't know enough about it, but I don't think when a candidate pulls papers for a local office that they have to do any sort of financial disclosure.

514
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:40,642
I think when they, as their campaign donations come in.

515
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:42,445
Yes, that's exactly right.

516
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:51,094
They have to, and those I don't think get reported to the state.

517
00:51:52,214 --> 00:51:54,937
I think if you're running for school, the mayor does.

518
00:51:54,957 --> 00:51:57,719
No, they all get reported to the state.

519
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:02,784
You have to do a quarterly filing on any kind of what's coming in and what's going out.

520
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:06,268
And that's just for campaign finance.

521
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:07,309
Right, exactly.

522
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:18,755
Right, these particular financial disclosures that we're talking about would require them to reveal every business they're invested in.

523
00:52:18,955 --> 00:52:23,898
Basically, I hold stocks in this, I own property here.

524
00:52:25,718 --> 00:52:31,562
So, and like I said, the state conflict of interest law

525
00:52:34,707 --> 00:52:45,373
Guy applies to all of that anyway, and they will have been trained in that.

526
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:52,457
So this would be just so that people could see, right?

527
00:52:52,517 --> 00:53:00,001
Because I don't know how effectively the conflict of interest law is enforced.

528
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:05,942
Yeah, I think some of it may well be sort of the honor system.

529
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:08,023
Right.

530
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:20,472
If you know, if all of this is covered under the conflict of interest, then why is a community like Boston or Somerville, which, you know, has a.

531
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:39,558
ton of people on staff and things, and who probably, you know, is even more aware of state laws because of that than, you know, I mean, our Elections Commission has, what, one and a half persons working for it?

532
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:43,120
And, you know, is usually drowning in the amount of work that there is.

533
00:53:45,969 --> 00:54:00,356
If communities that are bigger and more robustly staffed than us are requiring these things, then something tells me that there's a good reason for it.

534
00:54:00,557 --> 00:54:06,960
Well, what I'm saying is that the law that has to be followed is the conflict of interest law.

535
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,822
The requirement is just to disclose their finances.

536
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:24,783
I mean, I had to look more carefully at the ordinance, but it doesn't say this is legal, this is not legal.

537
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:27,806
It's really about transparency, right?

538
00:54:27,906 --> 00:54:29,728
And that's what we discussed at the meeting.

539
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,490
This is about transparency and about people seeing.

540
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:39,237
Because some things might not even fall under the conflict of interest law, but somebody might not like that.

541
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:56,951
Oh, wait a minute, look at that city councilor has stock in this, even if it's an indirect relationship, you know, I don't, I mean, you know, it's, as I understand it, this is a matter of transparency.

542
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:01,833
Well, I guess I, I'm, I'm interested in, um,

543
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:10,433
you know, seeing if we can do a deeper dive into mass general law.

544
00:55:10,493 --> 00:55:15,098
I tried to do a little bit of poking around yesterday and my eyes started to glaze over.

545
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:17,721
It's pretty hard to follow this stuff.

546
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,585
So I think maybe that's worth some information from the Collins Center.

547
00:55:22,706 --> 00:55:24,768
Well, I don't know.

548
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:26,189
I don't know how much that

549
00:55:29,013 --> 00:55:32,957
applies to us really because we can't change state law.

550
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:41,367
I mean, even if you look at the Cambridge Ordinance, all the enforcement is about enforcing the ordinance, and it's about the reporting requirement, right?

551
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:49,716
It's not saying anything about what conflict a person can or can't have, because that's all in state law.

552
00:55:52,850 --> 00:56:00,953
So what we would be doing is we would be just laying out this reporting requirement and everybody would have to divulge.

553
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,296
I could be understanding it wrong, but that's how I understand it.

554
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:08,816
Yeah.

555
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,137
I mean, I still like the idea.

556
00:56:12,132 --> 00:56:18,135
You know, of requiring the reporting requirement, whether that be.

557
00:56:19,196 --> 00:56:27,701
Um, via the charter, like framing him does they do it via the charter and an ordinance both the language of the charter and the language of the ordinance are.

558
00:56:28,161 --> 00:56:35,065
Copy paste, you know, whether we do it that way, or whether we do it via.

559
00:56:36,528 --> 00:56:40,809
Establishing an ethics commission, which I think is a pretty darn good idea.

560
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:44,370
You know, provided that it's, you know.

561
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,131
Populated by residents.

562
00:56:50,731 --> 00:56:56,932
And requiring of them to making 1 of their requirements to do.

563
00:56:57,713 --> 00:57:01,894
You know, financial disclosures because I think it's still important to have something.

564
00:57:01,914 --> 00:57:03,594
You know, from.

565
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:19,346
People that run for people that are seated in office, at the very least, along with some of the important department heads, and maybe the ZBA and the community development board as well to have.

566
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:23,689
You know, some have.

567
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:35,638
disclosures on file, maybe not on the website for 60,000 people to see, but that if somebody were that interested, they could go hunt it down.

568
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:37,520
Yeah.

569
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:45,526
Do we know of any communities that require basically volunteers to file a financial statement?

570
00:57:46,526 --> 00:57:47,807
That would be something else.

571
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:50,289
Because that would be, again,

572
00:57:54,566 --> 00:57:57,729
You know, that's a lot to ask of a volunteer.

573
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,652
But it would be interesting to see if any communities do it.

574
00:58:01,672 --> 00:58:04,314
All right, so it looks like we have a plan.

575
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:09,178
Eunice is going to research what the other communities that have this in place.

576
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:16,364
I mean, the other thing I would be interested in knowing from these communities is because the other thing I feel like we have to consider is what

577
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:24,803
whether, I mean, creating the ethics commission takes the burden off the city clerk and the elections department, say, right?

578
00:58:24,843 --> 00:58:29,286
But we have to think about, but it still creates a burden to create the commission and all that.

579
00:58:29,786 --> 00:58:37,852
So what, you know, what are, what's the burden that we would be putting on the city to administer such a requirement?

580
00:58:38,573 --> 00:58:39,753
That's something else to consider.

581
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:44,777
So if you can find out, you know, how they, how that works too, that would be good.

582
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:59,666
Then I'm going to ask David if he's willing to talk to the HR director and potentially carry through the idea that he had about talking to other people.

583
00:58:59,946 --> 00:59:05,710
Then I will ask the call-in center and then we'll reconvene and decide

584
00:59:08,953 --> 00:59:12,916
if we want to make this recommendation to the whole committee, and if so, how?

585
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:30,070
The other thing I could do is draft a couple of options that we can look at that we didn't put in the charter, which would include creating an ordinance.

586
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:36,175
Because I think either way, no matter what we put in the charter, there has to be some ordinance to get into the details of it.

587
00:59:38,448 --> 00:59:39,549
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

588
00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:44,771
Okay.

589
00:59:45,151 --> 00:59:47,132
You think it might be a good idea maybe for you to.

590
00:59:48,013 --> 00:59:57,438
Touch base with, you know, maybe, um, yeah, you know, Mark's some of the, you know, some of the former elected and see what they think of something like this.

591
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:07,350
Yeah, why don't we put together just a little tick list for me to go over with them and so forth.

592
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,831
My problem is my time is shrinking.

593
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:14,913
I just don't have a lot of time anymore.

594
01:00:14,993 --> 01:00:21,715
And we've been going at this for a year and a half, and I'm willing to do whatever I can.

595
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:23,916
But sure, I can take time out.

596
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:26,377
In fact, I'm going to see most of them this week.

597
01:00:26,843 --> 01:00:27,564
That would be great.

598
01:00:27,764 --> 01:00:36,691
And basically, you could just say, what would you think about the idea of requiring financial statements from?

599
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:38,512
Can I tell you the answer already?

600
01:00:38,532 --> 01:00:39,373
I know.

601
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:44,077
Well, and Donato does it for the state, right?

602
01:00:44,137 --> 01:00:44,857
Yeah, he does it.

603
01:00:44,917 --> 01:00:45,718
Yeah, Paul does it.

604
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:48,000
So he will know what you mean.

605
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:56,744
Oh, yeah, and the other ones will too, but they'll just say to me, you know, this whole thing you're doing is crazy, you know, because everyone is against what we're doing.

606
01:00:56,764 --> 01:00:59,805
So, yes, I'd be happy to.

607
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:01,646
Okay, that's great.

608
01:01:02,427 --> 01:01:04,067
All right, so that sounds like a plan.

609
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:09,410
Now, in terms of another meeting, it would be, I mean, let's see.

610
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:13,452
Should we just look at next week at the same time?

611
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:18,453
I think Thursday's a holiday.

612
01:01:18,473 --> 01:01:22,776
If I'm going to be trying to reach out to some of these city folks.

613
01:01:23,437 --> 01:01:23,997
Two weeks?

614
01:01:25,118 --> 01:01:27,160
You're not going to find anybody available.

615
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,703
These are the two biggest vacation weeks of the year.

616
01:01:31,163 --> 01:01:37,928
I think you can get through this week coming up and maybe the following, maybe look at the 15th.

617
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:40,657
Or the 15th or the 22nd?

618
01:01:40,817 --> 01:01:42,018
Either one.

619
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:43,781
Don't we have something already on the 22nd?

620
01:01:45,142 --> 01:01:45,283
22nd?

621
01:01:45,383 --> 01:01:46,925
I don't think we do.

622
01:01:47,005 --> 01:01:47,646
Do we?

623
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:49,368
I, my God.

624
01:01:49,388 --> 01:01:52,272
I'm like, I think I'm going to be- That date is ringing the bell.

625
01:01:52,332 --> 01:01:53,954
I know it's just one and I'm laying in the middle.

626
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:58,990
Let's see, do we have anything?

627
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,831
The other committee that you guys are doing?

628
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,312
The final report committee.

629
01:02:03,572 --> 01:02:05,392
That's the 22nd, I believe.

630
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:06,153
Is that the 22nd?

631
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:08,634
I saw it on the city calendar for the 15th.

632
01:02:08,674 --> 01:02:09,154
That's it, 15th.

633
01:02:09,174 --> 01:02:09,294
Yeah.

634
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:10,754
That sounds right.

635
01:02:19,888 --> 01:02:23,029
Yeah, because I'm going to be coming back to town on the 22nd.

636
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:25,530
So I would have a hard time meeting on the morning of the 22nd.

637
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:27,351
But I could do the evening.

638
01:02:30,692 --> 01:02:32,753
I think I'm around most of this month.

639
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:34,634
I'll probably be gone some of next month.

640
01:02:35,354 --> 01:02:40,816
I could do some early evening, like 6 o'clock or 6.30, something like that.

641
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:43,157
Was there another day of the week that was possible?

642
01:02:43,938 --> 01:02:46,279
The rest of the week's days, I'm working every day.

643
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:47,359
Monday is my day off.

644
01:02:47,419 --> 01:02:49,540
Other than that, I'm in there at 8 in the morning.

645
01:02:50,688 --> 01:02:52,230
Who knows?

646
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:57,216
We could look at the 15th if I could remember what the heck time I set that other meeting for.

647
01:03:02,242 --> 01:03:03,103
What about the 15th?

648
01:03:03,123 --> 01:03:04,845
Do you think that's too soon?

649
01:03:08,488 --> 01:03:09,849
You know, I'm going to, you know.

650
01:03:10,149 --> 01:03:11,170
Why don't we do this?

651
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,671
Let's schedule it for the 15th.

652
01:03:12,951 --> 01:03:22,157
Let's see how much we can get done between now and if we are not able to, you know, do our stuff, then we'll just push it out.

653
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:23,938
Okay.

654
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:25,239
Is that okay?

655
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,380
Is that agreeable?

656
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:31,183
And whatever we scheduled for the other committee wouldn't have been in the morning, so.

657
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:31,944
No, no.

658
01:03:31,964 --> 01:03:32,965
I think that's a nighttime.

659
01:03:33,245 --> 01:03:33,465
Yeah.

660
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,187
I think it's like in the afternoon.

661
01:03:35,427 --> 01:03:36,528
Yeah, that's right.

662
01:03:36,628 --> 01:03:36,908
It is.

663
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:39,530
So let's go to July 15th, 10 AM.

664
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:40,511
Okay.

665
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:45,575
I won't post it until like, you know, three or four days before.

666
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:48,817
And if it turns out, you know what, we're not going to be able to do that.

667
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:51,479
We just won't, we'll just cancel.

668
01:03:51,739 --> 01:04:00,466
It's going to take me, you know, if not today, then probably another day to kind of get my head around what I need to,

669
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:13,902
ask these people and put it in some sort of a form so that I can make a call or see if I can get through to anybody, see if I can do a Zoom with any of these people or a phone call.

670
01:04:13,962 --> 01:04:14,242
Yeah.

671
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:16,503
It is going to be hard because it's a hard time of year.

672
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:16,823
Yeah.

673
01:04:17,143 --> 01:04:26,344
I mean, by noon on Wednesday, you're not going to see anybody in city government except for one person in each office until the following Monday at least.

674
01:04:26,384 --> 01:04:26,744
Maybe.

675
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:27,785
Maybe.

676
01:04:27,825 --> 01:04:30,285
Well, it seems like- Maybe one person.

677
01:04:32,123 --> 01:04:44,152
It seems like the ordinances and the charter will tell you, like in Springfield, obviously, you could try to contact an ethics commissioner.

678
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:45,893
There are three of them, right?

679
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:54,019
And then in Framingham, was it the city clerk that would get the statement so that person might be good to contact in Framingham?

680
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:57,582
And then I think in Cambridge, they said it was the elections, right?

681
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:03,184
Yeah, I need to sit down, you know, I only sort of yeah, but I would target those people.

682
01:05:03,204 --> 01:05:07,805
Yeah, you know, so I need to really sit down and absorb them first.

683
01:05:08,465 --> 01:05:21,390
And then, you know, take my list of questions that we've talked about, maybe anything else that I can think of and put it in a form so that I'm, you know, each group that I talked to, I'm kind of comparing apples to apples and asking,

684
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:27,173
Yeah, but I don't think it's three hours of conversation with each municipality.

685
01:05:27,193 --> 01:05:28,713
We have some ballpoint questions.

686
01:05:29,013 --> 01:05:34,556
Yeah, I mean, I think 20 minutes per person is probably it.

687
01:05:34,636 --> 01:05:37,217
Maybe half an hour if they want to talk.

688
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:49,363
But like we just said, by noon on Wednesday, you're not going to see a city official, the police chief, the fire chief, and one other.

689
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:50,624
And that's about it.

690
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:54,177
Okay, so let's plan for the 15th.

691
01:05:54,258 --> 01:05:58,648
I'll send out minutes that list everything that everybody said they would do.

692
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:01,113
I'll get those out within a day.

693
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,346
OK, yeah, no hurry.

694
01:06:03,486 --> 01:06:13,136
I've got some notes here of what I can do, and I'm going to read through all of this stuff over the next day or so, and maybe not start contacting anybody till next week.

695
01:06:13,897 --> 01:06:14,137
Great.

696
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:15,038
Sounds good.

697
01:06:15,578 --> 01:06:15,859
All right.

698
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:17,300
And we're done 15 minutes early.

699
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:17,780
How's that?

700
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:18,922
Awesome.

701
01:06:19,582 --> 01:06:20,343
Thanks, everybody.

702
01:06:20,623 --> 01:06:20,924
All right.

703
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:21,344
Thanks a lot.

704
01:06:21,364 --> 01:06:21,804
Have a good one.

705
01:06:21,824 --> 01:06:22,605
Have a good fourth.

706
01:06:23,106 --> 01:06:24,107
Everybody, yeah, you too.

707
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:25,048
Bye.

708
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:25,528
Bye.
