1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I go to the next slide.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start since you started out with six show of hands.

3
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:05,732
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people counted six.

4
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:07,494
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

5
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got about six hands.

6
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:10,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed you didn't put your hand back.

7
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:13,817
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people counted seven.

8
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:16,959
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people counted eight.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,161
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people counted nine.

10
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,423
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people right now are not sure.

11
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:28,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish we could do it find out from what's going on at home.

12
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:29,527
[SPEAKER_05]: The people watching this.

13
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:32,427
[SPEAKER_05]: There are nine.

14
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,594
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, let's do this together, all together now.

15
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:51,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Fairness, F, final, two, of, three, of, four, effective, five, six, effort, seven, eight, of, diversity, nine.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,781
[SPEAKER_05]: There were nine.

17
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:56,383
[SPEAKER_05]: It was right there in front of you, and you missed it.

18
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:02,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this is the part where I have to say, everybody take a deep breath, because this has got nothing to do with Alzheimer's.

19
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:05,914
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got nothing to do with memory.

20
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:07,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an optical illusion.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:18,762
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point is, it proves my point that sometimes something is right in front of you and you don't, remember I said those warning signs?

22
00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:26,124
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right in front of you and you don't see it until the wheels fall off.

23
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:31,405
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, before we go to the next slide, anybody who would like to take a picture to dazzle their friends and loved ones?

24
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can always rewrite it and take that answer out.

25
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:42,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have family members who to this day still see seven and won't talk to me about it.

26
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:45,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's go to the next slide.

27
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:53,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started out by saying the number one question that is asked of me is what's the difference between dementia and Alzheimer's disease?

28
00:01:54,518 --> 00:02:12,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have met, just recently, just the other day I was at a program, Saturday I was doing a program, and a woman said that her mother had been diagnosed with, and I'm not making this up, a slight case of dementia.

29
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:19,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I told you, I've got doctors in the room, so please don't get upset at me at this, but that's a cop-out diagnosis.

30
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:21,224
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not telling you anything you didn't know.

31
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:26,507
[SPEAKER_05]: For you to have taken Nana to the doctor, you're concerned about her memory, you know something's wrong.

32
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:42,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And the example I always use for that, and this is a really bad analogy, but ladies, if you missed your period for three months and you went to go see your OBGYN and they told you you were slightly pregnant, come back in six months, if you didn't fire that fool, that's on you.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see what dementia is.

34
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:47,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the next one.

35
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:52,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Dementia is an umbrella term.

36
00:02:54,247 --> 00:03:01,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Dementia is symptoms of a disease that impacts average daily lifestyle.

37
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:07,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if I told you right now my right big toe hurt, what do you know?

38
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,272
[SPEAKER_05]: See, some of you are looking, see, I shouldn't have done the F game, because some of you are like, I ain't answering that question.

39
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,355
[SPEAKER_05]: All you know is my right big toe hurts.

40
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,257
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know, are these fancy shoes too tight?

41
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:21,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I stub my toe?

42
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it painful enough that I have to use a cane because it impacts my average daily lifestyle?

43
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: All you know is the symptoms of the problem.

44
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:37,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, under this umbrella, we've got Parkinson's disease.

45
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got other diseases.

46
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I love vascular dementia.

47
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:48,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had this debate with some of the physicians I work with.

48
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:52,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Because back in the day, I swear to God, vascular dementia used to be hardening of the arteries.

49
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a lot of folks shaking their heads like, oh, yeah, I remember that.

50
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:05,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got dementia with Lewy bodies, just a whole bunch, frontal temporal lobe dementia.

51
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,805
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a whole bunch of, so you see why it's important to find out what type of dementia that person has.

52
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:22,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Because all of these dementias, and by the way, 60 to 70% of people with dementia will have Alzheimer's.

53
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,951
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I use my uncle, my uncle was a perfect example.

54
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:33,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my grandmother had Alzheimer's, when my uncle started showing symptoms, my aunt took him to a doctor,

55
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:39,303
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, she took him to his primary care physician, who was an eye, ear, nose, throat kind of guy.

56
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:45,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of the history in my family, his doctor just simply, okay, well, you have Alzheimer's.

57
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:52,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then he started getting other symptoms, which we remember did not resemble a grandma.

58
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:59,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And so finally, I convinced my cousin to have my, because my aunt wouldn't talk to me about this.

59
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:04,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as my cousin said, she still sees you as a 16-year-old boy who thinks he knows everything.

60
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not going to talk to you.

61
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had them go to another clinic and get retested, and come to find out he had Parkinson's disease.

62
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:17,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are similarities up to a certain point.

63
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:20,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, why it's important.

64
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:25,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, my doctor of 32 years just simply retired.

65
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:27,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike retired three years ago.

66
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,005
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd been together 32 years.

67
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:31,827
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a general practitioner.

68
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:36,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I taught him more about Alzheimer's than he learned in medical.

69
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:42,615
[SPEAKER_05]: My physical was every August after the International Alzheimer's Conference, which he would read up on.

70
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:49,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the first half hour of my physical was him asking me questions about something he heard or saw at that conference.

71
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:56,931
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I realized was that if before Mike and I started, and in case you're wondering, I picked him out of the big book.

72
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when you had the big book of doctors?

73
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:03,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked for two things, a doctor who practiced near where I lived and whose first name was Mike so I wouldn't forget it.

74
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:04,837
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

75
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:14,805
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point, what I learned from Mike and our conversations is if one of his elderly patients had come to him and said, I'm concerned about my memory,

76
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: then Mike would have gone to one of his big books.

77
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,981
[SPEAKER_05]: He had those medical journal books.

78
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,883
[SPEAKER_05]: He would have pulled up a mini mental exam and he would have done that.

79
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And he admitted that to me because that's what he knew.

80
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:40,892
[SPEAKER_05]: But what him and I in our constant conversations realized, no, Mike, what you should do is refer them to the hospital that you have admitting duties at to the neurology department so that they can get a memory diagnostic workup.

81
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the difference between Mike doing it

82
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:53,766
[SPEAKER_05]: and a neurological workup at a hospital is the difference between you taking your new car to Jiffy Lube for an oil change or taking it back to the dealer.

83
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,889
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to the Jiffy Lube, they're gonna bang it out in 15 minutes and tell you you need new wipers.

84
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:08,782
[SPEAKER_05]: You go back to the dealer, they're hooking that puppy up to the computer and they're running a diagnostic workup to the point where they tell you what your air pressure is in your tires.

85
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:10,783
[SPEAKER_05]: See where I'm going.

86
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:14,505
[SPEAKER_05]: One is way more complete than the other.

87
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:16,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the next one.

88
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:21,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and here's the other reason why you want to get this tested.

89
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some types of dementia are reversible.

90
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:28,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to repeat myself.

91
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:33,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Some types of dementia are reversible.

92
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:36,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Years ago, I had major surgery.

93
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:42,367
[SPEAKER_05]: When I came out from the anesthesia, knowing the symptoms that I know, I knew I had dementia.

94
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:43,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I was dizzy.

95
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:44,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know where I was.

96
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:45,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget trying to walk.

97
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't happening.

98
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,853
[SPEAKER_05]: But as my brain got more oxygen, as the anesthesia wore off, that went away.

99
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:57,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody who is diabetic who's mismanaged their meds knows exactly what I'm talking about.

100
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:59,504
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to show symptoms of dementia.

101
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:03,146
[SPEAKER_05]: But once you get your meds regulated, it goes away.

102
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:06,487
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got other symptoms, UTIs.

103
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:12,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It is my understanding that a UTI can again give symptoms of dementia.

104
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,470
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I've got folks shaking their heads so you know where I'm going with this.

105
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way,

106
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:23,307
[SPEAKER_05]: For everyone who's taking notes, if you'd like, reach out to Sophie, and we can get you this.

107
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:24,548
[SPEAKER_05]: OK?

108
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:27,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'd much prefer for us to have a conversation.

109
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned a long time ago, you give people stuff to read, they're going to do just that, and they're not going to engage.

110
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:40,199
[SPEAKER_05]: So you see, we have different types of reversible dementias.

111
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:42,868
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it's important to get tested.

112
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:44,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Sophie, let's go to the next.

113
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:48,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not going to read all of this, so that's why I'm saying if you want copies of it, I'll get it to you.

114
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is Alzheimer's disease?

115
00:08:52,752 --> 00:09:00,915
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, the number one thing to remember is Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible type of disease.

116
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:03,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It just gets worse.

117
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:06,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And today, there's no cure for it.

118
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,732
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why, again, we're talking about research.

119
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:19,956
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I've got these amazing folks here tonight to also talk with you about participating in research, because we need to take care of this.

120
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:30,481
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a disease of age for most people, but it doesn't necessarily mean the older you get.

121
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:33,222
[SPEAKER_05]: The older you get, yes, there's a greater chance you're going to get it.

122
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:39,321
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember I told you, my grandmother, who passed away at 67 years old, had Alzheimer's disease.

123
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:46,046
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandfather lived to 104, outlived two and a half wives, and that man was as sharp as the day I met him.

124
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go to the next one.

125
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:57,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is those warning signs I was saying you're not going to see, like that F game.

126
00:09:58,797 --> 00:09:59,777
[SPEAKER_05]: What's normal, what's not.

127
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to pivot so I can see this.

128
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Forgetting what you went into the room for.

129
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:05,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single one of us.

130
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:21,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm watching the college basketball March Madness, and I'm sitting on my couch, and my partner, Bonnie and I, we had gone to Cheesecake Factory, and I had leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator, and she was in bed asleep, and my stomach was literally saying, Mike, go eat the cheesecake.

131
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:24,316
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm talking about.

132
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:26,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got up, and I walked into the kitchen.

133
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:31,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was like, oh my god, I dropped the dunk and blah blah, and I turned, and I, ooh.

134
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:34,964
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell did I come in here for?

135
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:40,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, 10 minutes ago, my stomach was literally, whole sentences were coming out.

136
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,427
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I come in?

137
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:45,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And in case you're wondering, I do what I know other people do.

138
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:47,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back in, I sat down on the couch, and I went, cheesecake.

139
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate it and got in trouble, but damn, it was good.

140
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, all of us who wear glasses, at one time or another have said, anybody know where my glasses are?

141
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:01,853
[SPEAKER_05]: That's normal.

142
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,440
[SPEAKER_05]: That's normal.

143
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody breathe, relax.

144
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:13,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We all, I mean, I used to jokingly say about my ex-wife, who never remembered where she put her car keys, her purse, her jacket.

145
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:20,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to say, if I ever get Alzheimer's, you're going to be butt naked and never go nowhere, because I won't remember where your stuff is.

146
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:27,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Forgetting a major event or a gift is not normal.

147
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:29,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell this story of this young man I met.

148
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,420
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what caused him to get his dad tested.

149
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:34,850
[SPEAKER_05]: They were from Oklahoma.

150
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,891
[SPEAKER_05]: When he was little, a tornado destroyed their house.

151
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:46,296
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on the anniversary of that day that he said to his dad, hey dad, you know, should we do something special for this day?

152
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:47,557
[SPEAKER_05]: And his dad said, for what?

153
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes, well, this is the day of the tornado.

154
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:51,739
[SPEAKER_05]: What tornado?

155
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,341
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, see you younger.

156
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, all of the warning signs had been there, but he didn't see them.

157
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:08,083
[SPEAKER_05]: But forgetting that was a red flag that he couldn't ignore.

158
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:11,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Occasionally making the wrong decision.

159
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:13,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I bought stuff I shouldn't have bought.

160
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:18,226
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a certain website, I'm not gonna give it a name, but I got tons of junk from it.

161
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:20,446
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bad decision.

162
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,687
[SPEAKER_05]: People were living with Alzheimer's.

163
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:27,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Our telemarketers and scammers dream come true.

164
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:43,288
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a disastrous decision, because they get them on the phone, and the next thing you know, they're sending gift cards to God knows where, or they're donating to save whatever tree.

165
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:46,389
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is, that's a bad decision.

166
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a poor decision or judgment making.

167
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:57,973
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got another examples of, okay, not remembering what day it is, or what time it is.

168
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:03,468
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, for the last four years, I know I'm not the only one that has to get up in the morning and look at their phone and know what the hell day it is.

169
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:04,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

170
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:10,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever since the pandemic, every day is like Saturday.

171
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:19,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're retired and you don't have to get up and go to work, you are definitely on a Saturday schedule.

172
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a certain time.

173
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:23,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the time of year.

174
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:23,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

175
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:24,376
[SPEAKER_05]: It is right now 630.

176
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

177
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:32,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks the same right now at 6.30 at night as it does at 6.30 in the morning.

178
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:36,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can be confused about day and time.

179
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's normal.

180
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:42,917
[SPEAKER_05]: But forgetting what year it is.

181
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:49,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And the older I get, I'm always shocked at how, I just saw something that was from the 1970s and they're like, 40 something years ago.

182
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, wow, is it that long ago?

183
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:57,334
[SPEAKER_05]: So my point is, is forgetting times and dates, that's normal.

184
00:13:57,814 --> 00:14:05,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Forgetting major, again, the situation with the tornado, that's not normal.

185
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And losing car keys, psh, okay.

186
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:12,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Not being able,

187
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:16,883
[SPEAKER_05]: to retrace your steps back home.

188
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We call that getting lost.

189
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people call it getting wandering.

190
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:28,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it or not, statistically, six to seven out of every 10 people with Alzheimer's are going to get lost.

191
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:30,838
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to forget how to get home.

192
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:33,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that number is actually higher.

193
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:40,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking it's 100% of people with Alzheimer's, if allowed to travel on their own, are going to get lost.

194
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:59,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I say that is because if I get this disease and I come out of stop and shop and I can't remember what my car looks like, or I find my car and I can't remember how to get home, and then two hours later I stumble in because I've figured out how to do it,

195
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:03,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I going to tell Bonnie how I got lost and I couldn't remember how to get home?

196
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:04,218
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

197
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:06,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on now.

198
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,961
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know nothing else about me, you should know this.

199
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:15,225
[SPEAKER_05]: What she's going to hear is, oh baby, you know, I went and got the milk and then I ran into Christine and next thing you know, we was talking and before.

200
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:20,969
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, I'm not going to admit I could not remember how to get home.

201
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:25,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I think that other 30% fall into that category.

202
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:28,854
[SPEAKER_05]: But what happens is the part of your brain

203
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:32,748
[SPEAKER_05]: which gives you directions, gets impacted.

204
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:47,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's nothing scarier, I share this, years ago I was at the Hadshell for the Fourth of July and I saw this woman standing in the middle of thousands of people about to come to tears because she looked lost.

205
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,293
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people here have ever been lost?

206
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:49,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Raise your hand.

207
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, as a child,

208
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:57,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you was lost as an adult, you was not lost.

209
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got turned around.

210
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,223
[SPEAKER_05]: When my dad taught us how to drive, he said, if you ever get lost, look for the potential building and just point the car that way.

211
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:08,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Sooner or later, you're going to see a sign that says Boston.

212
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:10,526
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is a true story.

213
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:19,591
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was 10 years old, friends of my family took me to the English high school Boston Latin Thanksgiving Day football game, one of the biggest high school football games in the country.

214
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:21,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Game gets over.

215
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:23,614
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all walking out.

216
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:25,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm holding their hand.

217
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:26,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I let go.

218
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:26,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I go this way.

219
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:28,657
[SPEAKER_05]: They go that way.

220
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:30,237
[SPEAKER_05]: 2,000 people go between us.

221
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:32,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing you know, I'm standing on the corner.

222
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't recognize nobody.

223
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know I'm going to die.

224
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am crying.

225
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was raised, you don't talk to strangers.

226
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:42,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm standing there.

227
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are like, little boy, what's wrong?

228
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:44,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, mm.

229
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:47,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Just let me stand here and die.

230
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:48,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Just leave me alone.

231
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:54,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my uncle was a Boston police officer, and they were doing the details that day.

232
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:55,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the guys sees me.

233
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:57,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes, Mike, what are you doing here?

234
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,268
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, oh, I can talk to you.

235
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:00,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Took me home.

236
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Saved me.

237
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:04,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Hear me now.

238
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to work in Watertown.

239
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So I used to go down Storrow Drive.

240
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:11,892
[SPEAKER_05]: And every time I drive by that freaking stadium,

241
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:24,265
[SPEAKER_05]: where that spot is, the hairs on the back of my neck, I deliberately avoid it because I still remember that fear that I was going to die.

242
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,947
[SPEAKER_05]: That's getting lost.

243
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:31,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never felt like that in my car when I didn't know where the hell I was going.

244
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:34,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I just pull over and pull out my GPS.

245
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,490
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference.

246
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,171
[SPEAKER_05]: You see where I'm going.

247
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:37,511
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go to the next one.

248
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:40,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's some numbers.

249
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:41,335
[SPEAKER_05]: All right?

250
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:50,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight, I also want to talk about there are different cultures where Alzheimer's impacts at a higher risk.

251
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Years ago, I gave this talk called The Invisible Population.

252
00:17:55,017 --> 00:18:02,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because, as you can see the first number, almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women.

253
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's a question.

254
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:10,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies, why is it that almost two-thirds of you

255
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,440
[SPEAKER_05]: will get Alzheimer's than men.

256
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:16,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Bam!

257
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:17,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Live longer.

258
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:19,767
[SPEAKER_05]: You live longer than we do.

259
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:25,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I've asked that before in a room full of predominantly women, and I've heard, because y'all drive us crazy and blah, blah, blah.

260
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:36,290
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are other factors involved in this besides just age, which is again why research participation is important.

261
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:41,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny when, I'm not gonna share that with you.

262
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:48,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Older African Americans are twice as likely to have Alzheimer's and dementia than older whites.

263
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:50,962
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a statistical fact.

264
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:55,346
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also less likely to get tested at an earlier stage.

265
00:18:57,193 --> 00:18:58,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, a statistical fact.

266
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:14,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks will take Nana to the emergency room and they will tell the triage nurse everything that, they'll talk about her gout, they'll talk about her blood sugar, they'll talk about her hypertension, they'll talk about everything except the fact Nana can't remember the name of her granddaughter who's named after her.

267
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:16,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

268
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:21,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Because all those other medical things they can't, they don't know what to do with.

269
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,383
[SPEAKER_05]: But memory, again, I told you, my grandmother forgot who I was with Uncle Tony.

270
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:33,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just adapted and I just became Uncle Tony because it made her happy.

271
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:42,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't go get tested until the wheels, until we can no longer deny there's something wrong.

272
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:51,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Hispanics are also more likely to get Alzheimer's disease than their white counterparts.

273
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, and this is something that I've been looking into.

274
00:19:57,526 --> 00:20:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The numbers on Asian Americans, they're really low.

275
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,930
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping maybe we can have a conversation with that.

276
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,991
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our presenters, Jin, is gonna be trying to join us virtually.

277
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:18,493
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point is, is if we don't participate in research,

278
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:24,752
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't go get tested, then those numbers are off.

279
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:26,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we need to show up.

280
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:27,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

281
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:55,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm going to repeat the question, and I'm going to paraphrase, which is I've said African Americans should participate in research, but historically research hasn't actually benefited us.

282
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:56,763
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a history there.

283
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:58,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And you are absolutely correct.

284
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:00,286
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the elephant in the room.

285
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But since those studies,

286
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,333
[SPEAKER_05]: of, and I'm not talking about just Tuskegee, there's a whole bunch of other studies.

287
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:21,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Since those days, what I like to affectionately refer to as the barbaric era of research, the research industry has put into place methods to make sure that doesn't happen again.

288
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:25,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the easy answer to that question.

289
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:33,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And also on top of that, it would be wrong of me to stand up here and tell you that, well, that never really happened and you gotta understand.

290
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,134
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not that guy.

291
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:37,845
[SPEAKER_05]: The reality is is that there is a history.

292
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:44,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of that history, the institution of research, and I'm just talking about Alzheimer's.

293
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about all those other ones.

294
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:58,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for us to put up a flyer, we have to take it to a board who has to review that flyer to make sure that that flyer does no harm.

295
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,321
[SPEAKER_05]: A flyer like you see all the time.

296
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,454
[SPEAKER_05]: but working for a hospital.

297
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:07,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that because I kind of got in trouble when I first started working at Mass General.

298
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:10,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a flyer, I put it up, and it walked its way back to me.

299
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, did you get approval for this?

300
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:16,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, it's just a flyer for a community event.

301
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:18,306
[SPEAKER_05]: But I learned.

302
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:30,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that I always like to tell people, if you start out in a research study, and at some point you change your mind,

303
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:34,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody is going to guilt trip you to stay.

304
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:37,365
[SPEAKER_05]: You have every right to say, I'm done.

305
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:38,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nice knowing you.

306
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodbye.

307
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:40,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And walk away.

308
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:42,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk away.

309
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And then most likely what's going to happen?

310
00:22:46,212 --> 00:22:47,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to be honest, because I've seen it.

311
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:50,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember those old commercials?

312
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:53,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You tell two friends, and they tell two friends, and they tell two friends, and they tell two friends?

313
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,180
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's going to happen.

314
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one of the things that the researchers I work with and the research assistants, we talk about this all the time.

315
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:04,789
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone has a bad experience, they're not keeping it to themselves.

316
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:08,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to be conscious of how you interact with people.

317
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:23,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, one of the things, and those of us who are old enough remember this, and this is a really bad analogy, but back in the day, before universal health care, if you went to a certain hospital, the first question I was asked of you in triage was, do you have health insurance?

318
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:25,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I grew up in Roxbury.

319
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:28,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the answer was no, they said, well, you need to go to Boston City.

320
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:30,667
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fact.

321
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:48,194
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandmother, my mother, I've heard those stories over and over, which is why one of the things that we coach people who work with folks is when you ask the question, what type of health insurance do you have, what a lot of folks hear is, do you have health insurance?

322
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, nothing's changed.

323
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:51,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it has changed.

324
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:54,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And so communication is very important.

325
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:57,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I do good with the answer?

326
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:00,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, she said she's satisfied.

327
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,859
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so let's keep going.

328
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, 70% of people with Alzheimer's live at home.

329
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:10,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Live at home.

330
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:18,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to run a support group and one of my support group members used to always say, my husband is going to die at home.

331
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:20,634
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not going to a nursing home.

332
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was serious about that.

333
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:26,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we found a way to bring her services in.

334
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are programs.

335
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:30,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed this when I was taking a peek at the East Boston table.

336
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:31,750
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a PACE program.

337
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a wraparound type of program whose main objective is, and my mom is in the Upperms Corner PACE program.

338
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:39,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to them.

339
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:43,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Their number one objective is to keep you home.

340
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:46,030
[SPEAKER_05]: and provide all those services for you.

341
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:55,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing, 70% of those folks who are living at home with Alzheimer's are being cared for by caregivers, family.

342
00:24:55,777 --> 00:25:05,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say family members, but that's not true, because I've known senior apartment buildings where Miss Mary across the street, I mean across the hall, comes over every day to watch the stories.

343
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:06,845
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a caregiver.

344
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:14,312
[SPEAKER_05]: You know Bob down the hall make sure that that Julie gets breakfast lunch and dinner.

345
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:15,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a caregiver.

346
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:17,193
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no relationship there.

347
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:19,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that that's what that's what friends do.

348
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:22,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what keeps people at home longer.

349
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:22,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.

350
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:26,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So African-Americans I already told you this.

351
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:32,019
[SPEAKER_05]: We tend to get diagnosed at a later stage not just African-Americans other communities of color.

352
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:36,041
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we call underserved communities because we don't go to get services.

353
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:37,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead in the back.

354
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go back to the previous slide.

355
00:25:51,622 --> 00:25:53,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women.

356
00:25:54,044 --> 00:26:05,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we talked about the fact that women tend to get it because, A, they live longer, but there's some other factors that involve that, which I've got some amazing women doctors here who can address that if it comes up.

357
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:10,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one, older African-Americans are twice as likely to get it than whites.

358
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:15,736
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all kinds of studies out there that have different reasons.

359
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:23,360
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing, because we don't show up to participate in that study, there's no definitive answer on why that is so.

360
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:29,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, and I'm not going to toss out stereotypes about diet.

361
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:41,089
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I will say this, think about this, anything that impacts the brain, anything, for example, high blood pressure impacts the brain.

362
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:47,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Diabetes impact, you see where I'm going with this, diseases that impact the brain.

363
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:53,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And as African Americans, we're practically number one in every single disease that I can think of.

364
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:03,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So me, I'm thinking that's probably one of the reasons why we're more likely to get this disease than our counterparts.

365
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:05,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that good?

366
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:08,422
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all right, all right.

367
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:10,843
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a scary number.

368
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:21,527
[SPEAKER_05]: By 2023, if left undressed, undressed, unaddressed, nearly half of all Americans living with Alzheimer's will be African American or Latino.

369
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:27,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you should know that I put these slides together, the first time I did this was years ago.

370
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember thinking, wow, 2030.

371
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:33,312
[SPEAKER_05]: That's six years away.

372
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:36,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Six years away.

373
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to just plant that seed right there.

374
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:48,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, remember, I started this out by, I'm not saying that this is our problem, but I'm saying we need to get in this game.

375
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:50,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the next one.

376
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:53,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So getting a memory test, and it's so funny.

377
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:54,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Sophie and I were talking about this.

378
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:57,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, I said, let's take that slide out.

379
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:57,559
[SPEAKER_05]: She goes, no.

380
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:58,879
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here's the deal.

381
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,901
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't go to Walgreens, CVS, or wherever and buy a memory test over the counter, OK?

382
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:07,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember I used that example of Jiffy Lube in a dealership?

383
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:11,503
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to get a neurological workup.

384
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:12,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the next one.

385
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:14,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did like that slide.

386
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:18,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, talking to your doctor.

387
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:23,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Your primary care may refer you to a specialist.

388
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:29,463
[SPEAKER_05]: The key word in there is may.

389
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:37,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're one of the few people I've ever met that's got a neurologist as a primary care physician, you want a referral.

390
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:39,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't hope for one.

391
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:41,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't think you might get one.

392
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask for one.

393
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:51,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The Alzheimer's Association has a pamphlet, you can go to their website, on how to ask for a neurological referral.

394
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:54,008
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, remember my guy Mike?

395
00:28:54,748 --> 00:29:07,198
[SPEAKER_05]: If you did, before we started having those conversations about Alzheimer's, if you just simply said you had a problem with your memory, God knows what he, you know, well, you know, change your diet or something like that.

396
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:21,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that conversation with the neurologist, things that are going to come up are physical exam, neurological exam, cognitive tests with paper and pen.

397
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,475
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all seen an example of that.

398
00:29:23,515 --> 00:29:35,865
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've watched the news, a certain ex-president, I'm not going to name any names, was bragging about how he could, how most people don't, can't pass that test about being able to remember elephant, TV, apple, whatever, you know.

399
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:39,648
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more to it than just that.

400
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:45,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember again, we started earlier talking about under the umbrella of dementia, all of those diseases.

401
00:29:46,254 --> 00:29:54,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it's important to have a neurological workup, because you want to make sure you got the right disease.

402
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:57,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to waste time going around the wrong track.

403
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:57,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

404
00:30:14,497 --> 00:30:14,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

405
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:41,897
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question was, how do you encourage people to advocate for themselves and their family members?

406
00:30:42,117 --> 00:30:46,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's interesting, because I've got Dr. Tony Farm here, but I'm not going to call him up, because that would embarrass him.

407
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do one thing better.

408
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:53,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Christine, how would you answer the question about how can folks advocate for themselves?

409
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want, I can take the microphone, or you can come up.

410
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,701
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a sneak preview, because this is Dr. Christine Ritchie, who will be speaking later.

411
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:07,723
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for the question and okay get closer.

412
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:20,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is very important and it's hard because many of us sort of think that oh it's an authority figure or somebody I need to just be deferential to and show respect all that but this is your body.

413
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:36,700
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know your body the best, and people who know you also know your body the best, and so if you feel like it's not, like the person's not listening to you, or they're actually not paying attention, then please stand up for yourself.

414
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:44,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Please say, I'd like a second opinion, or could you refer me to a specialist, or can you answer these questions?

415
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:47,869
[SPEAKER_01]: don't suffer in silence.

416
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:51,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people suffer in silence.

417
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go home and they're like, ugh.

418
00:31:54,134 --> 00:32:00,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that feeling starts coming, start asking questions like, I'm worried about this.

419
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:03,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you help me understand this?

420
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:08,586
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not getting satisfactory answers, then say, could I actually have a second opinion?

421
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you refer me to someone else?

422
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,609
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

423
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:13,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

424
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

425
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:18,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid.

426
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:19,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

427
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:28,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm not the only one who's seen people lose their minds because their French fries were cold at McDonald's, but will walk out of the doctor's office going, I have no idea what just happened.

428
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:29,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

429
00:32:29,726 --> 00:32:30,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Be active.

430
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:34,607
[SPEAKER_05]: You are your family, your loved ones, number one.

431
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm repeating what she said.

432
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,928
[SPEAKER_05]: You are their number one activist.

433
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:41,148
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't do it, no one else is going to do it for them.

434
00:32:41,468 --> 00:32:43,389
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go to the next one.

435
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:43,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

436
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:58,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to steer you back.

437
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:03,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question, what if the patient is in denial, or if the doctor is like, no, you're good.

438
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:04,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry about it.

439
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so either way, right?

440
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:21,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So either the doctor's not sort of acknowledging the problem, or maybe you're the care partner, and the person who's actually experiencing dementia is in denial.

441
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:28,655
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately with dementia, it's not that uncommon for people to not have insight into their illness.

442
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may think they're fine.

443
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is tricky, right?

444
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:46,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why early on it's worth maintaining a good relationship with that person and getting them to allow you to be a spokesperson for them, to get them to sign, you know, this HIPAA waiver and say, yes, I can talk to you.

445
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:50,775
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you talk to the doctor and say, let me tell you what I'm observing.

446
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very important.

447
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:57,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And most, you know, clinicians are crazy thankful.

448
00:33:58,267 --> 00:34:13,893
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a different perspective because they know that a lot of folks who are living with dementia don't actually, they're not aware or they don't have insight into actually what's going on or they're very afraid and they're afraid of what's gonna happen.

449
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:26,519
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, that's where the relationship and building that trust and giving them the opportunity to allow you to be their spokesperson and they sign a waiver for that,

450
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,260
[SPEAKER_01]: then that doctor can talk to you.

451
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

452
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:34,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else I want to piggyback.

453
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:35,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Get help.

454
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,284
[SPEAKER_05]: With my mom, you know, I'm the bad guy.

455
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:41,125
[SPEAKER_05]: My older brother is the good guy.

456
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:45,747
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the good cop, bad cop thing down to, you know, mom, you know, you got to do this.

457
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:47,448
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't do this, we're going to have to go do this.

458
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:51,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas he turns around and goes, now, mom, you really know you don't want Mike to do blah, blah, blah.

459
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I can't believe, but it works.

460
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:55,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And it makes life so much easier.

461
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:56,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead in the back.

462
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:21,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is, is there an average age to start looking for those warning signs?

463
00:35:21,624 --> 00:35:22,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a two-part question.

464
00:35:23,145 --> 00:35:29,467
[SPEAKER_05]: The first part is that it is not uncommon for somebody to start showing symptoms in their 60s.

465
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:31,628
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember what I said.

466
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:33,449
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to notice that.

467
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:34,868
[SPEAKER_05]: OK?

468
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:41,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there's a very small percentage of people that get what we call early onset Alzheimer's.

469
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are folks who get it at a much younger age.

470
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:48,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I've seen studies of people in their 40s, early 40s.

471
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, let me say this.

472
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:54,574
[SPEAKER_05]: For everybody in this room right now wondering, could that be them?

473
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,143
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't be wondering, you'd already know.

474
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:07,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Because for something like that, first of all, it tends to run more aggressively in a family.

475
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:14,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, years ago I used to work for the Alzheimer's Association, and I met mothers who were caring for their children.

476
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:17,325
[SPEAKER_05]: They're adults, sons and daughters.

477
00:36:17,865 --> 00:36:22,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So my point is you wouldn't be sitting in this room wondering if you fit that category.

478
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:24,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd already know it.

479
00:36:25,189 --> 00:36:27,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's called early onset Alzheimer's disease.

480
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:33,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, another reason why it's important to get tested.

481
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:35,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a question all the way in the back.

482
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:36,535
[SPEAKER_05]: You threw your hand up.

483
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:37,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we answered it?

484
00:37:09,716 --> 00:37:11,377
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, Christine, you don't have to come up for this one.

485
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:11,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I got this.

486
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:12,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I got this.

487
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:16,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question was, is you and your doctor disagree.

488
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:23,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're looking for another type of care that your doctor seems to be downplaying.

489
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:26,883
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you go get a second opinion.

490
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:32,225
[SPEAKER_05]: You just simply go get a second opinion.

491
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:34,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one's feelings get hurt.

492
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:37,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something I wish people would understand.

493
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:46,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to go see another doctor because you don't agree with your primary care physician, life goes on for them.

494
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:49,204
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's feelings will get hurt.

495
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:54,748
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like they're going to fire you tomorrow or cancel you as a patient.

496
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,310
[SPEAKER_05]: You just want a referral.

497
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:58,131
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

498
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:00,253
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.

499
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:01,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.

500
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:07,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you do after you've gotten tested?

501
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:09,280
[SPEAKER_05]: You've gotten your loved one tested.

502
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,641
[SPEAKER_05]: You've gotten the results.

503
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:19,410
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Alzheimer's, it's mild cognitive impairment, it's Lewy bodies, it's one of those, you now know exactly what's wrong.

504
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:21,372
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do next?

505
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:26,537
[SPEAKER_05]: You learn everything you can about that disease as the caregiver.

506
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:30,299
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to become the expert on that disease.

507
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:42,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Primarily also so that when you're sitting down, and as Christine said, you wanna find the HIPAA forms, you wanna become the healthcare proxy, you wanna get guardianship.

508
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Alzheimer's is a disease not of if, it's when.

509
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:51,513
[SPEAKER_05]: when that person is going to reach that point where they can no longer do certain things.

510
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:53,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you wanna get ahead of that.

511
00:38:53,634 --> 00:39:07,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always tell people, under the guardianship thing, if you jump on it at an earlier stage, it's simply just getting some paperwork signed, going before a judge, boom, you're done in a matter of, it doesn't take that long.

512
00:39:08,017 --> 00:39:09,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't really cost anything.

513
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:18,232
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wait or family, and I always tell family, everyone needs to sit down and be on the same page.

514
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:23,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've seen people go to court and fight over dishes.

515
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:26,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, mom said I was going to get those dishes.

516
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:27,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not making this up.

517
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:31,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happens is they go get lawyers.

518
00:39:32,435 --> 00:39:33,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And those lawyers go to court.

519
00:39:33,635 --> 00:39:38,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And the job of their lawyers is to make the other side look like if you let Nana go live with them, she's going to die in a day.

520
00:39:39,997 --> 00:39:44,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And the judge, who does not know this person, listens to both arguments.

521
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:52,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is not uncommon for that judge to appoint another attorney as temporary guardian, who never even met Nana.

522
00:39:54,082 --> 00:39:55,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And think about it.

523
00:39:55,323 --> 00:40:03,287
[SPEAKER_05]: That argument that you just heard, well, now the judge can't let Nana go home alone or with either one of those two, so the guardian has to put Nana in an institution.

524
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:04,488
[SPEAKER_05]: You see where I'm going with this.

525
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important to jump on this as soon as possible.

526
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Learn everything you can.

527
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:16,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care of all of those legal issues so that the rest of the time, you can just do the caregiver stuff.

528
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:20,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also, the more you know, the less you're surprised.

529
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:33,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and you can get this information, by the way, by contacting your local elder service agency, or the town of Medford, and Sophie, and the team that's here.

530
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:35,186
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a very good team.

531
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:36,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a chance to talk with some of them.

532
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's services out there for you.

533
00:41:04,174 --> 00:41:05,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that's two things here.

534
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:11,779
[SPEAKER_05]: The question she asked is, is there types of testing that can pinpoint exactly what the person has?

535
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:29,134
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the autopsy, and this is something that whenever you see a documentary or anything about Alzheimer's, you always hear about plaques and tangles, which is usually done after the person has passed away and has donated their brain to science, and they do an autopsy, and they're looking for certain things.

536
00:41:29,974 --> 00:41:38,740
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a study that just recently came out that showed that there may be some people who may have these things, these plaques and tangles, but never get Alzheimer's.

537
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:42,623
[SPEAKER_05]: But so I'm just putting that out there.

538
00:41:43,563 --> 00:41:51,787
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the first one, again, if you remember when we talked about getting tested, they go through a battery of tests.

539
00:41:51,907 --> 00:41:53,467
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not a 15-minute thing.

540
00:41:54,488 --> 00:42:01,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of some folks who've gone back, it's taken two days because the person got tired on the first day and they had to come back to continue the testing.

541
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:06,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the whole purpose is to eliminate all of those different types of diseases we saw.

542
00:42:06,753 --> 00:42:08,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

543
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:17,455
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

544
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:27,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Amyloid, right.

545
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:53,824
[SPEAKER_12]: It's wrong.

546
00:42:54,204 --> 00:43:02,509
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're sitting there and you're looking at something, you know what the name of it is, but you don't know how to deal with it.

547
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:05,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you don't know what the name is and you think you might, that's a problem.

548
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:18,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, and I'm going to, because you mentioned your name Julie, what Julie was sharing was is that what made her go get tested and tell her doctor something's wrong was she could no longer deny something wasn't wrong.

549
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:21,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on a second, Julia.

550
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:23,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm about to make you famous.

551
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:25,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin, don't hate me for this.

552
00:43:26,746 --> 00:43:28,508
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having a Phil Donahue flashback.

553
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:30,471
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

554
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:34,535
[SPEAKER_12]: My aunt, my mother's sister had it.

555
00:43:36,017 --> 00:43:36,918
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, that's fine.

556
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:40,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Now with my family, whatever one side of the family has it,

557
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:41,659
[SPEAKER_12]: The other side has it.

558
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, my father was diagnosed with it.

559
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:50,150
[SPEAKER_12]: His niece was diagnosed with it.

560
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Another nephew was diagnosed with it.

561
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,635
[SPEAKER_12]: I says, I'm going to the doctor.

562
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So Julie, what you're saying is that you, just like I said with my grandmother, you've seen it.

563
00:44:02,845 --> 00:44:03,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what to look for.

564
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:10,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And if told, oh, don't worry about it, well, you know, yeah, no, I need to get me another doctor.

565
00:44:11,492 --> 00:44:13,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for sharing that.

566
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:15,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go.

567
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:17,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, go ahead.

568
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:30,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

569
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:34,410
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

570
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,712
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the first person to ever ask me that question.

571
00:44:36,752 --> 00:44:38,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Christine, that's a good question.

572
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:39,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a certain age?

573
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:40,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

574
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:46,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, is there a certain age where you should get tested?

575
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:48,008
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is no.

576
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:56,476
[SPEAKER_01]: There is actually a national organization that sort of makes recommendations about what makes sense for screening and what doesn't.

577
00:44:57,176 --> 00:45:00,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the big answer is no, but it's a but.

578
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:16,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the but is, if you have risk factors, like you described, where you have a family history, or maybe you have a history of diabetes and high blood pressure, as Mike was talking about, and you have other things that may put you at increased risk, yes, it's appropriate to get screening.

579
00:45:17,143 --> 00:45:29,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, more and more, we're encouraging people, as Mike was saying, especially now as we start having treatments that work better when you're actually earlier on in the course of dementia, not late,

580
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:32,506
[SPEAKER_01]: then you really have to get screened and tested early.

581
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:40,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And so increasingly we're thinking about how do we make sure that people who actually are at higher risk are actually getting screened.

582
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:51,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to start seeing some changes even, you know, over the next year or two where people are recognizing, especially with these new treatments that are coming out, we need to give people the opportunity to get tested early.

583
00:45:55,494 --> 00:46:08,300
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be, but I think because we have more and more even blood tests, and you heard about the PET scan, it'll be easier actually to evaluate people when things don't look right than it has been in the past.

584
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:20,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, what was it Liliana, this past year, even the way we think about the categories and stages of dementia has changed because we have more information

585
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:29,198
[SPEAKER_01]: from blood tests, from fluid from the spinal fluid, from the brain than we used to, to help provide differentiation about things.

586
00:46:47,823 --> 00:47:04,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right Yeah, so So the question is What if your insurance makes it hard for you to get the kind of testing that you think might be appropriate?

587
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:14,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a real thing and actually dr. Ramirez Gomez can speak to this because she's actually like Navigating some of this right now but by and large if you have

588
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:36,412
[SPEAKER_01]: risk factors, and then you screen positive, that is, there are things from your memory test and maybe other things that suggest that you actually are at very high risk for dementia and we're specifically worried about differentiating between different kinds of dementia or being considered for treatment, that's when the insurance companies are much more likely to pay for it.

589
00:47:37,072 --> 00:47:42,595
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, there are some insurance companies, they're still a very high deductible, right?

590
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:46,957
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might pay something thousand, but they don't pay all of it.

591
00:47:47,577 --> 00:47:58,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's worth asking these questions on the front end and making sure that you can go through it without coming out with a bill and going, wait, what's this?

592
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ramirez-Gomez, do you want to add anything?

593
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:03,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

594
00:48:04,645 --> 00:48:04,926
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

595
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:06,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

596
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:10,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

597
00:48:14,682 --> 00:48:14,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

598
00:48:16,282 --> 00:48:34,728
[SPEAKER_01]: So you heard Mike talk about mild cognitive impairment, and that is where people are starting to have problems with their thinking before they're actually at the point where they're having trouble getting stuff done, where it's not interfering necessarily with their ability to pay their bills or things like that.

599
00:48:35,868 --> 00:48:46,195
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the window of time, and when people are just early on in their dementia, when they're most appropriate for actually getting some of these newer therapies that have just come out in the past year or so.

600
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:59,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I keep talking about Dr. Ramirez-Gomez is because she actually runs our treatment center at MGH that's actually providing these kind of therapies, which is why I wanted to get her involved.

601
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, good evening, and thank you for being here.

602
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you heard, I am a neurologist.

603
00:49:09,432 --> 00:49:25,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a doctor who takes care of patients in my clinic and at the hospital, at Massachusetts General Hospital, that present like that with concerns about their memory, or why I am forgetting these things, or having difficulties recognizing certain things.

604
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:27,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's our job.

605
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:37,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So, actually, we have these opportunities to listen and pay attention and do the work that Mike was saying.

606
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:46,774
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you go to this place and you have all the concerns heard, and we actually take a very good history and a detailed evaluation.

607
00:49:47,774 --> 00:49:51,636
[SPEAKER_03]: We look for all of these red flags, and it is true.

608
00:49:51,716 --> 00:50:10,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I am glad that you brought up the PET scan and Dr. Ritchie mentioned about blood tests and things that may come up in the very near future, because we really pay attention to this, because now we have available treatments that are more helpful when we use them early.

609
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:20,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It is true that we have all this availability to do testing, and many times, as doctors, I heard about advocacy.

610
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:25,465
[SPEAKER_03]: You, as a patient, saying, I need this test, or I have this concern.

611
00:50:25,985 --> 00:50:31,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We doctors advocate, too, and that's what we do when we believe something has to happen.

612
00:50:31,992 --> 00:50:46,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Many times we even have to talk to insurance or send letters or appeals and speak on your behalf because we really think this is necessary and this is going to make a difference in the life of someone because we provide a specific diagnosis.

613
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:51,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone asked if we can know for sure what type of dementia it is, and yes.

614
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:54,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we can get to that level of detail.

615
00:50:54,861 --> 00:51:06,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And also to your question, when you say why is important that we participate if maybe before there were all these difficulties and it didn't benefit us, why is important now?

616
00:51:06,669 --> 00:51:10,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of this, because we want the treatments to benefit everybody.

617
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:15,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to make sure that the differences we have in the numbers that Mike shared,

618
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:24,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Those numbers matter because we need to understand what's the difference and, for example, how the treatments will impact each of us in a different way.

619
00:51:24,757 --> 00:51:30,079
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have really clinics in which we evaluate people of colors.

620
00:51:30,139 --> 00:51:34,260
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, we evaluate people that speak different languages.

621
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to really include everybody.

622
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:41,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the word that Mike was using at the beginning with the F game.

623
00:51:47,977 --> 00:52:06,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ramirez-Gomez talked about how important it is to actually seek attention and one other kind of interesting backdoor approach towards getting the kind of interesting help that you might want is to volunteer to be participating in a study.

624
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:22,741
[SPEAKER_01]: What we know about participating in these research studies that are related to dementia is that number one, many people actually are helping us find the answer to some of these newer medicines.

625
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:27,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But regardless, you get a very comprehensive evaluation.

626
00:52:27,782 --> 00:52:30,123
[SPEAKER_01]: A very comprehensive evaluation.

627
00:52:30,163 --> 00:52:31,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So you learn a lot in the process.

628
00:52:32,224 --> 00:52:35,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other perk is that then you get to know people.

629
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:47,257
[SPEAKER_01]: They know you, you know them, there's a relationship there, and if things come up, you're much more likely to have somebody, even as a part of the research team, who's like advocating for you.

630
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:58,849
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's a kind of interesting thing to think about, and we know this actually from big studies, that when you have people who actually participate in research and compare them to people who are just like them, who don't,

631
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:01,410
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who participate in research do better.

632
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:02,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, why is that?

633
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:05,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably because of these other things.

634
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:07,934
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting more comprehensive evaluations.

635
00:53:07,994 --> 00:53:09,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's looking out for them.

636
00:53:10,075 --> 00:53:12,757
[SPEAKER_01]: They've developed a sense of relationship and connection.

637
00:53:13,157 --> 00:53:17,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another interesting sort of backdoor approach to also getting support.

638
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a number of studies that we have available.

639
00:53:20,623 --> 00:53:23,085
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard Mike say about 42 studies that we have.

640
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:31,714
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not all for the same thing, but we have studies for people who have no issues with their thinking or their memory.

641
00:53:31,794 --> 00:53:35,257
[SPEAKER_01]: We have folks who have what we call subjective complaints.

642
00:53:35,317 --> 00:53:38,821
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when they get tested, it looks okay, but they know something's not right.

643
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:46,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, we have actual studies for people with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, the whole spectrum.

644
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:51,925
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to support you if that's of interest to you, so please reach out to us about that.

645
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:54,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ramirez-Gomez, do you want to add anything?

646
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:56,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

647
00:53:57,403 --> 00:54:07,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now that we are talking about this and why research and participating and getting comfortable with the medical community, it's because we care.

648
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:14,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Like really, the newer generations and how we are getting together and how things are changing, all of that is true.

649
00:54:15,536 --> 00:54:23,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to share too that when we care for each other, as Mike mentioned, we care for our neighbor, for our family member.

650
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:27,624
[SPEAKER_03]: We have this word of being a caregiver, a care partner.

651
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:34,669
[SPEAKER_03]: We also want to invite some of you that may care for friends, family.

652
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,953
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have studies in which we want to provide resources.

653
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:54,522
[SPEAKER_03]: for caregivers, care partners, and it's an invitation, too, that we know Alzheimer's disease and dementia and the related dementias is not a condition that it only affects the person who has the memory loss or the symptoms.

654
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:58,505
[SPEAKER_03]: It affects the whole family, the community, the neighbors, their friends.

655
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:10,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So we include everybody because we want to make sure the well-being of all the people and all the persons that are struggling with this is taken care of.

656
00:55:15,518 --> 00:55:28,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm wrapping up my part with my warm and fuzzy because you just got a sneak preview of the second part of this because so I said I was gonna wrap it up with warm and fuzzy here we go I'm gonna give you an example of the difference between emotional and historical memory and

657
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:31,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell you a story.

658
00:55:31,053 --> 00:55:32,153
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an actual true story.

659
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 1970-something.

660
00:55:34,194 --> 00:55:40,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I am sitting at 15 Rockville Park with the then love of my life, who is wearing Gina Tay perfume.

661
00:55:40,156 --> 00:55:44,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We are listening to WIOD 1090 on your AM dial.

662
00:55:44,197 --> 00:55:46,037
[SPEAKER_05]: The disc jockey is Sonny Joe White.

663
00:55:46,618 --> 00:55:52,940
[SPEAKER_05]: A song comes on called Dedicated to the One I Love, and we kiss for the first time.

664
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything I have just told you is historical.

665
00:55:58,419 --> 00:55:58,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything.

666
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:06,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I get Alzheimer's, at that point in my life where I will forget everything I just told you.

667
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:23,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's a warm summer day, and I am sitting outside, and God help me if a woman walks by wearing Gina Tay perfume, and a song dedicated to the one I love comes on, I am 16 years old, madly in love, and just sitting there,

668
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:31,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what I want you to understand is that what this disease steals from our brain never touches our heart.

669
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:34,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Because love will always remember.

670
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I told you I was going to end it with the warm and fuzzy for me.

671
00:56:38,794 --> 00:56:41,015
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to hand it off to Christine.

672
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:42,556
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got you queued up.

673
00:56:52,352 --> 00:56:57,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ramirez Gomez already got us started by talking about care partners and caregivers.

674
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:08,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And as she said, and I think she said it so beautifully, when someone is experiencing dementia, it doesn't just affect them, right?

675
00:57:08,077 --> 00:57:09,477
[SPEAKER_01]: It affects those who are with them.

676
00:57:09,517 --> 00:57:11,458
[SPEAKER_01]: It affects those who care for them.

677
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:16,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's its own journey for that person who's that caregiver.

678
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to just spend a few minutes talking about caring for the caregiver.

679
00:57:21,841 --> 00:57:29,464
[SPEAKER_01]: and how there might be things that we can do to support people who are caring for that person living with dementia.

680
00:57:30,124 --> 00:57:31,724
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we go to the next, do you want me to do it?

681
00:57:31,764 --> 00:57:33,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this country,

682
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:45,347
[SPEAKER_01]: By and large, it's often family or people who are like family who are caring for us if we're living with dementia.

683
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:48,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few things about me.

684
00:57:48,248 --> 00:57:52,670
[SPEAKER_01]: My specialty is in geriatrics and palliative care.

685
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:58,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the honor of caring for my father in my home when he had Lewy body dementia.

686
00:57:59,612 --> 00:58:16,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought I knew a lot as, you know, going through all the training about caring for people who live with dementia, but when I became a caregiver, it was a whole new education for what it was like to be in that space with somebody.

687
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:21,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the United States, about 11 million people are providing that care.

688
00:58:22,452 --> 00:58:24,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not paid care.

689
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:35,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually adds up to a lot of money, probably $325 billion worth of caregiving that we're doing for our families if we actually got paid to do it.

690
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:39,800
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 40% of caregivers are men.

691
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes men get short shrift on this.

692
00:58:41,881 --> 00:58:47,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say there are a lot of men out there who are doing a great job with being a caregiver.

693
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:58,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in this country, about a third of caregivers are over the age of 65, and about half are caring for a parent.

694
00:58:59,174 --> 00:59:01,415
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does affect all of us.

695
00:59:01,535 --> 00:59:02,856
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be that partner.

696
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:04,638
[SPEAKER_01]: that life partner.

697
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:06,300
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be the daughter.

698
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,726
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be the daughter-in-law, the son, son-in-law, niece, nephew.

699
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:12,929
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can affect all of us.

700
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:14,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we go to the next slide.

701
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:27,582
[SPEAKER_01]: What is important to keep in mind if you're a caregiver is that it is crazy important to take care of you because the physical and health consequences of caregiving are not nothing.

702
00:59:28,143 --> 00:59:34,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at studies and research about caregiving, what we find is that if you are a caregiver,

703
00:59:35,299 --> 00:59:49,987
[SPEAKER_01]: you're more likely to be depressed, you're more likely to have sleep issues, you're more likely to be hospitalized, you actually have a higher mortality rate than you would be if you weren't a caregiver, and you're less likely to get help.

704
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:55,257
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got to take care of my person here.

705
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:56,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't take care of me.

706
00:59:57,078 --> 00:59:58,839
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to do that, right?

707
00:59:59,379 --> 01:00:01,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't fill our own medicines.

708
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,802
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't actually take care of ourselves.

709
01:00:03,402 --> 01:00:04,563
[SPEAKER_01]: That puts us at risk.

710
01:00:04,843 --> 01:00:15,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm sure you've heard this before, but when you're on a plane, they say, please put the air mask on yourself first before putting it on the person next to you.

711
01:00:16,191 --> 01:00:18,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to think about that, but we often don't.

712
01:00:18,852 --> 01:00:21,074
[SPEAKER_01]: That when you're caring, if you're a caregiver,

713
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:25,119
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're caring for yourself, you are caring for that other person.

714
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:28,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually really important that you're doing that.

715
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:35,693
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it takes actually some intentionality and some work to actually figure out how the heck I'm going to take care of myself.

716
01:00:36,234 --> 01:00:37,536
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we go to the next slide.

717
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:44,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, in this country, there are a lot of care gaps for caregivers when it comes to dementia care.

718
01:00:45,462 --> 01:00:49,906
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a caregiver, you're much more likely to experience a lot of challenges.

719
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:56,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to go over some of them with you and then also talk about how we can address those gaps, OK?

720
01:00:56,792 --> 01:01:05,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we go to the next slide, we often find that what people don't get told when they go to the, so a lot of times people go to the doctor.

721
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,883
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're fortunate, they'll actually have someone tell them what's going on.

722
01:01:10,683 --> 01:01:13,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll give them some idea about what the future is going to look like, right?

723
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:20,430
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people, as Mike was saying, they're not told what this is going to look like.

724
01:01:20,731 --> 01:01:22,572
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this going to look like two years from now?

725
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,733
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I need to be prepared for?

726
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:30,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, living with dementia right now is a terminal illness.

727
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,919
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless, until we get a cure,

728
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:42,404
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at a journey that can sometimes be quite a long journey that's going to be associated with a number of losses along the way.

729
01:01:43,204 --> 01:01:44,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we prepare for that?

730
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:53,888
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times we don't get that information knowing that, you know, what this is going to look like and, again, by what kind of dementia.

731
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:57,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Different dementias actually look different in terms of what their journey looks like.

732
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:04,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what kind of dementia is actually is helpful for sort of thinking about what the future is going to look like.

733
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:05,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also knowing

734
01:02:07,017 --> 01:02:09,098
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty.

735
01:02:09,178 --> 01:02:12,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the way dementia works is it's a lot of ups and downs.

736
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:19,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you get a urinary tract infection or you fall or something, then you're going to have a bad spell.

737
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you might recover some.

738
01:02:21,766 --> 01:02:23,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you might have another bad spell.

739
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:29,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though it's a long, slow journey of decline, a lot of times there's actually fits and starts.

740
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:31,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And that uncertainty can be very hard for caregivers.

741
01:02:32,472 --> 01:02:36,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, when you're the caregiver, you're not even noticing what's happening.

742
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:44,163
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not even know, actually, that you're getting close to the end because you are just doing it, right?

743
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:50,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, when I was caring for my father, he was getting very sick near the end.

744
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:56,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And a friend of mine said, don't you think you're, now remember, I take care of people who are at the end of life.

745
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,113
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is funny.

746
01:02:57,493 --> 01:03:00,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, don't you think your dad is ready for hospice?

747
01:03:00,716 --> 01:03:02,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, huh.

748
01:03:03,484 --> 01:03:04,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't thought of that.

749
01:03:05,044 --> 01:03:06,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, he was.

750
01:03:06,605 --> 01:03:08,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And he benefited from hospice.

751
01:03:08,065 --> 01:03:11,266
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing about it is I was so close to it, I couldn't see it.

752
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:13,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other thing.

753
01:03:13,347 --> 01:03:18,408
[SPEAKER_01]: We need other people to come alongside us that can give us guidance and come along the path with us.

754
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:28,051
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing is getting information about how to deal with many common behaviors that occur when people are living with dementia.

755
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:42,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Different people have different kinds of behaviors, but things that are fairly common are something we call apathy, which is just not being as interested in the things that we've been interested in before.

756
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:45,928
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get more anxious if we don't actually know what's going on around us.

757
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:47,329
[SPEAKER_01]: That can make us feel anxious.

758
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:51,072
[SPEAKER_01]: we may start seeing things that other people are not seeing.

759
01:03:51,132 --> 01:03:58,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Lewy body dementia in particular, it's not uncommon for people to actually see like little people and other things that are not there.

760
01:03:59,098 --> 01:04:06,643
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not even bother the person living with dementia, but it can be quite bothersome to the caregiver because it's, it's scary.

761
01:04:06,824 --> 01:04:11,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they might start getting paranoid or start having delusions like,

762
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:16,503
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm pretty sure you stole my wallet, because I can't find it, right?

763
01:04:16,783 --> 01:04:21,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course they can't find it because they don't know where it is, but they will think that somebody stole it, right?

764
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:37,149
[SPEAKER_01]: So delusions can also be a common behavior, and knowing what these, and then being resistant, like I'm not gonna get in the bathtub anymore, I'm not gonna take a shower, these kind of things, knowing how to navigate them, we often don't guide people.

765
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:50,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Happily, there are ways to navigate these kind of behaviors, but it's useful to know kind of what the tips are, what the clues are, and a lot of times we don't provide that adequately to caregivers.

766
01:04:51,255 --> 01:05:00,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Safety, you know, you heard from Mike, it's pretty much the norm that people will get lost when they start developing dementia.

767
01:05:01,342 --> 01:05:07,546
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a game plan, you know, do I have a way to make sure that my loved one doesn't elope from the house?

768
01:05:08,226 --> 01:05:11,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when my father eloped from the house, scared the heck out of me.

769
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:20,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got locks that were down low so he couldn't notice them, so that he would be safe from eloping from the house.

770
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:24,725
[SPEAKER_01]: There are little tips, things that you can do, wearing a life alert, you know, having

771
01:05:26,207 --> 01:05:32,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I tell everybody, get somebody on your phone that actually knows where you are on your phone, you know, on Apple.

772
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,030
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Find My Friend.

773
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:40,132
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the more people actually help, we can help each other if we know, oh, why isn't, you know,

774
01:05:42,433 --> 01:05:48,755
[SPEAKER_01]: my uncle home yet, I look and find my friends and he's like nowhere where he should be, then I can go check on him, right?

775
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:56,337
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually there are more and more technological tools that we can use to help people from a safety perspective.

776
01:05:56,357 --> 01:05:57,817
[SPEAKER_01]: But safety becomes a big thing.

777
01:05:58,237 --> 01:06:01,418
[SPEAKER_01]: People can forget and leave their stove on, right?

778
01:06:01,438 --> 01:06:04,039
[SPEAKER_01]: They can leave stuff in the oven.

779
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:19,513
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of safety issues that can bubble up that are sometimes a little subtle and then the biggest one and most neurologists will tell us that this is actually the biggest challenge in talking with people is driving.

780
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:25,319
[SPEAKER_01]: No one likes to be told it's not a good time for you to drive anymore.

781
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:26,440
[SPEAKER_01]: No one.

782
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,502
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the hardest things for me was taking away my father's keys.

783
01:06:30,518 --> 01:06:32,600
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was not happy, not happy.

784
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:37,924
[SPEAKER_01]: So driving, but that becomes an issue, becomes a liability issue, right?

785
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:48,073
[SPEAKER_01]: If it becomes unsafe for us, for someone with dementia to drive, and then they get into an accident, then we could potentially be held at fault if we knew they had dementia, right?

786
01:06:48,553 --> 01:06:56,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to have these conversations up front, and to try to think about having them in as gentle, kind,

787
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:01,943
[SPEAKER_01]: and supportive ways possible, and then having alternative strategies.

788
01:07:02,384 --> 01:07:10,269
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, fortunately now we have, you know, ways that people can get around that's not just dependent on having my own car.

789
01:07:10,289 --> 01:07:11,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a car.

790
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:21,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy for the bus system and the T here, but, you know, there are ways for us to get around even when we have cognitive impairment and trying to give people a sense of

791
01:07:22,336 --> 01:07:28,139
[SPEAKER_01]: of solace around the fact that they are not being taken, their independence is being taken away.

792
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:33,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you heard from Mike, so I'm not going to talk about this that much, which is about planning for the future.

793
01:07:34,202 --> 01:07:37,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we think about planning for the future, it's a lot of stuff, right?

794
01:07:37,843 --> 01:07:41,445
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, is this house going to work anymore?

795
01:07:41,985 --> 01:07:46,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe there are a bunch of steps, and that's going to become a problem.

796
01:07:47,168 --> 01:07:48,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this house is not going to work anymore.

797
01:07:48,988 --> 01:07:55,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I need to look for a place where it's all one story, and the person doesn't have to go up steps.

798
01:07:55,430 --> 01:08:03,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it going to work actually from my own well-being for this person to live with me all the way to the end of their life?

799
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:04,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not be able to care for them.

800
01:08:04,772 --> 01:08:11,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I may need to be able to bring caregivers in, or I may need to think about some other living opportunity for them.

801
01:08:11,873 --> 01:08:13,754
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that are worth planning for.

802
01:08:14,534 --> 01:08:27,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike already talked about a power of attorney, crazy important, making sure that someone is actually a power of attorney for our legal affairs, our financial affairs, and our health care affairs.

803
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:32,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And many, many people don't think about that, but it's actually all of us would benefit from it.

804
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:38,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking, I was on a call recently with my daughter.

805
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:45,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I said to my daughter, have you decided on a health care proxy and do you have an advanced directive?

806
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:46,498
[SPEAKER_01]: She's 30.

807
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:50,180
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, she needs to decide.

808
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to be that decision maker?

809
01:08:51,801 --> 01:08:54,402
[SPEAKER_01]: She gets run over by a bus tomorrow, right?

810
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:55,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of us need that.

811
01:08:56,023 --> 01:09:01,906
[SPEAKER_01]: But it becomes really important as we develop dementia that we have someone we trust

812
01:09:02,366 --> 01:09:04,707
[SPEAKER_01]: who we are actually allocating those services to.

813
01:09:04,787 --> 01:09:15,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you haven't looked this up, I would really encourage you to look at the website called prepare for your care, all one word, prepareforyourcare.org.

814
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:26,281
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have a special, so they have advanced directives so you can actually say like I want this person to be my decision maker if I get hit by a bus or something like that.

815
01:09:26,761 --> 01:09:28,362
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they also have things like,

816
01:09:28,862 --> 01:09:31,464
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do you want this person to make decisions for you?

817
01:09:32,385 --> 01:09:35,206
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the sort of things you don't want them to make decisions for you about?

818
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:41,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a whole section for people who are living with dementia and who are care partners for living with dementia.

819
01:09:42,691 --> 01:09:49,296
[SPEAKER_01]: The other cool thing about it is it doesn't matter what state of the country you're in, you can click on it and any state will pop up.

820
01:09:49,836 --> 01:09:56,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I moved to Massachusetts, I printed out the Massachusetts Advance Directive, filled it out, got with my kids, said, here's what's up.

821
01:09:57,922 --> 01:10:09,134
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do that with that if you have, again, somebody who you know, or you're living with dementia, that you make sure that someone you trust is going to be that decision maker for you.

822
01:10:10,115 --> 01:10:10,456
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

823
01:10:12,085 --> 01:10:13,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So planning for the future.

824
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember I was talking about planning.

825
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:17,149
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really what I was getting at.

826
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:20,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And a colleague of mine calls it the six Ds.

827
01:10:21,913 --> 01:10:25,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they had to work a little hard at it, because who calls housing domicile?

828
01:10:25,295 --> 01:10:25,856
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway.

829
01:10:27,177 --> 01:10:28,978
[SPEAKER_01]: But domicile means housing.

830
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:33,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So is where I am right now going to work for me over the long haul?

831
01:10:34,122 --> 01:10:37,884
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth asking this question because it gets crazy hard to do it when it's a crisis.

832
01:10:38,444 --> 01:10:41,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's much better to think about doing it when it's not.

833
01:10:41,766 --> 01:10:43,006
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about driving.

834
01:10:43,446 --> 01:10:44,987
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about decision making.

835
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:50,750
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple other things to think about is what about my financial situation?

836
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,891
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to navigate this future?

837
01:10:53,731 --> 01:10:55,072
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I actually get help?

838
01:10:56,012 --> 01:11:05,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to people I trust, you know, a lot of our senior centers and this Medford Community Center have resources to help us think through like how to get support.

839
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:10,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're lucky in Massachusetts we have a lot more support than some other places.

840
01:11:11,504 --> 01:11:13,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what about drugs?

841
01:11:13,905 --> 01:11:21,511
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know about you, but I often see people who I would say they collect medications over the years.

842
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:22,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

843
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody gives them some medicine.

844
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,761
[SPEAKER_01]: They got that one.

845
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:27,403
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone else gives them another medicine.

846
01:11:27,443 --> 01:11:27,863
[SPEAKER_01]: They got one.

847
01:11:27,963 --> 01:11:30,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, next thing you know, they're like 10 to 12 medicines.

848
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:33,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, do I still need all of these?

849
01:11:33,949 --> 01:11:36,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And often the answer is no.

850
01:11:37,072 --> 01:11:41,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thing to advocate for with your doctor is say, do I still need all these medicines?

851
01:11:41,857 --> 01:11:44,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know each one of these drugs are interacting with each other.

852
01:11:45,160 --> 01:12:00,368
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might feel a heck of a lot, and I've seen many people, they feel so much better when they got off those medicines that they didn't need anyway, and actually are no longer having to interact with other medicines or with their food.

853
01:12:00,989 --> 01:12:10,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about your drugs, and think about how to make sure that you're only on the ones that you need to be on and not on a whole bunch that we tend to collect over time.

854
01:12:11,514 --> 01:12:12,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally,

855
01:12:13,513 --> 01:12:19,035
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an illness that will ultimately lead to the end of our life and to our death.

856
01:12:19,075 --> 01:12:20,276
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we plan for that?

857
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:27,039
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we actually plan for that now so that it is a peaceful journey as possible?

858
01:12:28,089 --> 01:12:32,570
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make sure that what we want is, again, what we get?

859
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:35,331
[SPEAKER_01]: That really requires talking to other people.

860
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:40,432
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times, we don't like to go there when we, you know, well, I'll go there, talk about dying, you know.

861
01:12:41,012 --> 01:12:48,894
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, it's good to go there, to actually think about how I can make sure that I'm getting what I want.

862
01:12:50,114 --> 01:13:04,646
[SPEAKER_01]: near when I get when the end is near because if I don't talk to people about it they're going to guess and that's not going to feel good to them and it likely is they're going to not necessarily guess right so that's also worth thinking about so if we move on

863
01:13:06,206 --> 01:13:10,688
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the common symptoms that I was talking about before that we commonly see.

864
01:13:10,828 --> 01:13:16,350
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of different strategies to actually address these symptoms and the stress associated with them.

865
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:25,454
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hear about two studies in just a minute that are studies that are trying to help us figure out the best way to support these kind of messages.

866
01:13:26,154 --> 01:13:27,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you go to the next slide.

867
01:13:28,675 --> 01:13:33,258
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really what I talk about when I'm talking to caregivers and care partners.

868
01:13:33,718 --> 01:13:35,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, Mike, you said it so beautifully.

869
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:46,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that oftentimes, when someone is developing dementia, they're not going to remember stuff the way it was you remember it.

870
01:13:47,346 --> 01:13:49,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually may even be in a different reality.

871
01:13:50,428 --> 01:13:51,989
[SPEAKER_01]: But they often will say things.

872
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:57,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than correcting them and making them feel judged, we can just go along.

873
01:13:58,613 --> 01:13:59,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can just love them.

874
01:13:59,657 --> 01:14:04,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember that it's the tone of our words more than the content of our words.

875
01:14:05,051 --> 01:14:07,593
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother-in-law also had dementia.

876
01:14:07,773 --> 01:14:12,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we'd go visit her, basically, she could not figure out who any of us were.

877
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:17,440
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was important to her was, were we friend or foe?

878
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:23,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And she could tell if we were friend or foe, depending on our behavior and how we sort of behaved with her.

879
01:14:24,185 --> 01:14:33,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really paying attention to being unthreatening, non-threatening, gentle, and being much more

880
01:14:33,732 --> 01:14:42,999
[SPEAKER_01]: just going along with whatever their reality is as opposed to what, like, no mom, it wasn't that, you know, that won't help.

881
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really paying attention to that I think is really important.

882
01:14:47,102 --> 01:14:47,923
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we move on.

883
01:14:49,813 --> 01:14:52,896
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably the most important thing I'd just like to suggest to you.

884
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:56,439
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so awesome that everybody is here in community together.

885
01:14:57,099 --> 01:14:59,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't go it alone.

886
01:15:00,322 --> 01:15:10,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy, and we're seeing this in research studies that we're doing right now, that people who are caregivers of people living with dementia can become so isolated.

887
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:16,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what happens is sometimes the neighbors or the friends, they actually don't know how to navigate

888
01:15:16,796 --> 01:15:18,256
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who's living with dementia.

889
01:15:18,296 --> 01:15:23,157
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of their own discomfort about that, they start backing away.

890
01:15:23,837 --> 01:15:28,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And that backing away doesn't just affect that person with dementia, it affects the care partner with dementia.

891
01:15:28,378 --> 01:15:31,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And that care partner can become isolated.

892
01:15:31,419 --> 01:15:33,019
[SPEAKER_01]: So do not go it alone.

893
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Helen Keller said, alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.

894
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:38,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I deeply believe that.

895
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:40,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Next.

896
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:45,352
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some helpful resources.

897
01:15:45,392 --> 01:15:47,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to just show you a couple slides of helpful resources.

898
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:56,782
[SPEAKER_01]: This book on the left is written by a colleague of ours, and it's specifically helpful if you're a child of somebody living with dementia.

899
01:15:57,302 --> 01:16:01,285
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of written for an adult child of someone with dementia.

900
01:16:01,345 --> 01:16:03,707
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for anybody, but it's particularly helpful that way.

901
01:16:04,628 --> 01:16:09,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you look over here at the top, the Alzheimer's Association has a bunch of great stuff.

902
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:16,652
[SPEAKER_01]: The National Caregiver Alliance and the Dementia Care Collaborative are all places where you can go to get additional support.

903
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:17,953
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the next slide,

904
01:16:19,073 --> 01:16:24,515
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard Mike talk about MAGIC, what we call MAGIC, which is the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.

905
01:16:24,895 --> 01:16:35,998
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bunch of things which we call our Roadmap Series, which provides a ton of jam-packed information about a number of different sort of topics that are relevant to dementia.

906
01:16:36,398 --> 01:16:38,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is called the Roadmap to Caregiving.

907
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:41,540
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a bunch of stuff.

908
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:44,961
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either look at it online or you can just print it out, download it.

909
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:46,521
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there for the taking.

910
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:48,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you go next,

911
01:16:52,793 --> 01:16:59,075
[SPEAKER_01]: These are two research studies that we have ongoing right now that we would love for you to become involved in.

912
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:04,316
[SPEAKER_01]: One is called the Social Study, and Sahana is going to tell you about that in a minute.

913
01:17:05,196 --> 01:17:16,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other is a study to assess an app that helps with mindfulness-guided imagery and support techniques to improve mood for dementia caregivers.

914
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:20,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, Dr. Ramirez-Gomez, are you game for talking about that one?

915
01:17:21,562 --> 01:17:21,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

916
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:22,483
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

917
01:17:22,783 --> 01:17:23,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Sahana come on up.

918
01:17:29,106 --> 01:17:29,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everyone.

919
01:17:29,866 --> 01:17:30,827
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Sahana.

920
01:17:31,707 --> 01:17:33,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a clinical research coordinator.

921
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:37,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with Christine and I'm going to talk a little bit about the social study.

922
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:39,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep it brief because it's getting kind of late.

923
01:17:40,732 --> 01:17:45,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So the social study stands for supporting our caregivers in ADR D learning.

924
01:17:46,054 --> 01:17:49,577
[SPEAKER_02]: What ADRD is, is Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

925
01:17:49,997 --> 01:18:02,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really looking for unpaid caregivers of people living with dementia, and looking to see how a six-week program can support them, reduce their stress, and improve their well-being overall.

926
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:06,548
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only six weeks, and each session is 60 minutes.

927
01:18:07,109 --> 01:18:13,133
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fully virtual, so you can do it from anywhere, your phone, tablet, anything like that.

928
01:18:13,153 --> 01:18:14,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.

929
01:18:15,214 --> 01:18:18,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're interested, please feel free to talk to me after this.

930
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:22,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have flyers located on the left side of the blue table up here.

931
01:18:22,537 --> 01:18:22,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

932
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:45,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you have been sitting now for a long time, so I'll be very short, but I want to highlight again and provide an invitation to all of you, because each of you count, like your friends, your neighbors, your community.

933
01:18:45,838 --> 01:18:49,703
[SPEAKER_03]: You are important for us, and we want everybody to be included.

934
01:18:50,324 --> 01:18:53,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I have said it again and I will keep saying it.

935
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:57,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I work a lot, for example, with my Latino community.

936
01:18:58,193 --> 01:19:03,180
[SPEAKER_03]: All of you are our community, so we want to invite you to participate.

937
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, there is a lot of information, flyers, opportunities that you have.

938
01:19:08,246 --> 01:19:14,448
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want you to know that not only you count, but we also want to help, because that's the goal of research.

939
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:17,470
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not just collecting information for the sake of it.

940
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:18,870
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make a difference.

941
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:27,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, we are going to achieve that by, of course, understanding better what's happening in these different communities.

942
01:19:27,774 --> 01:19:31,635
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we different from all those numbers that we heard today?

943
01:19:31,755 --> 01:19:33,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is a risk higher?

944
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:34,697
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening here?

945
01:19:34,757 --> 01:19:39,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Then how can we lower that risk and make things better for each one of us?

946
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:46,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, of course, I work a lot with the caregivers, with the patients, with healthy, with everybody.

947
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:57,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So I invite you to consider joining us in this effort because we want to count everybody on this journey.

948
01:20:04,187 --> 01:20:07,910
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so we actually have something interesting.

949
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:13,353
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one of our researchers who we're going to try and do this virtually.

950
01:20:13,713 --> 01:20:15,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Key word in that phrase is try.

951
01:20:17,176 --> 01:20:21,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Seth Gale is going to be talking about a study that we have.

952
01:20:21,218 --> 01:20:22,459
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the AHEAD Study.

953
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:29,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cool thing about the AHEAD Study is that they're looking for people who do not have Alzheimer's.

954
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:31,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

955
01:20:33,933 --> 01:20:36,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you've got to have a baseline.

956
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to steal Seth's thunder.

957
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:41,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, come on.

958
01:20:41,721 --> 01:20:43,764
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try to figure it out.

959
01:20:44,777 --> 01:21:03,564
[SPEAKER_05]: um see this is why we have and so you know what while we're trying to figure out this out i've got a special guest appearance tonight everybody i mentioned him earlier so let me do this tony come on up man this is

960
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:14,433
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Tony Pham, who's been working on chronic pain in African-Americans.

961
01:21:15,214 --> 01:21:18,816
[SPEAKER_05]: And he started up some workshop series.

962
01:21:19,156 --> 01:21:20,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I said, I'm not stealing your thunder.

963
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:21,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Jump in here.

964
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:24,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I just swallowed some gum.

965
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:25,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.

966
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:33,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I just would like to get a moment to have a round of applause for this community center.

967
01:21:38,203 --> 01:21:44,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep it brief, but I really do appreciate these spaces because I feel they're so important for the wellness of the community.

968
01:21:44,711 --> 01:21:52,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you've seen, there's a lot of creative efforts that are underway to meet the unmet needs of

969
01:21:53,981 --> 01:21:58,764
[SPEAKER_06]: different ethno-racial populations, different disorders, different illnesses.

970
01:21:58,865 --> 01:22:21,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm part of a group at Mass General with Mr. Mike Kincaid, Noman, Mary back there, and we're actually looking to bring evidence-based interventions into the community setting by way of making interventions deliverable by people in the community for the community.

971
01:22:22,063 --> 01:22:29,189
[SPEAKER_06]: at a price that's not inexorbitantly expensive, in a way that is culturally accessible.

972
01:22:29,929 --> 01:22:38,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And so our study, among several to be mentioned here, is looking to culturally adapt a mind-body intervention

973
01:22:39,356 --> 01:22:45,260
[SPEAKER_06]: for older black Americans who have early cognitive decline and chronic pain.

974
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:57,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's an interesting thing to take into account because folks with chronic pain are two times more likely to have early cognitive decline, as we call it, and the two work to make each other worse.

975
01:22:57,787 --> 01:23:03,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very important to target all the things associated with aging concerns, such as early cognitive decline.

976
01:23:03,991 --> 01:23:19,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And to do this, we're building a community advisory board, essentially bringing together experts from the community with lived experience who identify as older black Americans, who identify as having chronic pain and having early cognitive decline.

977
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:26,845
[SPEAKER_06]: to essentially give their input so that we can create this intervention for delivery in the community.

978
01:23:27,965 --> 01:23:33,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Because essentially, like others have mentioned, insurance rates are so high sometimes.

979
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:36,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Health care is very inaccessible at times.

980
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:39,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important to figure out creative ways to get care for those who need it.

981
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:47,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a shameless plug.

982
01:23:47,716 --> 01:23:49,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you'll be seeing Tony again.

983
01:23:51,147 --> 01:23:54,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as I shared, I love this community health center.

984
01:23:55,870 --> 01:24:00,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've got to be honest, when I got here, I was like, I've been here before.

985
01:24:01,915 --> 01:24:03,356
[SPEAKER_05]: But it has been so long ago.

986
01:24:04,296 --> 01:24:10,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, if invited, that's a shameless plug, we would love to come back.

987
01:24:10,741 --> 01:24:14,303
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, are we ready?

988
01:24:15,424 --> 01:24:17,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

989
01:24:17,506 --> 01:24:17,846
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, Seth.

990
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

991
01:24:19,809 --> 01:24:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hear you.

992
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:26,513
[SPEAKER_05]: So ladies and gentlemen, this is Dr. Seth Gale, who, Seth, you're going to take us home, OK?

993
01:24:27,134 --> 01:24:27,994
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the last speaker tonight.

994
01:24:28,014 --> 01:24:28,295
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

995
01:24:29,035 --> 01:24:29,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

996
01:24:29,575 --> 01:24:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make sure you can hear me, though.

997
01:24:31,677 --> 01:24:32,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you?

998
01:24:32,057 --> 01:24:32,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

999
01:24:33,478 --> 01:24:33,958
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1000
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:36,420
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a great discussion.

1001
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry that I can't be there in person.

1002
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:39,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been listening to all of it.

1003
01:24:40,342 --> 01:24:41,703
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have wonderful questions.

1004
01:24:41,723 --> 01:24:43,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone, for coming tonight.

1005
01:24:44,745 --> 01:24:47,006
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm Dr. Gale, Seth Gale.

1006
01:24:48,871 --> 01:24:52,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Ramirez Gomez was talking about her role at Mass General.

1007
01:24:52,415 --> 01:24:53,396
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a similar role.

1008
01:24:53,436 --> 01:25:05,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a neurologist at Brigham and Women's, and we work really closely together on a number of things, including research studies and also care, taking care of patients.

1009
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:12,543
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a couple of themes I want to pick up on, and I want to talk about mainly a study.

1010
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:14,444
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the main thing I want to get to.

1011
01:25:14,504 --> 01:25:18,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've talked about detecting Alzheimer's early.

1012
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:32,235
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been a big theme in this discussion, from Mike's original conversation, from someone in the audience who talked about having a PET scan done with recognizing symptoms early.

1013
01:25:33,656 --> 01:25:35,317
[SPEAKER_07]: All of this is geared towards

1014
01:25:36,033 --> 01:25:49,480
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to figure out what to do if you identify changes in the brain for someone that is early Alzheimer's disease, really early, even before you have symptoms.

1015
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you do about that?

1016
01:25:52,162 --> 01:26:00,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, like a lot of conditions, you know, you think about diabetes or heart disease, the goal, right, is to identify

1017
01:26:02,085 --> 01:26:05,908
[SPEAKER_07]: changes early so you can try to intervene and to do something about it.

1018
01:26:06,569 --> 01:26:19,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So take diabetes, we all want to know when sugar starts to change in a way before it starts to give neuropathy and before it starts to affect vision and that sort of thing.

1019
01:26:19,561 --> 01:26:21,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So the brain is no different in that way.

1020
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,704
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea is to try to detect these changes early.

1021
01:26:23,824 --> 01:26:23,965
[SPEAKER_07]: So

1022
01:26:26,521 --> 01:26:29,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not clear, though, what to do at that point, right?

1023
01:26:29,744 --> 01:26:45,280
[SPEAKER_07]: You can advise all of the healthy lifestyle things that are really important, and I don't want to minimize at all things like exercise and having a healthy diet and having positive social interactions and reducing stress and getting good sleep and these things.

1024
01:26:45,987 --> 01:26:49,930
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not clear exactly what else can be done.

1025
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a study that we're doing.

1026
01:26:52,492 --> 01:27:00,119
[SPEAKER_07]: The Brigham is one site for this study of about 85 or 90 worldwide, actually.

1027
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:04,983
[SPEAKER_07]: That's called the AHEAD Study, like step ahead or jump ahead.

1028
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:10,027
[SPEAKER_07]: And this study is for people who are age 55 to 80, who

1029
01:27:16,412 --> 01:27:19,374
[SPEAKER_07]: don't have any memory difficulty.

1030
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:21,335
[SPEAKER_07]: They could be worried about memory.

1031
01:27:26,378 --> 01:27:30,561
[SPEAKER_08]: People are laughing because some of them are older than 80.

1032
01:27:30,721 --> 01:27:31,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Older than 80.

1033
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:36,885
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't qualify for the study.

1034
01:27:37,846 --> 01:27:38,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1035
01:27:38,426 --> 01:27:38,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1036
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:42,208
[SPEAKER_07]: But they may know some youngins.

1037
01:27:42,409 --> 01:27:42,889
Oh, we do.

1038
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:44,570
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1039
01:27:47,114 --> 01:27:48,294
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a bunch of studies.

1040
01:27:48,314 --> 01:27:56,196
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually, I want to check one thing before because the age limits are slightly different.

1041
01:27:56,216 --> 01:27:57,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so I was right.

1042
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:59,137
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is 55 to 80.

1043
01:27:59,377 --> 01:28:02,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a bunch of studies that go to age 85.

1044
01:28:03,258 --> 01:28:07,159
[SPEAKER_07]: But the idea of this study is you have to be age 55 to 80.

1045
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:12,860
[SPEAKER_07]: You come in for a visit, and you have a basic memory test done.

1046
01:28:13,843 --> 01:28:17,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can be worried about having memory difficulty.

1047
01:28:20,387 --> 01:28:22,449
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay, but you don't have to even be worried.

1048
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:34,097
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just be someone who's living your life and it's important for you to, you know, figure out a way to give back or participate in research and maybe you have a family history.

1049
01:28:34,117 --> 01:28:35,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all possibilities.

1050
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:39,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have a basic memory test done.

1051
01:28:40,061 --> 01:28:42,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a blood test that's done.

1052
01:28:42,956 --> 01:29:01,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And that blood test has these tests for these kind of fragments in the blood, which the brain is giving off, that can predict whether there are Alzheimer's changes going on in the brain from the blood test.

1053
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:04,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a really neat, this is a really neat

1054
01:29:06,429 --> 01:29:12,915
[SPEAKER_07]: fairly new technology advancement to be able to detect that.

1055
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:29,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have this blood test, and the blood test indicates that if you were to look at the brain in a scan, if you were to go into a scanner and look at the brain, then you would have these plaques we've been talking about, these amyloid plaques.

1056
01:29:30,731 --> 01:29:32,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's the first step of the study.

1057
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:40,534
[SPEAKER_07]: an abnormal blood test, which would correlate with having plaques in the brain.

1058
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:56,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's the case, if it's positive, the test, then you come in to have the imaging test, which is called a PET scan, which we were talking a little bit about earlier in the discussion, to confirm that.

1059
01:29:57,447 --> 01:30:03,552
[SPEAKER_07]: To confirm that you're cognitively normal, so your memory and your thinking is normal for age,

1060
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:23,037
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have these early signs and we call that's kind of like having the condition Alzheimer's, but before you have symptoms right so you don't all the things that Mike and others have talked about related to, you know, having confusion or forgetting things that that's not happening yet for you.

1061
01:30:24,448 --> 01:30:29,150
[SPEAKER_07]: But you find all of this out, by the way, in these first two visits that I just described in this study.

1062
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:50,076
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what happens then is if you have these plaques on the brain imaging test, which is called a PET scan, then you're enrolled in a study, which is a four-year study, that's looking at a medication called Lecanumab or Lekembe.

1063
01:30:50,836 --> 01:30:52,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a medication that you may have

1064
01:30:56,047 --> 01:31:12,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I'm getting feedback, but this is a medication that we just started to use, as Dr. Ramirez-Gomez talked about, for patients with early Alzheimer's disease.

1065
01:31:13,162 --> 01:31:21,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it went through all the studies and it was approved by the FDA for use, but what we don't know is if this medication

1066
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:30,316
[SPEAKER_07]: can be helpful for people who do not yet have symptoms, but they have the same brain changes that we see a little bit later on.

1067
01:31:30,957 --> 01:31:35,463
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really like early intervention, early, early changes.

1068
01:31:37,898 --> 01:31:54,285
[SPEAKER_07]: To go back to one of the points that Mike made about participation, which is that we just don't know if there aren't, we don't know differential effects in different populations if there isn't participation from different populations.

1069
01:31:54,705 --> 01:31:56,285
[SPEAKER_07]: That includes Black population.

1070
01:31:56,346 --> 01:31:58,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that this series is focused on Black health.

1071
01:31:59,327 --> 01:32:02,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It includes Pacific or Islander populations.

1072
01:32:02,228 --> 01:32:03,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It includes Hispanic Americans.

1073
01:32:03,829 --> 01:32:04,369
[SPEAKER_07]: It includes

1074
01:32:05,581 --> 01:32:12,470
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone across racial and ethnic lines and sex lines as well, men and women.

1075
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:23,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Mike was alluding to, you know, research will go on and the idea is to maximize knowledge that

1076
01:32:24,278 --> 01:32:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: so that results of a study like the one I'm describing can be applied in a way to everyone.

1077
01:32:31,322 --> 01:32:47,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there isn't fair and equal participation and representation that represents the population in the United States, then we're not going to know what needs to be changed about treatment or about research in order to answer those questions.

1078
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:51,992
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my brief summary of a

1079
01:32:52,705 --> 01:32:56,546
[SPEAKER_07]: of a big study that we're inviting people to come and participate in.

1080
01:32:56,626 --> 01:33:01,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm happy to answer any questions about it or to go into more detail about it.

1081
01:33:01,988 --> 01:33:06,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, Mike, it makes sense to open up to questions like for the last kind of 10, 15 minutes here.

1082
01:33:07,309 --> 01:33:08,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we have any?

1083
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:09,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1084
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,331
[SPEAKER_05]: This is early in your presentation.

1085
01:33:13,351 --> 01:33:14,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me let me let me.

1086
01:33:14,411 --> 01:33:15,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Seth, can you hear her?

1087
01:33:16,392 --> 01:33:16,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1088
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:17,392
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, go ahead.

1089
01:33:21,357 --> 01:33:30,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I got in your earlier presentation about PET scans.

1090
01:33:31,764 --> 01:33:38,688
[SPEAKER_11]: The PET scan that you were talking about, when you get the PET scan, does that determine what type of Alzheimer's, dementia that you may have?

1091
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:39,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a good question.

1092
01:33:39,429 --> 01:33:46,733
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the doctor's office- So Seth, real quick, for the folks at home, the question was, the PET scan, does it determine what type of Alzheimer's you have?

1093
01:33:48,054 --> 01:33:48,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Or dementia.

1094
01:33:48,514 --> 01:33:49,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Or dementia.

1095
01:33:49,435 --> 01:33:50,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, what type of dementia you have?

1096
01:33:51,997 --> 01:34:03,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So this particular PET scan I was talking about in the context when you would come in to participate in the AHEAD study I was describing, is looking specifically for Alzheimer's disease.

1097
01:34:03,661 --> 01:34:08,383
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the kind of dementia that is defined by these amyloid plaques.

1098
01:34:09,204 --> 01:34:20,408
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think this question gets at, in general, if you have memory or thinking or behavior changes, and you come in to see a doctor like myself or Dr. Ritchie or Dr. Ramirez-Gomez,

1099
01:34:21,263 --> 01:34:29,485
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we figure out what kind of dementia it is in order to figure out what is the recommendation and is there a certain medication to use?

1100
01:34:30,065 --> 01:34:33,266
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's different pieces of information that can help with that.

1101
01:34:34,787 --> 01:34:36,967
[SPEAKER_07]: There is the symptoms themselves.

1102
01:34:37,087 --> 01:34:38,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So what exactly is happening?

1103
01:34:38,908 --> 01:34:42,529
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of memory or behavior or thinking change is it?

1104
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:47,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just memory or is it also problem solving or decision-making?

1105
01:34:48,137 --> 01:35:00,586
[SPEAKER_07]: does the person also have this kind of sleep difficulty or are there changes with their walking or their gait or their eye movement?

1106
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:03,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, that's the category of what we call symptoms.

1107
01:35:03,548 --> 01:35:11,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So just like any condition, asthma or lung disease, there's a series of symptoms you would present to the doctor with.

1108
01:35:11,054 --> 01:35:14,857
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just I'm having memory difficulty, but we will fine tune and figure that out.

1109
01:35:15,297 --> 01:35:17,938
[SPEAKER_07]: The second is a regular scan of the brain.

1110
01:35:18,038 --> 01:35:20,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So not a PET scan, but like an MRI scan.

1111
01:35:20,919 --> 01:35:29,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes, not always, but sometimes there's a pattern on that MRI which can correlate with the symptoms that the person has.

1112
01:35:30,383 --> 01:35:36,626
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have symptoms, you have an MRI scan, and then you have memory and thinking testing.

1113
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:46,628
[SPEAKER_07]: So not just remember this word and tell it to me two minutes later, but more detailed testing like, can you copy this image?

1114
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:53,276
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I read this paragraph to you, I want you to try to remember these specific facts.

1115
01:35:53,316 --> 01:35:56,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically performance on memory and thinking tests.

1116
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:02,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you combine these three pieces of information, you're building a story of like a diagnosis.

1117
01:36:02,545 --> 01:36:04,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this Lewy body dementia?

1118
01:36:04,446 --> 01:36:06,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this Alzheimer's disease?

1119
01:36:06,848 --> 01:36:11,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this frontotemporal dementia and these other kinds of rare dementias?

1120
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:17,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what that kind of that question is getting at, which is there are tools to use.

1121
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:21,120
[SPEAKER_07]: It is true, just like with a stroke,

1122
01:36:21,934 --> 01:36:32,442
[SPEAKER_07]: that the definitive diagnosis, the 100% diagnosis is like what you look at with a biopsy, which we don't do for the brain typically, or you look after death.

1123
01:36:32,882 --> 01:36:35,564
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the 100% definitive diagnosis.

1124
01:36:36,284 --> 01:36:40,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't stop us from being almost there.

1125
01:36:40,487 --> 01:36:47,412
[SPEAKER_07]: With all these tools I described, especially with these markers, we're 95, 97% there.

1126
01:36:47,693 --> 01:36:50,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the same thing we do with all diseases, with pneumonia,

1127
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:58,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuberculosis, we have biomarkers, we have blood tests, and so we're getting much, much better at figuring it out.

1128
01:36:58,933 --> 01:37:13,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's important to distinguish the fact that we can have actionable information, like treating someone with an Alzheimer's medication based on that information, without having the brain after death, like an autopsy.

1129
01:37:13,215 --> 01:37:16,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need that to have an actionable treatment.

1130
01:37:18,539 --> 01:37:21,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I've got a question here.

1131
01:37:22,481 --> 01:37:24,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll repeat the question, go ahead, because the microphone won't reach there.

1132
01:37:32,424 --> 01:37:33,825
[SPEAKER_05]: We will get the microphone to you.

1133
01:37:35,646 --> 01:37:39,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.

1134
01:37:39,747 --> 01:37:44,609
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a... What is it called?

1135
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:46,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Aphasia?

1136
01:37:57,085 --> 01:38:15,872
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was little, going on third grade, when I come out of school and I go home,

1137
01:38:17,051 --> 01:38:23,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I fell asleep and wake up.

1138
01:38:28,096 --> 01:38:39,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Every... I had... So is it a question about sleeping?

1139
01:38:41,623 --> 01:38:42,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Take your time.

1140
01:38:44,624 --> 01:38:45,325
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a...

1141
01:38:46,685 --> 01:38:59,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Here and there and there.

1142
01:38:59,594 --> 01:39:00,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Older.

1143
01:39:00,895 --> 01:39:03,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Older brothers and sisters.

1144
01:39:03,657 --> 01:39:03,957
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1145
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:04,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1146
01:39:04,878 --> 01:39:05,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Older.

1147
01:39:05,198 --> 01:39:08,061
[SPEAKER_15]: And I went to school.

1148
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:17,957
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm 80.

1149
01:39:19,038 --> 01:39:25,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Over and over and over.

1150
01:39:26,683 --> 01:39:27,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1151
01:39:27,364 --> 01:39:30,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, 80.

1152
01:39:48,203 --> 01:39:49,343
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm 80.

1153
01:39:50,283 --> 01:39:51,544
[SPEAKER_05]: You're young enough to be in the study.

1154
01:39:51,824 --> 01:39:53,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1155
01:39:53,784 --> 01:40:13,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I, uh,

1156
01:40:15,154 --> 01:40:15,554
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

1157
01:40:15,835 --> 01:40:16,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

1158
01:40:17,056 --> 01:40:17,376
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1159
01:40:17,396 --> 01:40:20,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to stick around afterwards, so if you want, just grab me and we'll talk.

1160
01:40:20,959 --> 01:40:21,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1161
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:22,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

1162
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:23,982
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1163
01:40:24,042 --> 01:40:24,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1164
01:40:25,883 --> 01:40:26,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did I?

1165
01:40:27,505 --> 01:40:30,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1166
01:40:30,828 --> 01:40:31,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I have another question?

1167
01:40:31,588 --> 01:40:32,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I did.

1168
01:40:32,669 --> 01:40:33,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1169
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:35,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it ain't getting back there.

1170
01:40:36,152 --> 01:40:36,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1171
01:40:36,372 --> 01:40:36,873
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the question?

1172
01:40:49,740 --> 01:41:02,349
[SPEAKER_00]: What can someone do at a younger age to try and lessen the chance of getting dementia if that's even possible?

1173
01:41:02,369 --> 01:41:17,099
[SPEAKER_05]: So Seth, the question for the folks at home watching this in the comfort of their home, the question is, are there other risk factors besides age, and is there anything that someone can do preventative to try and keep from getting Alzheimer's or at least delaying it?

1174
01:41:19,597 --> 01:41:20,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there are definitely.

1175
01:41:21,438 --> 01:41:22,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to take a stab at it too.

1176
01:41:22,939 --> 01:41:25,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I also know that Dr. Ramirez-Gomez is there too.

1177
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:31,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want the Q&A just to be about what I'm saying, what I started with my study.

1178
01:41:31,664 --> 01:41:33,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me start and others can add.

1179
01:41:35,326 --> 01:41:46,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are a lot of modifiable risk factors, that is things that you can do from middle age and even earlier on to reduce your risk of dementia.

1180
01:41:46,989 --> 01:41:49,111
[SPEAKER_07]: And this includes some of the things we've talked about.

1181
01:41:49,231 --> 01:42:13,948
[SPEAKER_07]: So things like getting regular physical activity and aerobic exercise, maintaining a diet that is close to like what we think about as what we might call like the Mediterranean style diet or a diet that has low amounts of saturated fats and processed sugar.

1182
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:37,666
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that for those in middle to older age that hearing difficulty when untreated is itself an independent risk factor to either hasten the onset of memory impairment or to kind of lead or be a risk factor for dementia.

1183
01:42:37,706 --> 01:42:43,030
[SPEAKER_07]: So getting hearing aids and making sure that hearing is tested is something that can be done later.

1184
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:47,271
[SPEAKER_07]: These are just some of the things that we know.

1185
01:42:47,331 --> 01:42:57,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know this information from when you study people in these long-term aging studies from, say, you know, 40s, 50s.

1186
01:42:57,256 --> 01:43:00,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish we could go earlier and have more, you know, even earlier.

1187
01:43:01,278 --> 01:43:10,602
[SPEAKER_07]: You can interview people and really get detailed information about what kinds of lifestyle behaviors they're doing, what region, where they live.

1188
01:43:12,665 --> 01:43:21,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Seth, Seth, only reason why I'm getting ready to cut you off is because somebody, I'm not mentioning any names, Sophie, forgot to charge their laptop.

1189
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:25,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're about to lose you.

1190
01:43:28,131 --> 01:43:29,852
[SPEAKER_05]: The battery thing just popped up.

1191
01:43:32,213 --> 01:43:35,094
[SPEAKER_05]: But let me say this, because we're also just about at time.

1192
01:43:37,245 --> 01:43:39,325
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I want to say thank you all for coming.

1193
01:43:40,086 --> 01:43:40,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I've enjoyed this.

1194
01:43:41,626 --> 01:43:43,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've already chatted with Lisa.

1195
01:43:43,587 --> 01:43:44,307
[SPEAKER_05]: We're coming back.

1196
01:43:45,108 --> 01:43:47,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I love a cliffhanger.

1197
01:43:49,309 --> 01:43:50,250
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to come back.

1198
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:57,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we'll do is instead of me bringing a gazillion doctors, why don't we do like one at a time or two at a time and we can just talk.

1199
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:05,615
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so on behalf of the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, I want to say thank you for coming out on a Wednesday night.

1200
01:44:08,818 --> 01:44:11,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It is literally 8 o'clock.

1201
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:12,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1202
01:44:19,346 --> 01:44:20,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Liliana, did you get her to ask that question?

1203
01:44:22,168 --> 01:44:23,509
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do this in Spanish.

1204
01:44:24,410 --> 01:44:25,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do this in English.

1205
01:44:26,232 --> 01:44:29,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can find somebody to translate in another language, we can do it there.

1206
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:31,638
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my way of saying, yes, we can.

1207
01:44:32,178 --> 01:44:34,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So having said that, Sophie, take us home.

1208
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:39,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Mike said it already.

1209
01:44:39,591 --> 01:44:40,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, everyone, for coming out.

1210
01:44:41,212 --> 01:44:46,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I learned a lot through the first time I reached out to Mike.

1211
01:44:46,837 --> 01:44:48,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Up until now, thank you, Dr. Gayle.

1212
01:44:48,938 --> 01:44:54,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Ritchie, Dr. Ramirez-Gomez, and everyone else.

1213
01:44:54,943 --> 01:44:58,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony, Dr. Sahara, thank you for coming out.

1214
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:03,349
[SPEAKER_08]: And our next series will be on Black maternal health next month.

1215
01:45:07,274 --> 01:45:08,555
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, we're out of time.

1216
01:45:08,595 --> 01:45:12,736
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did charge my computer, but we're using the OWL.

1217
01:45:13,176 --> 01:45:15,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I had to plug in the same port.

1218
01:45:15,357 --> 01:45:17,498
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you, everyone, and have a good night.
