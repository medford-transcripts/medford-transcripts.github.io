    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=0.089s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  Or I go to the next slide.
 Let's start since you started out with six show of hands.
 How many people counted six.
 OK.
 I've got about six hands.
 I noticed you didn't put your hand back.
 How many people counted seven.
 How many people counted eight.
 How many people counted nine.
 How many people right now are not sure.
 And I wish we could do it find out from what's going on at home.
 The people watching this.
 There are nine.
 OK, let's do this together, all together now.
 Fairness, F, final, two, of, three, of, four, effective, five, six, effort, seven, eight, of, diversity, nine.
 There were nine.
 It was right there in front of you, and you missed it.
 Now, this is the part where I have to say, everybody take a deep breath, because this has got nothing to do with Alzheimer's.
 It's got nothing to do with memory.
 It's an optical illusion.
 But the point is, it proves my point that sometimes something is right in front of you and you don't, remember I said those warning signs?
 It's right in front of you and you don't see it until the wheels fall off.
 By the way, before we go to the next slide, anybody who would like to take a picture to dazzle their friends and loved ones?
 So you can always rewrite it and take that answer out.
 I still have family members who to this day still see seven and won't talk to me about it.
 Okay, let's go to the next slide.
 So I started out by saying the number one question that is asked of me is what's the difference between dementia and Alzheimer's disease?
 And I have met, just recently, just the other day I was at a program, Saturday I was doing a program, and a woman said that her mother had been diagnosed with, and I'm not making this up, a slight case of dementia.
 Like I told you, I've got doctors in the room, so please don't get upset at me at this, but that's a cop-out diagnosis.
 That's not telling you anything you didn't know.
 For you to have taken Nana to the doctor, you're concerned about her memory, you know something's wrong.
 And the example I always use for that, and this is a really bad analogy, but ladies, if you missed your period for three months and you went to go see your OBGYN and they told you you were slightly pregnant, come back in six months, if you didn't fire that fool, that's on you.
 So let's see what dementia is.
 Let's go to the next one.
 Dementia is an umbrella term.
 Dementia is symptoms of a disease that impacts average daily lifestyle.
 Now if I told you right now my right big toe hurt, what do you know?
 See, some of you are looking, see, I shouldn't have done the F game, because some of you are like, I ain't answering that question.
 All you know is my right big toe hurts.
 You don't know, are these fancy shoes too tight?
 Did I stub my toe?
 Is it painful enough that I have to use a cane because it impacts my average daily lifestyle?
 All you know is the symptoms of the problem.
 Now, under this umbrella, we've got Parkinson's disease.
 We've got other diseases.
 I love vascular dementia.
 And I've had this debate with some of the physicians I work with.
 Because back in the day, I swear to God, vascular dementia used to be hardening of the arteries.
 I see a lot of folks shaking their heads like, oh, yeah, I remember that.
 We've got dementia with Lewy bodies, just a whole bunch, frontal temporal lobe dementia.
 We've got a whole bunch of, so you see why it's important to find out what type of dementia that person has.
 Because all of these dementias, and by the way, 60 to 70% of people with dementia will have Alzheimer's.
 But again, I use my uncle, my uncle was a perfect example.
 Because my grandmother had Alzheimer's, when my uncle started showing symptoms, my aunt took him to a doctor,
 In fact, she took him to his primary care physician, who was an eye, ear, nose, throat kind of guy.
 And because of the history in my family, his doctor just simply, okay, well, you have Alzheimer's.
 Well, then he started getting other symptoms, which we remember did not resemble a grandma.
 And so finally, I convinced my cousin to have my, because my aunt wouldn't talk to me about this.
 Because as my cousin said, she still sees you as a 16-year-old boy who thinks he knows everything.
 So they're not going to talk to you.
 So I had them go to another clinic and get retested, and come to find out he had Parkinson's disease.
 Because there are similarities up to a certain point.
 Again, why it's important.
 Now, my doctor of 32 years just simply retired.
 Mike retired three years ago.
 We'd been together 32 years.
 He was a general practitioner.
 I swear I taught him more about Alzheimer's than he learned in medical.
 My physical was every August after the International Alzheimer's Conference, which he would read up on.
 And in the first half hour of my physical was him asking me questions about something he heard or saw at that conference.
 So what I realized was that if before Mike and I started, and in case you're wondering, I picked him out of the big book.
 Remember when you had the big book of doctors?
 I looked for two things, a doctor who practiced near where I lived and whose first name was Mike so I wouldn't forget it.
 That was it.
 But the point, what I learned from Mike and our conversations is if one of his elderly patients had come to him and said, I'm concerned about my memory,
 then Mike would have gone to one of his big books.
 He had those medical journal books.
 He would have pulled up a mini mental exam and he would have done that.
 And he admitted that to me because that's what he knew.
 But what him and I in our constant conversations realized, no, Mike, what you should do is refer them to the hospital that you have admitting duties at to the neurology department so that they can get a memory diagnostic workup.
 Because the difference between Mike doing it
 and a neurological workup at a hospital is the difference between you taking your new car to Jiffy Lube for an oil change or taking it back to the dealer.
 You go to the Jiffy Lube, they're gonna bang it out in 15 minutes and tell you you need new wipers.
 You go back to the dealer, they're hooking that puppy up to the computer and they're running a diagnostic workup to the point where they tell you what your air pressure is in your tires.
 See where I'm going.
 One is way more complete than the other.
 Let's go to the next one.
 So, and here's the other reason why you want to get this tested.
 Because some types of dementia are reversible.
 I'm going to repeat myself.
 Some types of dementia are reversible.
 Years ago, I had major surgery.
 When I came out from the anesthesia, knowing the symptoms that I know, I knew I had dementia.
 I was dizzy.
 I didn't know where I was.
 Forget trying to walk.
 That wasn't happening.
 But as my brain got more oxygen, as the anesthesia wore off, that went away.
 Anybody who is diabetic who's mismanaged their meds knows exactly what I'm talking about.
 You're going to show symptoms of dementia.
 But once you get your meds regulated, it goes away.
 We've got other symptoms, UTIs.
 It is my understanding that a UTI can again give symptoms of dementia.
 See, I've got folks shaking their heads so you know where I'm going with this.
 And by the way,
 For everyone who's taking notes, if you'd like, reach out to Sophie, and we can get you this.
 OK?
 Because I'd much prefer for us to have a conversation.
 I learned a long time ago, you give people stuff to read, they're going to do just that, and they're not going to engage.
 So you see, we have different types of reversible dementias.
 That's why it's important to get tested.
 Sophie, let's go to the next.
 And I'm not going to read all of this, so that's why I'm saying if you want copies of it, I'll get it to you.
 So what is Alzheimer's disease?
 For me, the number one thing to remember is Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible type of disease.
 It just gets worse.
 And today, there's no cure for it.
 And that's why, again, we're talking about research.
 That's why I've got these amazing folks here tonight to also talk with you about participating in research, because we need to take care of this.
 It is a disease of age for most people, but it doesn't necessarily mean the older you get.
 The older you get, yes, there's a greater chance you're going to get it.
 But remember I told you, my grandmother, who passed away at 67 years old, had Alzheimer's disease.
 My grandfather lived to 104, outlived two and a half wives, and that man was as sharp as the day I met him.
 So let's go to the next one.
 So this is those warning signs I was saying you're not going to see, like that F game.
 What's normal, what's not.
 And I'm going to pivot so I can see this.
 Forgetting what you went into the room for.
 Every single one of us.
 I'm watching the college basketball March Madness, and I'm sitting on my couch, and my partner, Bonnie and I, we had gone to Cheesecake Factory, and I had leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator, and she was in bed asleep, and my stomach was literally saying, Mike, go eat the cheesecake.
 You know what I'm talking about.
 And I got up, and I walked into the kitchen.
 And then it was like, oh my god, I dropped the dunk and blah blah, and I turned, and I, ooh.
 What the hell did I come in here for?
 Now, 10 minutes ago, my stomach was literally, whole sentences were coming out.
 What did I come in?
 And in case you're wondering, I do what I know other people do.
 I went back in, I sat down on the couch, and I went, cheesecake.
 I ate it and got in trouble, but damn, it was good.
 Also, all of us who wear glasses, at one time or another have said, anybody know where my glasses are?
 That's normal.
 That's normal.
 Everybody breathe, relax.
 We all, I mean, I used to jokingly say about my ex-wife, who never remembered where she put her car keys, her purse, her jacket.
 I used to say, if I ever get Alzheimer's, you're going to be butt naked and never go nowhere, because I won't remember where your stuff is.
 Forgetting a major event or a gift is not normal.
 I tell this story of this young man I met.
 This is what caused him to get his dad tested.
 They were from Oklahoma.
 When he was little, a tornado destroyed their house.
 It was on the anniversary of that day that he said to his dad, hey dad, you know, should we do something special for this day?
 And his dad said, for what?
 And he goes, well, this is the day of the tornado.
 What tornado?
 All right, see you younger.
 Now, all of the warning signs had been there, but he didn't see them.
 But forgetting that was a red flag that he couldn't ignore.
 Occasionally making the wrong decision.
 Okay, I bought stuff I shouldn't have bought.
 There's a certain website, I'm not gonna give it a name, but I got tons of junk from it.
 That's a bad decision.
 People were living with Alzheimer's.
 Our telemarketers and scammers dream come true.
 That's a disastrous decision, because they get them on the phone, and the next thing you know, they're sending gift cards to God knows where, or they're donating to save whatever tree.
 The point is, that's a bad decision.
 That is a poor decision or judgment making.
 We've got another examples of, okay, not remembering what day it is, or what time it is.
 OK, for the last four years, I know I'm not the only one that has to get up in the morning and look at their phone and know what the hell day it is.
 Come on.
 Ever since the pandemic, every day is like Saturday.
 And if you're retired and you don't have to get up and go to work, you are definitely on a Saturday schedule.
 And then there's a certain time.
 And this is the time of year.
 Think about it.
 It is right now 630.
 Think about it.
 It looks the same right now at 6.30 at night as it does at 6.30 in the morning.
 So you can be confused about day and time.
 That's normal.
 But forgetting what year it is.
 And the older I get, I'm always shocked at how, I just saw something that was from the 1970s and they're like, 40 something years ago.
 I'm like, wow, is it that long ago?
 So my point is, is forgetting times and dates, that's normal.
 Forgetting major, again, the situation with the tornado, that's not normal.
 And losing car keys, psh, okay.
 Not being able,
 to retrace your steps back home.
 We call that getting lost.
 Some people call it getting wandering.
 Believe it or not, statistically, six to seven out of every 10 people with Alzheimer's are going to get lost.
 They're going to forget how to get home.
 I think that number is actually higher.
 I'm thinking it's 100% of people with Alzheimer's, if allowed to travel on their own, are going to get lost.
 And the reason why I say that is because if I get this disease and I come out of stop and shop and I can't remember what my car looks like, or I find my car and I can't remember how to get home, and then two hours later I stumble in because I've figured out how to do it,
 Am I going to tell Bonnie how I got lost and I couldn't remember how to get home?
 No.
 Come on now.
 If you don't know nothing else about me, you should know this.
 What she's going to hear is, oh baby, you know, I went and got the milk and then I ran into Christine and next thing you know, we was talking and before.
 In other words, I'm not going to admit I could not remember how to get home.
 And that's why I think that other 30% fall into that category.
 But what happens is the part of your brain
 which gives you directions, gets impacted.
 And there's nothing scarier, I share this, years ago I was at the Hadshell for the Fourth of July and I saw this woman standing in the middle of thousands of people about to come to tears because she looked lost.
 How many people here have ever been lost?
 Raise your hand.
 Okay, as a child,
 Because if you was lost as an adult, you was not lost.
 You just got turned around.
 When my dad taught us how to drive, he said, if you ever get lost, look for the potential building and just point the car that way.
 Sooner or later, you're going to see a sign that says Boston.
 But this is a true story.
 When I was 10 years old, friends of my family took me to the English high school Boston Latin Thanksgiving Day football game, one of the biggest high school football games in the country.
 Game gets over.
 We're all walking out.
 I'm holding their hand.
 I let go.
 I go this way.
 They go that way.
 2,000 people go between us.
 Next thing you know, I'm standing on the corner.
 And I don't recognize nobody.
 And I know I'm going to die.
 And I am crying.
 And I was raised, you don't talk to strangers.
 So I'm standing there.
 And people are like, little boy, what's wrong?
 And I'm like, mm.
 Just let me stand here and die.
 Just leave me alone.
 And then my uncle was a Boston police officer, and they were doing the details that day.
 And one of the guys sees me.
 And he goes, Mike, what are you doing here?
 And I'm like, oh, I can talk to you.
 Took me home.
 Saved me.
 Hear me now.
 I used to work in Watertown.
 So I used to go down Storrow Drive.
 And every time I drive by that freaking stadium,
 where that spot is, the hairs on the back of my neck, I deliberately avoid it because I still remember that fear that I was going to die.
 That's getting lost.
 I have never felt like that in my car when I didn't know where the hell I was going.
 I just pull over and pull out my GPS.
 There's a difference.
 You see where I'm going.
 All right, let's go to the next one.
 So here's some numbers.
 All right?
 And tonight, I also want to talk about there are different cultures where Alzheimer's impacts at a higher risk.
 Years ago, I gave this talk called The Invisible Population.
 And it's because, as you can see the first number, almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women.
 Now, here's a question.
 Ladies, why is it that almost two-thirds of you
 will get Alzheimer's than men.
 Bam!
 Live longer.
 You live longer than we do.
 And yes, I've asked that before in a room full of predominantly women, and I've heard, because y'all drive us crazy and blah, blah, blah.
 But there are other factors involved in this besides just age, which is again why research participation is important.
 It's funny when, I'm not gonna share that with you.
 Older African Americans are twice as likely to have Alzheimer's and dementia than older whites.
 That's a statistical fact.
 We're also less likely to get tested at an earlier stage.
 Again, a statistical fact.
 Folks will take Nana to the emergency room and they will tell the triage nurse everything that, they'll talk about her gout, they'll talk about her blood sugar, they'll talk about her hypertension, they'll talk about everything except the fact Nana can't remember the name of her granddaughter who's named after her.
 Why?
 Because all those other medical things they can't, they don't know what to do with.
 But memory, again, I told you, my grandmother forgot who I was with Uncle Tony.
 And we just adapted and I just became Uncle Tony because it made her happy.
 So we don't go get tested until the wheels, until we can no longer deny there's something wrong.
 Hispanics are also more likely to get Alzheimer's disease than their white counterparts.
 Now, and this is something that I've been looking into.
 The numbers on Asian Americans, they're really low.
 And I'm hoping maybe we can have a conversation with that.
 One of our presenters, Jin, is gonna be trying to join us virtually.
 But the point is, is if we don't participate in research,
 If we don't go get tested, then those numbers are off.
 And that's why we need to show up.
 Go ahead.
 Okay, I'm going to repeat the question, and I'm going to paraphrase, which is I've said African Americans should participate in research, but historically research hasn't actually benefited us.
 There's a history there.
 And you are absolutely correct.
 That's the elephant in the room.
 But since those studies,
 of, and I'm not talking about just Tuskegee, there's a whole bunch of other studies.
 Since those days, what I like to affectionately refer to as the barbaric era of research, the research industry has put into place methods to make sure that doesn't happen again.
 And that's the easy answer to that question.
 And also on top of that, it would be wrong of me to stand up here and tell you that, well, that never really happened and you gotta understand.
 No, I'm not that guy.
 The reality is is that there is a history.
 And because of that history, the institution of research, and I'm just talking about Alzheimer's.
 I'm not talking about all those other ones.
 I mean, for us to put up a flyer, we have to take it to a board who has to review that flyer to make sure that that flyer does no harm.
 A flyer like you see all the time.
 but working for a hospital.
 And I know that because I kind of got in trouble when I first started working at Mass General.
 I did a flyer, I put it up, and it walked its way back to me.
 And it's like, did you get approval for this?
 I was like, it's just a flyer for a community event.
 But I learned.
 And one of the things that I always like to tell people, if you start out in a research study, and at some point you change your mind,
 Nobody is going to guilt trip you to stay.
 You have every right to say, I'm done.
 It was nice knowing you.
 Goodbye.
 And walk away.
 Walk away.
 And then most likely what's going to happen?
 And I'm going to be honest, because I've seen it.
 Remember those old commercials?
 You tell two friends, and they tell two friends, and they tell two friends, and they tell two friends?
 That's what's going to happen.
 And that's one of the things that the researchers I work with and the research assistants, we talk about this all the time.
 If someone has a bad experience, they're not keeping it to themselves.
 So you have to be conscious of how you interact with people.
 I mean, one of the things, and those of us who are old enough remember this, and this is a really bad analogy, but back in the day, before universal health care, if you went to a certain hospital, the first question I was asked of you in triage was, do you have health insurance?
 Now, I grew up in Roxbury.
 And if the answer was no, they said, well, you need to go to Boston City.
 That's a fact.
 My grandmother, my mother, I've heard those stories over and over, which is why one of the things that we coach people who work with folks is when you ask the question, what type of health insurance do you have, what a lot of folks hear is, do you have health insurance?
 Oh, man, nothing's changed.
 Well, it has changed.
 And so communication is very important.
 Did I do good with the answer?
 Okay, she said she's satisfied.
 All right, so let's keep going.
 Oh, 70% of people with Alzheimer's live at home.
 Live at home.
 I used to run a support group and one of my support group members used to always say, my husband is going to die at home.
 He's not going to a nursing home.
 And she was serious about that.
 And so we found a way to bring her services in.
 And there are programs.
 I noticed this when I was taking a peek at the East Boston table.
 They've got a PACE program.
 It's a wraparound type of program whose main objective is, and my mom is in the Upperms Corner PACE program.
 Shout out to them.
 Their number one objective is to keep you home.
 and provide all those services for you.
 But here's the thing, 70% of those folks who are living at home with Alzheimer's are being cared for by caregivers, family.
 I was gonna say family members, but that's not true, because I've known senior apartment buildings where Miss Mary across the street, I mean across the hall, comes over every day to watch the stories.
 She's a caregiver.
 You know Bob down the hall make sure that that Julie gets breakfast lunch and dinner.
 That's a caregiver.
 There's no relationship there.
 It's just that that's what that's what friends do.
 And that's what keeps people at home longer.
 Let's go.
 So African-Americans I already told you this.
 We tend to get diagnosed at a later stage not just African-Americans other communities of color.
 That's why we call underserved communities because we don't go to get services.
 Go ahead in the back.
 Let's go back to the previous slide.
 Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women.
 Yes, we talked about the fact that women tend to get it because, A, they live longer, but there's some other factors that involve that, which I've got some amazing women doctors here who can address that if it comes up.
 And the other one, older African-Americans are twice as likely to get it than whites.
 There's all kinds of studies out there that have different reasons.
 But here's the thing, because we don't show up to participate in that study, there's no definitive answer on why that is so.
 But, you know, and I'm not going to toss out stereotypes about diet.
 But what I will say this, think about this, anything that impacts the brain, anything, for example, high blood pressure impacts the brain.
 Diabetes impact, you see where I'm going with this, diseases that impact the brain.
 And as African Americans, we're practically number one in every single disease that I can think of.
 So me, I'm thinking that's probably one of the reasons why we're more likely to get this disease than our counterparts.
 Is that good?
 All right, all right, all right.
 This is a scary number.
 By 2023, if left undressed, undressed, unaddressed, nearly half of all Americans living with Alzheimer's will be African American or Latino.
 Now, you should know that I put these slides together, the first time I did this was years ago.
 And I remember thinking, wow, 2030.
 That's six years away.
 Six years away.
 So I'm going to just plant that seed right there.
 Again, remember, I started this out by, I'm not saying that this is our problem, but I'm saying we need to get in this game.
 Let's go to the next one.
 So getting a memory test, and it's so funny.
 Sophie and I were talking about this.
 And she's like, I said, let's take that slide out.
 She goes, no.
 All right, here's the deal.
 You can't go to Walgreens, CVS, or wherever and buy a memory test over the counter, OK?
 Remember I used that example of Jiffy Lube in a dealership?
 You need to get a neurological workup.
 Let's go to the next one.
 But I did like that slide.
 So again, talking to your doctor.
 Your primary care may refer you to a specialist.
 The key word in there is may.
 Unless you're one of the few people I've ever met that's got a neurologist as a primary care physician, you want a referral.
 Don't hope for one.
 Don't think you might get one.
 Ask for one.
 The Alzheimer's Association has a pamphlet, you can go to their website, on how to ask for a neurological referral.
 You know, remember my guy Mike?
 If you did, before we started having those conversations about Alzheimer's, if you just simply said you had a problem with your memory, God knows what he, you know, well, you know, change your diet or something like that.
 And in that conversation with the neurologist, things that are going to come up are physical exam, neurological exam, cognitive tests with paper and pen.
 We've all seen an example of that.
 If you've watched the news, a certain ex-president, I'm not going to name any names, was bragging about how he could, how most people don't, can't pass that test about being able to remember elephant, TV, apple, whatever, you know.
 There's more to it than just that.
 And remember again, we started earlier talking about under the umbrella of dementia, all of those diseases.
 That's why it's important to have a neurological workup, because you want to make sure you got the right disease.
 You don't want to waste time going around the wrong track.
 Go ahead.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=1814.497s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 非常感谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=1836.536s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 所以问题是，你如何鼓励人们为自己和家人辩护？
 这很有趣，因为托尼·法姆博士在这里，但我不会给他打电话，因为那会让他难堪。
 我要把一件事做得更好。
 克里斯汀，您如何回答人们如何为自己辩护的问题？
 如果你愿意的话，我可以拿起麦克风，或者你也可以上来。
 这是一个预览，因为这是 Christine Ritchie 博士，她稍后将发表讲话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=1863.342s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 谢谢你的提问，好吧，靠近一点。
 所以这非常重要，也很难，因为我们很多人都认为，哦，这是一个权威人物，或者是我需要尊重的人，但这是你的身体。
 你最了解你的身体，认识你的人也最了解你的身体，所以如果你觉得情况并非如此，就像那个人没有在听你说话，或者他们实际上没有注意，那么请站起来为了你自己。
 请说，我想要第二意见，或者您可以将我转介给专家，或者您可以回答这些问题吗？
 不要默默承受。
 我认为很多人都在默默承受痛苦。
 然后他们回家后就会说，呃。
 因此，当这种感觉开始出现时，开始问这样的问题：我对此感到担心。
 你能帮我理解这一点吗？
 如果您没有得到满意的答案，那么可以说，我真的可以有第二意见吗？
 你能把我介绍给其他人吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=1930.267s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 好的。
 谢谢。
 快点。
 别害怕。
 我的意思是，来吧。
 我知道我不是唯一一个看到人们因为麦当劳的炸薯条冷了而失去理智的人，但当我走出医生办公室时，我不知道刚刚发生了什么。
 快点。
 积极一点。
 你是你的家人，你所爱的人，第一。
 我正在重复她所说的话。
 你是他们的第一积极分子。
 如果你不这样做，没有人会为他们做这件事。
 好吧，我们进入下一篇。
 前进。
 我会引导你回去。
 所以问题是，如果病人否认，或者医生说，不，你很好。
 别担心。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=1987.162s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 是的，所以无论如何，对吧？
 因此，要么医生没有承认这个问题，要么你是护理伙伴，而真正患有痴呆症的人却否认这一点。
 不幸的是，对于痴呆症，人们无法深入了解自己的疾病的情况并不少见。
 所以他们可能认为自己很好。
 这很棘手，对吧？
 这就是为什么一开始就值得与那个人保持良好的关系，让他们允许你成为他们的发言人，让他们签署 HIPAA 弃权书，并说，是的，我可以和你谈谈。
 这样你就可以和医生交谈并说，让我告诉你我所观察到的情况。
 这非常重要。
 你知道，大多数临床医生都非常感激。
 获得不同的观点，因为他们知道很多患有痴呆症的人实际上并没有意识到，或者他们没有洞察到底发生了什么，或者他们非常害怕，他们害怕会发生什么。
 但无论哪种方式，这就是关系和建立信任的地方，让他们有机会让你成为他们的发言人，他们为此签署了一份弃权书，
 然后那个医生就可以和你谈谈。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2070.92s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 是的。
 还有一些我想背负的东西。
 寻求帮助。
 和我妈妈在一起，你知道，我是个坏人。
 我的哥哥是个好人。
 我们已经把好警察和坏警察的事情归结为，你知道，妈妈，你知道，你必须这样做。
 如果你不这样做，我们就不得不这样做。
 然而他转身就走，现在，妈妈，你真的知道你不想让迈克做废话、废话、废话。
 我简直不敢相信，但它确实有效。
 它让生活变得更加轻松。
 从后面往前走。
 所以问题是，是否有一个平均年龄开始寻找这些警告信号？
 这是一个由两部分组成的问题。
 第一部分是，60 多岁开始出现症状的情况并不罕见。
 但请记住我说的话。
 你不会注意到这一点。
 好的？
 现在，只有很小一部分人患有我们所说的早发性阿尔茨海默氏症。
 这些人在更年轻的时候就得到了它。
 我的意思是，我看过针对 40 多岁、40 岁出头的人的研究。
 现在，让我这么说。
 现在在座的每个人都想知道，这会是他们吗？
 你不会想知道，你已经知道了。
 因为对于这样的事情，首先，它往往在家庭中表现得更加激进。
 我的意思是，几年前我曾在阿尔茨海默氏症协会工作，我遇到了照顾孩子的母亲。
 他们是成年人、儿子和女儿。
 所以我的观点是，你不会坐在这个房间里想知道你是否属于这一类别。
 你已经知道了。
 这就是所谓的早发性阿尔茨海默病。
 这又是接受测试很重要的另一个原因。
 我在后面一直有一个问题。
 你举起了手。
 我们回答了吗？
 好吧，克里斯汀，你不必来参加这个。
 我明白了。
 我明白了。
 所以问题是，您和您的医生是否不同意。
 您正在寻找另一种类型的护理，而您的医生似乎对此轻描淡写。
 那是你去寻求第二意见的时候。
 您只需去寻求第二意见即可。
 没有人的感情受到伤害。
 这就是我希望人们能够理解的事情。
 因为你不同意你的初级保健医生的意见而去看另一位医生，但他们的生活还要继续。
 没有人的感情会受到伤害。
 他们不会明天解雇你或取消你的病人资格。
 您只是想要一个推荐。
 就这样。
 它发生了。
 我们走吧。
 那么，考试结束后，你该做什么呢？
 你已经让你所爱的人接受了测试。
 你已经得到结果了。
 它是阿尔茨海默氏症，它是轻度认知障碍，它是路易体，它是其中之一，你现在确切地知道出了什么问题。
 接下来你做什么？
 作为护理人员，您可以了解有关该疾病的一切信息。
 你必须成为该疾病的专家。
 主要也是这样，当您坐下来时，正如 Christine 所说，您想要找到 HIPAA 表格，您想要成为医疗保健代理人，您想要获得监护权。
 阿尔茨海默病是一种疾病，不在于是否发生，而在于何时发生。
 当那个人将达到他们无法再做某些事情的地步时。
 所以你想领先一步。
 我总是告诉人们，在监护权的情况下，如果你在早期阶段就介入，那只是简单地签署一些文件，然后去见法官，繁荣，你就完成了，这并不需要这么长。
 而且它实际上不需要任何成本。
 如果你或家人等待，我总是告诉家人，每个人都需要坐下来并达成共识。
 因为我见过有人上法庭为菜品打架。
 嗯，妈妈说我要去拿那些菜。
 这不是我编造的。
 结果是他们去找律师。
 那些律师就上法庭了。
 他们的律师的工作就是让对方看起来如果你让娜娜和他们住在一起，她一天之内就会死。
 法官不认识这个人，他听取了双方的论点。
 法官任命另一名律师作为临时监护人的情况并不罕见，而这名律师甚至从未见过娜娜。
 想想吧。
 你刚才听到的那个论点，好吧，现在法官不能让娜娜单独回家，也不能让娜娜和这两个人中的任何一个回家，所以监护人必须把娜娜送进机构。
 你知道我要说什么了。
 因此，尽快采取行动非常重要。
 学习一切你能学到的东西。
 处理好所有这些法律问题，这样剩下的时间你就可以做看护人的事情了。
 而你，知道的越多，就越不会感到惊讶。
 好的，顺便说一句，您可以通过联系当地的老年服务机构或梅德福镇、索菲以及这里的团队来获取此信息。
 有一个非常好的团队。
 我有机会与他们中的一些人交谈。
 所以这里有适合您的服务。
 好的，这里有两件事。
 她问的问题是，是否有类型的测试可以准确地确定一个人的病情？
 就尸检而言，每当你看到纪录片或任何有关阿尔茨海默氏症的内容时，你总是会听到有关斑块和缠结的内容，这通常是在死者去世并将大脑捐献给科学之后进行的，他们确实这样做了尸检 他们正在寻找某些东西
 最近发表的一项研究表明，可能有些人可能有这些东西，这些斑块和缠结，但从未患上阿尔茨海默病。
 但我只是把它放在那里。
 至于第一个，如果你还记得我们谈到接受测试时，他们会经历一系列测试。
 这不是15分钟的事情。
 我听说有些人回去了，花了两天时间，因为第一天累了，他们不得不回来继续测试。
 因为整个目的是消除我们看到的所有不同类型的疾病。
 前进。
 那挺好的。
 淀粉样蛋白，对。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2573.584s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 这是错误的。
 当你坐在那里看着某样东西时，你知道它的名字是什么，但你不知道如何处理它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2582.529s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 或者你不知道这个名字是什么，但你认为你可能知道，这是一个问题。
 换句话说，我要说的是，因为你提到了你的名字朱莉，朱莉分享的是，让她去接受检查并告诉她的医生出了问题的是，她不能再否认有些事情没有错。
 等一下，朱莉娅。
 我要让你出名。
 凯文，不要因此而恨我。
 我们正在经历菲尔·多纳休的倒叙。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2610.05s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 好的。
 我的姨妈，我母亲的姐姐有它。
 好吧，没关系。
 现在和我的家人在一起，无论家庭的哪一方有什么，
 另一边有它。
 现在，我父亲被诊断出患有此病。
 他的侄女被诊断出患有此病。
 另一个侄子也被诊断出患有此病。
 我说，我要去看医生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2636.56s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 所以朱莉，你的意思是，就像我对我祖母说的那样，你已经看到了。
 你知道要寻找什么。
 如果被告知，哦，别担心，好吧，你知道，是的，不，我需要再找一位医生。
 感谢您分享这一点。
 那么我们走吧。
 哦，继续吧。
 哦。
 你知道吗？
 你是第一个问我这个问题的人。
 克里斯汀，这是个好问题。
 有一定年龄吗？
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2682.983s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 那么问题来了，是否有一定年龄才应该接受检查呢？
 答案是否定的。
 实际上有一个国家组织就什么对筛查有意义、什么没有意义提出建议。
 所以最重要的答案是否定的，但这是一个但是。
 因为但是，如果你有风险因素，就像你所描述的那样，你有家族史，或者你可能有糖尿病和高血压病史，正如迈克所说，并且你还有其他事情可能会让你如果风险增加，是​​的，进行筛查是适当的。
 事实上，正如迈克所说，我们越来越多地鼓励人们，特别是现在，当你实际上处于痴呆症的早期而不是晚期时，我们开始提供效果更好的治疗方法，
 那么你真的必须尽早接受筛查和测试。
 因此，我们越来越多地思考如何确保实际上处于较高风险的人确实得到了筛查。
 因此，您将开始看到一些变化，甚至在未来一两年内，人们认识到，特别是随着这些新疗法的出现，我们需要为人们提供早期接受测试的机会。
 可能是这样，但我认为，因为我们进行了越来越多的均匀血液检查，而且您也听说过 PET 扫描，所以当情况看起来不对劲时，实际上比过去更容易对人进行评估。
 甚至，莉莉安娜，去年，甚至我们对痴呆症类别和阶段的思考方式也发生了变化，因为我们有了更多信息
 从血液测试、从脊髓液、从大脑中提取，以帮助提供对事物的区分。
 是的，是的，所以问题是，如果您的保险使您很难获得您认为可能合适的测试，该怎么办？
 所以这是一个真实的事情，实际上是博士。拉米雷斯·戈麦斯（Ramirez Gomez）可以谈论这一点，因为她实际上现在正在浏览其中的一些内容，但总的来说，如果您有的话
 风险因素，然后你筛查呈阳性，也就是说，你的记忆测试中的一些事情，也许还有其他一些事情表明你实际上患有痴呆症的风险非常高，我们特别担心区分不同类型的痴呆症或考虑进行治疗，此时保险公司更有可能支付费用。
 话虽如此，有些保险公司的免赔额仍然很高，对吧？
 因此，他们可能会支付数千美元，但不会支付全部费用。
 因此，值得在前端提出这些问题，并确保您可以完成它，而无需拿出账单然后说，等等，这是什么？
 拉米雷斯-戈麦斯博士，您还有什么要补充的吗？
 好的。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2885.366s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 正确的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2890.433s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 正确的。
 正确的。
 所以你听到迈克谈到了轻度认知障碍，这就是人们在真正难以完成工作之前就开始出现思维问题的地方，这并不一定会干扰他们的能力支付他们的账单或类似的事情。
 这是一个时间窗口，当人们处于痴呆症早期时，他们最适合实际接受过去一年左右刚刚推出的一些新疗法。
 我一直谈论拉米雷斯-戈麦斯医生的原因是因为她实际上在麻省总医院经营着我们的治疗中心，该中心实际上提供此类治疗，这就是为什么我想让她参与其中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=2943.607s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 你好，晚上好，谢谢你来到这里。
 正如你所听到的，我是一名神经科医生。
 我是一名医生，在我的诊所和医院、马萨诸塞州总医院照顾病人，他们对他们的记忆力感到担忧，或者为什么我会忘记这些事情，或者难以识别某些事情。
 这就是我们的工作。
 所以，实际上，我们有机会倾听、关注并做迈克所说的工作。
 你知道，你去这个地方，你会听到所有的担忧，我们实际上记录了非常好的历史记录和详细的评估。
 我们寻找所有这些危险信号，而且确实如此。
 我很高兴你提到了 PET 扫描，里奇医生提到了血液检查和不久的将来可能出现的事情，因为我们真的很关注这一点，因为现在我们有可用的治疗方法，当我们尽早使用它们。
 确实，我们有足够的能力进行检测，而且作为医生，我多次听说过倡导。
 你，作为一个病人，说，我需要这个测试，或者我有这个担忧。
 我们医生也提倡这一点，当我们相信某些事情必须发生时，我们就会这么做。
 很多时候，我们甚至必须与保险公司交谈或发送信件或上诉并代表您发言，因为我们确实认为这是必要的，并且这将改变某人的生活，因为我们提供了具体的诊断。
 有人问我们是否能确定它是什么类型的痴呆症，是的。
 是的，我们可以达到这种程度的细节。
 还有你的问题，当你说为什么我们参与很重要，如果以前存在所有这些困难并且它对我们没有好处，为什么现在很重要？
 正因为如此，因为我们希望治疗能够使每个人受益。
 我们希望确保迈克分享的数字存在差异，
 这些数字很重要，因为我们需要了解其中的差异，例如，治疗将如何以不同的方式影响我们每个人。
 所以我们确实有诊所来评估有色人种。
 例如，我们评估说不同语言的人。
 我们希望真正让所有人都参与进来。
 这就是迈克在 F 游戏开始时使用的词。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=3107.977s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 拉米雷斯-戈麦斯博士谈到了真正寻求关注的重要性，以及另一种有趣的后门方法来获得您可能想要的有趣的帮助，那就是自愿参与一项研究。
 我们对参与这些与痴呆症相关的研究的了解是，第一，许多人实际上正在帮助我们找到一些新药物的答案。
 但无论如何，你都会得到一个非常全面的评估。
 非常全面的评价。
 所以你在这个过程中学到了很多东西。
 另一个好处是你可以认识人。
 他们认识你，你也认识他们，那里有一种关系，如果出现问题，你更有可能有人为你辩护，即使是作为研究团队的一员。
 所以，这是一件值得思考的有趣的事情，我们实际上从大型研究中知道这一点，当你有人真正参与研究并将他们与那些与他们相似或不参与研究的人进行比较时，
 参与研究的人做得更好。
 我们想，为什么会这样？
 这可能是因为其他事情。
 他们正在获得更全面的评估。
 有人正在寻找他们。
 他们已经形成了一种关系和联系感。
 所以这是另一种有趣的后门方法来获得支持。
 我们有许多可用的研究。
 您听到 Mike 说过我们有 42 项研究。
 他们的目的并不相同，但我们对思维或记忆没有问题的人进行了研究。
 我们有些人有所谓的主观抱怨。
 当他们接受测试时，看起来没问题，但他们知道有些事情不对劲。
 然后，我们对患有轻度认知障碍和痴呆症的人进行实际研究。
 如果您对此感兴趣，我们希望为您提供支持，因此请与我们联系。
 拉米雷斯-戈麦斯博士，您还有什么要补充的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=3235.362s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 是的，谢谢。
 好吧，现在我们正在谈论这个以及为什么要进行研究、参与并与医学界相处融洽，这是因为我们关心。
 就像真的一样，新一代以及我们如何聚集在一起以及事物如何变化，所有这些都是真实的。
 我还想分享的是，当我们互相关心时，正如迈克提到的，我们关心我们的邻居，关心我们的家庭成员。
 我们有这样的说法：“照顾者”、“照顾伙伴”。
 我们还想邀请一些关心朋友、家人的人。
 我们还希望提供一些研究资源。
 对于护理人员、护理伙伴来说，这也是一个邀请，让我们知道阿尔茨海默病和痴呆症以及相关的痴呆症并不是一种只影响记忆丧失或症状的人的疾病。
 它影响到整个家庭、社区、邻居、他们的朋友。
 因此，我们将每个人都包括在内，因为我们希望确保所有人以及所有为此苦苦挣扎的人的福祉得到照顾。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=3315.518s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 所以我要用我的温暖和模糊来结束我的部分，因为你刚刚预览了第二部分，因为所以我说我要用温暖和模糊来结束它，我们开始吧，我会给你一个情感记忆和历史记忆之间差异的例子
 我要给你讲一个故事。
 这是一个真实的故事。
 这是 1970 年左右的事。
 我和我当时的挚爱坐在罗克维尔公园 15 号，她身上喷着 Gina Tay 香水。
 我们正在您的 AM 拨号盘上收听 WIOD 1090。
 唱片骑师是桑尼·乔·怀特。
 一首名为《献给我爱的人》的歌曲响起，我们第一次接吻。
 我刚才告诉你的一切都是历史的。
 一切。
 如果我得了阿尔茨海默氏症，到了我生命中的那个阶段，我就会忘记我刚才告诉你的一切。
 但如果是在一个温暖的夏日，我坐在外面，上帝保佑我，如果一个女人穿着吉娜泰香水走过，一首献给我爱的人的歌响起，我16岁，疯狂地爱着，就坐在那里，
 因为我想让你明白的是，这种疾病从我们大脑中偷走的东西永远不会触及我们的心脏。
 因为爱会永远记得。
 现在，我告诉过你我将以我的温暖和模糊来结束它。
 但我要把它交给克里斯汀。
 我们已经帮你排好队了</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=3412.352s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  Dr. Ramirez Gomez already got us started by talking about care partners and caregivers.
 And as she said, and I think she said it so beautifully, when someone is experiencing dementia, it doesn't just affect them, right?
 It affects those who are with them.
 It affects those who care for them.
 And it's its own journey for that person who's that caregiver.
 So I want to just spend a few minutes talking about caring for the caregiver.
 and how there might be things that we can do to support people who are caring for that person living with dementia.
 So if we go to the next, do you want me to do it?
 So in this country,
 By and large, it's often family or people who are like family who are caring for us if we're living with dementia.
 Just a few things about me.
 My specialty is in geriatrics and palliative care.
 And I had the honor of caring for my father in my home when he had Lewy body dementia.
 And so I thought I knew a lot as, you know, going through all the training about caring for people who live with dementia, but when I became a caregiver, it was a whole new education for what it was like to be in that space with somebody.
 And in the United States, about 11 million people are providing that care.
 And it's not paid care.
 And it actually adds up to a lot of money, probably $325 billion worth of caregiving that we're doing for our families if we actually got paid to do it.
 And about 40% of caregivers are men.
 I think sometimes men get short shrift on this.
 I just want to say there are a lot of men out there who are doing a great job with being a caregiver.
 And then in this country, about a third of caregivers are over the age of 65, and about half are caring for a parent.
 So it does affect all of us.
 We could be that partner.
 that life partner.
 We could be the daughter.
 We could be the daughter-in-law, the son, son-in-law, niece, nephew.
 So it can affect all of us.
 So if we go to the next slide.
 What is important to keep in mind if you're a caregiver is that it is crazy important to take care of you because the physical and health consequences of caregiving are not nothing.
 And when we look at studies and research about caregiving, what we find is that if you are a caregiver,
 you're more likely to be depressed, you're more likely to have sleep issues, you're more likely to be hospitalized, you actually have a higher mortality rate than you would be if you weren't a caregiver, and you're less likely to get help.
 You know, I got to take care of my person here.
 I can't take care of me.
 How am I going to do that, right?
 So we don't fill our own medicines.
 We don't actually take care of ourselves.
 That puts us at risk.
 And you know, I'm sure you've heard this before, but when you're on a plane, they say, please put the air mask on yourself first before putting it on the person next to you.
 And we need to think about that, but we often don't.
 That when you're caring, if you're a caregiver,
 When you're caring for yourself, you are caring for that other person.
 And it's actually really important that you're doing that.
 And sometimes it takes actually some intentionality and some work to actually figure out how the heck I'm going to take care of myself.
 So if we go to the next slide.
 Unfortunately, in this country, there are a lot of care gaps for caregivers when it comes to dementia care.
 So as a caregiver, you're much more likely to experience a lot of challenges.
 And I want to go over some of them with you and then also talk about how we can address those gaps, OK?
 So if we go to the next slide, we often find that what people don't get told when they go to the, so a lot of times people go to the doctor.
 If they're fortunate, they'll actually have someone tell them what's going on.
 And they'll give them some idea about what the future is going to look like, right?
 But a lot of people, as Mike was saying, they're not told what this is going to look like.
 What is this going to look like two years from now?
 What do I need to be prepared for?
 Actually, living with dementia right now is a terminal illness.
 So unless, until we get a cure,
 We're looking at a journey that can sometimes be quite a long journey that's going to be associated with a number of losses along the way.
 And how do we prepare for that?
 A lot of times we don't get that information knowing that, you know, what this is going to look like and, again, by what kind of dementia.
 Different dementias actually look different in terms of what their journey looks like.
 So knowing what kind of dementia is actually is helpful for sort of thinking about what the future is going to look like.
 And then also knowing
 that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty.
 Because the way dementia works is it's a lot of ups and downs.
 Like if you get a urinary tract infection or you fall or something, then you're going to have a bad spell.
 And then you might recover some.
 And then you might have another bad spell.
 So even though it's a long, slow journey of decline, a lot of times there's actually fits and starts.
 And that uncertainty can be very hard for caregivers.
 And also, when you're the caregiver, you're not even noticing what's happening.
 You might not even know, actually, that you're getting close to the end because you are just doing it, right?
 So actually, when I was caring for my father, he was getting very sick near the end.
 And a friend of mine said, don't you think you're, now remember, I take care of people who are at the end of life.
 So this is funny.
 And she said, don't you think your dad is ready for hospice?
 And I was like, huh.
 I hadn't thought of that.
 And in fact, he was.
 And he benefited from hospice.
 But the thing about it is I was so close to it, I couldn't see it.
 And that's the other thing.
 We need other people to come alongside us that can give us guidance and come along the path with us.
 The second thing is getting information about how to deal with many common behaviors that occur when people are living with dementia.
 Different people have different kinds of behaviors, but things that are fairly common are something we call apathy, which is just not being as interested in the things that we've been interested in before.
 We can get more anxious if we don't actually know what's going on around us.
 That can make us feel anxious.
 we may start seeing things that other people are not seeing.
 And in Lewy body dementia in particular, it's not uncommon for people to actually see like little people and other things that are not there.
 It might not even bother the person living with dementia, but it can be quite bothersome to the caregiver because it's, it's scary.
 Or they might start getting paranoid or start having delusions like,
 you know, I'm pretty sure you stole my wallet, because I can't find it, right?
 And of course they can't find it because they don't know where it is, but they will think that somebody stole it, right?
 So delusions can also be a common behavior, and knowing what these, and then being resistant, like I'm not gonna get in the bathtub anymore, I'm not gonna take a shower, these kind of things, knowing how to navigate them, we often don't guide people.
 Happily, there are ways to navigate these kind of behaviors, but it's useful to know kind of what the tips are, what the clues are, and a lot of times we don't provide that adequately to caregivers.
 Safety, you know, you heard from Mike, it's pretty much the norm that people will get lost when they start developing dementia.
 And so having a game plan, you know, do I have a way to make sure that my loved one doesn't elope from the house?
 I remember when my father eloped from the house, scared the heck out of me.
 And we got locks that were down low so he couldn't notice them, so that he would be safe from eloping from the house.
 There are little tips, things that you can do, wearing a life alert, you know, having
 Actually, I tell everybody, get somebody on your phone that actually knows where you are on your phone, you know, on Apple.
 It's called Find My Friend.
 But I think the more people actually help, we can help each other if we know, oh, why isn't, you know,
 my uncle home yet, I look and find my friends and he's like nowhere where he should be, then I can go check on him, right?
 So actually there are more and more technological tools that we can use to help people from a safety perspective.
 But safety becomes a big thing.
 People can forget and leave their stove on, right?
 They can leave stuff in the oven.
 lots of safety issues that can bubble up that are sometimes a little subtle and then the biggest one and most neurologists will tell us that this is actually the biggest challenge in talking with people is driving.
 No one likes to be told it's not a good time for you to drive anymore.
 No one.
 That was one of the hardest things for me was taking away my father's keys.
 and he was not happy, not happy.
 So driving, but that becomes an issue, becomes a liability issue, right?
 If it becomes unsafe for us, for someone with dementia to drive, and then they get into an accident, then we could potentially be held at fault if we knew they had dementia, right?
 So it's important to have these conversations up front, and to try to think about having them in as gentle, kind,
 and supportive ways possible, and then having alternative strategies.
 You know, fortunately now we have, you know, ways that people can get around that's not just dependent on having my own car.
 I don't have a car.
 I'm happy for the bus system and the T here, but, you know, there are ways for us to get around even when we have cognitive impairment and trying to give people a sense of
 of solace around the fact that they are not being taken, their independence is being taken away.
 And then you heard from Mike, so I'm not going to talk about this that much, which is about planning for the future.
 So when we think about planning for the future, it's a lot of stuff, right?
 It's like, is this house going to work anymore?
 Like maybe there are a bunch of steps, and that's going to become a problem.
 Maybe this house is not going to work anymore.
 Maybe I need to look for a place where it's all one story, and the person doesn't have to go up steps.
 Or is it going to work actually from my own well-being for this person to live with me all the way to the end of their life?
 I may not be able to care for them.
 I may need to be able to bring caregivers in, or I may need to think about some other living opportunity for them.
 These are things that are worth planning for.
 Mike already talked about a power of attorney, crazy important, making sure that someone is actually a power of attorney for our legal affairs, our financial affairs, and our health care affairs.
 And many, many people don't think about that, but it's actually all of us would benefit from it.
 I was just thinking, I was on a call recently with my daughter.
 I said to my daughter, have you decided on a health care proxy and do you have an advanced directive?
 She's 30.
 But the thing is, she needs to decide.
 Who's going to be that decision maker?
 She gets run over by a bus tomorrow, right?
 So all of us need that.
 But it becomes really important as we develop dementia that we have someone we trust
 who we are actually allocating those services to.
 And if you haven't looked this up, I would really encourage you to look at the website called prepare for your care, all one word, prepareforyourcare.org.
 They actually have a special, so they have advanced directives so you can actually say like I want this person to be my decision maker if I get hit by a bus or something like that.
 But then they also have things like,
 How much do you want this person to make decisions for you?
 What are the sort of things you don't want them to make decisions for you about?
 And then there's a whole section for people who are living with dementia and who are care partners for living with dementia.
 The other cool thing about it is it doesn't matter what state of the country you're in, you can click on it and any state will pop up.
 So when I moved to Massachusetts, I printed out the Massachusetts Advance Directive, filled it out, got with my kids, said, here's what's up.
 And you can do that with that if you have, again, somebody who you know, or you're living with dementia, that you make sure that someone you trust is going to be that decision maker for you.
 All right.
 So planning for the future.
 Remember I was talking about planning.
 This is really what I was getting at.
 And a colleague of mine calls it the six Ds.
 I think they had to work a little hard at it, because who calls housing domicile?
 But anyway.
 But domicile means housing.
 So is where I am right now going to work for me over the long haul?
 It's worth asking this question because it gets crazy hard to do it when it's a crisis.
 So it's much better to think about doing it when it's not.
 We talked about driving.
 We talked about decision making.
 A couple other things to think about is what about my financial situation?
 How am I going to navigate this future?
 How can I actually get help?
 Go to people I trust, you know, a lot of our senior centers and this Medford Community Center have resources to help us think through like how to get support.
 And we're lucky in Massachusetts we have a lot more support than some other places.
 And then what about drugs?
 You know, I don't know about you, but I often see people who I would say they collect medications over the years.
 Right?
 So somebody gives them some medicine.
 They got that one.
 And someone else gives them another medicine.
 They got one.
 And they're like, next thing you know, they're like 10 to 12 medicines.
 And the question is, do I still need all of these?
 And often the answer is no.
 So that's another thing to advocate for with your doctor is say, do I still need all these medicines?
 Because I know each one of these drugs are interacting with each other.
 And I might feel a heck of a lot, and I've seen many people, they feel so much better when they got off those medicines that they didn't need anyway, and actually are no longer having to interact with other medicines or with their food.
 So think about your drugs, and think about how to make sure that you're only on the ones that you need to be on and not on a whole bunch that we tend to collect over time.
 And then finally,
 This is an illness that will ultimately lead to the end of our life and to our death.
 So how do we plan for that?
 How do we actually plan for that now so that it is a peaceful journey as possible?
 How do we make sure that what we want is, again, what we get?
 That really requires talking to other people.
 So a lot of times, we don't like to go there when we, you know, well, I'll go there, talk about dying, you know.
 But actually, it's good to go there, to actually think about how I can make sure that I'm getting what I want.
 near when I get when the end is near because if I don't talk to people about it they're going to guess and that's not going to feel good to them and it likely is they're going to not necessarily guess right so that's also worth thinking about so if we move on
 These are the common symptoms that I was talking about before that we commonly see.
 And there's a lot of different strategies to actually address these symptoms and the stress associated with them.
 You're going to hear about two studies in just a minute that are studies that are trying to help us figure out the best way to support these kind of messages.
 And then if you go to the next slide.
 This is really what I talk about when I'm talking to caregivers and care partners.
 And actually, Mike, you said it so beautifully.
 And that is that oftentimes, when someone is developing dementia, they're not going to remember stuff the way it was you remember it.
 And they actually may even be in a different reality.
 But they often will say things.
 And rather than correcting them and making them feel judged, we can just go along.
 And we can just love them.
 And remember that it's the tone of our words more than the content of our words.
 My mother-in-law also had dementia.
 And when we'd go visit her, basically, she could not figure out who any of us were.
 But what was important to her was, were we friend or foe?
 And she could tell if we were friend or foe, depending on our behavior and how we sort of behaved with her.
 And so really paying attention to being unthreatening, non-threatening, gentle, and being much more
 just going along with whatever their reality is as opposed to what, like, no mom, it wasn't that, you know, that won't help.
 And so really paying attention to that I think is really important.
 So if we move on.
 This is probably the most important thing I'd just like to suggest to you.
 And it's so awesome that everybody is here in community together.
 Please don't go it alone.
 It's very easy, and we're seeing this in research studies that we're doing right now, that people who are caregivers of people living with dementia can become so isolated.
 Because what happens is sometimes the neighbors or the friends, they actually don't know how to navigate
 someone who's living with dementia.
 And so because of their own discomfort about that, they start backing away.
 And that backing away doesn't just affect that person with dementia, it affects the care partner with dementia.
 And that care partner can become isolated.
 So do not go it alone.
 Helen Keller said, alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.
 I deeply believe that.
 Next.
 These are some helpful resources.
 I'm going to just show you a couple slides of helpful resources.
 This book on the left is written by a colleague of ours, and it's specifically helpful if you're a child of somebody living with dementia.
 It's sort of written for an adult child of someone with dementia.
 It's good for anybody, but it's particularly helpful that way.
 Then if you look over here at the top, the Alzheimer's Association has a bunch of great stuff.
 The National Caregiver Alliance and the Dementia Care Collaborative are all places where you can go to get additional support.
 If you go to the next slide,
 You heard Mike talk about MAGIC, what we call MAGIC, which is the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.
 We have a bunch of things which we call our Roadmap Series, which provides a ton of jam-packed information about a number of different sort of topics that are relevant to dementia.
 And this one is called the Roadmap to Caregiving.
 It has a bunch of stuff.
 You can either look at it online or you can just print it out, download it.
 It's there for the taking.
 And then if you go next,
 These are two research studies that we have ongoing right now that we would love for you to become involved in.
 One is called the Social Study, and Sahana is going to tell you about that in a minute.
 And the other is a study to assess an app that helps with mindfulness-guided imagery and support techniques to improve mood for dementia caregivers.
 And I don't know, Dr. Ramirez-Gomez, are you game for talking about that one?
 Awesome.
 OK.
 Sahana come on up.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=4649.106s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 大家好。
 我的名字是萨哈娜。
 我是一名临床研究协调员。
 我和克里斯汀一起工作，我将谈论一些关于社会研究的事情。
 我会保持简短，因为已经有点晚了。
 因此，社会研究代表支持我们的护理人员进行 ADR D 学习。
 ADRD 是阿尔茨海默病和相关痴呆症。
 因此，我们确实在寻找痴呆症患者的无偿护理人员，并希望了解为期六周的计划如何能够为他们提供支持，减轻他们的压力，并改善他们的整体福祉。
 只有六周，每节课60分钟。
 它是完全虚拟的，因此您可以从任何地方（手机、平板电脑等）进行操作。
 是的。
 因此，如果您有兴趣，请在这之后随时与我交谈。
 我们在蓝色桌子的左侧也有传单。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=4710.18s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 我知道你们已经坐了很长时间了，所以我的发言会很简短，但我想再次强调并向你们所有人发出邀请，因为你们每个人都很重要，就像你们的朋友、你们的邻居、你们的朋友一样。社区。
 您对我们很重要，我们希望每个人都参与其中。
 我已经说过了，而且我会一直这样说。
 例如，我与我的拉丁裔社区合作很多。
 你们所有人都是我们的社区，所以我们想邀请您参与。
 基本上，你有很多信息、传单和机会。
 但我想让你知道，不仅你很重要，而且我们也想提供帮助，因为这是研究的目标。
 我们不仅仅是为了收集信息而收集信息。
 我们想要有所作为。
 当然，我们将通过更好地了解这些不同社区正在发生的事情来实现这一目标。
 我们与今天听到的所有这些数字有何不同？
 为什么风险更高？
 这里发生了什么事？
 那么我们怎样才能降低这种风险并使我们每个人的生活变得更好呢？
 当然，我与护理人员、患者、健康者以及每个人一起工作。
 因此，我邀请您考虑加入我们的这一努力，因为我们希望这一旅程中的每个人都受益。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=4804.187s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 好吧，我们实际上有一些有趣的东西。
 我们有一位研究人员，我们将尝试以虚拟方式进行这项工作。
 该短语中的关键词是尝试。
 塞思·盖尔博士将谈论我们的一项研究。
 这就是所谓的 AHEAD 研究。
 AHEAD 研究的一个很酷的事情是他们正在寻找没有患有阿尔茨海默氏症的人。
 哦。
 因为你必须有一个底线。
 所以我不会抢赛斯的风头。
 希望，加油。
 我们会尽力弄清楚。
 嗯，这就是我们这样做的原因，所以你知道，当我们试图解决这个问题时，今晚我有一个特别的客串，我之前提到过他，所以让我来做这个，托尼来吧，伙计，这是
 这是我的朋友兼同事托尼·范博士，他一直致力于研究非洲裔美国人的慢性疼痛。
 他开始了一些研讨会系列。
 所以就像我说的，我不会抢你的风头。
 跳到这里来。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=4883.198s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 我刚刚吞下了一些口香糖。
 谢谢你。
 我只是想抽出一点时间为这个社区中心鼓掌。
 我会保持简短，但我真的很欣赏这些空间，因为我觉得它们对于社区的健康非常重要。
 正如您所看到的，为了满足未满足的需求，正在进行许多创造性的努力
 不同的种族人口、不同的疾病、不同的疾病。
 因此，我是麻省总医院的一个小组的一员，与迈克·金凯德先生、诺曼、玛丽一起，我们实际上希望通过让社区中的人们能够实施干预措施，将基于证据的干预措施引入社区环境。社区为了社区。
 以一种文化上可以接受的方式，价格并不算贵得离谱。
 因此，我们的研究（这里提到的几项研究之一）正在寻求在文化上适应身心干预
 针对患有早期认知能力下降和慢性疼痛的美国老年黑人。
 这是一件值得考虑的有趣的事情，因为患有慢性疼痛的人出现早期认知能力下降（我们称之为这种现象）的可能性是其他人的两倍，而这两种情况会导致彼此变得更糟。
 因此，针对与衰老问题相关的所有问题（例如早期认知能力下降）非常重要。
 为此，我们正在建立一个社区咨询委员会，主要汇集社区中具有生活经验的专家，他们被认为是美国老年黑人，患有慢性疼痛和早期认知能力下降。
 本质上是提供他们的意见，以便我们能够在社区中实施这种干预措施。
 因为本质上，就像其他人提到的那样，保险费率有时很高。
 有时医疗保健非常难以获得。
 因此，找出创造性的方法来为有需要的人提供护理非常重要。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5026.455s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 这是一个无耻的插头。
 希望你能再次见到托尼。
 我的意思是，正如我所分享的，我喜欢这个社区卫生中心。
 我的意思是，我必须说实话，当我到达这里时，我就想，我以前来过这里。
 但那已经是很久以前的事了。
 是的，如果受到邀请，那真是无耻的插嘴，我们很乐意回来。
 好吧，我们准备好了吗？
 你好？
 好的，赛斯。
 你能听到我吗？
 我们能听到你的声音。
 女士们先生们，这是塞斯·盖尔博士，塞斯，你要带我们回家，好吗？
 你是今晚最后一位发言者。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5069.035s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 非常好。
 不过，我想确保你能听到我的声音。
 你可以吗？
 是的。
 好的。
 这是一次很棒的讨论。
 很抱歉我不能亲自到场。
 我一直在听这一切。
 你们的问题很精彩。
 谢谢大家今晚的到来。
 我是盖尔博士，赛斯·盖尔。
 拉米雷斯·戈麦斯正在谈论她在麻省总医院的角色。
 所以我也有类似的角色。
 我是布莱根妇女医院的一名神经科医生，我们在很多事情上都密切合作，包括研究和护理、照顾病人。
 我想谈谈几个主题，我想主要谈谈一项研究。
 这是我想要达到的主要目的。
 但我们已经讨论过尽早发现阿尔茨海默病。
 这是本次讨论的一个重要主题，来自 Mike 最初的对话，来自观众中的某个人，他谈到了进行 PET 扫描以尽早识别症状。
 这一切都是为了
 试图找出如果您发现早期阿尔茨海默病患者的大脑发生变化该怎么办，非常早，甚至在出现症状之前。
 那么你对此怎么办？
 我的意思是，就像很多情况一样，你知道，你想到糖尿病或心脏病，目标是确定
 尽早改变，这样你就可以尝试干预并采取措施。
 以糖尿病为例，我们都想知道糖在开始引起神经病变之前以及在开始影响视力等之前什么时候开始发生变化。
 所以大脑在这方面没有什么不同。
 我们的想法是尝试尽早发现这些变化。
 所以
 但目前尚不清楚此时该做什么，对吗？
 你可以建议所有真正重要的健康生活方式，我不想最小化所有的事情，比如锻炼、健康饮食、积极的社交互动、减轻压力、获得良好的睡眠等等。
 但目前还不清楚还能做什么。
 我们正在做一项研究。
 实际上，百翰大学是这项研究的地点之一，全世界约有 85 或 90 名研究人员。
 这就是所谓的 AHEAD 研究，就像向前迈出一步或向前跳跃一样。
 这项研究针对的是 55 岁至 80 岁的人群，他们
 没有任何记忆困难。
 他们可能担心记忆力。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5246.378s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 人们在笑，因为他们中的一些人已经超过 80 岁了。
 80岁以上。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5252.622s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 他们没有资格参加这项研究。
 很公平。
 很公平。
 但他们可能认识一些年轻人。
 好的。
 我们有很多研究。
 所以实际上，我想先检查一件事，因为年龄限制略有不同。
 是的，所以我是对的。
 所以是55到80。
 所以我们有很多研究的对象是 85 岁。
 但这项研究的想法是你的年龄必须在 55 岁到 80 岁之间。
 您前来拜访，并完成了基本的记忆测试。
 您可能会担心记忆困难。
 没关系，但您甚至不必担心。
 你可以只是过着自己的生活，找到一种回馈或参与研究的方法对你来说很重要，也许你有家族史。
 这些都是可能性。
 您已经完成了基本的记忆测试。
 然后进行血液检查。
 血液测试对大脑释放的血液中的这些碎片进行测试，可以通过血液测试预测大脑中是否存在阿尔茨海默病的变化。
 所以这真的很整洁，这真的很整洁
 相当新的技术进步能够检测到这一点。
 因此，如果你进行了这项血液测试，并且血液测试表明，如果你要通过扫描来观察大脑，如果你要进入扫描仪并观察大脑，那么你就会发现这些斑块。谈论这些淀粉样斑块。
 这就是研究的第一步。
 血液检查异常，这可能与大脑中存在斑块有关。
 如果是这样的话，如果测试结果呈阳性，那么你就需要进行影像学测试，即所谓的 PET 扫描，我们在前面的讨论中已经讨论过，以确认这一点。
 为了确认您的认知能力正常，因此您的记忆力和思维能力与年龄相符，
 但是你有这些早期迹象，我们称之为阿尔茨海默氏症，但在你出现正确的症状之前，你不会像迈克和其他人谈论的所有事情都与困惑或忘记事情有关这对你来说还没有发生。
 但顺便说一句，在我刚刚在这项研究中描述的前两次访问中，您会发现所有这些。
 然后会发生的事情是，如果你在大脑成像测试（称为 PET 扫描）中发现这些斑块，那么你就参加了一项为期四年的研究，研究一种名为 Lecanumab 或 Lekembe 的药物。
 这是您可能拥有的一种药物
 我不知道我是否得到反馈，但正如拉米雷斯-戈麦斯博士所说，这是我们刚刚开始使用的一种药物，用于治疗早期阿尔茨海默病患者。
 因为它经过了所有的研究并且获得了 FDA 的批准使用，但我们不知道的是这种药物是否有效
 对于那些还没有症状的人来说可能会有帮助，但他们的大脑变化与我们稍后看到的相同。
 所以这真的就像早期干预、早期、早期改变。
 回到迈克关于参与的观点之一，那就是我们只是不知道是否存在，如果没有不同人群的参与，我们不知道不同人群中的差异效应。
 这包括黑人人口。
 我知道这个系列主要关注黑人健康。
 它包括太平洋或岛民人口。
 其中包括西班牙裔美国人。
 它包括
 每个人都跨越种族和民族界限以及性别界限，无论男人还是女人。
 正如迈克所暗示的，你知道，研究将会继续下去，我们的想法是最大限度地利用知识
 这样我所描述的研究结果就可以以某种方式应用于每个人。
 如果没有代表美国人民的公平和平等的参与和代表性，那么我们就不会知道治疗或研究需要改变什么才能回答这些问题。
 这就是我的简短总结
 我们正在邀请人们来参加一项大型研究。
 我很乐意回答有关它的任何问题或详细介绍它。
 我认为，迈克，在这里提出最后 10、15 分钟之类的问题是有意义的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5587.309s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 那么我们有吗？
 前进。
 这是您演示的早期部分。
 好吧，让我让我让我。
 赛斯，你能听到她的声音吗？
 是的。
 好的，继续吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5601.357s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 我听过您之前关于 PET 扫描的演示。
 您所说的 PET 扫描，当您进行 PET 扫描时，是否可以确定您可能患有哪种类型的阿尔茨海默病、痴呆症？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5618.708s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 这是一个好问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5619.429s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 所以在医生的办公室里——塞斯，很快，对于家里的人来说，问题是，PET 扫描，它能确定你患有哪种类型的阿尔茨海默病吗？
 或者痴呆症。
 或者痴呆症。
 抱歉，您患有哪种类型的痴呆症？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5631.997s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 因此，当您参加我所描述的 AHEAD 研究时，我所讨论的这种特殊 PET 扫描是专门针对阿尔茨海默病的。
 这就是由这些淀粉样斑块定义的痴呆症。
 但我认为，一般来说，如果你有记忆、思维或行为改变，并且你来看像我、里奇医生或拉米雷斯-戈麦斯医生这样的医生，那么这个问题就会出现。
 我们如何确定这是哪种痴呆症，以便确定建议是什么以及是否有某种药物可以使用？
 有不同的信息可以帮助解决这个问题。
 症状本身就有。
 那么究竟发生了什么？
 是什么样的记忆或行为或思维变化？
 仅仅是记忆还是也解决问题或决策？
 该人是否也有这种睡眠困难，或者他们的行走、步态或眼球运动是否有变化？
 换句话说，这就是我们所说的症状类别。
 因此，就像哮喘或肺部疾病等任何疾病一样，您会向医生提出一系列症状。
 这不仅仅是我有记忆困难，而且我们会微调并解决这个问题。
 第二个是定期扫描大脑。
 所以不是 PET 扫描，而是 MRI 扫描。
 有时，并非总是如此，但有时 MRI 上有一种模式可以与该人的症状相关联。
 所以你有症状，你有核磁共振扫描，然后你有记忆和思维测试。
 所以不仅仅是记住这个词并在两分钟后告诉我，而是更详细的测试，比如，你能复制这张图片吗？
 如果我读这一段给你听，我希望你尝试记住这些具体事实。
 所以基本上是记忆力和思维测试的表现。
 当你将这三条信息结合起来时，你就构建了一个类似诊断的故事。
 这是路易体痴呆吗？
 或者这是阿尔茨海默病？
 或者这是额颞叶痴呆和其他类型的罕见痴呆？
 我认为这就是这个问题所要表达的意思，那就是有一些工具可以使用。
 确实如此，就像中风一样，
 明确的诊断，100%的诊断就像你通过活组织检查看到的那样，我们通常不会对大脑进行活组织检查，或者你会关注死亡。
 这是 100% 明确的诊断。
 但这并不能阻止我们接近目标。
 有了我描述的所有这些工具，尤其是这些标记，我们就达到了 95%、97%。
 我们对所有疾病都采取同样的做法，比如肺炎，
 结核病，我们有生物标志物，我们有血液测试，所以我们在弄清楚它方面做得越来越好。
 但我认为重要的是要区分这样一个事实：我们可以获得可操作的信息，例如根据该信息使用阿尔茨海默氏症药物治疗某人，而无需像尸检那样拥有死后的大脑。
 您不需要它来进行可行的治疗。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5838.539s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 好的，我在这里有一个问题。
 我会重复这个问题，继续，因为麦克风无法到达那里。
 我们会将麦克风交给您。
 对不起，请原谅，我过来了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5859.747s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 我有一个...它叫什么名字？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5866.59s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 失语症？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5877.085s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 当我还小的时候，上三年级，当我放学回家时，
 我睡着了又醒来。
 每次……我都……那么这是一个关于睡眠的问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5921.623s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 慢慢来。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5924.624s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 我有一个...
 这里、那里、那里。
 年纪大了。
 哥哥姐姐们。
 不。
 好的。
 年纪大了。
 我去了学校。
 我80岁了。
 一遍又一遍。
 是的。
 无论如何，80。
 我80岁了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5990.283s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 你还年轻，可以参加研究。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=5991.824s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 是啊，是啊，是啊。
 嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=6015.154s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 没关系。
 没关系。
 你知道吗？
 之后我会留下来，所以如果你愿意的话，就拉住我，我们谈谈。
 好的？
 没关系。
 好的。
 所以。
 哦，是吗？
 是的。
 我还有其他问题吗？
 哦，是的，我做到了。
 好的。
 因为它回不到那里了。
 前进。
 问题是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=6049.74s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 如果可能的话，在年轻时可以做些什么来尝试减少患痴呆症的机会？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=6062.369s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 所以，赛斯，对于在家舒适地观看这一事件的人们来说，问题是，除了年龄之外，是否还有其他风险因素，以及是否有人可以采取任何预防措施来尝试避免患上阿尔茨海默病，或者至少拖延吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=6079.597s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 是的，肯定有。
 我也很高兴能尝试一下。
 我还知道拉米雷斯-戈麦斯博士也在场。
 我不希望问答只是关于我所说的、我开始学习的内容。
 让我开始，其他人可以添加。
 因此，有很多可改变的风险因素，即您可以从中年甚至更早开始做的事情来降低患痴呆症的风险。
 这包括我们已经讨论过的一些事情。
 因此，定期进行体力活动和有氧运动，保持类似于我们所认为的地中海式饮食或低饱和脂肪和加工糖含量的饮食。
 我们知道，对于中老年人来说，未经治疗的听力困难本身就是一个独立的危险因素，它要么加速记忆障碍的发生，要么导致或成为痴呆症的危险因素。
 因此，购买助听器并确保测试听力是可以稍后完成的事情。
 这些只是我们所知道的一些事情。
 当你在这些长期衰老研究中研究 40 岁、50 岁的人时，我们就知道了这些信息。
 我希望我们能早点去，得到更多，你知道，甚至更早。
 您可以采访人们并真正获得有关他们正在做什么类型的生活方式行为、他们居住在哪个地区、在哪里的详细信息。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=6192.665s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 塞斯，塞斯，我准备打断你的唯一原因是因为有人，我没有提到任何名字，索菲，忘记给他们的笔记本电脑充电。
 哦，我们即将失去你。
 电池的事就突然出现了。
 但我要这么说，因为我们也到了这个时候了。
 首先，我想说谢谢大家的到来。
 我很享受这个。
 我已经和丽莎聊过了。
 我们回来了。
 我喜欢悬念。
 我们会回来的。
 我们要做的不是我带上无数的医生，我们为什么不一次只带一个或两个，然后我们就可以谈谈。
 好吧，我谨代表马萨诸塞州阿尔茨海默病研究中心对您周三晚上的到来表示感谢。
 从字面上看，已经是 8 点了。
 前进。
 莉莲娜，你让她问这个问题了吗？
 我们可以用西班牙语做到这一点。
 我们可以用英语来做这件事。
 如果我们能找到人翻译成另一种语言，我们就可以在那里做。
 这就是我说的，是的，我们可以。
 话虽如此，苏菲，带我们回家吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eYr5aDp5dhU&t=6277.99s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 我想迈克已经说过了。
 谢谢大家的到来。
 我想我在第一次联系迈克时学到了很多东西。
 到目前为止，谢谢你，盖尔博士。
 谢谢里奇博士、拉米雷斯-戈麦斯博士和其他所有人。
 托尼、撒哈拉博士，谢谢你们的到来。
 我们的下一个系列将于下个月讨论黑人孕产妇健康。
 是的，我们没时间了。
 所以我确实给电脑充电了，但我们使用的是 OWL。
 这就是为什么我必须插入同一个端口。
 但谢谢大家，祝大家有个美好的夜晚。</p>
