1
02:35:26,470 --> 02:35:27,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Recording in progress.

2
02:35:39,972 --> 02:35:49,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can tell you, just in terms of getting another member, we're putting out another call slash push with the, with the city for people to apply.

3
02:35:49,774 --> 02:35:53,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully that will, it's catered like a typical Craig.

4
02:35:53,875 --> 02:35:55,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be able to,

5
02:35:57,053 --> 02:35:58,434
[SPEAKER_04]: get a new member soon.

6
02:35:59,814 --> 02:36:11,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and those of you who are watching at home and public access, you know, if you're interested, please contact the city, actually in any board commission, not just ours, but we're the best one.

7
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:12,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially ours.

8
02:36:13,420 --> 02:36:13,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

9
02:36:27,225 --> 02:36:27,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good.

10
02:37:16,908 --> 02:37:17,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Heather.

11
02:37:17,368 --> 02:37:18,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

12
02:37:22,032 --> 02:37:23,353
[SPEAKER_07]: You are our quorum.

13
02:37:23,733 --> 02:37:25,395
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can start now.

14
02:37:25,695 --> 02:37:28,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I had to find a place that I could get reception.

15
02:37:28,697 --> 02:37:29,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

16
02:37:29,938 --> 02:37:30,759
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

17
02:37:30,859 --> 02:37:32,040
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're very glad you're here.

18
02:37:33,341 --> 02:37:36,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will open the hearing at 637 on Tuesday.

19
02:37:36,343 --> 02:37:41,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, it's Wednesday, December 7th.

20
02:37:41,087 --> 02:37:41,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And

21
02:37:46,136 --> 02:37:53,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for returning tonight and for the revised plans.

22
02:37:53,581 --> 02:38:07,750
[SPEAKER_07]: If the representative for the applicant would like to discuss the revisions, that would be helpful.

23
02:38:10,952 --> 02:38:11,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

24
02:38:11,152 --> 02:38:11,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

25
02:38:11,733 --> 02:38:13,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Hughes with Hughes Environmental Consulting.

26
02:38:14,966 --> 02:38:24,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Here tonight, we've got Dan Chen from the architect's office, Gabe Cicerello from Medford Housing, and Steve Sawyer from GM2, the engineer on the project.

27
02:38:25,412 --> 02:38:29,314
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the bulk of the comments that we had to address were stormwater related and engineering.

28
02:38:29,354 --> 02:38:31,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to turn it right over to Steve.

29
02:38:31,596 --> 02:38:32,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve can run through it.

30
02:38:32,536 --> 02:38:35,498
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have any general questions, we've got folks here to try and answer.

31
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:39,521
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Steve Sawyer, GM2.

32
02:38:39,582 --> 02:38:40,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm in the hot seat here.

33
02:38:40,862 --> 02:38:45,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so we took a hard look at the storm.

34
02:38:45,826 --> 02:38:54,212
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a fair amount of comments from Pam Merrill at DEP, and then some comments, also comments provided by the commission.

35
02:38:55,533 --> 02:39:05,100
[SPEAKER_02]: We really looked at it hard and revised the stormwater treatment systems, which I feel addresses all of the concerns.

36
02:39:06,419 --> 02:39:08,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what I'll do, is it okay if I can share a screen?

37
02:39:08,681 --> 02:39:11,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve, you're all set.

38
02:39:11,425 --> 02:39:12,666
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, very good.

39
02:39:15,309 --> 02:39:18,413
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we all set, everyone can see?

40
02:39:19,834 --> 02:39:19,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

41
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:30,082
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I think what we've done, so all along we were converting this swale to a grass swale.

42
02:39:30,122 --> 02:39:34,623
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have the room to do any serpentine or additional plantings in it.

43
02:39:35,803 --> 02:39:44,725
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do have is we have a forebay to dissipate the velocities and settle out any heavy solids, but we have a grass swale.

44
02:39:44,805 --> 02:39:51,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I worked with Tom for a planting mix for the swale in the grassed areas of the basins.

45
02:39:52,447 --> 02:39:58,972
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the comments was this basin here was within 50 feet of water of a resource area.

46
02:39:59,772 --> 02:40:07,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually not the top of bank, but it would be the Mystic River itself would be the resource area in question that we need to stay away from.

47
02:40:08,498 --> 02:40:14,681
[SPEAKER_02]: But we couldn't with this system, so we actually converted it to a bioretention area.

48
02:40:14,821 --> 02:40:18,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thicker soil media, provides enhanced treatment through the soil media.

49
02:40:19,663 --> 02:40:26,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've rimmed, in the next slide, we've actually provided planting in the

50
02:40:28,046 --> 02:40:37,753
[SPEAKER_02]: upper areas, the top foot and a half of the basin itself, and then the bottom of the basin itself would just be the grass area.

51
02:40:39,534 --> 02:40:40,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's

52
02:40:41,282 --> 02:40:43,443
[SPEAKER_02]: That's this western side.

53
02:40:43,503 --> 02:40:53,449
[SPEAKER_02]: We fully hold and treat and recharge the required volumes set forth in DEP requirements, a half inch water quality volume for all the paved areas.

54
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:58,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ended up at a B soil for this site.

55
02:40:58,132 --> 02:41:04,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there are mixed, the test pits indicated mixed

56
02:41:05,463 --> 02:41:06,023
[SPEAKER_02]: mix mature.

57
02:41:06,043 --> 02:41:09,725
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some areas of sand fill, some areas with tighter soils fill.

58
02:41:11,285 --> 02:41:11,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mix.

59
02:41:12,345 --> 02:41:30,572
[SPEAKER_02]: The clipper ship trail or the clipper ship path, all of their stormwater calculations for this area, they ended up with the soil class B. We felt it was a good indication of what the soils behave here.

60
02:41:32,275 --> 02:41:37,199
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we use for the soil classification for both of these systems.

61
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:44,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on the eastern side, so originally we weren't treating.

62
02:41:44,445 --> 02:41:49,590
[SPEAKER_02]: We were letting this portion of the lease area go and just let it run into the paved swale.

63
02:41:51,191 --> 02:41:55,795
[SPEAKER_02]: This side, we were planning to curb this side anyway, and we had a break.

64
02:41:55,855 --> 02:41:59,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there was a break here, and I think there was another break.

65
02:41:59,787 --> 02:42:06,790
[SPEAKER_02]: to allow the water to continue to flow off as it does today on the existing pavement.

66
02:42:07,931 --> 02:42:11,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But with this, what we decided, okay, let's, while we're curbing it, let's collect it.

67
02:42:12,773 --> 02:42:17,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's collect this entire paved area, this entire eastern side of the drainage area.

68
02:42:18,135 --> 02:42:27,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what we're doing is we provided actually, I think this is the type of swale that I think the commission and the CPC application was envisioning

69
02:42:28,042 --> 02:42:45,983
[SPEAKER_02]: On the western side so the serpentine some bulges with some planting, so we we actually had room to do it on this side, so we provided that swale into the into a four bay this system we moved it was a little longer and narrow with the overflow into the into the river mystic river.

70
02:42:46,003 --> 02:42:46,043
[SPEAKER_02]: To.

71
02:42:49,309 --> 02:42:54,477
[SPEAKER_02]: To simplify the overflow, we've treated everything.

72
02:42:54,497 --> 02:42:58,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've done, we've pulled this 50 feet away.

73
02:42:58,643 --> 02:43:02,308
[SPEAKER_02]: We've maintained this as a infiltration area, infiltration basin.

74
02:43:02,829 --> 02:43:03,951
[SPEAKER_02]: There are sands underneath.

75
02:43:05,231 --> 02:43:06,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We found some sandy material underneath.

76
02:43:06,732 --> 02:43:20,576
[SPEAKER_02]: We did throttle back our infiltration rate, I believe, from substantial, I think, to 2.2 inches per hour, which is a very conservative infiltration rate on this.

77
02:43:21,257 --> 02:43:27,979
[SPEAKER_02]: With this basin, we actually have, in the calculations, I think we're well above the requirements.

78
02:43:28,639 --> 02:43:31,520
[SPEAKER_02]: We had room, so we went beyond the requirements of the half inch.

79
02:43:32,172 --> 02:43:39,138
[SPEAKER_02]: and the recharge, I believe we're, I think our water quality volume is somewhere around almost an inch here on this.

80
02:43:39,218 --> 02:43:41,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 0.8 inches or something in that neighborhood.

81
02:43:42,020 --> 02:43:45,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had the room, so we did provide extra treatment beyond what's required.

82
02:43:46,824 --> 02:43:57,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is we overtop and we discharge, there's a stone swale here that we tie into the existing swale that runs underneath the future, the future Clipper City path.

83
02:43:57,612 --> 02:43:58,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna jump to the,

84
02:43:59,236 --> 02:44:02,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Jump to my next lawn.

85
02:44:07,818 --> 02:44:11,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an enlargement of our infiltration basin.

86
02:44:12,319 --> 02:44:18,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've done is around these areas, we've provided most of it's gonna be a lawn, a mix, a seed mix.

87
02:44:19,281 --> 02:44:21,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I specified the seed mix up in,

88
02:44:22,985 --> 02:44:23,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did I put it?

89
02:44:23,906 --> 02:44:25,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he specified it somewhere.

90
02:44:25,168 --> 02:44:27,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, here are the two seed mixes.

91
02:44:27,871 --> 02:44:34,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom did a little research here to find out, to come up with something that we thought would provide a

92
02:44:36,373 --> 02:44:41,777
[SPEAKER_02]: a robust and durable planting mix in these basins and in the swales.

93
02:44:42,377 --> 02:44:45,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came up with a warm season grass mix, because this can go both ways.

94
02:44:45,879 --> 02:44:48,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It can dry out, and during long dry periods, it will get dry.

95
02:44:48,461 --> 02:44:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the detention basin mix for moisture sites.

96
02:44:55,025 --> 02:44:58,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And his thought is what's going to happen is the species in both of these, what

97
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:06,092
[SPEAKER_02]: what works best will end up surviving and thriving.

98
02:45:06,933 --> 02:45:11,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of provided a mixed base there, a mixed seeding mix.

99
02:45:12,796 --> 02:45:16,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So then along this area, the perimeter areas here,

100
02:45:17,114 --> 02:45:31,863
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna provide a planting schedule here, some native plants, some, what is it, red osier, dogwood, summer sweet, silky dogwood, shrubby, I don't know, Tommy can tell me what that is, and inkberry.

101
02:45:32,243 --> 02:45:35,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tom helped me out with some good native species to plant in this area.

102
02:45:35,745 --> 02:45:39,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll look good, and it provides a great environmental benefit here.

103
02:45:40,087 --> 02:45:41,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and a shrubby sinkfoil.

104
02:45:42,509 --> 02:45:44,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Those should be an eye.

105
02:45:44,870 --> 02:45:46,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, yeah.

106
02:45:46,728 --> 02:45:50,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, sinkfoil, yeah.

107
02:45:51,012 --> 02:45:52,894
[SPEAKER_00]: But confoil must be a beautiful plant.

108
02:45:54,315 --> 02:45:56,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Confoil, yeah.

109
02:45:56,217 --> 02:45:57,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking the ocean, I guess.

110
02:45:57,699 --> 02:46:01,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so and then as far as the profile, we have the grass whale, it dumps into our forebay.

111
02:46:01,983 --> 02:46:07,488
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have, you know, we dissipate the energy with a riprap embankment, then we end up with

112
02:46:08,923 --> 02:46:13,206
[SPEAKER_02]: the loam and seed, and this is the mix that Tom had talked about.

113
02:46:13,346 --> 02:46:35,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, to provide a concise weir, concise overflow, what we did is we're putting a concrete, it's a basically, well, it's a concrete road curb, long, rocky, concrete road curb set in elevation so that it will slide over the forebay and then into the main treatment area, the main section here.

114
02:46:35,981 --> 02:46:37,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have plantings up in the higher,

115
02:46:38,453 --> 02:46:45,872
[SPEAKER_02]: The grass is on the lower area, same thing here where we have the weir and then this overtops and then out into the...

116
02:46:47,165 --> 02:46:49,166
[SPEAKER_02]: the swale and into the Mystic River.

117
02:46:50,087 --> 02:46:58,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this treatment, we provided ample pretreatment and with the bioretention area, we actually achieved the 90% TSS removal.

118
02:46:58,713 --> 02:47:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that is you do have the enhanced soil media here of the three foot or 30 inch, I'm sorry, the 30 inch planting soil media in the bioretention basin.

119
02:47:11,423 --> 02:47:12,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So now as you pop over to the

120
02:47:16,568 --> 02:47:22,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so the water quality swale, what we see is we plant the grasses in the center.

121
02:47:22,373 --> 02:47:26,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we do is all the plantings would be placed on the side.

122
02:47:26,876 --> 02:47:29,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to have to jump back to my other plan.

123
02:47:29,318 --> 02:47:31,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on a second.

124
02:47:31,239 --> 02:47:34,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get back to those swales now, I think.

125
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:47,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have is, Tom came up with this planting scheme.

126
02:47:47,942 --> 02:47:56,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the grass swale, we end up in a little bay here where we have 16 tubelings planted in this area here.

127
02:47:57,087 --> 02:48:02,050
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another little embayment here with 12 silky dogwoods there, tubelings.

128
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:11,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on here, on this side, on the eastern swale here, we have 10 red osier dogwood tubelings in this area.

129
02:48:11,487 --> 02:48:19,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We bump it out for a few more tubelings here, and then some pussy willow tubelings down prior to discharging into our forebay.

130
02:48:21,135 --> 02:48:23,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a provided

131
02:48:26,823 --> 02:48:28,263
[SPEAKER_02]: great pre-treatment.

132
02:48:28,283 --> 02:48:30,664
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only using it for pre-treatment, not full treatment.

133
02:48:30,884 --> 02:48:35,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So from here, from our treatment swale, we run into our forebay.

134
02:48:35,725 --> 02:48:40,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And from our forebay, we overtop and we run into our infiltration basin.

135
02:48:42,126 --> 02:48:46,427
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be the lawn, the seeded mix here.

136
02:48:46,807 --> 02:48:51,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, it overtops and flows out to the existing swale.

137
02:48:54,854 --> 02:48:56,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we're at.

138
02:48:56,835 --> 02:48:59,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's some response.

139
02:48:59,696 --> 02:49:03,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I feel I was very responsive to the comments.

140
02:49:03,097 --> 02:49:06,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is a great plan for treating the stormwater.

141
02:49:06,158 --> 02:49:09,299
[SPEAKER_02]: We've really cleaned up, you know, currently there's no treatment at all.

142
02:49:10,219 --> 02:49:14,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the housing authority project will be a great improvement to the water quality.

143
02:49:16,081 --> 02:49:19,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Upon Heidi's request, I did reach out to the DCR contact at

144
02:49:21,235 --> 02:49:24,877
[SPEAKER_02]: For the clipper ship path, of course, I can't remember her name.

145
02:49:24,897 --> 02:49:26,998
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm an engineer, not a salesperson.

146
02:49:27,138 --> 02:49:29,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke with her a little over a week ago.

147
02:49:30,785 --> 02:49:35,228
[SPEAKER_02]: But their plan here is they're just going to rip the pavement up.

148
02:49:35,668 --> 02:49:49,496
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to rip the pavement up and then put in trap rock and riprap to mitigate it, to make sure it doesn't erode some robust stone and heavy stone in this area for each of those, which the water is already clean.

149
02:49:49,516 --> 02:49:53,178
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, you just don't want it to become erosive or any

150
02:49:55,570 --> 02:49:59,073
[SPEAKER_02]: erode the bank or cause any hazard there.

151
02:49:59,513 --> 02:50:01,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a good plan for that.

152
02:50:01,535 --> 02:50:07,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're tying into that, to both of those points there, that condition that they're providing.

153
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:13,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Their hope, as far as their schedule, I think they're hoping to get funding over the winter.

154
02:50:13,364 --> 02:50:23,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're hoping this is gonna be a project next building season, which I believe, Dan may be able to follow up, Dan Chen might be able to help me out.

155
02:50:24,535 --> 02:50:31,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all this work in this area is part of the long-term improvements at the housing at the Saltonstall building.

156
02:50:32,019 --> 02:50:33,020
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to follow them.

157
02:50:33,160 --> 02:50:41,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So the good news is, okay, we have a certain point to tie into and any kind of piping that we were originally thinking of going underneath.

158
02:50:41,765 --> 02:50:46,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the complexities of pulling up the riprap and replacing the riprap, we've mitigated that.

159
02:50:46,988 --> 02:50:53,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll be tying into the two areas where the point discharges are into the river that are going to be stabilized by the

160
02:50:54,372 --> 02:50:56,853
[SPEAKER_02]: by the Clipper Ship Path project.

161
02:50:56,933 --> 02:51:03,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I've covered everything as far as the stormwater improvements on the project.

162
02:51:03,616 --> 02:51:10,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel we, you know, I feel very responsive to the comments and working with the commission and the DEP on this project.

163
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:13,161
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, granted, it is, you know, it is a mix.

164
02:51:14,041 --> 02:51:17,562
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a mix of redevelopment, new development, but as part of the redevelopment,

165
02:51:19,345 --> 02:51:30,153
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations say, if we have the room to do it, we should make the extra effort and provide the water quality treatment.

166
02:51:30,314 --> 02:51:33,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'll wrap it up with that and turn it over for questions.

167
02:51:33,916 --> 02:51:35,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, if I missed anything, let me know.

168
02:51:36,618 --> 02:51:47,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just point out on the seed mixes, the reason we're blending two mixes is, as Steve said, we get a broader hydrology range of survival for the seeds.

169
02:51:48,191 --> 02:51:51,213
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the warm season grass mix tends to be slow growing.

170
02:51:51,373 --> 02:51:58,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the restoration moist site seed mix that we're proposing tends to establish faster.

171
02:51:58,518 --> 02:52:00,840
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get some good natives in there.

172
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:06,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, I don't expect to, I think there's like 10 or 15 different species there.

173
02:52:07,284 --> 02:52:10,006
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably come down to four or five that are really dominant.

174
02:52:10,566 --> 02:52:23,337
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may actually be different species in different areas that dominate depending on, you know, if we've got any portions of the basins that are wetter than others, then we've got, you know, an appropriate seed in that area that will kind of take over.

175
02:52:25,378 --> 02:52:36,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so I'm pretty happy that we've also gotten away from sort of a lawn to something that, while it is grasses, it's going to really be dominated by grasses.

176
02:52:36,748 --> 02:52:36,948
[SPEAKER_00]: It is

177
02:52:40,724 --> 02:52:41,384
[SPEAKER_00]: provide some value.

178
02:52:42,505 --> 02:52:47,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tom, I think the maintenance that you recommended was they get mowed once a year, right?

179
02:52:47,646 --> 02:52:48,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

180
02:52:49,147 --> 02:52:55,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're natives, we shouldn't have to do anything more than mow it once a year.

181
02:52:55,789 --> 02:53:03,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really to keep the woody stuff from kind of getting in the way of the swale.

182
02:53:03,491 --> 02:53:05,152
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd mow the core of the swale.

183
02:53:05,532 --> 02:53:09,013
[SPEAKER_00]: The areas where the dogwoods and the pussywillows and all that are going,

184
02:53:10,325 --> 02:53:17,287
[SPEAKER_00]: that would just be kind of left alone, maybe some trimming with a weed whacker around those shrubs to keep the grasses from getting out of hand.

185
02:53:17,427 --> 02:53:22,388
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're using natives, they should be much lower maintenance anyway.

186
02:53:27,229 --> 02:53:28,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for that.

187
02:53:29,090 --> 02:53:30,030
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very helpful.

188
02:53:31,270 --> 02:53:37,672
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll turn this to the commission now and see if you have any questions for either Tom or

189
02:53:45,216 --> 02:53:46,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I can jump in.

190
02:53:46,677 --> 02:53:52,941
[SPEAKER_01]: This looks like from I think the first time that got brought before us, this looks fantastic.

191
02:53:53,681 --> 02:54:01,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to see a lot more vegetation, a lot more utilizing the space to provide treatment.

192
02:54:03,247 --> 02:54:07,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one question on the bioretention zone.

193
02:54:07,490 --> 02:54:10,072
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be a question for Tom more than Steven.

194
02:54:12,522 --> 02:54:16,143
[SPEAKER_01]: looks to be a relatively deep practice.

195
02:54:16,243 --> 02:54:26,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at the cross sections you guys have, it looks like a lot of the plantings are going to be subject to more than a foot and a half of inundation on a regular basis.

196
02:54:26,466 --> 02:54:29,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a concern for plant health long term?

197
02:54:30,547 --> 02:54:33,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I can first, I can respond to that first.

198
02:54:33,228 --> 02:54:36,609
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why our planting areas is up on the banks.

199
02:54:37,069 --> 02:54:39,230
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the, that's our deep area.

200
02:54:40,509 --> 02:54:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've planted, done the heavy planting up around the rim with our deep, it's really just that one deep sump that's very deep.

201
02:54:47,354 --> 02:54:53,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And this shelf is only, I think it's a foot and a half deep here, 18 inches.

202
02:54:53,298 --> 02:54:54,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn it over to Tom now.

203
02:54:55,060 --> 02:55:00,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the elevation of planting that you had there on the cross section lists four as the base.

204
02:55:00,123 --> 02:55:04,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm comparing that to the invert of the weird five and a half.

205
02:55:04,727 --> 02:55:04,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

206
02:55:05,718 --> 02:55:10,592
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants can all withstand some level of flooding and some level of inundation.

207
02:55:12,112 --> 02:55:32,181
[SPEAKER_00]: What we typically do is these things are planted and we kind of observe the plant survival in the first year or two and it becomes pretty obvious if we've misjudged or mischosen a species and then we look to swap it out with one of the plants that's thriving or we look to choose a species similar to one of the plants that's thriving.

208
02:55:33,221 --> 02:55:34,622
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not uncommon to

209
02:55:35,673 --> 02:55:45,806
[SPEAKER_00]: You use your best professional judgment to put these things in, but it's not uncommon to make a change after planting if one of the species tends to be a little less resilient than you think it might be.

210
02:55:47,609 --> 02:55:50,933
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've had good luck with all of those.

211
02:55:53,161 --> 02:55:55,403
[SPEAKER_00]: in bioretention areas before.

212
02:55:55,763 --> 02:56:05,929
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the biggest problem I've had with those is when they've gone in on the basin floor and the grasses kind of overgrow them and dwarf them.

213
02:56:05,949 --> 02:56:08,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the guys go with the weed whackers and cut them down.

214
02:56:09,431 --> 02:56:13,034
[SPEAKER_00]: So having them up on the sides, I'm actually feeling better about it.

215
02:56:13,274 --> 02:56:17,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there'll be sort of more out of the way of the routine maintenance and the guy in the mower.

216
02:56:18,997 --> 02:56:19,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

217
02:56:20,078 --> 02:56:21,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that type of kind of

218
02:56:22,328 --> 02:56:25,650
[SPEAKER_01]: informed replanting included in the O&M plan?

219
02:56:27,991 --> 02:56:36,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if we included it in the O&M, but it would be part of our, before we come in for a COC, we'd need to demonstrate that we've got plants surviving there.

220
02:56:36,515 --> 02:56:42,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's, once they're established, we shouldn't need to do anything with them.

221
02:56:42,899 --> 02:56:45,480
[SPEAKER_00]: But Steve, I don't know if you have any more on that.

222
02:56:46,123 --> 02:56:54,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well I was pretty, that's one thing probably we could do as we, you know, as it's planted and such and get some recommendations from Tom.

223
02:56:54,126 --> 02:57:02,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, my O&M has just replaced, you know, it's kind of the stock one, replaced vegetation that's died off.

224
02:57:04,248 --> 02:57:13,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I did do is provide an open access so you're not going, I wanted to provide an area way in and out of here with a mower so they don't have to sneak their way in.

225
02:57:13,572 --> 02:57:22,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was that gap is for a reason why kind of trying to keep our planting areas separate and also distinct.

226
02:57:22,996 --> 02:57:25,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as the maintenance, it can be achieved.

227
02:57:26,217 --> 02:57:46,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Tom brought up a good point is, you know, with the COC, probably, you know, there might be a good idea to update the O&M based on what we see out there over the, you know, as we, you know, during the construction period and during the growing period, as these systems take hold, refine the O&M to meet those needs.

228
02:57:47,489 --> 02:57:52,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, the bioretention areas do, you know, they are maintenance, they do require maintenance.

229
02:57:52,572 --> 02:57:53,853
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the drawbacks of them.

230
02:57:54,420 --> 02:57:55,321
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not horrible.

231
02:57:55,361 --> 02:58:04,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, if you have a landscape contractor out there doing the general maintenance or doing the maintenance, they just need to be informed.

232
02:58:06,386 --> 02:58:11,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually one of my comments was that the O&M plan needs to incorporate the shrub plantings.

233
02:58:11,669 --> 02:58:14,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very pleased to see the number of shrub plantings there.

234
02:58:14,451 --> 02:58:22,315
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to make sure that the Medford Housing Authority's investment is protected and not run over, which often happens.

235
02:58:24,750 --> 02:58:25,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

236
02:58:27,231 --> 02:58:29,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also want to.

237
02:58:29,973 --> 02:58:51,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully we won't have a summer like we did this past summer, but I want to make sure that or just mention that it may be wise to water in the shrubs when they're first planted to keep to reduce the mortality.

238
02:58:52,071 --> 02:59:00,480
[SPEAKER_07]: and don't know if there's any ability to do so, but that would be, that would help the shrubs for sure.

239
02:59:00,520 --> 02:59:00,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

240
02:59:01,861 --> 02:59:11,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's something that could be done, you know, where, you know, the good news is I, you know, get, you know, the, the housing authority is going to, they're going to want to keep that area looking good.

241
02:59:13,039 --> 02:59:15,680
[SPEAKER_02]: and a nice area for the residents and such.

242
02:59:15,740 --> 02:59:21,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we have, one thing, I think we have a little more control here than a lot of the projects I'm involved with.

243
02:59:21,941 --> 02:59:25,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you have a developer, they turn over, they sell it to somebody and they're gone.

244
02:59:26,322 --> 02:59:32,783
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news here is our client, the owner, has a vested interest in the property in perpetuity.

245
02:59:33,423 --> 02:59:40,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we have a much better probability that these areas will be cared, upon planting, they'll be cared for.

246
02:59:41,243 --> 02:59:44,484
[SPEAKER_02]: and then in the long-term to be cared for.

247
02:59:45,004 --> 02:59:53,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, the other thing is just kind of your, well, kind of the bocce area and the patio kind of overlook or it does overlook this.

248
02:59:53,146 --> 03:00:00,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's gonna be a reason to keep these plants flourishing and looking good here.

249
03:00:00,867 --> 03:00:04,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it.

250
03:00:05,768 --> 03:00:06,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

251
03:00:08,629 --> 03:00:09,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's it for me.

252
03:00:11,316 --> 03:00:12,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, great, thanks.

253
03:00:12,057 --> 03:00:16,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we return to the full view so I can see my commission members?

254
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:20,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, sorry.

255
03:00:20,202 --> 03:00:21,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Comment near the screen.

256
03:00:25,825 --> 03:00:27,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So any other commission members?

257
03:00:27,646 --> 03:00:28,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any comments?

258
03:00:30,428 --> 03:00:31,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing from me, thank you.

259
03:00:31,569 --> 03:00:34,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

260
03:00:34,531 --> 03:00:36,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy with the changes.

261
03:00:36,292 --> 03:00:38,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they did a good job.

262
03:00:39,309 --> 03:00:40,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very impressed.

263
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:42,871
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't usually get more than.

264
03:00:43,812 --> 03:00:44,813
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is wonderful.

265
03:00:45,133 --> 03:00:52,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And Heidi, I thought you summed it up nicely and much more elegantly than I would have with regard to our experience with mowing and brush hogging.

266
03:00:56,900 --> 03:01:00,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen it far too often, unfortunately.

267
03:01:01,183 --> 03:01:05,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I also appreciate the seed mixes that you are intending to use.

268
03:01:07,063 --> 03:01:07,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

269
03:01:08,364 --> 03:01:17,469
[SPEAKER_07]: The New England plant, sea mixes are definitely, are good mix for sure.

270
03:01:19,571 --> 03:01:35,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to, I presume that we're going to want some monitoring at least annually of, sorry, of the shrubs and the basins to ensure that there isn't

271
03:01:36,065 --> 03:01:38,166
[SPEAKER_07]: erosion, rilling, die off, et cetera.

272
03:01:40,448 --> 03:01:46,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something that- Heidi, you're referring to more than what we normally have in our requirements.

273
03:01:47,513 --> 03:01:49,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what's in our requirements.

274
03:01:49,174 --> 03:01:55,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we definitely have, you know, replacement of shrubs, et cetera, et cetera, but sounds like you're asking for a little bit more.

275
03:01:56,539 --> 03:02:00,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, this is an annual, something that would- Yeah, no, this is good.

276
03:02:06,858 --> 03:02:12,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that something that the applicant was intending to do?

277
03:02:13,901 --> 03:02:14,962
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my question.

278
03:02:14,982 --> 03:02:30,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as part of the O&M, we do have an annual, annually, it's a perpetual condition that these are to be monitored on an annual basis and with shrubs replaced and maintained.

279
03:02:32,409 --> 03:02:34,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they, I'm sorry, go ahead.

280
03:02:34,928 --> 03:02:35,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

281
03:02:35,228 --> 03:02:36,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Will that be part of the revised O&M?

282
03:02:37,909 --> 03:02:47,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, currently it is part of the O&M, but I think what I want to do is the upgraded is get a little more detailed in how how the maintenance is performed in the mowing and such.

283
03:02:48,073 --> 03:03:02,659
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, well, we can stress the fact that, OK, on an annual basis, any of the you know, the the any dead growth to be replaced and and such, we can add that little little more stress out a little more as far as within the O&M.

284
03:03:06,680 --> 03:03:13,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can condition the permit to require a revised O&M prior to construction.

285
03:03:14,486 --> 03:03:22,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other potential conditions?

286
03:03:31,326 --> 03:03:34,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Were there any that were discussed in our previous meetings?

287
03:03:34,568 --> 03:03:38,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just wondering if they were listed.

288
03:03:40,751 --> 03:03:42,192
[SPEAKER_08]: My memory is failing me here.

289
03:03:44,633 --> 03:03:47,935
[SPEAKER_08]: No, then just, okay.

290
03:03:48,035 --> 03:03:50,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And a question to Gabe, if I could.

291
03:03:50,196 --> 03:03:56,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that there can be some training of the maintenance crew to recognize the shrubs?

292
03:03:58,036 --> 03:03:59,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, most definitely.

293
03:03:59,597 --> 03:04:10,922
[SPEAKER_09]: We have very blessed at the Medford Housing Authority to have an amazing maintenance staff that are always eager to learn.

294
03:04:10,982 --> 03:04:19,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I've worked in a few housing authorities and I can't speak highly enough of our maintenance staff and the care that they have for our developments.

295
03:04:19,366 --> 03:04:25,329
[SPEAKER_09]: If you ever have a chance to go by, they do a really good job keeping up with everything.

296
03:04:25,889 --> 03:04:26,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know how important

297
03:04:28,643 --> 03:04:37,411
[SPEAKER_09]: So it will be under very close observation and the staff that we work in there will be very caring of everything that's gonna be on the site.

298
03:04:38,872 --> 03:04:39,533
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great to hear.

299
03:04:40,814 --> 03:04:55,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Heidi, is it worth adding any sort of condition in the off chance that DCR doesn't get their funding to proceed next season that the soils need to be stabilized through to the river just in case this project moves forward before DCRs?

300
03:04:57,182 --> 03:05:04,046
[SPEAKER_07]: If this project moves forward before DCR, I presume the swale in that area will remain bituminous.

301
03:05:05,868 --> 03:05:08,189
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other swale, I'm not sure.

302
03:05:08,209 --> 03:05:09,250
[SPEAKER_01]: The other swale is bituminous?

303
03:05:10,210 --> 03:05:11,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's also bituminous, I believe, yeah.

304
03:05:12,432 --> 03:05:18,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, nevermind then.

305
03:05:18,135 --> 03:05:19,836
[SPEAKER_07]: So, not ideal, but stable.

306
03:05:20,777 --> 03:05:20,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

307
03:05:28,077 --> 03:05:28,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

308
03:05:33,198 --> 03:05:41,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have a hear a motion from the commission to issue an order?

309
03:05:43,740 --> 03:05:46,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any public tonight, Heidi?

310
03:05:47,781 --> 03:05:51,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not believe so, but I certainly will ask, is there anyone here from the public tonight?

311
03:05:59,637 --> 03:06:01,538
[SPEAKER_06]: We also lost Dennis.

312
03:06:02,859 --> 03:06:05,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a message in the chat that he had to step off.

313
03:06:07,241 --> 03:06:09,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to log off for a second, but the meeting will continue.

314
03:06:14,485 --> 03:06:18,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make a motion to approve with the condition regarding the O&M fund.

315
03:06:20,169 --> 03:06:20,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second that.

316
03:06:22,650 --> 03:06:22,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

317
03:06:23,070 --> 03:06:24,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do a roll call then.

318
03:06:25,852 --> 03:06:26,932
[SPEAKER_07]: All in favor, Craig.

319
03:06:30,464 --> 03:06:32,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, here's Eric.

320
03:06:32,805 --> 03:06:32,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

321
03:06:34,065 --> 03:06:34,325

03:06:35,165 --> 03:06:35,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

03:06:36,545 --> 03:06:36,845

03:06:37,826 --> 03:06:38,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

03:06:44,907 --> 03:06:45,647
[SPEAKER_07]: You're very welcome.

328
03:06:45,707 --> 03:06:50,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for coming back tonight and incorporating both ours and DEP's comments.

329
03:06:51,368 --> 03:06:52,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

330
03:06:52,869 --> 03:06:53,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

331
03:06:53,909 --> 03:06:54,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great night.

332
03:06:54,469 --> 03:06:55,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everybody.

333
03:06:55,469 --> 03:06:55,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye Heidi.

334
03:06:56,029 --> 03:06:57,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, everyone.

335
03:06:57,410 --> 03:06:58,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good evening.

336
03:06:58,130 --> 03:06:58,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

337
03:06:58,470 --> 03:06:59,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to see you.

338
03:07:00,400 --> 03:07:00,840
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

339
03:07:01,601 --> 03:07:01,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye everyone.

340
03:07:02,681 --> 03:07:02,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

341
03:07:03,541 --> 03:07:03,741
Bye.

342
03:07:05,782 --> 03:07:13,725
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will also request a motion to close the public hearing portion of this.

343
03:07:14,665 --> 03:07:17,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I make such a motion to close the public hearing on the site.

344
03:07:18,467 --> 03:07:19,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I second the motion.

345
03:07:19,467 --> 03:07:21,648
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor, Craig.

346
03:07:21,668 --> 03:07:21,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

347
03:07:21,788 --> 03:07:22,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Heather.

348
03:07:22,108 --> 03:07:22,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

349
03:07:22,548 --> 03:07:23,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Eric.

350
03:07:30,166 --> 03:07:30,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

351
03:07:31,066 --> 03:07:31,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex?

352
03:07:32,106 --> 03:07:32,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

353
03:07:33,107 --> 03:07:34,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself as an aye.

354
03:07:36,668 --> 03:07:37,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

355
03:07:38,588 --> 03:07:42,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any other items to discuss this evening?

356
03:07:43,189 --> 03:07:47,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I just realized, do we not need to approve the minutes from the last meeting?

357
03:07:47,430 --> 03:07:48,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, let's do that.

358
03:07:49,770 --> 03:07:50,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I just closed the hearing though.

359
03:07:50,971 --> 03:07:54,412
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we, we can, what's that?

360
03:07:56,837 --> 03:07:57,817
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do it the next meeting.

361
03:07:57,897 --> 03:07:58,537
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not.

362
03:07:58,597 --> 03:07:59,618
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was just going to say.

363
03:07:59,938 --> 03:08:00,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we have to remember.

364
03:08:03,839 --> 03:08:07,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we ask our agent to please include that on the agenda for the next meeting?

365
03:08:08,580 --> 03:08:09,380
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be brilliant.

366
03:08:10,301 --> 03:08:10,661
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do.

367
03:08:13,321 --> 03:08:13,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I did read them.

368
03:08:14,962 --> 03:08:18,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So did I. Sent in little corrections.

369
03:08:19,143 --> 03:08:20,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the reminder, Eric.

370
03:08:20,983 --> 03:08:22,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I slipped my mind.

371
03:08:22,924 --> 03:08:23,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry.

372
03:08:23,817 --> 03:08:24,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of that sooner.

373
03:08:25,438 --> 03:08:26,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least you remembered.

374
03:08:26,478 --> 03:08:29,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and we have, we can do so within three hearings.

375
03:08:30,180 --> 03:08:30,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

376
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:32,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

377
03:08:32,561 --> 03:08:33,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

378
03:08:35,082 --> 03:08:36,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to check Dennis.

379
03:08:36,263 --> 03:08:38,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else we should discuss before we go?

380
03:08:38,764 --> 03:08:39,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

381
03:08:39,365 --> 03:08:39,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for right now.

382
03:08:40,185 --> 03:08:40,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're good.

383
03:08:40,885 --> 03:08:41,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

384
03:08:41,125 --> 03:08:44,667
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just having some issues with other meetings trying to use zoom and it's been a thing.

385
03:08:44,847 --> 03:08:47,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but I'll let you know.

386
03:08:47,449 --> 03:08:48,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send you an email tomorrow.

387
03:08:48,389 --> 03:08:50,370
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything comes in for our next meeting.

388
03:08:51,057 --> 03:08:52,118
[SPEAKER_08]: How about I do that, just to.

389
03:08:52,338 --> 03:08:54,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And the date of that, just remind me.

390
03:08:55,060 --> 03:08:58,102
[SPEAKER_05]: The potential one would be the 21st of this month.

391
03:08:58,222 --> 03:09:01,764
[SPEAKER_05]: But if people are not around, then it would be January 7th.

392
03:09:02,404 --> 03:09:03,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you very much.

393
03:09:04,506 --> 03:09:04,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

394
03:09:05,606 --> 03:09:05,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

395
03:09:05,926 --> 03:09:06,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.
