00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:31,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Medford Happenings, a show far and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:45,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:50,511
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, I want to welcome a special guest, Tricia Schiappelli,

5
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:55,288
[SPEAKER_01]: who is a candidate for our Medford City Council.

6
00:00:56,349 --> 00:01:00,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanna really thank you, Tricia, for joining us today.

7
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:02,755
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been on the show before.

8
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:07,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also wanna thank you for running for City Council.

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,842
[SPEAKER_00]: You may owe me one for that.

11
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:11,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we appreciate it.

12
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:12,364
[SPEAKER_00]: We really do.

13
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:15,446
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you so much for having me back.

14
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:17,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I always enjoy the show, and I'm happy to be here.

15
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,510
[SPEAKER_00]: We enjoy having you here.

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,792
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to get right into the questions like we always do.

17
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:28,977
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start by just giving our audience some background information about yourself.

18
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's Tricia Ciappelli?

19
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:43,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I originally moved to Massachusetts in 1998 to complete my MBA at Simmons University in their Graduate School of Management.

20
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:47,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I graduated in 2001.

21
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:50,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 20 plus years experience as a commercial lender.

22
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,030
[SPEAKER_00]: in the banking industry.

23
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:59,652
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with CEOs and CFOs of companies with revenues in the size of $10 million to $60 million.

24
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:07,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I help them acquire debt, refinance existing debt, purchase their real estate, whatever they may need.

25
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:17,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I also help them with their cash cycles in their business so that they can get paid faster, hang on to their money a little bit longer, and then make their payments in a faster, more secure environment.

26
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:20,576
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am currently a Medford resident.

27
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:23,237
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved here in 2009.

28
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:27,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived at Station Landing first for just a little over four years.

29
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:33,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really loved that development with the access to the T and just being so close to so many things.

30
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:36,900
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2013, I actually bought my home.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually enjoy the house.

32
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:42,641
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Victorian.

33
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Method's a good place to live.

34
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:51,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also, some good qualifications I want to point out to run for city council.

35
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:52,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

36
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:53,530
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good stuff.

37
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:53,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

38
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:55,211
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

39
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:02,281
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, can you give us a few reasons why you're running for a seat on the city council?

40
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:08,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe throw in a few concerns you might have, like why you're running and what would your concerns be?

41
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:09,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.

42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,476
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am running for city council because, first of all, I live in the city.

43
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:23,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it has a tremendous amount of potential and opportunity given its proximity to Boston, Cambridge, and access to the 93.

44
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:28,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I believe it's my opinion that it's being horribly mismanaged.

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:36,750
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that if elected to the city council, I would really want to change and improve

46
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:43,057
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, the first debacle I became involved in was the methadone dispensary.

47
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:46,962
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my wake up moment if you will.

48
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:53,890
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to your point what are my concerns, I have a very long list of concerns to be

49
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:56,833
[SPEAKER_00]: honest.

50
00:03:57,133 --> 00:04:08,039
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one is my concern is if we stay on this trajectory and we don't have some drastic changes sooner rather than later, that we may hit a point where there's a point of no return.

51
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:15,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that we are in a current downward spiral and we need to correct that as soon as possible.

52
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:17,364
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be a heavy lift.

53
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:27,450
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely, given the current circumstances and the six years of the current administration and city council, who in my opinion have really done nothing except raise our taxes.

54
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:34,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they must think we're all blind and that because we can't see that nothing is being done in the city.

55
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:39,979
[SPEAKER_00]: With our tax money, our roads and sidewalks and water are still not fixed.

56
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,260
[SPEAKER_00]: in desperate need of repair.

57
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:53,048
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they have managed to throw the city into a complete chaos with this radical rezoning that they pulled out of thin air and decided to thrust onto the community.

58
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Good concerns.

59
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I think a lot of people agree with you.

60
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:01,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I really do.

61
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a lot of people agree with you on that.

62
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:11,134
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Trish, can you give us some solutions for the concerns you brought up?

63
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:12,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

64
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:17,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to start at the top with the mayor, which I think is where the buck stops.

65
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:21,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And while she is running unopposed, which I find shocking to say the least,

66
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:32,587
[SPEAKER_00]: If she has any interest in saving her reputation and her legacy as the mayor of Medford, I believe she needs to do three very difficult things immediately.

67
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:39,830
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is she needs to deny the city council their request for additional funds for the zoning studies.

68
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,690
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is she needs to fire consulting.

69
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,755
[SPEAKER_00]: They are lacking in experience for the project of this size and the location.

70
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:53,239
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not the right decision for the project in the beginning.

71
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,425
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest project they have done is out in a smaller town past 128.

72
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:16,729
[SPEAKER_00]: And an example of why I think they really need to be fired and we shouldn't be giving them any more money is at a recent presentation at city council when questioned about some of the streets in the homes that were going to be changed with this zoning, they admitted that they hadn't driven

73
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:30,653
[SPEAKER_00]: by the actual addresses or walked through any of the neighborhoods to really understand the lot size and the types of houses their planning is going to affect with this radical rezoning, but rather they chose to rely on Google Maps.

74
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:32,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously?

75
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:34,874
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're paying for?

76
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was really kind of shocked by that.

77
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:53,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third thing, the mayor absolutely needs to immediately, because it is so long overdue, I believe, in my opinion, she needs to fire Alicia Hunt immediately today for her pandering to developers.

78
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:57,901
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really inconscionable and that's just a period, full stop.

79
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:03,086
[SPEAKER_00]: So once those three things have been done on the city side to really help

80
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:07,208
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect and make some changes that we can all live with.

81
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,010
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a chance to resume herself with the city of Medford.

82
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:26,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing that needs to happen is it falls to the actual citizens in the city, the good people that live here, the people that vote, the people that want to help and do their part in saving the city and their respective neighborhoods.

83
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is really very simple.

84
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:39,284
[SPEAKER_00]: The voters need to vote out every single Our Revolution city councilor, full stop, period.

85
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to repeat that, and they may need to write it down.

86
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:56,550
[SPEAKER_00]: The voters need to vote out every single Our Revolution city councilor if they want to take back their city and have a decent city with neighborhoods that they can live in and enjoy and have a say in.

87
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Full stop, no questions.

88
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,422
[SPEAKER_00]: So who do they vote for?

89
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:14,754
[SPEAKER_00]: The voters then need to pick independent candidates who will listen to them and put Medford first, not be all involved in a national agenda and with things that aren't even pertaining to us.

90
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:20,358
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be careful because not all of those saying that they're independents are true independents.

91
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,267
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple are questionable because they really don't want to take a hard line.

92
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:28,650
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an election about a hard line.

93
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,097
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a position, you pick a hill, you live and die on it.

94
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,480
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this city needs.

95
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:44,287
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of my favorite sayings is the definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and expecting different results.

96
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:49,991
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been doing the same thing over for six years and expecting different results, and we have not gotten any.

97
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,473
[SPEAKER_00]: So once there is a turnover,

98
00:08:52,933 --> 00:09:01,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can roll up our sleeves and really the hard work can begin and we must review rezoning and decide what gets changed.

99
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:08,383
[SPEAKER_00]: We must demand a forensic audit and demand 21st century standards for how we are reporting our finances.

100
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:15,931
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we show the taxpayers of this city exactly where their taxpayer dollars are being spent.

101
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:21,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, accountable and transparent with this administration is really just a word salad.

102
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:23,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at our budget.

103
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,540
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of three lines.

104
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:28,805
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of revenue, expenses, deficit or surplus.

105
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,005
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.

106
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:30,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

107
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:30,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

108
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:36,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual reports are really not much better and don't provide a lot of additional information.

109
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:46,673
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually reached out to our CPA audit firm in Woburn and more than once and crickets, of course.

110
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:55,762
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we need to really work together and partner with each department in the city and hold people accountable for the people's tax dollars.

111
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:58,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And that isn't as difficult as it sounds.

112
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:04,150
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand where surplus and deficits are coming from so that we can stop the gaps.

113
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we just continue to rob Peter to pay Paul.

114
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,016
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fix our roads desperately.

115
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,097
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fix our sidewalks.

116
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:16,518
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the lead out of our water system.

117
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:19,159
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fix our schools.

118
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,980
[SPEAKER_00]: The scores are abhorrent.

119
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:27,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I would like to see an ethics guideline added in there for city councilors.

120
00:10:27,763 --> 00:10:28,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

121
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:35,211
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's important so that we're all playing by the same rules no matter what position you're in.

122
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:36,312
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to me.

123
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:44,821
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the people of Medford need to know that every Tuesday night there will be a city council meeting that is consistency is the key.

124
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:50,046
[SPEAKER_00]: They can come home, turn on their TV or log in online and we will be there in chamber

125
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:57,089
[SPEAKER_00]: every Tuesday night to discuss and update them on all of the items that we are in the process of working through.

126
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:07,313
[SPEAKER_00]: These marathon meetings until midnight or later, because they only meet every other week because that is what is convenient for them, really isn't working.

127
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:10,955
[SPEAKER_00]: The citizens of this city have jobs, they have kids, they have a life to live.

128
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:15,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it will get rid of all these side meetings behind closed doors, I believe.

129
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:39,961
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go to meetings every week, the citizens of this city will have the right to hear the facts and the figures and hear the presentation of the pros and cons between their city council members and better understand the concepts of how it will affect them as we move through the discussion of the facts and the figures and research prior to an item being moved to a vote so that they will feel a little more comfortable

130
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,662
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully with the decisions being made.

131
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:49,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we would still always have open comments and they would have the right to ask questions and maybe we could delve through it a little bit better.

132
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:58,469
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really feel like they've been kept out of the loop and no one has the time and the wherewithal to go look everything up and read through 16 pages.

133
00:11:58,529 --> 00:11:59,170
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our job.

134
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to boil it down and give it to the citizens of Medford so that they can understand what's going on as is their right.

135
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:06,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

136
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the citizens deserve that, too.

137
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:09,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

138
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:12,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of talk about zoning and method.

139
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:20,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think voters were misled when promised affordable housing through zoning changes?

140
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:22,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we might as well.

141
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,359
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your position on zoning?

142
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:35,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I think that, yes, they were misled, but I think that my position on zoning is that we absolutely must improve our city.

143
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:41,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as you drive around, it has the potential to be a beautiful city, but right now it looks tired and dirty.

144
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:50,782
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be thoughtful about any zoning that we do and look at the zoning as a total number and how it's going to be affected with the city with

145
00:12:51,762 --> 00:13:01,747
[SPEAKER_00]: our resources such as zoning and sewer and things like that, we already had the DPW leader come in and say, you have to give me a number, you have to give me a number.

146
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,389
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't give them a number, they're just adding, throwing people at it.

147
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:13,172
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point we're going to end up like other cities were with brownouts and sewage running down your streets, sewage backup during horrible storms.

148
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:18,076
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually think that the city of Medford is at a crossroads right now.

149
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:29,545
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the luxury to design a thoughtful city where people want to live and one that will drive visitors from contiguous cities to come here and spend dollars and enjoy some time.

150
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:35,190
[SPEAKER_00]: The zoning decisions that we make now will define us as a city going forward for many, many years.

151
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will either be like Somerville, where so many people say, oh, gosh, I lived there.

152
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:40,914
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be great.

153
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:41,835
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't anymore.

154
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:42,696
[SPEAKER_00]: You're jam-packed.

155
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:43,457
[SPEAKER_00]: It's miserable.

156
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,378
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to live in Somerville.

157
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:47,418
[SPEAKER_00]: People are starting to move out of Cambridge.

158
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:57,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we choose to be smart and manage growth responsibly, where we can keep green spaces, have homes available for people through every season of their life and what they need.

159
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:03,685
[SPEAKER_00]: And in which case, we would be more like Belmont, Winchester, possibly even Melrose.

160
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:11,388
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see us take that direction and have smart growth, not just throw in density.

161
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:22,882
[SPEAKER_00]: But to even imply, as our revolution city councilor Matt Leming did, that gone are the days of a single family house,

162
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,788
[SPEAKER_00]: is really just ludicrous.

163
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:34,012
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people will always have a need for a single family home and want to choose that as their option of a place to live.

164
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:41,455
[SPEAKER_00]: They suffer from the delusion that all growth is good growth, and as we know in business and finance, that isn't necessarily the case.

165
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:51,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth that is too fast actually drives up costs and takes a toll on the existing situation and the existing assets, and you can actually put

166
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:58,262
[SPEAKER_00]: the company, or in this case the city, in a deficit position if not monitored and managed appropriately.

167
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,163
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen firsthand.

168
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:11,107
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting legal fact that I've done some research, I've talked to a couple of attorneys in preparing for this, and zoning laws are in place to protect the property owners

169
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:19,273
[SPEAKER_00]: not for the city to use and change as they see fit in a desperate cry for additional tax dollars.

170
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:31,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoning laws initially were established so that you can buy property and not worry that one day you will wake up to a 10-story building next door to your house or a factory.

171
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:45,237
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, zoning ordinances have a valid legal interest in protecting the character of the neighborhood, not destroying the character of the neighborhood.

172
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:49,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gets back to the taking of land that we had had a conversation about a while ago.

173
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:54,244
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a home, you are entitled to certain rights.

174
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:59,169
[SPEAKER_00]: And that right is that you have a say in the neighborhood that you live in.

175
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And the laws are very clear.

176
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:16,965
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are actually two Supreme Court cases, one in 1926 and one in 1928, that actually involved Cambridge, where a zoning ordinance had depleted the plaintiff's property value, and the Supreme Court overturned it.

177
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:30,961
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel if we continue down this road and things get as bad as some projections think that they could be with what they want to do, there is going to be a plethora of lawsuits.

178
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:31,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So get ready.

179
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:36,857
[SPEAKER_00]: So Medford is just really just waking up to the truth about what is going on in the city.

180
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:50,263
[SPEAKER_00]: And my concern right now is for West Medford because I'm worried that they will now get lulled into a false sense of security with the zoning being delayed to March 2026 only to one day wake up and realize

181
00:16:51,223 --> 00:17:03,650
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the ugly scenario that Salem Street is in and the reality, and that is that our sneaky Our Revolution City Councilor Matt Leming in the dead of the night around 11 p.m.

182
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:19,900
[SPEAKER_00]: after the Community Development Board had agreed to the request of the homeowners and we had a completely different neighborhood negotiated, Councilor Matt Leming reversed the request to the original zoning and all six of Our Revolution Councilors voted for it.

183
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't be fooled, West Medford.

184
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:29,603
[SPEAKER_00]: If reelected, this city council will do the same thing to you.

185
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:34,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it happen.

186
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:36,464
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another saying I like to say.

187
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:39,345
[SPEAKER_00]: People show you who they are and you better believe them.

188
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:42,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've shown me on several occasions.

189
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:45,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Radical rezoning must stop, period.

190
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,164
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great, not a good answer, that was a great answer.

191
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:51,545
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the truth.

192
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:52,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

193
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,026
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the truth.

194
00:17:53,046 --> 00:18:00,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many things that people in the city don't know, and I think unless you live in the Salem Street corridor, you really don't understand what happened to us.

195
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:01,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people have to go back.

196
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:02,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And how egregious it was.

197
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:06,500
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to go back and know what zoning was designed to do.

198
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,303
[SPEAKER_01]: It was designed to protect the property owners.

199
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:09,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

200
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:11,889
[SPEAKER_01]: for the city council.

201
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,750
[SPEAKER_00]: And those cases, to this day, have never been overturned.

202
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,610
[SPEAKER_01]: They never will be.

203
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they be?

204
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Great answer, Tricia.

205
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:23,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's get on.

206
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:33,955
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you approach getting economic growth started and, you know, growing Medford's tax base?

207
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,965
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would focus on making the city more business-friendly.

208
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,627
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear we're not really that friendly to businesses.

209
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:57,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would make a target list of companies that our city and residents would like to have in Medford and companies that maybe are not available to the contiguous cities that we have that would then drive visitors to our city to see certain things and then

210
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:02,230
[SPEAKER_00]: increase bottom line we need to increase our commercial tax base.

211
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:13,276
[SPEAKER_00]: The homeowners really just can't continue to take the hit for that because our administration doesn't know how to attract or negotiate with certain

212
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:30,327
[SPEAKER_00]: certain entities and I feel like you know the Budweiser campus is a perfect example of something that took place and we should have been working with the owners of that and I feel like some of the leadership could have gone there and said thank you so much for you know

213
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:45,989
[SPEAKER_00]: being here all these years and leasing and I understand Budweiser has had to move out because of their, but what can you do to help us and we understand that it's around price and you could even cut a side deal with them.

214
00:19:47,170 --> 00:20:00,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now we're losing 600,000, but if you said to them, listen, I understand price is important, but if somebody comes in with a million three and they're a few hundred thousand dollars short, let's go with the lesser and we'll pay you back 200,000 a year.

215
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:18,096
[SPEAKER_00]: year for three or four years to make up that difference in that sale price, and we're still $400,000 or $500,000 ahead in tax revenue, versus just giving it to the MBTA and then saying, oh, you know, we're losing, we're at a deficit for $600,000 a year.

216
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that are done all the time.

217
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:20,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they are.

218
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:23,757
[SPEAKER_01]: And I call it they've lost the odd of negotiation.

219
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:24,437
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I call it.

220
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that is definitely something I would have advised one of my clients to do.

221
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:28,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

222
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:28,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

223
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:29,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that.

224
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:31,299
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want that building, don't let it go.

225
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:32,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in and try to negotiate.

226
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,501
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the worst they're going to say is absolutely not.

227
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:34,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

228
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:35,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

229
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,062
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're back to square one, but at least you try.

230
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:45,505
[SPEAKER_00]: At least you can say to the good people of Medford, I tried to save us $400,000 to $600,000 in tax revenue, and here's what I did, and they refused to do it.

231
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:46,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks a lot better.

232
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Good people of Medford hear you loud and clear.

233
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:49,787
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

234
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:51,388
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move on.

235
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to ask this question.

236
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:56,630
[SPEAKER_01]: This came out of nowhere, but what's your opinion

237
00:20:57,785 --> 00:21:07,091
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, on the Method City Council, they're looking to divest from certain, you know, business entities.

238
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:07,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

239
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:07,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

240
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:10,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat through that whole torture show the other night.

241
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:11,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was, yeah.

242
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:12,294
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a torture show.

243
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was laughable and a complete waste of time.

244
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:19,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Four hours of nonsense and four hours of my life that I'll never get back.

245
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:24,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And they insist on focusing their attention and prioritizing things that are not local and

246
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:28,726
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are happening thousands of miles away.

247
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:42,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could see if everything was glorious here in Medford, and our roads were fixed, and our sidewalks were perfect, and the birds were humming, and everything was beautiful, and our parkways were perfectly planted, not with weeds and overgrowth.

248
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:46,524
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they did it for a reason.

249
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:48,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a strategy behind it.

250
00:21:48,546 --> 00:22:00,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was a much-needed diversion for them so that people can focus on something other than their inept management of the city and their failure at the rezoning, given what's been transpiring.

251
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:20,982
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they've already confirmed, like three and a half hours into the meeting, I believe it was, they said, oh, well, by the way, we already knew from the investment company they had let us know that we really didn't have an exorbitant amount of percentage that is out of our guideline in those companies anyway.

252
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:22,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.

253
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:23,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding me?

254
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,163
[SPEAKER_00]: They wasted all that time.

255
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:27,823
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have just changed the agenda.

256
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:31,905
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have made the announcement and said we wanted to save everyone's time.

257
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:33,785
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, they didn't.

258
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:39,786
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I thought was fascinating is that they actually allowed people from other cities, Malden and Somerville, to come up.

259
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,647
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of that before or seen that.

260
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:45,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really, in my opinion, shouldn't be allowed.

261
00:22:46,128 --> 00:23:08,986
[SPEAKER_00]: My greater concern at the end of that whole debacle is for our large Jewish population who just a few weeks ago spoke at a city council meeting and tried to impress on them and explain to them that they feel scared in Medford and they're uncomfortable in Medford with the things that are happening and the anti-Semitism that's going on.

262
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:15,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made it perfectly clear at that meeting, their message was received loud and clear, they just

263
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:16,472
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care.

264
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, obviously.

265
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:20,718
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad to say, but that's the message.

266
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:23,301
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

267
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:31,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're on a roll, let's look into another question.

268
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:49,367
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you think Council President Bears, he had a video response prior to the meeting, you know, to the meeting on the mayor's request to slow down zoning changes.

269
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,167
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you get from that?

270
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:55,668
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you, I mean, what do you think about it?

271
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:58,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I thought it, I thought it was odd.

272
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:04,884
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, coming from him because he's been, you know, so rah-rah zoning.

273
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:20,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought, yeah, you know, that's actually a pretty good stunt to pass the blame on to the mayor because that's really kind of the overarching theme that I picked up.

274
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:28,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know, the truth is the city council really has had full control of this whole process all along.

275
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:36,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is it incumbent upon the mayor to maybe have frequent check-ins, weekly, quarterly reports?

276
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:37,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that done?

277
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:38,509
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

278
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:46,435
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly when they had an opportunity to listen to the residents and do the right thing, they didn't.

279
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:52,570
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think is more interesting is that they don't seem to be able to have a mea culpa moment.

280
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,671
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're right.

281
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:54,491
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sorry.

282
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:55,491
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't have done this.

283
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,552
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have listened to the residents.

284
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:02,873
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, an apology, in my opinion, is owed to the Salem Street residents.

285
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:10,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what's really more interesting is that it doesn't appear that he actually crafted that whole message himself.

286
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:26,841
[SPEAKER_00]: As I found out later, the speech that he gave was verbatim to a memo that the mayor had written herself to the city councilors with regard to her thoughts on the zoning a day or two earlier.

287
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:32,603
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, her memo is actually posted out on the web, and anyone can view it and confirm this fact.

288
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:35,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's public information, so it isn't like I'm not.

289
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:39,446
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's just a waste of time, and not to mention another meeting violation.

290
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:40,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hear you.

291
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:41,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

292
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:41,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

293
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:42,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

294
00:25:42,828 --> 00:25:43,189
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

295
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:47,052
[SPEAKER_01]: As we move on, you know, another important thing.

296
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:52,076
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you improve the management of city finances?

297
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,458
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see needing to be done there?

298
00:25:55,132 --> 00:26:00,056
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing short of a complete forensic audit for at least the past three years would suffice for me.

299
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:08,483
[SPEAKER_00]: A new city council would never want to take over the funds and the books without having an accurate financial picture of where they currently are.

300
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:11,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it is true, we are already audited.

301
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:14,168
[SPEAKER_00]: It is someone that is state approved.

302
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:16,510
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somebody that we've used for 15 years.

303
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,433
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often find vendors, when you have them come in

304
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:24,614
[SPEAKER_00]: for assignments such as this, in that length of time, they tend to become complacent.

305
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:26,875
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, dollars in, dollars out.

306
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:27,895
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you want.

307
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:33,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I don't know if maybe that's because our side doesn't ask for more.

308
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:34,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in those meetings.

309
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:34,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

310
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:42,305
[SPEAKER_00]: A fresh set of eyes with some new ideas to help us clean things up would be terrific and money well spent, I believe.

311
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:53,198
[SPEAKER_00]: I also hope that an RFP would get us a larger accounting firm that specializes in forensic accounting and can give us some financial guidance and benchmarks to reach for the years as we grow.

312
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:54,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

313
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:55,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.

314
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,363
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing on that.

315
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:14,349
[SPEAKER_00]: So with regard to that and anything else that takes place, I think one of the things I would like to do is also I like the idea of putting advisory boards together with industry experts for certain tasks that can give us guidance in their respective areas.

316
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses do it all the time.

317
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,672
[SPEAKER_00]: There are CEO forums that certain CEOs join

318
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:23,693
[SPEAKER_00]: to help solve problems that they experience with other CEOs.

319
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:29,954
[SPEAKER_00]: And it isn't uncommon when businesses are in a huge growth pattern, they put advisory boards together.

320
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:31,574
[SPEAKER_00]: And it isn't something that you do every week.

321
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:32,695
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't be at every meeting.

322
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:42,257
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have a problem, and certainly something with planning, you would pull some really big, big, big developers in, like Suffolk and CTA Construction.

323
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:43,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know those guys.

324
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:46,318
[SPEAKER_00]: You come in and you go, hey, are we doing this right?

325
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:47,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we looking at this right?

326
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:48,239
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you recommend?

327
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:55,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you have two of them, you're going to get one maybe that has a different idea than the other one, right?

328
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:56,623
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can choose.

329
00:27:56,943 --> 00:28:04,086
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just feel like even for finances and certain things, you need to be putting those things together to give the best city their biggest bang for their buck.

330
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:09,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're doing basically is you're having experts experience.

331
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:09,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

332
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's missing.

333
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:11,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's great.

334
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:13,110
[SPEAKER_01]: You have experts.

335
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,271
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I know, but you really, you have to be smart enough to know what you don't know, right?

336
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:17,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

337
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:18,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

338
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:18,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

339
00:28:19,071 --> 00:28:19,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.

340
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:36,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, one of my things, uh, that I always think about, you know, what, what would you consider, uh, would you consider updating the city's financing and accounting procedures?

341
00:28:37,457 --> 00:28:40,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I don't know what they're currently using now.

342
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know what the finished product looks like.

343
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:45,204
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say absolutely.

344
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:49,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And a new audit team would be a part of that.

345
00:28:50,009 --> 00:29:01,700
[SPEAKER_00]: They would probably, you know, I would look to someone that deals strictly with municipalities and they would probably be able to make some recommendations and then we would have them come in and we would, you know,

346
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:09,163
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out which software is the best for us, given our size and maybe the growth that we're anticipating over the next 10 years.

347
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:22,588
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, maybe pick the top two or three, and we would take it from there with an RFP and definitely update in, you know, software tailored for municipalities.

348
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:29,090
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to work closer with the part and partner with each of the departments to better understand their needs and help them accurately budget.

349
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,531
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as monitor the process through the year, right?

350
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:35,371
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what do you need?

351
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:36,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you need it?

352
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:39,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an honest conversation around that.

353
00:29:39,092 --> 00:29:40,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get them what they need.

354
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,433
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the first couple years may be a little dicey.

355
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:54,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may run into deficit and you may need to put a line item that you lent money from this department over to this department and then you pay it back at the end of the year or you look at did you really need that money in the first place.

356
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:57,518
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of balance things out as you go along.

357
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:07,450
[SPEAKER_00]: But within two years, you should be able to have a good handle on what your projections for that year are and not be as in an upheaval as what I think we are.

358
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,815
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's also important that there's a proper expense approval put into place.

359
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:34,745
[SPEAKER_00]: with regard to credit cards and with regard to what they're spent on, and regard to dollar limits and who has that dollar limit, you know, so maybe the person that is the manager of that department can approve, and I'm just making this up, up to $1,000, anything over $1,000, it has to go somewhere else, and then once you get into $5,000, it has to go to a third person.

360
00:30:34,785 --> 00:30:37,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody is on board with that money being spent.

361
00:30:38,427 --> 00:30:40,147
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand why it's being spent.

362
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:43,968
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand if there is a need right now that it has to be spent, or could it wait.

363
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:50,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the citizens are owed the financial reporting that shows them exactly how their tax dollars are being spent and where.

364
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:56,110
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, who approved these expenses that they don't like, right?

365
00:30:56,431 --> 00:30:57,711
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have a conversation around that.

366
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,051
[SPEAKER_01]: The President Exactly.

367
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

368
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:03,632
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your opinion?

369
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:10,856
[SPEAKER_01]: seven and a half million dollars in overrides in their passage.

370
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:12,119
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your opinion on that?

371
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,763
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?

372
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:20,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the passage of the override is disgraceful.

373
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:36,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that as we all know, the votes, and you had someone else on here that can speak to this, but the votes were counted behind closed doors and in an election office where you could peek through a window if you were lucky and not even that.

374
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:42,345
[SPEAKER_00]: with our revolution city councilor Matt Leming holding guard outside.

375
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:45,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know people who tried to go inside and were not allowed.

376
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:48,028
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing is suspect and very shady.

377
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:55,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know from talking to many people in the city, I can count on my two hands the number of people who actually voted for it.

378
00:31:57,452 --> 00:32:03,315
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's so sad is they, again, were lied to by this Our Revolution city councilor.

379
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:10,278
[SPEAKER_00]: They built this big program that you could go in and you could log in your house value and blah, blah, blah.

380
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept trying to tell people that calculator is not accurate.

381
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:16,221
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not going to be $45 a month.

382
00:32:18,082 --> 00:32:30,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I will guarantee you that because they haven't taken into, nor can they, the new assessments that are going to hit in January before that tax override is added on top of the assessment.

383
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:36,423
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for whatever reason, I think some people got that.

384
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:37,503
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.

385
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:45,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I was talking to someone else and she said I was out there talking to a woman and she thought that 7.5% override was for the high school.

386
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:52,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I think there's just really this misinformation out there that people really don't understand or know.

387
00:32:53,488 --> 00:33:01,774
[SPEAKER_00]: what that seven and a half percent was, and I think they understand now, as they've gotten their tax bill, that the calculators weren't right.

388
00:33:01,794 --> 00:33:03,596
[SPEAKER_01]: They certainly do understand.

389
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:04,817
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand that.

390
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,157
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah.

391
00:33:05,577 --> 00:33:06,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway.

392
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:09,600
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about that, yeah.

393
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:21,669
[SPEAKER_00]: And so based on some of the things that we've seen posted recently in our politics page, I understand the Department of Justice is actually investigating the whole state of Massachusetts with voter information.

394
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:22,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are.

395
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:28,741
[SPEAKER_00]: After we have a handle on our finance and we understand where we truly are, I'd like to overturn the override in some fashion.

396
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:36,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually working on that and thinking about several different things and trying to figure out if there's a legal way to do that.

397
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:37,865
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what do we do?

398
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,827
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the easiest to do for the people?

399
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:43,468
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, more to come on that.

400
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:47,750
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a great answer.

401
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,091
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about some pretty serious stuff tonight.

402
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:51,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

403
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,372
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we really did.

404
00:33:52,392 --> 00:33:53,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm exhausted.

405
00:33:55,553 --> 00:33:57,715
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into some good stuff.

406
00:33:58,355 --> 00:33:59,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.

407
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.

408
00:34:01,016 --> 00:34:04,578
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's let's do one that's I guess it's it's easier.

409
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:06,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask this for everybody.

410
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,980
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, as we're coming to a close.

411
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you least?

412
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:16,138
[SPEAKER_01]: and most favorite things for you to do in Medford.

413
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:18,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a fun question.

414
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:19,398
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.

415
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:28,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So my least favorite thing to do in Medford is drive around and hit potholes all the time with my car.

416
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:32,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And then deal with the bike lane.

417
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:34,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to end up with a hood ornament someday.

418
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:38,068
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was ever anybody in there, I would probably have them as a hood ornament.

419
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:40,210
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's never anyone in there, thankfully.

420
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,111
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like.

421
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:47,732
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's in them, they're a pain in the neck, and all they do is make traffic worse that's already bad.

422
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:55,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another genius idea by the administration to just put bike lanes in regardless of whether the people want them.

423
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,674
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing is I love our library.

424
00:34:57,714 --> 00:35:00,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to the library and perusing some books.

425
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:01,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I check out books there.

426
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy just spending a few quiet hours there.

427
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:12,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is very helpful and super nice, and it's just an enjoyable time when I get to go there.

428
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:21,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you on the driving, and I especially agree with you on the library, because it is incredible what's available.

429
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:24,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have some nice events there as well.

430
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they have great events, and I don't think enough people in the city

431
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,015
[SPEAKER_01]: know what's going on up there, take advantage of it.

432
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:33,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we had them on the show.

433
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:34,796
[SPEAKER_01]: We plan on having them again.

434
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:35,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great.

435
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:36,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it's great to promote them.

436
00:35:36,937 --> 00:35:37,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

437
00:35:37,398 --> 00:35:38,878
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a gem in Method.

438
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:39,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

439
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:40,719
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

440
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people are great.

441
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:44,782
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something.

442
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:45,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy it up there, too.

443
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is the very last question.

444
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most important question.

445
00:35:55,186 --> 00:36:00,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone wants to get in touch with Tricia Schiapelli.

446
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:01,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

447
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:14,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if they haven't heard enough already and they want more opinions from me, they can e-mail me at Trish for Medford at gmail.com.

448
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:20,131
[SPEAKER_00]: So Trish, T-R-I-S-H, the number for Medford at gmail.com.

449
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:21,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Or text me.

[SPEAKER_00]: I have a phone number set up specifically for this at 617-620-7845.

452
00:36:36,183 --> 00:36:37,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Tricia.

453
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:38,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.

[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed it.

[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is that time again, so I want to really thank Tricia Schiappelli for joining us on Method Happenings.

456
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:57,793

457
00:36:58,113 --> 00:36:59,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's great.

[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting a lot of positives.
