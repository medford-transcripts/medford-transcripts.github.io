    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2712.165s">Yes,</a>  my name is Mark Rumley, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2714.927s">I'm</a>  city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2715.907s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2719.849s">The</a>  paper which is before you, 16-020, is one which would change the city solicitor's term from one year to a two year term which would run concurrently with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2731.235s">That's</a>  the purpose of that particular suggestion and amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2736.628s">And</a>  could I make a comment about the papers, the questions that are referred out? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2740.729s">I</a>  believe that I explained as to the positions which are on the council agenda tonight, those resolutions that pertain to the proposed amendments and the creation of a new position tonight, that at least in terms of those salaries, I did explain on those positions what the salaries have been, were, and what the changes were. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2761.864s">I</a>  just want to save the answer to a question, if it's not necessary, because I believe I was fairly clear in Committee of the Whole as to the positions before you tonight.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2959.35s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2960.451s">On</a>  paper 16-021, this is not an amendment to an existing ordinance, but rather the creation of a new ordinance which would provide for a chief of staff and policy to work in the executive office with the duties you've just described. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2978.884s">As</a>  I said in the committee of the whole meeting, Mayor Burke has indicated that chief of staff and her vision would be beneficial to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=2988.077s">And</a>  in order to implement that vision, this is a position that she puts forth to you as a positive recommendation in order for her to allow the executive branch to move forward in a fashion which is filled with discernment and filled in a way that a professional attitude and professional advice can be given to her by a chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3009.102s">Also,</a>  if I may, the one thing that a chief of staff can bring, because I've seen it in other people, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3015.61s">who</a>  have held this position even though it wasn't called it, is somebody who can sit down with the mayor when the door is closed and speak frankly and openly about municipal policy and difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3028.422s">That</a>  provision also applies to department heads who can come in and perhaps be just as free to speak with a chief of staff without having to wait to see the mayor whose calendar is always busy <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3040.997s">and</a>  to be able to speak to the chief of staff freely and openly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3044.679s">And</a>  all of that serves the purposes of good government.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3054.225s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3055.746s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3057.427s">I'm</a>  not necessarily against this new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3061.05s">I</a>  believe that, you know, maybe the $106,000 salary has to be looked at and just compared to other chiefs of staffs in our surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3071.372s">I</a>  think my major concern as one Councilor is a number of things that we've requested from the mayor herself with regards to seeing the big picture on the topic, on will this chief of staff need secretarial workers? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3088.081s">What</a>  else is coming down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3089.542s">We</a>  have four or five different amendments, changes, new positions that are before us tonight, but I think we all decided to table them because <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3098.651s">I'm</a>  hearing rumors of increases in salaries in other positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3102.113s">I'm</a>  hearing rumors of other new positions that are being brought on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3105.634s">And</a>  I want to make sure that it all fits within our budget that we have to come and meet on and discuss and review and approve come June. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3113.258s">So</a>  I do want to see the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3115.179s">Therefore,</a>  unless anybody in the public wants to talk, I will move to table this as well until hopefully we do get a bigger picture on everything that is going to be encompassed and hopefully our <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3128.185s">seven</a>  or eight requests will help us out in that matter and enlighten us of what is coming down the line within the next six months, the big turnover and change.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3138.268s">If</a>  I could add one thing to that, Mr. President, I heard the Councilor's concerns, the Vice President's concerns, both here and in the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3146.651s">I</a>  just would like to remind the Council and those who are hearing this resolution for the first time is that, budgetarily, the Chief of Staff position will have a zero impact on this fiscal year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3158.666s">because</a>  it is not a matter of adding dollars to this budget, but rather putting a person into this position at a classification that's already been funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3167.969s">But</a>  I just wanted to make that clear.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3170.13s">On</a>  that matter, though, you also said you're not sure if, if I made through the chair, you're not sure if this person's going to need one or two or three secretaries or if they're going to be using the mayor's four secretaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3180.394s">And</a>  so that is, that's an issue.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3183.215s">Well,</a>  I also, but I did say that I'm sure that the chief of staff, like any other, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3188.555s">department</a>  head, and I use that term synonymously, will have clerical assistance because you wouldn't expect anything less.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3197.862s">And</a>  that's my issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3199.403s">Will</a>  this assistance be from the four, I believe, four new people that are in the mayor's office now? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3204.747s">Will</a>  we need additional secretaries? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3207.029s">Because</a>  if you continue to add and increase salaries and add positions, that is going to have an impact on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3213.393s">So</a>  that's where I'm hoping we can get the full picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3216.075s">And</a>  whether that's another committee of the whole meeting or <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3218.71s">written</a>  answers, I definitely want to see what's coming down the line.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3225.773s">Motion</a>  to table is discussed in committee of the whole, Mr. President, until the questions are answered.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3229.635s">I</a>  think somebody would like to speak.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3243.293s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3245.014s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3245.415s">My</a>  name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3246.515s">I</a>  live at Zero Summit Road in Massachusetts, and I think we're in an area right now where we have a unique opportunity to really look at what our audiences are saying and where we can be going, because if we're going to relegate ourselves to changing audiences, maybe we should just look at the total picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3262.665s">The</a>  total picture revolves itself around to the victor goes to spoils, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3267.743s">But</a>  rather than change our municipal ordinance or any ordinance, maybe we ought to take advantage of what the law already allows for. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3275.546s">The</a>  new administration does have a unique opportunity to hire any individual he or she would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3281.768s">Massachusetts</a>  General Laws, Chapter 4, Section 7, Sixth A, allows for coterminous appointments that would exist to that of the mayor in this particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3294.763s">And</a>  what would happen there, that the individual who would be appointed would not be subject to any municipal ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3301.408s">They</a>  would just be subject to this particular law, which happens to be state statute, and every person that's in the mayor's office, which is an administrative appointment, would find itself in a co-terminus position as it relates to the term that the mayor sits in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3316.598s">If,</a>  in fact, a new mayor were to come in in the future, the person sitting in that position would then be reviewed <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3322.505s">at</a>  a subsequent time by the then new mayor for the purposes of whether they continue to be coterminous or whether in fact they are going to be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3331.587s">They</a>  would come under the same privileges of having a review to their job, their job application, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3337.768s">The</a>  second portion that you would have to look at is these individuals are serving at an at-will position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3345.165s">The</a>  mayor chooses individuals to work in that particular office, his or her office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3349.65s">And</a>  by looking at having that person sit in that particular office, you have to take into consideration the fact that are we putting people in there because of a municipal ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3360.302s">Are</a>  we putting people in there because it's going to be coterminous? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3362.704s">Are</a>  we putting those people in there because they're at will? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3365.928s">Now,</a>  if you look at all the state rules and laws and regulations as it relates to at-will contracts, you can have these made in such a way that you can fire them and hire them anytime they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3375.555s">They</a>  can leave anytime they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3376.856s">You</a>  can have an employment contract that basically relegates what their terms and duties are in this particular office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3382.801s">And</a>  to do that, that sets the tempo of making sure that you do have and you have hired the right person. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3388.865s">For</a>  example, you might hire somebody and the person just doesn't work out six, seven months down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3394.249s">Then</a>  what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3395.729s">If</a>  you stick with the municipal ordinance the way it is, you're not going to have the same luxury of either an at-will or a coterminous type of an individual, because that way the other review factor would be part and parcel of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3408.134s">Second</a>  of all, and more importantly, whether it's this position or any other position, you have to look at the conflict of interest issue that revolves around the people in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3417.997s">In</a>  this particular case, you already have one individual that's working in the office, I believe it was on or about January, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3425.547s">in</a>  January, early January, and this individual also happens to be on the, on the transition team. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3432.372s">Well,</a>  being on a transition team and also getting paid by the city of Medford for being an individual working in the mayor's office right now, I think presents itself, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3442.22s">And</a>  I asked the question, I begged the question, so to speak, is there a conflict of interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3446.604s">Because</a>  the impartiality of a transition team is supposed to bring the recommendations <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3450.89s">to</a>  the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3452.23s">But</a>  when you're getting paid by the administration, and you're also on this transition team, you're also, I think, if you look under the conflict of interest law, you're possibly looking or possibly indicating that there could be a conflict, there might be a conflict, or it could appear to be a conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3466.453s">And</a>  really, that's what you don't want right now, especially starting off with a brand new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3471.194s">So</a>  I would suggest to my colleagues, as you review this thing in your committee of the whole, that you <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3477.083s">look</a>  into this thing a little bit further, over and beyond changing a municipal ordinance or adding or subtracting to it, and look at the term that's allowed by state statute under the term of being either coterminous or at-will employees, because your responsibility back to the taxpayers is not the same as that of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3494.672s">If</a>  you appropriate money for those particular positions, the question then becomes, after that appropriation, you have absolutely no control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3502.536s">You'll</a>  have absolutely no control over that employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3505.093s">other</a>  than the chief executive officer making the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3508.295s">So</a>  if you want to ask the hard questions, this is the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3511.717s">But</a>  you do have options, and your options are either serve coterminously, number one, at will, number two, and more importantly, I think you really need to look at the conflict of interest that presently exists in the office, because I don't think it's right that someone who's on the transition team at the same time is getting paid well in excess of $90,000 to sit in the mayor's office at the present time and take on another job and duty and responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3533.608s">the</a>  same job and duty of responsibility that will come up in the next issue that's going to be presented before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3539.43s">I'll</a>  be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think you really need to look at this thing more in its totality as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3545.713s">And</a>  I really think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3548.174s">I</a>  think you need a listing of every single person, their job classification, who they're replacing, and more importantly, what's the difference in the salaries, because that's going to make a big difference as to why are we making these changes at all and for what reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3561.113s">And</a>  I think you deserve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3562.114s">And</a>  that's what transparency is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3564.215s">And</a>  you should not be afraid to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3566.316s">It's</a>  the taxpayer's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3568.257s">And</a>  it's your duty and responsibility, as it was mine when I was sitting on that side, to make sure that the money was accounted for properly and appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3576.181s">So</a>  that's it, if anyone wants to ask any questions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3836.636s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Luglocurrent to table, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3842.737s">On</a>  that motion.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3845.478s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3846.999s">It</a>  was brought up by Councilor Caraviello during a Committee of the Whole meeting that the position of procurement officer requires a special license. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3856.122s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3858.313s">Now,</a>  this new job title is Procurement Plus Budget Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3863.895s">And</a>  as Councilor Caraviello mentioned so eloquently inside the Committee of the Whole meeting, is that Louise Miller now has her license. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3871.337s">But</a>  what's to say the next person that's hired is going to have that procurement license or is brought in for budgeting and doesn't have a procurement license? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3881.96s">I</a>  just think the administration is tying their hands with putting both positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3887.112s">together.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3888.232s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3888.432s">Well,</a>  let's, let's go through, let's peel back a couple of the issues that you've just alluded to and ascribed to Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3894.774s">First,</a>  the idea of certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3896.914s">In</a>  fact, Louise Miller is properly certified to be a procurement officer, whether or not in the future, Mr. Or Mrs. Smith or Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3904.836s">Smith</a>  might apply for the position and not have that, that type of determination is going to have to wait to the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3912.118s">Secondly,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3912.934s">As</a>  far as tying hands go, if Louise Miller is also the budget officer here, she will report as the budget officer to the chief finance auditor and, excuse me, in the procurement to chief finance auditor and to the budget to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3929.459s">If</a>  the mayor at some time in the future decides that Louise Miller should not do both jobs, then she will surely have a discussion with Louise Miller and that will probably end in a way which will have her stop doing one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3941.548s">The</a>  point is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3943.99s">We</a>  can go forward into the future and look at different nuances, different combinations and say, what if this? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3949.896s">How</a>  about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3950.997s">This</a>  could happen, but what we are is in January of 2016 with a new mayor who's decided <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3958.386s">that</a>  this is the way she wants to proceed with her administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3961.788s">So</a>  while I, like everyone else, would like to have a crystal ball and to make sure that nothing goes awry in the future, what we have to do is to act on the basis of the facts as they exist now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3972.776s">I</a>  say this respectfully.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3976.979s">I</a>  take it respectfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3980.382s">My</a>  only issue is that when Louise Miller was originally hired, she was hired as <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3984.964s">the</a>  procurement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3987.166s">And</a>  then her description morphed into a number of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3992.069s">And</a>  I'm not, to be quite frank with you, I'm not opposed to any of the changes that is offered by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3998.093s">I</a>  think it's a long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4000.275s">I</a>  was hoping to see a constituent person, which was mentioned on many, many occasions, something that I feel is needed, in addition to a chief of staff, someone that will handle the constituent calls and be able to get back to people in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4014.397s">And</a>  I've yet to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4015.458s">But</a>  my only concern is that many of these positions have morphed into other positions over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4022.243s">And</a>  as we know, we used to have a director of personnel and a budget director that no longer exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4027.987s">Then</a>  we had someone that was a procurement officer that was doing the duties, because as far as I know, Louise was still signing off on the paperwork and also was budget director and I believe at some point was personnel director. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4042.497s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4043.137s">For</a>  a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4044.465s">That</a>  position morphed into three what I would consider department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4048.449s">So</a>  I only bring up that issue because I would hate to create a city ordinance and then in six months from now, a year, two years, whatever it might be, be unable to find a person that suits the procurement requirements, which is certification, and also the budgeting requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4068.163s">And</a>  that may be a special person that is unique to Louise and not unique to a lot of people out there in that profession.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4076.73s">I</a>  understand your sentiments, Councilor, but I would also say, and I'm probably preaching to the choir on this, ordinances like other enactments, other regulatory schemes are always in a state of flux. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4087.158s">They</a>  reflect the needs and the desires of the government at that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4091.581s">So</a>  if there are needs that are unforeseen right now in the future, I'm sure that this Council in its wisdom <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4097.102s">and</a>  the mayor in her wisdom will take appropriate action to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4100.463s">I'm</a>  not saying that to be a funny guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4102.304s">What</a>  I'm saying is that this is not necessarily the end of proposals from this administration, certainly not the first night. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4110.427s">And</a>  so when you talk about the need for this officer or that officer, no one should draw the inference that these amendments and proposed amendments tonight or new ordinances is the end of the universe as far as proposals from this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4125.9s">I</a>  don't know what they are because I'm not the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4128.321s">But</a>  I do know that ordinances are always, and views of government, are always fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4134.102s">They're</a>  always in a state of flux. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4136.063s">So</a>  I understand your sentiments.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4137.783s">I</a>  don't think anyone's saying that this is the end and the final. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4141.204s">But,</a>  you know, for many years, we've received piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4144.965s">And</a>  one of the biggest issues with this council, besides transparency, was the fact that we receive things in piecemeal form. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4153.267s">And</a>  as we receive tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4155.692s">These</a>  are great first steps, but I as one, like Councilor Longo mentioned, would like to see the overall picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4161.017s">What</a>  is the current organizational chart of the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4165.54s">What's</a>  it going to look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4166.781s">What's</a>  the additional staff that's going to be needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4169.263s">There's</a>  talk about a 3-1-1 system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4172.226s">The</a>  3-1-1 system is only as good, and we heard from Councilor Scarpelli, who happens to work in Somerville, and they've had this system for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4181.392s">It's</a>  only as good as the staff that you have on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4184.517s">And</a>  we all know many of our departments, DPW, you can go through the list, are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4189.986s">So</a>  it's great to say we're going to implement this new program, which I've been pushing for for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4195.294s">But</a>  I've yet to see any substance behind it that's going to say, with this new program, we're going to be able to staff it appropriately so people get timely calls back and their issues are addressed in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4208.023s">So</a>  these are the things, I guess, I'm not part of that 28-person transition committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4214.007s">But</a>  these are the things that I have questions on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4217.309s">And</a>  the reason why we asked that it be tabled is <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4220.475s">that</a>  we see an overall picture.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4223.977s">I</a>  follow that, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4225.297s">And</a>  like you, I am not a member of the transition team either. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4229.42s">And</a>  I would also say that 311, as a citizen, I might say, is a very meritorious program. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4235.042s">But</a>  it's also totally and completely outside of these amendment proposals this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4240.505s">I</a>  just mentioned that parenthetically. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4242.526s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4243.587s">Motion</a>  to withdraw my motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4247.069s">On</a>  the motion, Councilor Lungo-Koehn has <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4250.13s">Withdrawing</a>  her motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4253.372s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4254.553s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4255.173s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4257.335s">I</a>  don't think we mean any disrespect to Louise because I think we both agree that Louise Miller is very qualified to do both positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4267.241s">And</a>  I have full confidence that she can. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4269.362s">And</a>  I think we're both looking at the position going forward, not at this particular moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4275.686s">But</a>  I said, you know, I have full confidence that Louise <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4279.863s">Miller</a>  is competent to do both of those positions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4283.724s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4285.045s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4287.665s">I</a>  yield my time, Mr. President, to the gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4291.906s">Mr.</a>  President, Mr. Gentleman at the podium, please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[jCO6jvvXtn0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4296.968s">Tom</a>  Zook, 29 Garfield Ave, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4300.189s">You</a>  know, I sit here at the City Council meeting and I keep hearing about we need to raise taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4306.771s">We</a>  need to raise taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4309.26s">Is</a>  the city that broke and now all of a sudden we have this abundance of money that we're going to hire all these new people? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4317.73s">That's</a>  what we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4318.971s">I</a>  mean, just two, three weeks, two, three meetings ago we were discussing raising taxes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4324.938s">I</a>  believe what came out of the committee of the whole meeting was that the sum of <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4330.24s">The</a>  financial impact on the current fiscal year's budget would be $953 for the remainder of 2015, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. President, just for personal peace of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4342.124s">So</a>  if these ordinance changes were passed this evening, the impact it would have on this year's budget would be $953 based upon what was presented to us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4352.67s">We're</a>  not going to pass it this evening.</p>

    <p>[jCO6jvvXtn0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4353.93s">We've</a>  all agreed to table the matter until— But in the very near future, she's going to want those positions filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4357.451s">Am</a>  I right?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4358.511s">I</a>  think they're filled by now, is what she's saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4360.032s">She's</a>  trying to reorganize the structure of government.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4362.012s">I</a>  mean, direct our comments to the chair.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4364.793s">But</a>  they are filled already.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4365.453s">You've</a>  made your point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4368.834s">You</a>  may continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4369.514s">All</a>  right, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4371.475s">Ma'am,</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4374.575s">Jean</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4376.116s">And</a>  I just wanted to—not on the positions, but on one point that the solicitor said that I was in <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4382.493s">a</a>  definite disagreement with, all due respect, these people get paid a lot of money and they get paid to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4389.618s">When</a>  I was a private in the Army, I was told point blank, you don't get paid to think, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4395.141s">And</a>  I said, I think, Sergeant, and he said, private, you don't get paid to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4400.464s">But</a>  anyway, these guys get a lot of money, a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4406.308s">They</a>  get paid to think about the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4408.189s">They</a>  get paid to think about what's going to happen in five years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4412.018s">So</a>  with all due respect to the solicitor, it's not about the positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4416.279s">I</a>  don't, you guys wrangled that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4418.4s">The</a>  point is, is that yeah, you guys are getting paid lots of money to think down the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4425.122s">And</a>  that includes the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4426.303s">So</a>  she needs to think what's going to happen in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4429.184s">So</a>  that's all I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4430.204s">And</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4430.664s">And</a>  with due respect to the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4433.985s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4435.626s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4438.077s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4438.917s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4441.418s">Watch</a>  the button there, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4442.378s">I</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4442.998s">Bob</a>  Penta, 07 Road Method Mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4445.219s">I'd</a>  just like to bring your attention to the number F section over there, where it says report to the director of finance auditing on matters that pertain to procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4454.441s">On</a>  January 5th of this year, the city administration appointed Ann Baker to also be the city treasurer, beside being the city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4462.602s">She</a>  can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4463.443s">It's</a>  illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4464.003s">It's</a>  against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4465.601s">and</a>  I don't even know why she's being allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4469.023s">The</a>  second section of the law is very specific as it relates to where we're going on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4473.825s">Chapter</a>  41, section 52 states that all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of the city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4486.231s">Now,</a>  the term city auditor and town auditor is interchangeable under our state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4491.073s">Then</a>  you go to chapter 41, section 55, and it's clear as a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4495.75s">The</a>  town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies." <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4505.133s">So,</a>  I don't know where you're going with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4507.693s">I</a>  think Mr. Solicitor, you need to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4509.534s">I</a>  could be wrong, but the way I read that, your town auditor or your city auditor, which is Ann Baker, is also now, as of January 5th, the city's tax collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4519.176s">She</a>  can hold both those positions, a direct conflict of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4522.448s">Uh,</a>  it's conflict of interest, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4524.269s">And</a>  the law is very specific, especially chapter 41, section 55. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4527.931s">I</a>  think a committee of the whole is so important to understand all the ramifications, you know, what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4535.135s">Um,</a>  you, as I said before, you have a lady that's a come on board from the transition team at $106,000 a year, um, as the director of budget and personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4545.901s">And</a>  that's what her title is, unless that's going to change in the future, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4549.866s">These</a>  are issues that I think the council needs to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4551.947s">I</a>  think you need to know all the names, the dollar amounts, and wherever you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4555.589s">But</a>  the conflicts that possibly and potentially arise, and this is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4559.311s">It's</a>  as clear as a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4560.472s">She</a>  got appointed in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4562.033s">She</a>  is our city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4563.854s">And</a>  apparently, she's going to be the city treasurer for another 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4567.476s">You</a>  can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4568.777s">The</a>  law is specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4569.757s">It's</a>  not me saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4571.038s">It's</a>  the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4571.558s">You</a>  only can serve one master. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4572.739s">You</a>  only can serve one position at one time, especially in the city or town. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4577.233s">And</a>  with all due respect, I just think before you guys just jump in, ladies, before you jump into this thing, I think you really need to understand the full ramifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4585.079s">Not</a>  only that, but the background of the individuals that are accepting these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4589.722s">Again,</a>  the mayor, whoever he or she might be, has that privilege of hiring whoever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4595.586s">But</a>  if there's a potential conflict, that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4599.208s">And</a>  then if there's also a possibility that, I'm not saying take the job out of a classification, I'm saying take the job out of a time sequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4606.929s">and</a>  make it run coterminous with the mayor, whether it's a CAF 14, 18, 22, whatever it might be, as it designated to the terminology, chief of staff, secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4616.394s">I've</a>  got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4617.794s">That's</a>  not the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4618.575s">The</a>  real issue is the person that's being hired, whether it's at will or whether it's coterminous. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4623.677s">But</a>  more importantly, in this particular case, I think it needs to be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4627.919s">Ann</a>  Bega cannot be the city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4629.84s">She</a>  cannot be the city's tax collector at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4632.982s">The</a>  law is specific, chapter 41, section 55, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4636.213s">says</a>  it, I don't say it, and I would expect that the city takes the appropriate action on that matter, just to make sure that they don't get themselves in any kind of a quandary as a conflict that possibly could exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4647.637s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4652.499s">When</a>  a person stands up and says that there's conflict of interest, so there's something awry going on, and they just says, well, the city should take a look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4660.641s">The</a>  brush has already been used on an appointment and said, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4665.593s">It's</a>  illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4666.854s">That</a>  particular statute, if you read it carefully and went through it, you'd know that it does not prohibit a temporary appointment of the city auditor to the position that she has at the city treasurer's with the retirement of the treasurer collector, Mr. Pompeo. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4683.268s">But</a>  to stand up and to say there's a conflict of interest on this other matter, but yet have nothing to say except to read a statute and say that's it, so you should do something, and it has nothing to do with the papers in front of you, I think that that's steep. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4698.854s">I</a>  think that that's disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4701.315s">I</a>  think that that's precipitous. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4703.988s">There's</a>  going to be another city treasurer at some juncture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4706.729s">Ann</a>  Baker is not the city treasurer for the future, but somebody has to have those duties held right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4713.111s">That</a>  has nothing to do with the amendments before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4716.012s">All</a>  it is is trying to just paint somebody with a black brush in order to reach another result. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4721.854s">It's</a>  not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4723.034s">As</a>  a city employee, I say that's not fair, and it's not true.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4727.055s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4730.156s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Longo.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4731.817s">I'll</a>  yield to Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4733.485s">There's</a>  no yielding chair recognizes Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4739.067s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4740.988s">Maybe</a>  Mr. Solicitor, if you could answer something that does the treasure collector report to the city auditor in the normal course? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4751.392s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4752.353s">So,</a>  so I can see what you're saying, but how does the oversight exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4757.721s">when</a>  it's one and the same person?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4759.904s">That</a>  is a legitimate question, but it does not rise to the level of a conflict of interest which is prohibitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4765.652s">Now,</a>  one might say that an accountant shouldn't hold both jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4768.977s">That</a>  would be a matter of accounting standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4771.548s">The</a>  question is whether or not it's illegal under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4776.152s">I've</a>  read that statute, the one that deals with towns and town accountants. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4780.736s">And</a>  you'd really have to stretch that statute to say that it would put the appointment of the finance auditor into conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4790.057s">What</a>  has to happen is the machine of the city in terms of finances and dollars has to move, and it will move until there's a treasurer-collector appointed, which hopefully won't be in the distant future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4804.64s">But</a>  we looked at that statute, and I looked at it specifically, read it line at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4808.881s">You'd</a>  really have to stretch that to say that it's illegal to undertake a temporary appointment.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4814.812s">So,</a>  so getting back to the question regarding the auditor's responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4818.015s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4818.735s">Then</a>  where is the oversight now with the treasurer collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4822.958s">Is</a>  it within an Baker in the auditor's position? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4825.841s">Yes,</a>  it would have to be.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4827.482s">So</a>  she, she will be overseeing on a temporary basis, her office and the treasurer's office, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4834.868s">That's</a>  the one person.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4835.869s">Yes,</a>  that is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4837.61s">So</a>  she has a concern in the treasurer collector's office.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4840.973s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4842.44s">She</a>  reports back as the acting treasurer-collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4845.782s">As</a>  incongruous as that may sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4849.104s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4849.385s">And</a>  why is it assistant treasurer-collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4853.747s">There</a>  is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4854.728s">Why</a>  would that person not assume the responsibilities?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4857.93s">That's</a>  a question which is not before me, because that was never broached. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4862.593s">It's</a>  a very valid question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4864.194s">Right,</a>  but it's also not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4864.955s">You</a>  have a very capable person in that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4866.556s">There</a>  are a number of questions which are valid, reasonable, but are yet not before us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4873.568s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4875.208s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4875.808s">Mr.</a>  President, I would like to make a response since the city solicitor challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4881.089s">Point</a>  of order, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4883.59s">I</a>  don't really think that it's an appropriate forum for a citizen and a city employee to be debating at the floor of the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4890.431s">It</a>  isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4891.071s">We've</a>  met, we've had our committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4893.131s">We</a>  have some questions that need to be answered, Mr. President, and that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4895.972s">We're</a>  going to be having another committee of the whole meeting on that when those questions do get answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4900.013s">However,</a>  I don't feel as though it's appropriate for <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4902.507s">individual</a>  citizen and a member of the administration to go back and forth at the podium here at the City Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4907.05s">I</a>  think that it detracts from what we're here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4909.132s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4909.913s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4914.396s">Sir,</a>  this isn't an opportunity for you to debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4918.239s">This</a>  is a meeting of the City Council and this is a meeting of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4925.484s">It's</a>  a meeting of the City Council, Mr. Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4934.881s">I'll</a>  address my comments back to the City Council so we don't have to have a discourse back and forth between my friend, the City Solicitor, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4942.685s">If</a>  he wanted to take that one step further as to what I said, I didn't say it was illegal, I said it has potential for conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4948.948s">And</a>  Councilman Marks is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4950.849s">If</a>  there is at present an Assistant City, what's her name, Treasurer, no, Mrs. Baker, an Assistant, there's two Assistants in both of those offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4963.562s">Whether</a>  it's Ann Baker as the auditor or Fred Pompeo's office as an assistant, they both have two capable individuals that could assume either one of those roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4971.571s">And</a>  my argument is, and it's very specific in here, I have a difference of opinion with my city solicitor friend, whether either one of those two assistants assume the position, but making one person assume both of them when you have other people just as capable <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4985.486s">and</a>  able to do the job presents and begs the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4988.668s">And</a>  that's what the issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4990.189s">How's</a>  the checks and balances going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4992.711s">A</a>  city auditor is supposed to be the checks and balances as to how and when the city spends its money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4998.195s">So</a>  if the city auditor wants to challenge, you know, what the treasurer-collector has done in the past, which has been her job, now that person is assuming both those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5008.302s">She</a>  will have a conflict between herself as to what role am I supposed to play, the auditor or the treasurer-collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5015.207s">And</a>  that makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5016.788s">And</a>  especially since you have the personnel that are in this building, well qualified, work their way up to the ranks, they should be given that opportunity rather than even get into this discourse that we're having right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5027.396s">That's</a>  what begs the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5028.957s">Why</a>  are we even discussing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5030.278s">There</a>  is no need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5031.859s">You</a>  have people in this building, they're getting paid, they've been trained, and they do their job well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5037.343s">But</a>  to take one person and put it in charge of two, which is the checks and balance person, how do you checks and balance yourself? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5045.234s">That</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5047.415s">The</a>  law is very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5049.475s">You</a>  only can serve one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5051.276s">And</a>  whether it's temporary or not temporary, we're not at that juncture of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5055.657s">Where</a>  we are right now is the fact that you have personnel that are capable and able of doing the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5062.399s">And</a>  that's what you should be talking about, and that's what should be being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5066.301s">Not</a>  one person assuming two positions and scratching their head and saying, what would happen if something were to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5073.203s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5838.154s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5839.194s">I</a>  just want to thank Councilor Caraviello for finding this Mass General Office 115, section 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5845.058s">And</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5845.819s">I</a>  think any chance you can get to get the board shall consist of not more than five, not less than five or more than 15 residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5854.944s">So,</a>  I mean, we'd be lucky to get 15 veterans to help out Mr. Lindsey and advise him on, you know, maybe different ways that he should be.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5864.272s">I</a>  have mentioned to other veterans, and they probably have a half a dozen that are already interested right now.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5869.793s">So</a>  I hope that the mayor looks into it, and obviously does an open public process to try to get interested veterans to help out and get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5877.915s">I</a>  think it's a great idea, and hopefully we can implement it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5881.076s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5882.456s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5884.197s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5885.417s">I</a>  also had an opportunity to take a look at Chapter 115, Section 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5888.958s">And</a>  as Councilor Longo-Kurtz said, that it would be comprised of between five and 15 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5893.625s">that</a>  are residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5895.665s">But</a>  in looking at the general law, and I may be wrong because I haven't had a chance to examine it thoroughly, there is no requirement that those individuals on the Veterans Advisory Committee be veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5906.928s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5907.348s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5907.888s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I think it might make sense for us to maybe request that a certain percentage or portion of the individuals appointed to the Veterans Advisory Council when established be veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5923.125s">whether</a>  it be 50% plus one of the individual positions that are established by the mayor if she takes us up on this offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5929.088s">I</a>  think that that would be... I think that that's a good approach, Councilor Caraviello, taking a two-fold approach where we send the request to the mayor, and then we have an opportunity to make some recommendations and act on her response would probably be the best course. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5944.754s">So</a>  I certainly support the resolution, but ask that the Veterans Subcommittee also take a look at it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5948.916s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5949.296s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5951.863s">for</a>  approval as amended by Councilor Knight to send to the, uh, veterans subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5957.707s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5959.728s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you would please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6000.504s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, as we're all aware, the city is going to be soon rolling out a 311 program where individuals can make service requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6007.49s">And</a>  I think that it would be a good idea if the administration would forward these reports to the city council so that we can have a good understanding as to whether or not the program is actually meeting its stated mission goals and objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6020.662s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my colleagues to support the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6024.225s">Move</a>  for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6025.266s">Motion</a>  for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6026.126s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6028.611s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6030.272s">I</a>  think this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6031.633s">I</a>  definitely support the 311 system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6033.574s">I</a>  think it does bring a great deal of transparency to the issues that, you know, the issues that the city addresses on an everyday basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6042.901s">But</a>  what I'd like to do is, if we could possibly find out what type of reporting is actually available from the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6049.445s">I</a>  mean, usually these systems have all kinds of reporting that are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6052.787s">It'd</a>  be good to actually see what's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6054.929s">I</a>  mean, in particular, I think it's great that we're going to <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6057.366s">that</a>  we can get some type of reporting, but I would like to see, I mean, to be specific, the issues that people call about when they are reported, the department that handled the request, the status of the issue, when they're resolved and the duration of time it took to resolve the issues, because I think that will answer questions with regard to staffing and when we're looking at budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6079.998s">So</a>  if we could get some detailed reporting with that information, I think that would be beneficial for everyone.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6087.443s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6087.863s">So</a>  as amended by councilor Falco, that, uh, the city council also receive a report back from the mayor's office as to what type of reports the new system can generate and how they may be tabulated, presented and, uh, uh, have their numbers crunched. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6108.57s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6109.53s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6110.711s">On</a>  motion for approval, uh, madam vice president.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6113.912s">Thank</a>  you, president Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6115.112s">I</a>  want to thank my colleagues for, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6118.265s">the</a>  request, I think it goes along with requests we made a few months back when we did find out that the 311 system was going to be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6126.892s">We</a>  just asked for updates on how it was going to work, how we were going to be able to view the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6131.996s">So</a>  maybe we have not got that response. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6134.918s">I'm</a>  trying to look exactly on the date we requested that, but maybe a quick 30-minute committee of the whole meeting with whether it be the mayor, whoever, whatever department head is going to run the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6146.26s">so</a>  that we can ask questions, because if there is glitches or anything like that, we're going to get the calls from the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6152.864s">Who</a>  do we call? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6153.584s">What's</a>  the number? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6154.825s">How</a>  do we do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6155.566s">How</a>  do we process it online? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6157.667s">Where</a>  do we go to look to see what order it's in? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6160.469s">So</a>  maybe if we could get a committee of the whole meeting to discuss, ask questions, and be able to understand what is being implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6168.193s">From</a>  what I understand, the go date is March 2000, which is only a month or two away, so I would like to know <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6176.428s">exactly</a>  how the program works myself so that I'm able to explain to residents who have questions with regards to how it works and what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6186.978s">So</a>  that would be my request.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6188.119s">That</a>  would be good to have a meeting on it, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6190.281s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6190.861s">And</a>  I think one of the things is that because we received it in the springtime, everyone was trained on it, and now it hasn't been used. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6198.829s">I</a>  think they're doing retraining and they're going to do, uh, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6203.592s">We'll</a>  receive it all in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6205.153s">The</a>  whole chair recognizes council.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6207.254s">I</a>  just want to, uh, reiterate what council Longo just said that, uh, we need to have a presentation on how this is going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6214.799s">This</a>  is a very important system, uh, in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6218.741s">And,</a>  um, at the very least, I think we should have a committee, the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6222.383s">So,</a>  uh, the sooner we can set that up, the better.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6224.725s">Well,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6225.323s">we'll</a>  schedule something soon because this is something that the entire council has asked for for years.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6230.864s">And</a>  I didn't even from through the chair, I didn't even know of a training that went on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6235.205s">So</a>  I think we all kind of just need to be brought on the same page that anybody can call us and ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6240.186s">And</a>  we know how to navigate the system ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6243.026s">Um,</a>  if a resident can't or isn't computer savvy, we can say, I'll look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6247.087s">Let</a>  me, and then we'll be able to check whether it's the website or some somewhere on the, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6252.042s">Internet</a>  to be able to figure out, you know, how to answer our constituents' questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6256.284s">That</a>  would be helpful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6257.665s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6258.365s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6259.066s">So</a>  on the motion of approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6261.367s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6262.487s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6264.668s">16-016</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Substance Abuse Outreach and Prevention Coordinator update the Council on their efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6275.434s">Councilor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6276.452s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6277.872s">I</a>  recently had a discussion with Karen Rose at the Board of Health, who would be the department head that would be responsible for the Substance Abuse Outreach and Prevention Coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6286.914s">She</a>  was pleased to inform me that the incumbent on the position, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6289.715s">Penny</a>  Funiali, has had her child and is on maternity leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6293.776s">So</a>  she will be unable to appear before the council to highlight some of the efforts and successes that the program has had since its inception. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6301.997s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6304.358s">Rose</a>  did <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6305.246s">commit</a>  to having Penny appear before the council when she does return. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6309.089s">So</a>  I'd ask that the council approve this resolution and then when Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6312.151s">Funigalli</a>  returns from her maternity leave, we ask her to come up here and tell us exactly what's going on with the new office and the new position that this council created.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6358.474s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6359.614s">Uh,</a>  one of the most important responsibilities that we have in the city council is to review and approve <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6364.356s">the</a>  yearly budget for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6365.917s">We</a>  have a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of our city to make sure that the budget and the budget process is fair and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6374.283s">The</a>  resolution that I offer tonight is to take a proactive approach to the upcoming budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6379.888s">When</a>  I was on the school committee, we had a budget that had a written narrative with summaries and goals, and I believe that a city budget should be comparable. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6388.794s">This</a>  year, I'd like to see a city budget with an overview and detailed analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6392.965s">Each</a>  department should produce a mission statement, organizational charts, a list of personnel goals, objectives, accomplishments, and performance metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6402.87s">That's</a>  where the 311 system would really come in handy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6406.832s">Above</a>  all, I think that the budget needs to be easy to review and very descriptive so that the public can understand how their tax dollars are being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6415.957s">Information</a>  like this makes the process transparent, and it's much easier for residents to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6422.159s">Our</a>  current process seems to be a binder full of spreadsheets, and I think that it can be improved upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6428.403s">I'm</a>  sure that the new administration will make improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6430.564s">I'm</a>  confident of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6432.005s">But</a>  I believe that as a council, we should be proactive in this request of the aforementioned recommendations in preparation for the upcoming budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6441.631s">I</a>  move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6443.111s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6443.492s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6447.174s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6447.834s">I</a>  want to commend Councilor Falco for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6451.232s">From</a>  my first term on the council, I had always been critical of our budget process and the budget that we've gotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6457.895s">And</a>  I hope that this year we get a budget, not a budget summary like we've gotten in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6464.558s">So</a>  again, I hope that Mr. Falco's motion for this new type of budget goes forward with our city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6475.443s">I</a>  mean, this will be our first budget with Mrs. Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6478.838s">and</a>  hopefully she'll take the suggestions, uh, uh, with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6483.499s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6484.02s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6484.34s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6484.72s">Councilor</a>  chair recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6486.981s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6488.561s">It's</a>  a breath of fresh air to have someone with a council of Falco's background in budgeting, uh, in his, uh, profession, uh, on the council, because that's been a bone of contention, uh, with this council for many years, uh, receiving a line item budget from the administration and really nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6508.745s">No</a>  narrative, no clear direction on which way the city's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6513.008s">And</a>  with that being said, I happen to have done a little research on outcomes-based budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6520.954s">And</a>  you're probably familiar with it, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6524.396s">But</a>  if I could, Mr. President, I just want to read a little narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6528.6s">Because</a>  I think this is the exact direction, at least I as one member of the council, and from what I'm hearing from other members of the council, would like to see take place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6538.34s">It</a>  states the new fiscal reality facing cities and towns across the Commonwealth necessitates that communities must be more judicious and prudent than ever before in their approach to providing services. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6550.349s">Outcome-based</a>  budgeting, as opposed to the more traditional line-item incremental budgeting where expenditures are increased or decreased by a percentage from prior year levels, outcome-based budgeting is unique in that it ties in strategic planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6568.158s">Performance</a>  management. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6570.68s">Outcome-based</a>  budgeting requires the mayor and department heads to develop an improved set of government priorities for the coming year, such as enhanced public safety or increased economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6582.691s">These</a>  larger priorities then cascade down through the departments and permeate each of their own annual work plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6588.836s">Resources</a>  are then calibrated toward the specific activities that are designed to realize those outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6595.31s">I</a>  mean, I think that's exactly what we as a council have been talking about for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6600.603s">You</a>  know, it's great to get a line item budget, and there's 10,000 line items on that, and we go through and we say, okay, last year you gave line item 003 10,000, this year it's getting 11,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6612.886s">There's</a>  no rhyme to reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6614.086s">Why</a>  is it getting 11,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6615.666s">We</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6616.907s">You</a>  know, one line item goes down, one goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6620.848s">And</a>  it never really addresses priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6624.088s">We've</a>  been talking about public safety, the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6626.709s">We've</a>  been talking about the need for additional cruises. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6628.97s">We've</a>  been talking about the need to repair roads and sidewalks and so forth, the leaking ceilings and preventive maintenance in our community on some of our city-owned buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6639.853s">And</a>  really, every year, we never really address those particular issues in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6645.275s">It's</a>  more or less just looking at last year's budget and adding or decreasing lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6652.057s">There's</a>  really no rhyme to reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6654.365s">And</a>  this outcomes-based budgeting, I think, it may not be the solve-all, but it allows us to hear from the different departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6661.226s">It</a>  allows us, as Councilor Peto would state year after year, that if you had a wish list, you used to ask every department head, what is your wish list? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6670.929s">And,</a>  you know, the department heads would either be open with you or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6674.129s">But</a>  this outcomes-based budgeting forces their hand to say, hey, the administration wants to act upon public safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6682.841s">And</a>  those particular department heads that have public safety within their budget would have to raise particular areas in their budget to address the needs of the community and what direction the mayor wants to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6696.566s">So,</a>  I support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6699.927s">I</a>  thank Councilor Falco for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6703.008s">And,</a>  you know, the ultimate goal is to ensure that each dollar in the city has a well-designed purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6711.008s">each</a>  dollar is accountable to whatever resources they're earmarked to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6716.631s">And</a>  as we all know, at the end of a budget year, at any given year, we're transferring millions of dollars that we thought were appropriated for this particular use. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6725.275s">A</a>  million dollars is going towards this, and at the end of the year, we have a million dollar surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6732.258s">And</a>  I think that speaks volumes on the need to dig a little deeper, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6739.656s">So,</a>  that's what Councilor Falco is saying, and I hope this is part of the new process and the budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6746.319s">I</a>  thank you for offering this.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6752.361s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6754.162s">I,</a>  too, want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6757.323s">I</a>  don't have the budget background, but I know two years ago we requested goals and objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6764.426s">To</a>  go even further is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6767.52s">I</a>  think that's something that should be reported every year by every department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6771.303s">Goals,</a>  objectives, I like how you've furthered it with priorities, staff vacancies, accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6776.027s">I</a>  think that's necessary, and that's something that should have been done for a very long time, and I hope the administration makes that changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6783.353s">One</a>  clarity, I just want to, you're looking for the template format. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6787.256s">I</a>  just want to make sure that this also includes, you're asking each department head for those list of things, or is that how the template works?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6797.388s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6802.689s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6803.59s">The</a>  template would basically be, I want to see what the administration is going to provide us with regard to data. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6809.991s">Are</a>  they going to provide us with mission statements, organizational charts, list of personnel? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6814.192s">Those</a>  are the types of things I think we should see. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6817.033s">And</a>  I'd like to know in advance, are they going to, you know, they should let us know, send us a template. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6823.354s">You're</a>  going to see for, you know, the DPW, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6826.66s">You're</a>  going to see a mission statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6827.761s">You're</a>  going to see an organizational chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6829.141s">You're</a>  going to see a list of personnel goals, objectives, accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6832.643s">So</a>  you're going to see that for each department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6834.584s">But</a>  I want them to confirm that they're going to send that to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6837.526s">I</a>  don't want to find out when we're looking at a budget book in June that it's something different than what we would really like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6843.849s">So</a>  that's why I'd like to, I'd really like them to confirm sooner than later that when it gets to budget season, this is what we're going to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6851.073s">So</a>  we can be prepared and we can know how to, you know, we can better analyze the budget as a group.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6857.194s">I'm</a>  in full support of getting the template, and I'm in full support of requesting a list of goals, objectives, priorities, and accomplishments from each and every department head months before. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6868.822s">I</a>  think that's a great idea, and I hope that's something that we can work as a council to almost mandate through the administration, because we are the ones that vote on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6878.668s">So</a>  if we make it very clear that this is something that should be done, then I hope to see that done before June.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6885.0s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6886.081s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilman Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6888.083s">If</a>  I can, I'd like to applaud my fellow councilman, Mr. Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6892.949s">We</a>  were both on the school committee, and I remember our first meeting when the first budget we went through, we received a budget book, I believe Friday or Father's Day, and to vote on a Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6904.622s">So</a>  we learned relatively quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6907.417s">that</a>  how we needed to work together collaboratively as a committee to make sure we get the answers that we need before we pass the budget onto the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6917.104s">Again,</a>  the mayor will present us with a budget, and I think what John's asking for and what we've done in the past with the school committee with having pre-budget meetings where department heads presented us with all of that information gave us the tools to make sure that we made the proper decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6935.418s">I</a>  know that the bone of contention <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6937.107s">that's</a>  been talked about recently is the PR person. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6940.508s">The</a>  PR person is something we talked about back in May of 2011 as part of our pre-budget conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6948.15s">So</a>  it's important that this is how we, it's the first step that I think that led us in a direction on the school committee in a positive direction, making sure that we're working with transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6960.973s">So</a>  again, I just want to applaud your resolution and <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6966.726s">pretty</a>  excited about making this happen, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6969.827s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6970.968s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6973.329s">Just</a>  a quick point, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6974.989s">This</a>  council has requested, I believe, unanimously over the last several budgets that also within our budget book, we receive a column that shows whether the account was in a deficit or had a surplus the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6988.535s">And</a>  I, as one member, know that's very helpful to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6992.196s">And,</a>  for instance, snow and ice, we end up funded by hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6996.848s">It's</a>  the only account that you can budget deficit spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7001.649s">And</a>  but it's helpful, I think, especially as new members of the council, those two new members to see what accounts every year go into deficit, whether it's overtime or whatever have you, and then make adjustments accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7016.413s">And,</a>  you know, I think any good budget person will make those adjustments on the fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7021.574s">So</a>  year after year, you don't have the same accounts that are in deficit or surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7026.848s">where</a>  money is being transferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7028.149s">So</a>  I would again ask that be part of this report that the previous year that we receive whether or not that account was in a surplus or deficit.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7038.497s">So</a>  as an amendment at the end of the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7041.34s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7042.18s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7043.802s">Just</a>  for clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7047.347s">as</a>  we move forward, the, the wishes of the school, this city council to ask for department heads to come to the rail or come to this meeting that would have to go through the mayor's office or that, that wouldn't be our privy, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7061.377s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7062.057s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7062.417s">But</a>  we can, we can request the mayor's office that we ask for a pre-budget updates and from department as we move forward, just to make, make sure that we're clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7071.944s">I</a>  think that Councilor Marks made that loud and clear, but we can always request. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7076.087s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7076.751s">Thank</a>  you, councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7077.511s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7079.412s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7081.032s">And</a>  again, thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7083.873s">I</a>  think Councilor Scarpelli hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7087.334s">It's</a>  a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7088.854s">It's</a>  a partnership between this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7090.195s">It's</a>  a partnership between the administration and the school department and the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7094.576s">And</a>  the school department had great success last year, putting together a school budget that was probably the best school budget that I've seen in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7102.158s">And</a>  I think that part of the reason the budget was so successful, because they had <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7106.775s">the</a>  narrative budget summary that was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7108.315s">They</a>  understood exactly what it was that they were working on and they didn't have to pry through 600 pages of line item budgets and ask every single question about every single line item because there was a narrative there, there was a mission there, there was an objective, a stated goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7121.518s">And</a>  I was very pleased to vote in favor of the budget, Mr. President, because of the fact that the school department's budget was so strong and the work that it did in restoring adjustment Councilors, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7131.2s">We</a>  could go over the successes time and time again as we have in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7135.8s">However,</a>  we also passed a resolution back, I want to say in September, requesting that this council or the budget subcommittee meet quarterly with the administration to determine whether or not forecasts are meeting collections and to see where we are in terms of surplus and accounts and stuff like that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7158.112s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd like to see that those meetings start to begin getting called as this council did vote for unanimously by way of a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7165.215s">With</a>  that being said, I certainly support this resolution that's before the council today. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7169.078s">I</a>  think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7169.899s">It's</a>  a great approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7170.619s">It</a>  sets the tone for us to start working together now on the most important job that we have, which is setting the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7175.603s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I move for approval and I'd ask for a roll call.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7178.425s">On</a>  the motion for approval, the citizen at the podium will speak before we take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7186.01s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7186.55s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7272.471s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7274.592s">As</a>  a frequent, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7275.74s">user</a>  of the smartphone application relative to the park mobile system, I received an article, and the article was in an online magazine called The Register. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7288.91s">The</a>  headline was, Carr Park Mobile Apps are Vulnerable to Hacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7293.233s">And</a>  that made me rather concerned, so I continued to research, and I found another site called Hack Read, which said, researchers find critical vulnerabilities in the Android parking apps. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7305.287s">and</a>  Info Security Magazine. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7307.428s">The</a>  headline would read, Researchers Find Major Security Flaws in Parking Apps. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7311.469s">And</a>  what's happening, Mr. President, is that because of substandard encryption, which, quite frankly, means nothing to me, but might mean something more to some people that are a little bit more tech-savvy than I, these phones are becoming vulnerable to attacks because the information is up in the cloud and people are able to get at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7329.015s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, there have been a number of suggestions and recommendations made by these <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7333.917s">And</a>  one of the biggest recommendations was that you use a credit card as opposed to a debit card to fund your purchases in your mobile app because of the fraud protections that are in the credit card system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7345.639s">However,</a>  Mr. President, we do have a parking program here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7348.5s">We</a>  do have a ParkMobile app here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7350.28s">So</a>  I would like to see what steps the ParkMobile people are taking to ensure that we do not have substandard encryption and that our consumers are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7359.18s">from</a>  cyber attacks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7361.241s">And</a>  in segue to that, if anybody has been affected by a cyber attack of some sort, I would ask that they report the matter immediately to not only the police department, but also the Office of Consumer, the Medford Consumer Commission, rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7375.709s">The</a>  First Floor of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7377.591s">First</a>  Floor of City Hall, the old Medford Savings Lives Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7381.213s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7383.594s">I</a>  think that this is a basic <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7385.654s">resolution</a>  that will allow us to understand what steps are being taken to keep consumers in the community safe.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7390.456s">On</a>  the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7393.897s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7395.497s">Seeing</a>  that we're talking about the parking, it's been about a year now with the parking just about, I think, almost a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7403.26s">And</a>  I'd like to see a report on our first year on monies collected, not collected, tickets, a full report. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7412.162s">We</a>  got one about two months ago, I think.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7414.448s">It</a>  was filled in detail, surprisingly so.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7416.489s">Yeah,</a>  so like I said, I think we're just about at the end of our first full year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7420.61s">I'd</a>  like to see where we stand with that and where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7425.512s">I</a>  see more and more meter heads popping up in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7429.093s">And</a>  I'd like to maybe get a report on that too.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7432.054s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7432.774s">So</a>  on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Caraviello, that we receive the first annual full report in detail <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7444.169s">summary</a>  of action on the traffic parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7450.274s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7452.096s">If</a>  I can, to add along, because we're talking about traffic and parking, if we can, too, through the chair, I've gotten some calls about some of the signs in Medford Square, the new signs that have been erected that I believe you need a master's degree to read them and to follow along. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7467.749s">It's</a>  been very difficult for some of our seniors <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7472.031s">to</a>  follow along. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7473.072s">I</a>  think there's six different bullets in one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7478.714s">I</a>  believe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7480.595s">Reynolds</a>  would say it was a carry on sentence as it keeps going on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7483.676s">So</a>  if someone can look into that too, it's important to get clarification for that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7488.418s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Scappelli, that the Park Medford, which has a purview over those signs in the contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7499.381s">review</a>  the content of the new square signs in Medford Square as they are difficult on the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7511.685s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7513.025s">Hi</a>  citizen, you're welcome to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7514.826s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7516.766s">Hi,</a>  my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7518.267s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7520.207s">Since</a>  you opened the park Medford a little more, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7523.928s">During</a>  the period that you were supposed to have the free Saturday parking, several people reported on Facebook and just parents speaking that they were paying for parking on the Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7535.535s">The</a>  meters were not off. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7537.297s">Park</a>  Medford still hasn't figured out how to turn their meters off. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7541.339s">So</a>  maybe when you get your report, you might want to see how many people paid when they weren't supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7545.322s">That</a>  seems like a breach of contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7547.363s">And</a>  since we're always talking about the contract and how much it'll cost us to get out of it, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7551.141s">Maybe</a>  there should be some ramifications when they don't honour their contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7554.364s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7559.108s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7561.11s">Sir?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7561.29s">I'd</a>  like to speak about... Please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7564.252s">Bob</a>  Henton from Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7565.774s">I'd</a>  like to speak about the contract in one particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7568.956s">If</a>  you go back and look at the contract and look at the proposal that was made, we were talking at one point in time of possibly having zones here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7576.443s">And</a>  to date, there are no zones, and none of the METAs are identified as being in any particular zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7582.707s">As</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7583.147s">Rodriguez</a>  just got through saying, during this past month of December, people were putting money in the METAs, and the METAs were accepting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7591.452s">I</a>  think the question needs to go a little bit further to the Park-Metford office to find out what their technology is, because they should be able to shut down that meter that indicates that they will not accept the money on any particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7603.341s">As</a>  far as the new meters in downtown Metford Square, I think Councilor Caraviello can attest to this, because I think he was a product of it, putting the money in the meter, and the meter did take the money in Metford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7615.27s">So</a>  you have situations here that even where you have the pay park ones, and now you have the stanchions <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7621.321s">where</a>  you put the quarters in, there are some problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7624.003s">I</a>  think it would behoove the council not only to have your first annual update, Councilor Caraviello, as you were talking about, maybe to have them come in here and find out, especially with two new councillors, what your concerns might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7634.01s">They</a>  indicated that they have all this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7636.872s">They</a>  have this computer app technology and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7640.835s">But</a>  there definitely are concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7642.276s">There</a>  are people still getting tagged for no reason at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7645.678s">And</a>  more importantly, there are no zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7647.379s">City</a>  of Boston is very clear <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7649.257s">on</a>  how they address their issue relative toward their parking and their meters, their zones and their territories. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7655.219s">It</a>  would be very easy to put zone locations on each and every one of the meters and each and every one of the, you know, it doesn't take a lot to put, you know, the number, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7664.863s">And</a>  you don't have to go through the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7667.123s">And</a>  on Christmas Eve day, Christmas Eve day in the afternoon, people were getting tickets right up until six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7674.566s">I</a>  think that's just a little bit disingenuous, as I said before, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7678.072s">They're</a>  nothing but a bunch of bounty hunters coming here to Boston and Medford, Massachusetts, to get as much money as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7684.734s">And</a>  it's just not working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7686.335s">And</a>  with the two new councils on here, I would hope that they would be brought up to date that the past council, the very past one in December, voted seven to nothing to give the senior citizens in the city of Medford the break of not being able to pay, because that was one of the concerns that was attributed by the president administration that they would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7704.602s">So</a>  I think it's an issue that needs to be addressed, and I think it's an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7708.332s">that</a>  should work well for the City of Medford, especially for the seniors in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7712.513s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7743.764s">On</a>  that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7745.085s">Mr.</a>  President, I put the resolution forward to address issues of cyber security. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7750.869s">Although</a>  I can understand why certain people are coming from Facebook and this guy got a ticket this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7759.254s">It</a>  is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7760.575s">There's</a>  an administrative procedure that's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7762.976s">If</a>  you feel as though you got a ticket, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7764.852s">erroneously</a>  that you go through the appeals process. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7768.034s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem amending the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7773.536s">However,</a>  the principle that I wrote for was just exclusively for cybersecurity, and we kind of went off on a little tangent and went down a different kind of road, Mr. President, and that's not where I was looking to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7784.782s">But</a>  with that being said, I'd ask that we <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7787.127s">several</a>  amendments and move forward.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7790.289s">On</a>  the motion for approval as amended and now to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7796.214s">So</a>  the amendments are?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7799.897s">Annual</a>  update.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7802.439s">Annual</a>  update.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7805.261s">What</a>  technology do they have to shut the matter off? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7809.504s">To</a>  shut the meters off. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7810.405s">To</a>  shut the meters off.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7813.309s">So</a>  then we'll take them one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7814.99s">So</a>  on the amendment for an annual update, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7821.792s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7821.972s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7823.392s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7826.333s">The</a>  signs to be reviewed and report back to the city council as to the content of them, and can they be simplified for the average reader? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7839.82s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7840.841s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7841.921s">Those</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7843.202s">Carries.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7845.363s">To</a>  have a check on shutting down the meters, are they shutting down when they're supposed to so that people aren't swindled into paying when they shouldn't have to? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7859.532s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7860.352s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7861.273s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7862.44s">And</a>  on the main motion of Councilor Knight, that report be given to the City Council as to cyber attacks and efforts to maintain cyber security in the payment system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7874.63s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7876.151s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7876.551s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7878.013s">The</a>  motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7879.954s">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7882.876s">Petitions,</a>  presentations, and similar matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7886.379s">Petition</a>  by Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford, Massachusetts, to discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7891.755s">preparing</a>  Union and Swan Streets to be converted for a municipal parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7898.198s">Citizen</a>  Martin, welcome and please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7901.459s">Hi,</a>  Gene Martin, Municipal Lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7904.181s">But</a>  anyway, this is, well, I'm going to be talking about two different little blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7910.463s">This</a>  is a citywide issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7911.724s">This</a>  affects the Medford Square projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7915.886s">This</a>  affects the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7918.427s">And</a>  I just want everybody to know that all of the <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7921.469s">department</a>  heads need to be in and understand what I'm trying to get across. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7925.15s">Because</a>  this is a citywide project, even though it's going to be talking about two small blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7931.231s">First</a>  of all, reorganizing Union and Swan Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7935.171s">There</a>  are two small blocks between the police headquarters and the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7939.652s">The</a>  first block is between Union and Swan, which are more like alleys than streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7945.413s">And</a>  I recommend anybody just drive down Mystic Ave and Main <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7950.281s">And</a>  go up those, quote, streets, they're more like alleys than they are streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7956.162s">The</a>  second block between Swan and James is a little bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7959.663s">These</a>  two blocks, separating the police facility and the DPW yards, are small privately owned businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7966.684s">Along</a>  Union Alley, and I call it alley, are the following, Alsar Automotive, Carly Fence, Stevens Auto, and Lew's Custom Exhaust. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7977.607s">Swan</a>  Street, A&P, Collision Center, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7980.572s">After</a>  that, a junkyard, complete eyesore, and then Eastern Tool Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7986.053s">If</a>  you go down that road, if you look from above, and actually as you're going down it, there's a huge junk area. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7994.074s">It</a>  just looks like an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7996.375s">On</a>  the left is a marble and granite company. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7998.535s">James</a>  Street has all truck company. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8002.656s">Unfortunately,</a>  the new public safety building is going to need at least the lots on Union to Swan Street to meet code. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8010.748s">for</a>  the current footprint, which is one-third too small, and so union to Swan is not an option, but rather a mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8020.431s">Whether</a>  or not we move the businesses on James Street is still optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8024.933s">Since</a>  we are going to have to disturb that area, we might as well do it right to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8030.795s">It</a>  makes sense to turn those two whole blocks, including James Street, into city-owned lots <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8037.775s">so</a>  that we can increase our building space for other related departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8042.217s">We</a>  need to work with these business owners and find them new lots for their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8047.22s">And</a>  this is where you come in, Mr. Delarusso and Mr. Caraviello especially, because you're both on the rotary and you need to be, you know, pushing for this, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8057.226s">Not</a>  only do I see the new police fire 911 facility staying where it is, but I see buildings that house other city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8066.538s">in</a>  it like public health, building management, engineering, water and sewer, cemetery, any departments that seems compatible with police, fire, and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8076.462s">The</a>  other aspect of this change is that it will impact the new square's view over the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8082.725s">Currently,</a>  the view is ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8085.586s">So</a>  seriously, if you put those fancy condos above the storefronts, you know, where CVS is and all of that, they're gonna have an awful view. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8095.783s">I'm</a>  telling you, if you look down, do the aerial thing from, that's why I did this, aerial view, it's all junky, it's ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8104.17s">So</a>  it'll increase your property values of the Medford Square project as well, not to look over the river and then to, you know, to see all that junky stuff, mostly automotive places. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8113.698s">And</a>  I'm not saying get rid of them, I'm saying help us move them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8118.602s">One</a>  other aspect of this change is that it will impact the new square's view on the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8124.106s">Currently,</a>  the view is ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8125.812s">As</a>  soon as these businesses are, some of these businesses are dumpy and crappy looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8132.458s">So</a>  if you are going to gentrify the square with condos above the storefronts, then you need to clean up that view for them anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8139.825s">The</a>  losers appear to be the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8142.408s">However,</a>  Carly Fence would do better on a front lot on Mystic Ave with a better eye-catching sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8150.541s">The</a>  other businesses will have a harder time finding lots because they are automotive by nature and have a lot of grease and oil and stuff requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8163.464s">I</a>  believe that the city would be short sighted not to consider the whole area between the police station and the DPW lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8171.276s">as</a>  possible office and building structures for city business, leaving more room in city hall for new areas of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8179.158s">As</a>  you know, the city is growing and it needs more space. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8182.379s">Um,</a>  my point is, is that since this isn't going to happen tomorrow, we need to help plan with the five year vision of, you know, breaking ground at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8196.363s">And</a>  if you do, you're going to have to do it where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8198.922s">because</a>  it's centrally located, it's easy to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8201.885s">You</a>  want police, fire, and 911 all in the same area. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8205.009s">Clearly</a>  the current building size is not big enough, the footprint is not big enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8209.534s">So</a>  you're gonna have to take over that little alley anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8213.362s">So</a>  since you're going to do that and you're going to disturb the area, you might as well do it all in one shot with the business community, with all the department heads, with everybody on board and visualize what you want it to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8225.911s">And</a>  it'll serve as a, everybody will be happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8229.853s">But</a>  what I'm saying is if we just take, take it by eminent domain, you're going to cause a lot of trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8236.117s">So</a>  if you, if I think that we all need to work with the business communities down there, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8240.17s">and</a>  find them another home inside the city where these automotive, mostly automotive places, body shops and whatnot, can do their business along Mystic Ave or someplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8249.576s">There's</a>  got to be someplace for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8251.277s">So</a>  if you don't, you're going to have to take the ground anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8255.099s">And</a>  it'll cause problems if it happens abruptly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8258.041s">So</a>  plan it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8259.221s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8261.883s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8262.263s">Mr.</a>  President, Mr. Martin, if you'd like for your information.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8265.505s">On</a>  the motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Knight,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8268.723s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caput. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8270.144s">For</a>  your information, there's going to be some building going on down there, so I think Joseph's Limousine is planning on building a building down there, because they were on the Board of Appeals docket for this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8283.829s">So</a>  I know there is some construction slated for down there.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8287.251s">So</a>  they're going to build higher?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8288.991s">Well,</a>  there's nothing there on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8290.372s">They</a>  are going to build a permanent garage there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8293.773s">Oh.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8293.953s">Well,</a>  I think, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8295.214s">You</a>  guys got to stop it, man, because where are you going to put the police station?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8298.298s">Well,</a>  again, that's their property that they own.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8300.979s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8301.599s">But</a>  where's the police station going to go?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8303.32s">But</a>  again, that's their property that they own.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8304.74s">We</a>  just can't go and- With all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8306.181s">I</a>  don't want to argue.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8894.064s">I</a>  thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing up this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8897.145s">However,</a>  I would state, Mr. President, when DOT was before us, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8901.492s">with</a>  all their high-paid salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8903.873s">They</a>  mentioned there's going to be a 24-hour hotline. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8906.513s">There's</a>  going to be contact people we can get a hold of. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8909.014s">Now</a>  we're hearing we have to petition our own traffic commission because we're unable to get a hold of DOT, as Councilor Caraviello just mentioned, to make some small — these are minor changes, which makes — Mr. President, we met with them at 10 o'clock that evening, and they agreed to make these changes, and they just ignored it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8927.159s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8927.579s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8928.019s">So</a>  — so, that's my issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8930.32s">You</a>  know, if — <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8931.519s">elected</a>  officials, as Councilor Caraviello, are unable to address some of the minor concerns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8939.284s">Maybe</a>  we have to put a halt on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8941.786s">Maybe</a>  it's about time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8942.747s">And</a>  I mentioned this several months ago, and, you know, I got a lot of feedback from people that were supportive of it, that we put a temporary halt on the project until some of these questions that are being asked by area businesses, Mr. President, and issues that Councilor Caraviello just mentioned about the Jersey Barriers <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8961.472s">are</a>  addressed, because it seems to me that DOT is not a willing partner in this, and they're going to go down kicking on every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8969.915s">And</a>  so, you know, if the council sees fit, I think we should offer a resolution, Mr. President, asking that if these issues are not addressed immediately, then a halt to the project be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8982.059s">And</a>  we take a vote on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8983.099s">The</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8983.78s">Is</a>  that a suitable amendment, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8986.22s">Councilor,</a>  if my colleague would like, I'd be happy to put that on.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8988.461s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8991.448s">So</a>  on that motion, did you want to speak council? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8994.51s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8995.13s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8995.791s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor, roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8997.992s">Mr.</a>  President roll call vote has been requested.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8999.973s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you would please call the roll timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9003.836s">So</a>  we know when we can, uh, should we wait a week to get a response? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9008.979s">Well,</a>  we'll go into the traffic commission, which means monthly on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9013.002s">Um,</a>  they don't meet again until next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9015.863s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9017.044s">Which</a>  is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9019.34s">It</a>  seems like a long time to wait.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9021.562s">If</a>  I may, I mean, we were here on Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9025.266s">We</a>  passed the resolution that was seven days ago, which was five business days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9029.97s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello met them there Wednesday evening at 10 o'clock, which was in essence, really Thursday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9036.296s">So</a>  that was only three business days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9038.419s">I</a>  think we need to give them an ample opportunity to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9040.44s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks is on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9041.981s">We</a>  need to put some sort of timeline in there to see if we can effectuate this change in a certain period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9046.544s">But</a>  I also want to be cognizant of the fact that it's really only been three business days that have passed since the request was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9053.268s">So</a>  I don't know if we've gotten a refusal back from DLT saying that they're not going to do it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9061.073s">Please</a>  counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9062.214s">Um,</a>  the DLT came the next morning, they removed, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9066.313s">the</a>  barrels and the barriers from in front of one of the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9071.777s">And</a>  he said that that next morning, he would also open a space up between the Jersey barrier to let the people cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9079.003s">Then,</a>  according to Representative Donato, he's saying that they're not doing it now.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9085.068s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9088.151s">Again,</a>  please, forgive my naive train of thought here, but what city department, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9096.633s">and</a>  director is overseeing the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9100.698s">That</a>  should be OCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9101.579s">So</a>  if OCD, why don't we... The city engineer has called you the point person on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9105.804s">Well,</a>  I think that we, for immediate action, we make the amendment that we send the department that's directly in charge there in the morning to give us an answer ASAP.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9118.198s">Would</a>  that be the engineering department, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9120.3s">I'm</a>  under the impression that the engineer has been the point person.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9124.483s">Based</a>  on my discussions with Mr. Daley from the DOT, that engineering has been.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9128.766s">So</a>  if we could do that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9134.891s">Refer</a>  to the traffic commission as well as the engineering department for immediate action. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9140.695s">And</a>  Councilor Marks, you wanted a time frame if you would.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9143.998s">I</a>  would say if we don't hear, if this is not resolved by next Tuesday, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9147.714s">And</a>  next Tuesday we take a vote to stop the project to stop the project.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9151.957s">Bring</a>  the matter forward next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9153.098s">It's</a>  not fixed.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9154.179s">And</a>  if we could have an amendment that we have a suitable answer as to why this wasn't done, it'd be just small fixes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9163.346s">And</a>  it was all supposed to be worked out for the benefit of the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9169.271s">So</a>  on the motion for approval, all those in favor, all those opposed motion carries unanimously records.</p>

    <p>[Rmp1s_8uCxM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9179.325s">Mr.</a>  President, before we go to the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9181.726s">Oh,</a>  yes, by all means.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9187.267s">Mr.</a>  President, over the last, I think it's been three months now, I put on two separate resolutions that were voted unanimously by this council asking about the temporary speed bumps that were placed on Harvard Street and Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9204.571s">I'm</a>  under the impression that the one on Harvard Street now is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9208.673s">as</a>  recently as a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9210.914s">That</a>  has been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9212.175s">I</a>  have yet to get a response on two separate resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9215.937s">Those</a>  two locations were part of the pilot program that involved three raised, not speed bumps, three raised crosswalks, of which Winthrop Street was the only one that was placed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9228.423s">And</a>  I've yet to get a response, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9230.624s">I</a>  know there's a new administration now, but I'm hoping that we can get a response back from someone in engineering or someone in DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9238.046s">or</a>  someone in the building that's in the know why these two speed bumps have popped up in the community, why one now is gone, and what's happening with the raised crosswalks that the mayor came out with a press conference saying that this was part of the initial pilot program to help with pedestrian safety in our community.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9257.782s">Three</a>  years ago.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9258.803s">Right,</a>  three years ago, and to help mitigate some of the concerns we have with increased speeding in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9266.42s">So</a>  I really would like to get an answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9268.321s">This</a>  is a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9270.621s">This</a>  is, this is not just some pie in the sky issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9273.182s">This</a>  is a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9274.883s">We</a>  read all the time in the paper about pedestrians being struck and killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9279.345s">And</a>  it's not in every other community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9280.665s">It's</a>  in our community too. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9282.186s">And,</a>  and really, uh, to not address these concerns is a detrimental Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9288.088s">So,</a>  uh, on the motion of Councilor Marks that the, uh, uh, mayor's office report back immediately to the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9295.652s">regarding</a>  the status of the raised crosswalks, the aforementioned raised crosswalks, and the temporary speed bump program on Harvard and also on Central. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9309.422s">On</a>  a motion for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9311.663s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9312.364s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9313.645s">Records</a>  of the meeting of January 5th, 2016 were passed to Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9320.012s">Councilor,</a>  how did you find those? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9324.433s">And</a>  I find them in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9326.374s">And</a>  you move approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9327.614s">I</a>  move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9328.374s">On</a>  the motion for approval of the records of the January 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9331.355s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9332.715s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9333.435s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9334.695s">On</a>  the motion for adjournment by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9336.676s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9337.776s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9340.237s">Meeting</a>  adjourned.</p>
