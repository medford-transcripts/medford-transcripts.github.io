[SPEAKER_15]: The language of said section 652 shall be amended to read as follows.

305
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:29,001
[SPEAKER_15]: He shall hold office for term of two years from the first Monday in January and the year of his appointment and until another shall be appointed and qualified.

306
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:33,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Respectfully submitted Stephanie Burke, Mayor.

307
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:37,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Before us to explain this is the city solicitor.

308
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:42,913
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a slew of papers that we discussed for amendments of ordinances in committee of the whole.

309
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:53,093
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was requested that these be reported out with some inquiries made through the mayor's office on that.

310
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:57,937
[SPEAKER_15]: And the clerk will enumerate those inquiries that have been asked for.

311
00:43:57,957 --> 00:44:06,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I made a report from earlier tonight pertaining to this particular topic.

312
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:11,088
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a certain amount of recommendations being written.

313
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:19,853
[SPEAKER_16]: recommendations were written explanation from the mayor on the role and need of the new chief of staff position.

314
00:44:21,554 --> 00:44:29,138
[SPEAKER_16]: A flow chart with the, on the executive office, executive office by position, title, duties, and salary.

315
00:44:33,521 --> 00:44:39,324
[SPEAKER_16]: A further explanation on the, on the prior positions that won't be filled.

316
00:44:40,504 --> 00:44:41,405
[SPEAKER_16]: The impact on the,

317
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,152
[SPEAKER_16]: current budget, uh, on the new hires.

318
00:44:45,853 --> 00:45:00,543
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, will there be, uh, any additional new secretary of administrative, uh, hiring at the mayor's office and also any new, uh, salary increases, uh, will be forthcoming in the future.

319
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:03,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Did we get, is that all in substance?

320
00:45:03,906 --> 00:45:04,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

321
00:45:04,586 --> 00:45:06,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam vice president that covered everything.

322
00:45:06,928 --> 00:45:09,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, council marks that covered everything that you had in there.

323
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:09,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

324
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:11,785
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Mr. Solicitor, if you would.

325
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:14,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, my name is Mark Rumley, Mr. President.

326
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:15,847
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm city solicitor.

327
00:45:15,907 --> 00:45:18,228
[SPEAKER_18]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

328
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:30,055
[SPEAKER_18]: The paper which is before you, 16-020, is one which would change the city solicitor's term from one year to a two year term which would run concurrently with the mayor.

329
00:45:31,235 --> 00:45:34,337
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the purpose of that particular suggestion and amendment.

330
00:45:36,628 --> 00:45:40,009
[SPEAKER_18]: And could I make a comment about the papers, the questions that are referred out?

331
00:45:40,729 --> 00:46:01,494
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that I explained as to the positions which are on the council agenda tonight, those resolutions that pertain to the proposed amendments and the creation of a new position tonight, that at least in terms of those salaries, I did explain on those positions what the salaries have been, were, and what the changes were.

332
00:46:01,864 --> 00:46:10,127
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to save the answer to a question, if it's not necessary, because I believe I was fairly clear in Committee of the Whole as to the positions before you tonight.

333
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:16,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, with that committee report that was just read, do we have a motion to adopt that?

334
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:18,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

335
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:18,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

336
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:21,892
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Long and Kern, all those in favor?

337
00:46:22,272 --> 00:46:22,992
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

338
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:25,053
[SPEAKER_15]: So the committee report is adopted.

339
00:46:25,093 --> 00:46:29,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion will be adjourned at the table until the questions

340
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:37,364
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Council and Knight, lay the matter on the table until the questions have been answered.

341
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:40,526
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

342
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:42,167
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

343
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:51,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we have one more that's going to come up now.

344
00:46:53,134 --> 00:46:53,874
[SPEAKER_15]: That's been tabled.

345
00:46:54,825 --> 00:47:14,300
[SPEAKER_15]: So 16-021, to the Honorable President, members of the Medford City Council, re-amendment to Division 4 by the addition of a Division 4A entitled Chief of Staff and Policy, and further adding Section 2680 entitled Appointments and Duties.

346
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:23,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear Mr. President and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following amendment to Division 4 by the addition of a

347
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:31,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Division 4A, entitled Chief of Staff and Policy, and further adding Section 2680, entitled Appointment and Duties.

348
00:47:32,288 --> 00:47:45,077
[SPEAKER_15]: The purpose of this amendment to the revised ordinances is the creation of a position called Chief of Staff and Policy to advise the mayor on policy matters and to act as personnel director.

349
00:47:45,577 --> 00:47:50,901
[SPEAKER_15]: An amendment to the revised ordinances of the City Method, Article 4, Officers,

350
00:47:52,037 --> 00:48:21,152
[SPEAKER_15]: and employees division for a chief of staff and policy section two six 80 appointment and duties be it ordained by the city council of the city of Medford that article four of the revised ordinances of the city of Medford as most recently amended is hereby further amended by the addition of division for a entitled chief of staff and policy and further adding section two dash six 80 entitled appointment and duties said section shall state

351
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:25,837
[SPEAKER_15]: there shall be a chief of staff and policy who shall be appointed by the mayor.

352
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:30,380
[SPEAKER_15]: The duties of the chief of staff and policy shall include the following.

353
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,282
[SPEAKER_15]: A, advise the mayor on matters of municipal policy.

354
00:48:34,822 --> 00:48:39,324
[SPEAKER_15]: B, manage communications and information both to and from the office of mayor.

355
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:50,390
[SPEAKER_15]: C, act as director of personnel being responsible for advising the mayor on matters of employee compensation, benefits administration, and fostering employee services

356
00:48:50,937 --> 00:48:53,538
[SPEAKER_15]: safely, safety, and welfare.

357
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:58,660
[SPEAKER_15]: D, advise the mayor and department heads on matters of employee discipline.

358
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:08,744
[SPEAKER_15]: E, be responsible for representing the mayor in all collective bargaining sessions, including all grievances, arbitrations, and all matters relating thereto.

359
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:12,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Respectfully submitted, Stephanie Muccini-Burke, mayor.

360
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:18,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, the city solicitor is here to report to us on this matter.

361
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

362
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:38,163
[SPEAKER_18]: On paper 16-021, this is not an amendment to an existing ordinance, but rather the creation of a new ordinance which would provide for a chief of staff and policy to work in the executive office with the duties you've just described.

363
00:49:38,884 --> 00:49:47,670
[SPEAKER_18]: As I said in the committee of the whole meeting, Mayor Burke has indicated that chief of staff and her vision would be beneficial to the city.

364
00:49:48,077 --> 00:50:08,421
[SPEAKER_18]: And in order to implement that vision, this is a position that she puts forth to you as a positive recommendation in order for her to allow the executive branch to move forward in a fashion which is filled with discernment and filled in a way that a professional attitude and professional advice can be given to her by a chief of staff.

365
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:15,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, if I may, the one thing that a chief of staff can bring, because I've seen it in other people,

366
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:27,681
[SPEAKER_18]: who have held this position even though it wasn't called it, is somebody who can sit down with the mayor when the door is closed and speak frankly and openly about municipal policy and difficulties.

367
00:50:28,422 --> 00:50:40,593
[SPEAKER_18]: That provision also applies to department heads who can come in and perhaps be just as free to speak with a chief of staff without having to wait to see the mayor whose calendar is always busy

368
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:44,179
[SPEAKER_18]: and to be able to speak to the chief of staff freely and openly.

369
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:47,861
[SPEAKER_18]: And all of that serves the purposes of good government.

370
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:55,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Vice President.

371
00:50:55,746 --> 00:50:57,407
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

372
00:50:57,427 --> 00:51:00,990
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not necessarily against this new position.

373
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:10,736
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe that, you know, maybe the $106,000 salary has to be looked at and just compared to other chiefs of staffs in our surrounding communities.

374
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:27,280
[SPEAKER_23]: I think my major concern as one counselor is a number of things that we've requested from the mayor herself with regards to seeing the big picture on the topic, on will this chief of staff need secretarial workers?

375
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:29,481
[SPEAKER_23]: What else is coming down the line?

376
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:37,946
[SPEAKER_23]: We have four or five different amendments, changes, new positions that are before us tonight, but I think we all decided to table them because

377
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:42,033
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm hearing rumors of increases in salaries in other positions.

378
00:51:42,113 --> 00:51:45,194
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm hearing rumors of other new positions that are being brought on board.

379
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:52,738
[SPEAKER_23]: And I want to make sure that it all fits within our budget that we have to come and meet on and discuss and review and approve come June.

380
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:55,139
[SPEAKER_23]: So I do want to see the big picture.

381
00:51:55,179 --> 00:52:07,025
[SPEAKER_23]: Therefore, unless anybody in the public wants to talk, I will move to table this as well until hopefully we do get a bigger picture on everything that is going to be encompassed and hopefully our

382
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:17,188
[SPEAKER_23]: seven or eight requests will help us out in that matter and enlighten us of what is coming down the line within the next six months, the big turnover and change.

383
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:26,571
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could add one thing to that, Mr. President, I heard the Councilor's concerns, the Vice President's concerns, both here and in the Committee of the Whole.

384
00:52:26,651 --> 00:52:37,975
[SPEAKER_18]: I just would like to remind the Council and those who are hearing this resolution for the first time is that, budgetarily, the Chief of Staff position will have a zero impact on this fiscal year's budget.

385
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:47,929
[SPEAKER_18]: because it is not a matter of adding dollars to this budget, but rather putting a person into this position at a classification that's already been funded.

386
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,390
[SPEAKER_18]: But I just wanted to make that clear.

387
00:52:50,130 --> 00:53:00,294
[SPEAKER_23]: On that matter, though, you also said you're not sure if, if I made through the chair, you're not sure if this person's going to need one or two or three secretaries or if they're going to be using the mayor's four secretaries.

388
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:03,015
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that is, that's an issue.

389
00:53:03,215 --> 00:53:07,377
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I also, but I did say that I'm sure that the chief of staff, like any other, uh,

390
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:16,061
[SPEAKER_18]: department head, and I use that term synonymously, will have clerical assistance because you wouldn't expect anything less.

391
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:18,943
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's my issue.

392
00:53:19,403 --> 00:53:24,647
[SPEAKER_23]: Will this assistance be from the four, I believe, four new people that are in the mayor's office now?

393
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:26,448
[SPEAKER_23]: Will we need additional secretaries?

394
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:33,313
[SPEAKER_23]: Because if you continue to add and increase salaries and add positions, that is going to have an impact on the budget.

395
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:36,015
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's where I'm hoping we can get the full picture.

396
00:53:36,075 --> 00:53:38,257
[SPEAKER_23]: And whether that's another committee of the whole meeting or

397
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:44,012
[SPEAKER_23]: written answers, I definitely want to see what's coming down the line.

398
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:49,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to table is discussed in committee of the whole, Mr. President, until the questions are answered.

399
00:53:49,635 --> 00:53:51,315
[SPEAKER_23]: I think somebody would like to speak.

400
00:53:51,756 --> 00:53:53,636
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion to table is undebatable.

401
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:55,997
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

402
00:53:56,178 --> 00:53:58,318
[SPEAKER_23]: Roll call.

403
00:53:58,338 --> 00:54:01,700
[SPEAKER_23]: I withdraw my motion to table to allow residents to speak on the matter.

404
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:03,113
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

405
00:54:03,293 --> 00:54:04,814
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

406
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:05,395
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

407
00:54:05,415 --> 00:54:06,475
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Robert Penter.

408
00:54:06,515 --> 00:54:22,625
[SPEAKER_25]: I live at Zero Summit Road in Massachusetts, and I think we're in an area right now where we have a unique opportunity to really look at what our audiences are saying and where we can be going, because if we're going to relegate ourselves to changing audiences, maybe we should just look at the total picture.

409
00:54:22,665 --> 00:54:26,788
[SPEAKER_25]: The total picture revolves itself around to the victor goes to spoils, and I understand that.

410
00:54:27,743 --> 00:54:34,125
[SPEAKER_25]: But rather than change our municipal ordinance or any ordinance, maybe we ought to take advantage of what the law already allows for.

411
00:54:35,546 --> 00:54:41,027
[SPEAKER_25]: The new administration does have a unique opportunity to hire any individual he or she would like.

412
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:54,292
[SPEAKER_25]: Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 4, Section 7, Sixth A, allows for coterminous appointments that would exist to that of the mayor in this particular situation.

413
00:54:54,763 --> 00:55:00,927
[SPEAKER_25]: And what would happen there, that the individual who would be appointed would not be subject to any municipal ordinance.

414
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:15,898
[SPEAKER_25]: They would just be subject to this particular law, which happens to be state statute, and every person that's in the mayor's office, which is an administrative appointment, would find itself in a co-terminus position as it relates to the term that the mayor sits in that office.

415
00:55:16,598 --> 00:55:22,122
[SPEAKER_25]: If, in fact, a new mayor were to come in in the future, the person sitting in that position would then be reviewed

416
00:55:22,505 --> 00:55:31,187
[SPEAKER_25]: at a subsequent time by the then new mayor for the purposes of whether they continue to be coterminous or whether in fact they are going to be eliminated.

417
00:55:31,587 --> 00:55:36,988
[SPEAKER_25]: They would come under the same privileges of having a review to their job, their job application, and what have you.

418
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:44,310
[SPEAKER_25]: The second portion that you would have to look at is these individuals are serving at an at-will position.

419
00:55:45,165 --> 00:55:49,149
[SPEAKER_25]: The mayor chooses individuals to work in that particular office, his or her office.

420
00:55:49,650 --> 00:56:00,202
[SPEAKER_25]: And by looking at having that person sit in that particular office, you have to take into consideration the fact that are we putting people in there because of a municipal ordinance?

421
00:56:00,302 --> 00:56:02,644
[SPEAKER_25]: Are we putting people in there because it's going to be coterminous?

422
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:04,947
[SPEAKER_25]: Are we putting those people in there because they're at will?

423
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:15,475
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, if you look at all the state rules and laws and regulations as it relates to at-will contracts, you can have these made in such a way that you can fire them and hire them anytime they want.

424
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:16,756
[SPEAKER_25]: They can leave anytime they want.

425
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:22,180
[SPEAKER_25]: You can have an employment contract that basically relegates what their terms and duties are in this particular office.

426
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:28,345
[SPEAKER_25]: And to do that, that sets the tempo of making sure that you do have and you have hired the right person.

427
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:33,789
[SPEAKER_25]: For example, you might hire somebody and the person just doesn't work out six, seven months down the road.

428
00:56:34,249 --> 00:56:35,130
[SPEAKER_25]: Then what are you going to do?

429
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:47,173
[SPEAKER_25]: If you stick with the municipal ordinance the way it is, you're not going to have the same luxury of either an at-will or a coterminous type of an individual, because that way the other review factor would be part and parcel of what's going on.

430
00:56:48,134 --> 00:56:57,257
[SPEAKER_25]: Second of all, and more importantly, whether it's this position or any other position, you have to look at the conflict of interest issue that revolves around the people in this particular case.

431
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:05,140
[SPEAKER_25]: In this particular case, you already have one individual that's working in the office, I believe it was on or about January,

432
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:11,732
[SPEAKER_25]: in January, early January, and this individual also happens to be on the, on the transition team.

433
00:57:12,372 --> 00:57:22,200
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, being on a transition team and also getting paid by the city of Medford for being an individual working in the mayor's office right now, I think presents itself, Mr. Solicitor.

434
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,564
[SPEAKER_25]: And I asked the question, I begged the question, so to speak, is there a conflict of interest?

435
00:57:26,604 --> 00:57:30,407
[SPEAKER_25]: Because the impartiality of a transition team is supposed to bring the recommendations

436
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:31,830
[SPEAKER_25]: to the administration.

437
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:46,393
[SPEAKER_25]: But when you're getting paid by the administration, and you're also on this transition team, you're also, I think, if you look under the conflict of interest law, you're possibly looking or possibly indicating that there could be a conflict, there might be a conflict, or it could appear to be a conflict.

438
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:50,394
[SPEAKER_25]: And really, that's what you don't want right now, especially starting off with a brand new administration.

439
00:57:51,194 --> 00:57:56,755
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would suggest to my colleagues, as you review this thing in your committee of the whole, that you

440
00:57:57,083 --> 00:58:13,852
[SPEAKER_25]: look into this thing a little bit further, over and beyond changing a municipal ordinance or adding or subtracting to it, and look at the term that's allowed by state statute under the term of being either coterminous or at-will employees, because your responsibility back to the taxpayers is not the same as that of the administration.

441
00:58:14,672 --> 00:58:22,216
[SPEAKER_25]: If you appropriate money for those particular positions, the question then becomes, after that appropriation, you have absolutely no control.

442
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:24,497
[SPEAKER_25]: You'll have absolutely no control over that employee.

443
00:58:25,093 --> 00:58:27,674
[SPEAKER_25]: other than the chief executive officer making the final decision.

444
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:31,257
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you want to ask the hard questions, this is the time to do it.

445
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:53,329
[SPEAKER_25]: But you do have options, and your options are either serve coterminously, number one, at will, number two, and more importantly, I think you really need to look at the conflict of interest that presently exists in the office, because I don't think it's right that someone who's on the transition team at the same time is getting paid well in excess of $90,000 to sit in the mayor's office at the present time and take on another job and duty and responsibility.

446
00:58:53,608 --> 00:58:58,990
[SPEAKER_25]: the same job and duty of responsibility that will come up in the next issue that's going to be presented before you.

447
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:05,453
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think you really need to look at this thing more in its totality as to what's going on.

448
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:07,654
[SPEAKER_25]: And I really think Councilor Lungo-Kern is right.

449
00:59:08,174 --> 00:59:20,539
[SPEAKER_25]: I think you need a listing of every single person, their job classification, who they're replacing, and more importantly, what's the difference in the salaries, because that's going to make a big difference as to why are we making these changes at all and for what reason.

450
00:59:21,113 --> 00:59:22,094
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think you deserve that.

451
00:59:22,114 --> 00:59:23,614
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's what transparency is all about.

452
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:25,915
[SPEAKER_25]: And you should not be afraid to ask the question.

453
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:27,496
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the taxpayer's money.

454
00:59:28,257 --> 00:59:35,780
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's your duty and responsibility, as it was mine when I was sitting on that side, to make sure that the money was accounted for properly and appropriately.

455
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,762
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's it, if anyone wants to ask any questions.

456
00:59:55,212 --> 01:00:11,075
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-022 to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, re-amendment to Article 5, Finance Division 2, Procurement Section 2931, entitled Procurement Office or Appointment Term and Authority.

457

469
01:02:08,276 --> 01:02:12,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Article 5 of Finance, Division 2, Budget and Procurement, Section 2, 931.

470
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:15,520
[SPEAKER_15]: I've made a mistake in reading.

471
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,982
[SPEAKER_15]: It originally said March, so it's going to be amended for the new one.

472
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:20,593
[SPEAKER_15]: to reach January.

473
01:02:21,034 --> 01:02:24,355
[SPEAKER_15]: There shall be a Chief Budget and Procurement Officer who shall be appointed by the Mayor.

474
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:31,198
[SPEAKER_15]: He or she shall hold office for a term of three years from the first Monday of January in the year of her appointment.

475
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:49,145
[SPEAKER_15]: The Chief Budget and Procurement Officer shall, in collaboration with the various departments, A, annually prepare and submit a proposed operating budget and capital improvement budget to the Mayor on a timely basis for submission to the City Council, B, attend all City Council budget subcommittee meetings,

[SPEAKER_15]: Committee of the whole meetings and regular or specially scheduled meetings of the Medford City Council that pertain to budgets.

477
01:02:55,888 --> 01:02:57,789
[SPEAKER_15]: C, have charge of the purchasing department.

478
01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:03,370
[SPEAKER_15]: D, perform all duties required of a chief procurement officer under Massachusetts general laws.

479
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,251

482
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:19,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Solicitor.

483
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:21,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Mr. President.

484
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:25,223
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, this is one of the amendments that was talked about in the Committee of the Whole.

485
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:34,070
[SPEAKER_18]: This would take the position of Chief Procurement Officer and graft onto it, if you will, the position of Chief Budget Officer.

486
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:43,618
[SPEAKER_18]: As will come up later in the proposed amendments, that salaried position would go from a CAF 16 to a CAF 19.

487
01:03:43,718 --> 01:03:47,661
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would bring together the marriage of two different positions.

488
01:03:48,353 --> 01:03:49,913
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the purpose of this amendment.

489
01:03:56,636 --> 01:04:00,837
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Luglocurrent to table, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

490
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:03,418
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion.

491
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:06,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

492
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:15,421
[SPEAKER_19]: It was brought up by Councilor Caviello during a Committee of the Whole meeting that the position of procurement officer requires a special license.

493
01:04:16,122 --> 01:04:16,322
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

494
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:23,095
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, this new job title is Procurement Plus Budget Director.

495
01:04:23,895 --> 01:04:30,797
[SPEAKER_19]: And as Councilor Caviello mentioned so eloquently inside the Committee of the Whole meeting, is that Louise Miller now has her license.

496
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:40,340
[SPEAKER_19]: But what's to say the next person that's hired is going to have that procurement license or is brought in for budgeting and doesn't have a procurement license?

497
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,542
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think the administration is tying their hands with putting both positions.

498
01:04:47,112 --> 01:04:47,512
[SPEAKER_19]: together.

499
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:48,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

500
01:04:48,432 --> 01:04:54,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, let's, let's go through, let's peel back a couple of the issues that you've just alluded to and ascribed to Councilor Caviello.

501
01:04:54,774 --> 01:04:56,454
[SPEAKER_18]: First, the idea of certification.

502
01:04:56,914 --> 01:05:04,816
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, Louise Miller is properly certified to be a procurement officer, whether or not in the future, Mr. Or Mrs. Smith or Ms.

503
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:11,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Smith might apply for the position and not have that, that type of determination is going to have to wait to the future.

504
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:12,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Secondly,

505
01:05:12,934 --> 01:05:28,979
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as tying hands go, if Louise Miller is also the budget officer here, she will report as the budget officer to the chief finance auditor and, excuse me, in the procurement to chief finance auditor and to the budget to the mayor.

506
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:41,043
[SPEAKER_18]: If the mayor at some time in the future decides that Louise Miller should not do both jobs, then she will surely have a discussion with Louise Miller and that will probably end in a way which will have her stop doing one.

507
01:05:41,548 --> 01:05:42,709
[SPEAKER_18]: The point is this.

508
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:49,555
[SPEAKER_18]: We can go forward into the future and look at different nuances, different combinations and say, what if this?

509
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:50,656
[SPEAKER_18]: How about that?

510
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:58,083
[SPEAKER_18]: This could happen, but what we are is in January of 2016 with a new mayor who's decided

511
01:05:58,386 --> 01:06:01,388
[SPEAKER_18]: that this is the way she wants to proceed with her administration.

512
01:06:01,788 --> 01:06:12,316
[SPEAKER_18]: So while I, like everyone else, would like to have a crystal ball and to make sure that nothing goes awry in the future, what we have to do is to act on the basis of the facts as they exist now.

513
01:06:12,776 --> 01:06:13,897
[SPEAKER_18]: I say this respectfully.

514
01:06:16,979 --> 01:06:18,320
[SPEAKER_19]: I take it respectfully.

515
01:06:20,382 --> 01:06:24,645
[SPEAKER_19]: My only issue is that when Louise Miller was originally hired, she was hired as

516
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:27,146
[SPEAKER_19]: the procurement officer.

517
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:31,388
[SPEAKER_19]: And then her description morphed into a number of items.

518
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:37,713
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not, to be quite frank with you, I'm not opposed to any of the changes that is offered by the administration.

519
01:06:38,093 --> 01:06:39,354
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a long time coming.

520
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:54,024
[SPEAKER_19]: I was hoping to see a constituent person, which was mentioned on many, many occasions, something that I feel is needed, in addition to a chief of staff, someone that will handle the constituent calls and be able to get back to people in a timely fashion.

521
01:06:54,397 --> 01:06:55,378
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've yet to see that.

522
01:06:55,458 --> 01:07:01,602
[SPEAKER_19]: But my only concern is that many of these positions have morphed into other positions over the years.

523
01:07:02,243 --> 01:07:07,646
[SPEAKER_19]: And as we know, we used to have a director of personnel and a budget director that no longer exist.

524
01:07:07,987 --> 01:07:22,377
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we had someone that was a procurement officer that was doing the duties, because as far as I know, Louise was still signing off on the paperwork and also was budget director and I believe at some point was personnel director.

525
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,077
[SPEAKER_19]: That's correct.

526
01:07:23,137 --> 01:07:23,838
[SPEAKER_19]: For a period of time.

527
01:07:24,465 --> 01:07:27,948
[SPEAKER_19]: That position morphed into three what I would consider department heads.

528
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:47,587
[SPEAKER_19]: So I only bring up that issue because I would hate to create a city ordinance and then in six months from now, a year, two years, whatever it might be, be unable to find a person that suits the procurement requirements, which is certification, and also the budgeting requirements.

529
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:56,109
[SPEAKER_19]: And that may be a special person that is unique to Louise and not unique to a lot of people out there in that profession.

530
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:06,697
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand your sentiments, Counselor, but I would also say, and I'm probably preaching to the choir on this, ordinances like other enactments, other regulatory schemes are always in a state of flux.

531
01:08:07,158 --> 01:08:11,081
[SPEAKER_18]: They reflect the needs and the desires of the government at that particular time.

532
01:08:11,581 --> 01:08:16,785
[SPEAKER_18]: So if there are needs that are unforeseen right now in the future, I'm sure that this Council in its wisdom

533
01:08:17,102 --> 01:08:20,103
[SPEAKER_18]: and the mayor in her wisdom will take appropriate action to address that.

534
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,984
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying that to be a funny guy.

535
01:08:22,304 --> 01:08:29,847
[SPEAKER_18]: What I'm saying is that this is not necessarily the end of proposals from this administration, certainly not the first night.

536
01:08:30,427 --> 01:08:45,372
[SPEAKER_18]: And so when you talk about the need for this officer or that officer, no one should draw the inference that these amendments and proposed amendments tonight or new ordinances is the end of the universe as far as proposals from this administration.

537
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,941
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what they are because I'm not the mayor.

538
01:08:48,321 --> 01:08:54,062
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do know that ordinances are always, and views of government, are always fluid.

539
01:08:54,102 --> 01:08:55,663
[SPEAKER_18]: They're always in a state of flux.

540
01:08:56,063 --> 01:08:57,383
[SPEAKER_18]: So I understand your sentiments.

541
01:08:57,783 --> 01:09:00,764
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think anyone's saying that this is the end and the final.

542
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:04,125
[SPEAKER_19]: But, you know, for many years, we've received piecemeal.

543
01:09:04,965 --> 01:09:12,587
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the biggest issues with this council, besides transparency, was the fact that we receive things in piecemeal form.

544
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:15,068
[SPEAKER_19]: And as we receive tonight,

545
01:09:15,692 --> 01:09:20,576
[SPEAKER_19]: These are great first steps, but I as one, like Councilor Longo mentioned, would like to see the overall picture.

546
01:09:21,017 --> 01:09:25,500
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the current organizational chart of the administration?

547
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,421
[SPEAKER_19]: What's it going to look like?

548
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:28,743
[SPEAKER_19]: What's the additional staff that's going to be needed?

549
01:09:29,263 --> 01:09:31,545
[SPEAKER_19]: There's talk about a 3-1-1 system.

550
01:09:32,226 --> 01:09:41,033
[SPEAKER_19]: The 3-1-1 system is only as good, and we heard from Councilor Scott Pelli, who happens to work in Somerville, and they've had this system for a number of years.

551
01:09:41,392 --> 01:09:43,996
[SPEAKER_19]: It's only as good as the staff that you have on.

552
01:09:44,517 --> 01:09:49,446
[SPEAKER_19]: And we all know many of our departments, DPW, you can go through the list, are understaffed.

553
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:54,895
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's great to say we're going to implement this new program, which I've been pushing for for a number of years.

554
01:09:55,294 --> 01:10:07,743
[SPEAKER_19]: But I've yet to see any substance behind it that's going to say, with this new program, we're going to be able to staff it appropriately so people get timely calls back and their issues are addressed in a timely fashion.

555
01:10:08,023 --> 01:10:13,106
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are the things, I guess, I'm not part of that 28-person transition committee.

556
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:16,729
[SPEAKER_19]: But these are the things that I have questions on.

557
01:10:17,309 --> 01:10:20,031
[SPEAKER_19]: And the reason why we asked that it be tabled is

558
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:22,196
[SPEAKER_19]: that we see an overall picture.

559
01:10:23,977 --> 01:10:25,237
[SPEAKER_18]: I follow that, Councilor Mox.

560
01:10:25,297 --> 01:10:28,739
[SPEAKER_18]: And like you, I am not a member of the transition team either.

561
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:34,442
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would also say that 311, as a citizen, I might say, is a very meritorious program.

562
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:40,265
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's also totally and completely outside of these amendment proposals this evening.

563
01:10:40,505 --> 01:10:42,086
[SPEAKER_18]: I just mentioned that parenthetically.

564
01:10:42,526 --> 01:10:42,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

565
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:45,888
[SPEAKER_23]: Motion to withdraw my motion to table.

566
01:10:47,069 --> 01:10:49,270
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion, Councilor Longo Kern has

567
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:52,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Withdrawing her motion to table.

568
01:10:53,372 --> 01:10:54,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caviello.

569
01:10:54,553 --> 01:10:55,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

570
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:56,854
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the point.

571
01:10:57,335 --> 01:11:07,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we mean any disrespect to Louise because I think we both agree that Louise Miller is very qualified to do both positions.

572
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:08,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have full confidence that she can.

573
01:11:09,362 --> 01:11:15,666
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we're both looking at the position going forward, not at this particular moment.

574
01:11:15,686 --> 01:11:18,848
[SPEAKER_13]: But I said, you know, I have full confidence that Louise

575
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:21,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Miller is competent to do both of those positions.

576
01:11:23,724 --> 01:11:24,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caravaglio.

577
01:11:25,045 --> 01:11:26,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

578
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:29,986
[SPEAKER_15]: I yield my time, Mr. President, to the gentleman at the podium.

579
01:11:31,906 --> 01:11:36,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, Mr. Gentleman at the podium, please state your name and address for the record.

580
01:11:36,968 --> 01:11:39,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Zook, 29 Garfield Ave, Medford.

581
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:46,310
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I sit here at the City Council meeting and I keep hearing about we need to raise taxes.

582
01:11:46,771 --> 01:11:47,851
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to raise taxes.

583
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:55,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the city that broke and now all of a sudden we have this abundance of money that we're going to hire all these new people?

584
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we have to look at.

585
01:11:58,971 --> 01:12:04,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just two, three weeks, two, three meetings ago we were discussing raising taxes.

586
01:12:04,938 --> 01:12:09,243
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe what came out of the committee of the whole meeting was that the sum of

587
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:21,624
[SPEAKER_14]: The financial impact on the current fiscal year's budget would be $953 for the remainder of 2015, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. President, just for personal peace of mind.

588
01:12:22,124 --> 01:12:31,827
[SPEAKER_14]: So if these ordinance changes were passed this evening, the impact it would have on this year's budget would be $953 based upon what was presented to us this evening.

589
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:33,870
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to pass it this evening.

590
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:37,431
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all agreed to table the matter until— But in the very near future, she's going to want those positions filled.

591
01:12:37,451 --> 01:12:38,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I right?

592
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:40,012
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're filled by now, is what she's saying.

593
01:12:40,032 --> 01:12:41,952
[SPEAKER_14]: She's trying to reorganize the structure of government.

594
01:12:42,012 --> 01:12:44,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, direct our comments to the chair.

595
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:45,433
[SPEAKER_14]: But they are filled already.

596
01:12:45,453 --> 01:12:46,653
[SPEAKER_15]: You've made your point of information.

597
01:12:48,834 --> 01:12:49,494
[SPEAKER_15]: You may continue.

598
01:12:49,514 --> 01:12:50,114
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I will.

599
01:12:51,475 --> 01:12:53,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

600
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:55,716
[SPEAKER_22]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

601
01:12:56,116 --> 01:13:01,617
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just wanted to—not on the positions, but on one point that the solicitor said that I was in

602
01:13:02,493 --> 01:13:08,217
[SPEAKER_22]: a definite disagreement with, all due respect, these people get paid a lot of money and they get paid to think.

603
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:14,521
[SPEAKER_22]: When I was a private in the Army, I was told point blank, you don't get paid to think, you know?

604
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:19,924
[SPEAKER_22]: And I said, I think, Sergeant, and he said, private, you don't get paid to think.

605
01:13:20,464 --> 01:13:25,968
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway, these guys get a lot of money, a lot of money.

606
01:13:26,308 --> 01:13:27,869
[SPEAKER_22]: They get paid to think about the future.

607
01:13:28,189 --> 01:13:31,231
[SPEAKER_22]: They get paid to think about what's going to happen in five years from now.

608
01:13:32,018 --> 01:13:36,179
[SPEAKER_22]: So with all due respect to the solicitor, it's not about the positions.

609
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:37,880
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, you guys wrangled that out.

610
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:44,742
[SPEAKER_22]: The point is, is that yeah, you guys are getting paid lots of money to think down the future.

611
01:13:45,122 --> 01:13:46,103
[SPEAKER_22]: And that includes the mayor.

612
01:13:46,303 --> 01:13:48,724
[SPEAKER_22]: So she needs to think what's going to happen in five years.

613
01:13:49,184 --> 01:13:50,084
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's all I wanted to say.

614
01:13:50,204 --> 01:13:50,624
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you.

615
01:13:50,664 --> 01:13:53,805
[SPEAKER_22]: And with due respect to the solicitor.

616
01:13:53,985 --> 01:13:55,606
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

617
01:13:55,626 --> 01:13:56,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

618
01:13:58,077 --> 01:13:58,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, sir.

619
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:00,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

620
01:14:01,418 --> 01:14:02,338
[SPEAKER_25]: Watch the button there, please.

621
01:14:02,378 --> 01:14:02,598
[SPEAKER_25]: I did.

622
01:14:02,998 --> 01:14:04,899
[SPEAKER_25]: Bob Penta, 07 Road Method Mask.

623
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:12,980
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd just like to bring your attention to the number F section over there, where it says report to the director of finance auditing on matters that pertain to procurement.

624
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:22,022
[SPEAKER_25]: On January 5th of this year, the city administration appointed Ann Baker to also be the city treasurer, beside being the city auditor.

625
01:14:22,602 --> 01:14:23,303
[SPEAKER_25]: She can't do that.

626
01:14:23,443 --> 01:14:23,963
[SPEAKER_25]: It's illegal.

627
01:14:24,003 --> 01:14:24,743
[SPEAKER_25]: It's against the law.

628
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:28,202
[SPEAKER_25]: and I don't even know why she's being allowed to do that.

629
01:14:29,023 --> 01:14:33,805
[SPEAKER_25]: The second section of the law is very specific as it relates to where we're going on that.

630
01:14:33,825 --> 01:14:45,791
[SPEAKER_25]: Chapter 41, section 52 states that all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of the city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties.

631
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:50,653
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, the term city auditor and town auditor is interchangeable under our state statute.

632
01:14:51,073 --> 01:14:55,215
[SPEAKER_25]: Then you go to chapter 41, section 55, and it's clear as a bell.

633
01:14:55,750 --> 01:15:04,172
[SPEAKER_25]: The town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies."

634
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,553
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I don't know where you're going with that.

635
01:15:07,693 --> 01:15:09,394
[SPEAKER_25]: I think Mr. Solicitor, you need to look at that.

636
01:15:09,534 --> 01:15:18,856
[SPEAKER_25]: I could be wrong, but the way I read that, your town auditor or your city auditor, which is Ann Baker, is also now, as of January 5th, the city's tax collector.

637
01:15:19,176 --> 01:15:21,897
[SPEAKER_25]: She can hold both those positions, a direct conflict of law.

638
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:24,209
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, it's conflict of interest, excuse me.

639
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:27,511
[SPEAKER_25]: And the law is very specific, especially chapter 41, section 55.

640
01:15:27,931 --> 01:15:34,895
[SPEAKER_25]: I think a committee of the whole is so important to understand all the ramifications, you know, what this is all about.

641
01:15:35,135 --> 01:15:45,821
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, you, as I said before, you have a lady that's a come on board from the transition team at $106,000 a year, um, as the director of budget and personnel.

642
01:15:45,901 --> 01:15:49,043
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's what her title is, unless that's going to change in the future, what have you.

643
01:15:49,866 --> 01:15:51,927
[SPEAKER_25]: These are issues that I think the council needs to know.

644
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,669
[SPEAKER_25]: I think you need to know all the names, the dollar amounts, and wherever you're going.

645
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:59,251
[SPEAKER_25]: But the conflicts that possibly and potentially arise, and this is one.

646
01:15:59,311 --> 01:16:00,252
[SPEAKER_25]: It's as clear as a bell.

647
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:01,673
[SPEAKER_25]: She got appointed in January.

648
01:16:02,033 --> 01:16:03,094
[SPEAKER_25]: She is our city auditor.

649
01:16:03,854 --> 01:16:07,156
[SPEAKER_25]: And apparently, she's going to be the city treasurer for another 60 days.

650
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:08,477
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't do it.

651
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:09,717
[SPEAKER_25]: The law is specific.

652
01:16:09,757 --> 01:16:10,698
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not me saying it.

653
01:16:11,038 --> 01:16:11,518
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the law.

654
01:16:11,558 --> 01:16:12,719
[SPEAKER_25]: You only can serve one master.

655
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:16,201
[SPEAKER_25]: You only can serve one position at one time, especially in the city or town.

656
01:16:17,233 --> 01:16:24,838
[SPEAKER_25]: And with all due respect, I just think before you guys just jump in, ladies, before you jump into this thing, I think you really need to understand the full ramifications.

657
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:28,881
[SPEAKER_25]: Not only that, but the background of the individuals that are accepting these positions.

658
01:16:29,722 --> 01:16:34,805
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, the mayor, whoever he or she might be, has that privilege of hiring whoever they want.

659
01:16:35,586 --> 01:16:38,288
[SPEAKER_25]: But if there's a potential conflict, that needs to be addressed.

660
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:46,333
[SPEAKER_25]: And then if there's also a possibility that, I'm not saying take the job out of a classification, I'm saying take the job out of a time sequence.

661
01:16:46,929 --> 01:16:56,374
[SPEAKER_25]: and make it run coterminous with the mayor, whether it's a CAF 14, 18, 22, whatever it might be, as it designated to the terminology, chief of staff, secretary.

662
01:16:56,394 --> 01:16:57,754
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got no problem with that.

663
01:16:57,794 --> 01:16:58,535
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not the issue.

664
01:16:58,575 --> 01:17:03,637
[SPEAKER_25]: The real issue is the person that's being hired, whether it's at will or whether it's coterminous.

665
01:17:03,677 --> 01:17:07,179
[SPEAKER_25]: But more importantly, in this particular case, I think it needs to be addressed immediately.

666
01:17:07,919 --> 01:17:09,500
[SPEAKER_25]: Ann Bega cannot be the city auditor.

667
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,541
[SPEAKER_25]: She cannot be the city's tax collector at the same time.

668
01:17:12,982 --> 01:17:14,642
[SPEAKER_25]: The law is specific, chapter 41, section 55,

669
01:17:16,213 --> 01:17:26,957
[SPEAKER_25]: says it, I don't say it, and I would expect that the city takes the appropriate action on that matter, just to make sure that they don't get themselves in any kind of a quandary as a conflict that possibly could exist.

670
01:17:27,637 --> 01:17:27,977
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

671
01:17:32,499 --> 01:17:39,721
[SPEAKER_18]: When a person stands up and says that there's conflict of interest, so there's something awry going on, and they just says, well, the city should take a look into it.

672
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:45,063
[SPEAKER_18]: The brush has already been used on an appointment and said,

673
01:17:45,593 --> 01:17:46,233
[SPEAKER_18]: It's illegal.

674
01:17:46,854 --> 01:18:02,825
[SPEAKER_18]: That particular statute, if you read it carefully and went through it, you'd know that it does not prohibit a temporary appointment of the city auditor to the position that she has at the city treasurer's with the retirement of the treasurer collector, Mr. Pompeo.

675
01:18:03,268 --> 01:18:18,274
[SPEAKER_18]: But to stand up and to say there's a conflict of interest on this other matter, but yet have nothing to say except to read a statute and say that's it, so you should do something, and it has nothing to do with the papers in front of you, I think that that's steep.

676
01:18:18,854 --> 01:18:20,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that that's disingenuous.

677
01:18:21,315 --> 01:18:22,896
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that that's precipitous.

678
01:18:23,988 --> 01:18:26,549
[SPEAKER_18]: There's going to be another city treasurer at some juncture.

679
01:18:26,729 --> 01:18:32,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Ann Baker is not the city treasurer for the future, but somebody has to have those duties held right now.

680
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:35,572
[SPEAKER_18]: That has nothing to do with the amendments before you.

681
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:41,613
[SPEAKER_18]: All it is is trying to just paint somebody with a black brush in order to reach another result.

682
01:18:41,854 --> 01:18:42,594
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not fair.

683
01:18:43,034 --> 01:18:47,035
[SPEAKER_18]: As a city employee, I say that's not fair, and it's not true.

684
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:50,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President?

685
01:18:50,156 --> 01:18:51,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Vice President Longo.

686
01:18:51,817 --> 01:18:52,977
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll yield to Councilor Marks.

687
01:18:53,485 --> 01:18:58,947
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no yielding chair recognizes counselor marks.

688
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,028
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

689
01:19:00,988 --> 01:19:11,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe Mr. Solicitor, if you could answer something that does the treasure collector report to the city auditor in the normal course?

690
01:19:11,392 --> 01:19:11,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

691
01:19:12,353 --> 01:19:17,275
[SPEAKER_19]: So, so I can see what you're saying, but how does the oversight exist?

692
01:19:17,721 --> 01:19:19,423
[SPEAKER_19]: when it's one and the same person?

693
01:19:19,904 --> 01:19:25,031
[SPEAKER_18]: That is a legitimate question, but it does not rise to the level of a conflict of interest which is prohibitive.

694
01:19:25,652 --> 01:19:28,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, one might say that an accountant shouldn't hold both jobs.

695
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:30,940
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be a matter of accounting standards.

696
01:19:31,548 --> 01:19:35,872
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is whether or not it's illegal under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

697
01:19:36,152 --> 01:19:40,396
[SPEAKER_18]: I've read that statute, the one that deals with towns and town accountants.

698
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:49,103
[SPEAKER_18]: And you'd really have to stretch that statute to say that it would put the appointment of the finance auditor into conflict of interest.

699
01:19:50,057 --> 01:20:03,260
[SPEAKER_18]: What has to happen is the machine of the city in terms of finances and dollars has to move, and it will move until there's a treasurer-collector appointed, which hopefully won't be in the distant future.

700
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,581
[SPEAKER_18]: But we looked at that statute, and I looked at it specifically, read it line at a time.

701
01:20:08,881 --> 01:20:14,042
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd really have to stretch that to say that it's illegal to undertake a temporary appointment.

702
01:20:14,812 --> 01:20:17,975
[SPEAKER_19]: So, so getting back to the question regarding the auditor's responsibility.

703
01:20:18,015 --> 01:20:18,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

704
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:22,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Then where is the oversight now with the treasurer collector?

705
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:25,601
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it within an Baker in the auditor's position?

706
01:20:25,841 --> 01:20:26,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it would have to be.

707
01:20:27,482 --> 01:20:34,708
[SPEAKER_18]: So she, she will be overseeing on a temporary basis, her office and the treasurer's office, right?

708
01:20:34,868 --> 01:20:35,789
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the one person.

709
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:37,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that is true.

710
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:40,092
[SPEAKER_19]: So she has a concern in the treasurer collector's office.

711
01:20:40,973 --> 01:20:41,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

712
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,722
[SPEAKER_19]: She reports back as the acting treasurer-collector.

713
01:20:45,782 --> 01:20:47,563
[SPEAKER_19]: As incongruous as that may sound.

714
01:20:49,104 --> 01:20:49,204
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

715
01:20:49,385 --> 01:20:53,207
[SPEAKER_19]: And why is it assistant treasurer-collector?

716
01:20:53,747 --> 01:20:54,308
[SPEAKER_19]: There is one.

717
01:20:54,728 --> 01:20:57,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would that person not assume the responsibilities?

718
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:01,312
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a question which is not before me, because that was never broached.

719
01:21:02,593 --> 01:21:03,774
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a very valid question.

720
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:04,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, but it's also not.

721
01:21:04,955 --> 01:21:06,536
[SPEAKER_18]: You have a very capable person in that role.

722
01:21:06,556 --> 01:21:10,958
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a number of questions which are valid, reasonable, but are yet not before us.

723
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:14,328
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

724
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:15,548
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

725
01:21:15,808 --> 01:21:21,069
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, I would like to make a response since the city solicitor challenged.

726
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:22,710
[SPEAKER_25]: Point of order, Councilor Knight.

727
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:30,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really think that it's an appropriate forum for a citizen and a city employee to be debating at the floor of the city council meeting.

728
01:21:30,431 --> 01:21:30,931
[SPEAKER_14]: It isn't.

729
01:21:31,071 --> 01:21:33,091
[SPEAKER_14]: We've met, we've had our committee of the whole meeting.

730
01:21:33,131 --> 01:21:35,952
[SPEAKER_14]: We have some questions that need to be answered, Mr. President, and that's all well and good.

731
01:21:35,972 --> 01:21:39,253
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to be having another committee of the whole meeting on that when those questions do get answered.

732
01:21:40,013 --> 01:21:41,933
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I don't feel as though it's appropriate for

733
01:21:42,507 --> 01:21:46,990
[SPEAKER_14]: individual citizen and a member of the administration to go back and forth at the podium here at the City Council meeting.

734
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it detracts from what we're here to do.

735
01:21:49,132 --> 01:21:49,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

736
01:21:49,913 --> 01:21:50,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

737
01:21:54,396 --> 01:21:57,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Sir, this isn't an opportunity for you to debate.

738
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:04,323
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a meeting of the City Council and this is a meeting of the City Council.

739
01:22:05,484 --> 01:22:07,726
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a meeting of the City Council, Mr. Penta.

740
01:22:14,881 --> 01:22:21,444
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll address my comments back to the City Council so we don't have to have a discourse back and forth between my friend, the City Solicitor, and myself.

741
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:28,708
[SPEAKER_25]: If he wanted to take that one step further as to what I said, I didn't say it was illegal, I said it has potential for conflict of interest.

742
01:22:28,948 --> 01:22:30,409
[SPEAKER_25]: And Councilman Marks is absolutely right.

743
01:22:30,849 --> 01:22:42,815
[SPEAKER_25]: If there is at present an Assistant City, what's her name, Treasurer, no, Mrs. Baker, an Assistant, there's two Assistants in both of those offices.

744
01:22:43,562 --> 01:22:51,010
[SPEAKER_25]: Whether it's Ann Baker as the auditor or Fred Pompeo's office as an assistant, they both have two capable individuals that could assume either one of those roles.

745
01:22:51,571 --> 01:23:05,005
[SPEAKER_25]: And my argument is, and it's very specific in here, I have a difference of opinion with my city solicitor friend, whether either one of those two assistants assume the position, but making one person assume both of them when you have other people just as capable

746
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:08,208
[SPEAKER_25]: and able to do the job presents and begs the issue.

747
01:23:08,668 --> 01:23:09,749
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's what the issue is.

748
01:23:10,189 --> 01:23:12,171
[SPEAKER_25]: How's the checks and balances going to take place?

749
01:23:12,711 --> 01:23:17,254
[SPEAKER_25]: A city auditor is supposed to be the checks and balances as to how and when the city spends its money.

750
01:23:18,195 --> 01:23:27,582
[SPEAKER_25]: So if the city auditor wants to challenge, you know, what the treasurer-collector has done in the past, which has been her job, now that person is assuming both those positions.

751
01:23:28,302 --> 01:23:34,827
[SPEAKER_25]: She will have a conflict between herself as to what role am I supposed to play, the auditor or the treasurer-collector?

752
01:23:35,207 --> 01:23:36,468
[SPEAKER_25]: And that makes no sense at all.

753
01:23:36,788 --> 01:23:47,016
[SPEAKER_25]: And especially since you have the personnel that are in this building, well qualified, work their way up to the ranks, they should be given that opportunity rather than even get into this discourse that we're having right now.

754
01:23:47,396 --> 01:23:48,677
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what begs the question.

755
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:50,258
[SPEAKER_25]: Why are we even discussing this?

756
01:23:50,278 --> 01:23:51,299
[SPEAKER_25]: There is no need for this.

757
01:23:51,859 --> 01:23:56,622
[SPEAKER_25]: You have people in this building, they're getting paid, they've been trained, and they do their job well.

758
01:23:57,343 --> 01:24:04,028
[SPEAKER_25]: But to take one person and put it in charge of two, which is the checks and balance person, how do you checks and balance yourself?

759
01:24:05,234 --> 01:24:06,294
[SPEAKER_25]: That doesn't make any sense.

760
01:24:07,415 --> 01:24:08,755
[SPEAKER_25]: The law is very specific.

761
01:24:09,475 --> 01:24:10,636
[SPEAKER_25]: You only can serve one thing.

762
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:15,137
[SPEAKER_25]: And whether it's temporary or not temporary, we're not at that juncture of the road.

763
01:24:15,657 --> 01:24:21,919
[SPEAKER_25]: Where we are right now is the fact that you have personnel that are capable and able of doing the position.

764
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:25,780
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's what you should be talking about, and that's what should be being addressed.

765
01:24:26,301 --> 01:24:31,862
[SPEAKER_25]: Not one person assuming two positions and scratching their head and saying, what would happen if something were to happen?

766
01:24:33,203 --> 01:24:33,523
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

767
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:56,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, I do believe that the executive branch of our municipal government does have something that will be called administrative prerogative, Mr. President, which would be the right to hire, fire, and create positions that they see fit if they fall within the scope of our ordinance.

768
01:24:56,987 --> 01:25:03,150
[SPEAKER_14]: With that being said, Mr. President, I motion that we table the matter until all questions are answered as previously discussed and agreed upon in the committee of the whole.

769
01:25:03,522 --> 01:25:06,024
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to table by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

770
01:25:06,705 --> 01:25:07,426
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

771
01:25:08,406 --> 01:25:10,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you again, Mr. President.

790
01:27:50,559 --> 01:28:02,626
[SPEAKER_18]: These amendments would apply to the compensation schedule, and they would mirror and mimic the ordinance changes or creation that have been talked about in the earlier three papers.

791
01:28:03,867 --> 01:28:06,308
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we went over them fairly deeply in the Committee of the Whole.

792
01:28:06,738 --> 01:28:14,164
[SPEAKER_18]: basically what they would do is ascribe a salary classification to each one of the positions as amended or as created.

793
01:28:15,185 --> 01:28:16,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Chair recognizes the Vice President.

804
01:29:42,444 --> 01:29:46,488
[SPEAKER_15]: That same section presently states, generally, all...

805
01:29:48,900 --> 01:30:06,672
[SPEAKER_15]: permanent officers and employees of the city with the exceptions noted in section 66-61 shall receive a vacation without loss of pay in each calendar year if he or she has actually worked for 30 weeks in the aggregate during the 12 months preceding June 1st in such calendar year.

806
01:30:07,312 --> 01:30:08,713
[SPEAKER_15]: The language of said vacation

807
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,843

808
01:30:15,303 --> 01:30:22,467
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm taking the amended version that was presented to us by the solicitor and committee of the whole.

809
01:30:22,527 --> 01:30:24,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct, Mr. Soliciting?

810
01:30:24,388 --> 01:30:25,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

811
01:30:25,449 --> 01:30:29,571
[SPEAKER_15]: So the amended one shall be read into the record tonight, the one that you distributed to us.

812
01:30:29,592 --> 01:30:32,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, because the other one had a phrase in it that should have been corrected.

813
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:33,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

814
01:30:34,034 --> 01:30:37,276
[SPEAKER_15]: So the language of said section 66-64 shall be amended

815
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,508
[SPEAKER_15]: to read as follows.

816
01:30:41,529 --> 01:30:42,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Vacation.

817
01:30:42,329 --> 01:30:42,729
[SPEAKER_15]: General.

818
01:30:43,609 --> 01:30:58,673
[SPEAKER_15]: All permanent officers and employees of the city, with the exception of noted in section 66-61, shall receive a vacation without loss of pay in each calendar year, which shall be based on the number of years of their employment.

819
01:30:59,233 --> 01:31:08,356
[SPEAKER_15]: During the first six months following the inception of the employment, said permanent officers and employees of the city may not utilize any vacation time

820
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:15,325
[SPEAKER_15]: but this requirement shall not prohibit the accrual of the same during that six month period.

821
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:16,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Solicitor.

822
01:31:18,108 --> 01:31:20,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you again, Mr. President and members of the council.

823
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:24,413
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an amendment that this really had been talked about for some years.

824
01:31:25,353 --> 01:31:37,023
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the ordinance that deals with, uh, working, uh, the aggregate of 30 weeks before, uh, in the 12 months before June one in any calendar year,

825
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:39,879
[SPEAKER_18]: is an odd thing to apply.

826
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:45,881
[SPEAKER_18]: This just clarifies that and says, doesn't change any vacation, doesn't add any vacation.

827
01:31:46,281 --> 01:31:52,824
[SPEAKER_18]: It just says when a new employee comes into the city's employment, that for the first six months, they can't take any vacation.

828
01:31:53,384 --> 01:31:57,986
[SPEAKER_18]: However, they will accrue the vacation and be able to take it at the end of the six months.

829
01:31:58,806 --> 01:32:01,207
[SPEAKER_18]: It has no budgetary impact on anything.

830
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:02,448
[SPEAKER_18]: It is clear.

831
01:32:02,908 --> 01:32:04,668
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a good personnel policy.

832
01:32:05,029 --> 01:32:05,809
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will say this,

833
01:32:06,518 --> 01:32:19,241
[SPEAKER_18]: The first time that this was talked about was years ago, and the person who talked to me about it was President Mayor Burke when she was in the personnel position, and she was going over the rules and said, this doesn't make sense, and it needs to be cleared up.

834
01:32:19,722 --> 01:32:26,583
[SPEAKER_18]: And when she mentioned it to me after she was sworn in, she said, do you remember what we said a few years ago about vacation?

835
01:32:26,823 --> 01:32:27,684
[SPEAKER_18]: And she had her notes.

836
01:32:28,244 --> 01:32:29,644
[SPEAKER_18]: This reflects those notes.

837
01:32:29,804 --> 01:32:30,424
[SPEAKER_18]: It's clear.

838
01:32:30,984 --> 01:32:32,405
[SPEAKER_18]: It's good personnel policy.

839
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:38,812
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't think, um, I know the questions that you've asked on those other positions and table those papers.

840
01:32:40,153 --> 01:32:46,257
[SPEAKER_18]: I suggest, and I recommend that this one be acted upon because I think it's a good change and a clear change.

841
01:32:46,918 --> 01:32:56,404
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, it doesn't have any budgetary impact and it assists all employees, especially those who are new to understand what their obligations are.

842
01:32:58,585 --> 01:33:01,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Move approval on the motion for approval by

843
01:33:01,612 --> 01:33:04,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight, this would be the first reading on this ordinance change.

844
01:33:07,575 --> 01:33:11,917
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

845
01:33:12,037 --> 01:33:14,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll for the first reading.

Yes.

01:33:24,883 --> 01:33:25,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

851
01:33:25,503 --> 01:33:25,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

852
01:33:25,983 --> 01:33:27,764
Vice President Leno-Kern.

853
01:33:27,804 --> 01:33:27,924
Yes.

854
01:33:28,585 --> 01:33:29,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Miles.

855
01:33:29,405 --> 01:33:29,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

856
01:33:29,945 --> 01:33:30,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

857
01:33:30,826 --> 01:33:31,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

858
01:33:31,923 --> 01:33:32,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

859
01:33:32,424 --> 01:33:35,206
[SPEAKER_15]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

860
01:33:35,626 --> 01:33:36,887
[SPEAKER_15]: It passes the first reading.

861
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:39,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to waive the additional readings, Mr. President.

862
01:33:39,969 --> 01:33:45,113
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to waive the additional readings.

863
01:33:46,434 --> 01:33:47,295
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

864
01:33:48,316 --> 01:33:49,096
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

865
01:33:50,097 --> 01:33:51,298

[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falcone?

869
01:34:00,694 --> 01:34:00,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

870
01:34:01,515 --> 01:34:02,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Nye?

871
01:34:02,275 --> 01:34:02,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

872
01:34:02,995 --> 01:34:03,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Long-Term?

873
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:04,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

874
01:34:05,695 --> 01:34:06,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Monk?

875
01:34:06,196 --> 01:34:06,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

876
01:34:08,136 --> 01:34:08,616

15.

882
01:34:20,438 --> 01:34:21,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

883
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:21,679
[SPEAKER_14]: 16-024 is ordained.

884
01:34:24,944 --> 01:34:26,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business, Mr. President.

885
01:34:27,026 --> 01:34:29,768
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business.

886
01:34:29,828 --> 01:34:30,569
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

887
01:34:31,029 --> 01:34:31,830
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

888
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:34,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

889
01:34:34,452 --> 01:34:42,498
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-014 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold the Committee of the Whole to discuss and establish goals and priorities for 2016.

890
01:34:42,899 --> 01:34:43,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

891
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

892
01:34:46,462 --> 01:34:54,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Two years ago when I was sworn in as a councilor, we began an exercise where we would meet in the Committee of the Whole to establish goals and priorities for this council moving forward.

893
01:34:54,807 --> 01:35:02,471
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd use that as a template and a basis for our direction as we continue to make legislation here as a legislative body in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

894
01:35:02,491 --> 01:35:08,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was a very helpful endeavor, and it also allowed us an opportunity to begin to prepare for budget discussions.

895
01:35:08,535 --> 01:35:20,122
[SPEAKER_14]: When I look at the agenda for this evening, I do see another paper on there offered by Councilor Falco relative to establishing a budget template and budget formats, which I'm going to be in full support of tonight, Mr. President.

896
01:35:20,142 --> 01:35:24,224
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that this is really a good way for us to start the discussion and to look forward to June.

897
01:35:24,611 --> 01:35:29,554
[SPEAKER_14]: to see what our priorities are, what steps we're going to take to keep Metro moving in the right direction and to improve the way that we do business.

898
01:35:30,414 --> 01:35:30,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

899
01:35:30,954 --> 01:35:32,715
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

900
01:35:33,496 --> 01:35:37,278
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

901
01:35:37,298 --> 01:35:37,998
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

902
01:35:38,538 --> 01:35:39,059
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

903
01:35:39,339 --> 01:35:39,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

904
01:35:46,263 --> 01:35:50,485
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello to take 16-025 out of order.

905
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:51,786
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

906
01:35:52,486 --> 01:35:53,326
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

907
01:35:53,627 --> 01:35:54,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

908
01:35:55,531 --> 01:36:09,094
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-025 offered by Councilor Caviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the Mayor examine the possibility of establishing a Veterans Advisory Committee as allowed by Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 115, Section 12.

909
01:36:10,454 --> 01:36:11,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caviello.

910
01:36:11,754 --> 01:36:12,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

911
01:36:12,795 --> 01:36:23,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I've looked into this, and we have a Veterans Department here, and I am the Veterans Subcommittee Chairman, and Mr. Lindsey does a very good job in what he does, but

912
01:36:25,732 --> 01:36:31,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I think his office is understaffed and could use probably some help on some things.

913
01:36:32,217 --> 01:36:43,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And this would be a way at no cost for the city to put together an advisory board to give him a little bit of help in the office and maybe some guidance.

914
01:36:43,304 --> 01:36:45,306
[SPEAKER_13]: And also it would get a chance to

915
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:53,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Get some other veterans involved with the board, possibly some younger veterans, along with the old ones.

916
01:36:53,845 --> 01:36:59,509
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe we could set some policies and a direction for our veterans office in the future, Mr. President.

917
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:04,593
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I say, I would hope that Mayor Burke would take this under consideration.

918
01:37:05,373 --> 01:37:09,016
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion approved by- I think we have someone, a gentleman who would like to speak this evening.

919
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:15,140
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of council, Clerk Caviello for approval.

920
01:37:15,612 --> 01:37:18,034
[SPEAKER_15]: The chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

921
01:37:18,154 --> 01:37:19,154
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Del Rosso.

922
01:37:19,194 --> 01:37:24,538
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to thank Councilor Caviello for finding this Mass General Office 115, section 12.

923
01:37:25,058 --> 01:37:25,779
[SPEAKER_23]: And I agree.

924
01:37:25,819 --> 01:37:34,844
[SPEAKER_23]: I think any chance you can get to get the board shall consist of not more than five, not less than five or more than 15 residents of the city.

925
01:37:34,944 --> 01:37:43,170
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I mean, we'd be lucky to get 15 veterans to help out Mr. Lindsey and advise him on, you know, maybe different ways that he should be.

926
01:37:44,272 --> 01:37:49,353
[SPEAKER_13]: I have mentioned to other veterans, and they probably have a half a dozen that are already interested right now.

927
01:37:49,793 --> 01:37:57,895
[SPEAKER_23]: So I hope that the mayor looks into it, and obviously does an open public process to try to get interested veterans to help out and get involved.

928
01:37:57,915 --> 01:38:00,436
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's a great idea, and hopefully we can implement it.

929
01:38:01,076 --> 01:38:01,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

930
01:38:02,456 --> 01:38:04,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Nye.

931
01:38:04,197 --> 01:38:05,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

932
01:38:05,417 --> 01:38:08,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I also had an opportunity to take a look at Chapter 115, Section 12.

933
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:13,339
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Councilor Longo-Kurtz said, that it would be comprised of between five and 15 members.

934
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:14,745
[SPEAKER_14]: that are residents of the city.

935
01:38:15,665 --> 01:38:26,108
[SPEAKER_14]: But in looking at the general law, and I may be wrong because I haven't had a chance to examine it thoroughly, there is no requirement that those individuals on the Veterans Advisory Committee be veterans.

936
01:38:26,928 --> 01:38:27,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

937
01:38:27,348 --> 01:38:27,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

938
01:38:27,888 --> 01:38:42,631
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think it might make sense for us to maybe request that a certain percentage or portion of the individuals appointed to the Veterans Advisory Council when established be veterans.

939
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:48,307
[SPEAKER_14]: whether it be 50% plus one of the individual positions that are established by the mayor if she takes us up on this offer.

940
01:38:49,088 --> 01:39:04,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that that would be... I think that that's a good approach, Councilor Caravaglio, taking a two-fold approach where we send the request to the mayor, and then we have an opportunity to make some recommendations and act on her response would probably be the best course.

941
01:39:04,754 --> 01:39:08,676
[SPEAKER_14]: So I certainly support the resolution, but ask that the Veterans Subcommittee also take a look at it.

942
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:09,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

943
01:39:09,296 --> 01:39:11,277
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Caravaglio,

944
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:17,186
[SPEAKER_15]: for approval as amended by counselor Knight to send to the, uh, veterans subcommittee.

945
01:39:17,707 --> 01:39:19,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote has been requested.

946
01:39:19,728 --> 01:39:21,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

947
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:28,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Cario.

948
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:28,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

949
01:39:28,974 --> 01:39:29,694
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco.

950
01:39:29,754 --> 01:39:30,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

951
01:39:30,355 --> 01:39:30,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

952
01:39:31,055 --> 01:39:31,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

953
01:39:31,535 --> 01:39:32,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice-president McCurran.

954
01:39:32,456 --> 01:39:32,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

955
01:39:33,296 --> 01:39:33,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Mox.

956
01:39:34,397 --> 01:39:34,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

957
01:39:35,218 --> 01:39:35,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

958
01:39:36,178 --> 01:39:36,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

959
01:39:36,919 --> 01:39:37,759
[SPEAKER_16]: President Del Russo.

960
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:38,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

961
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:59,695
[SPEAKER_15]: vote of seven in the affirmative none in the negative the motion carries on the motion of vice president low current to return back to the regular order of business all those in favor all those opposed the motion carries 16-0 1 5 offered by councillor night be resolved that the Memphis City Council be provided a monthly report of all three one one calls councillor night

962
01:40:00,504 --> 01:40:07,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mr. President, as we're all aware, the city is going to be soon rolling out a 311 program where individuals can make service requests.

963
01:40:07,490 --> 01:40:19,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that it would be a good idea if the administration would forward these reports to the city council so that we can have a good understanding as to whether or not the program is actually meeting its stated mission goals and objectives.

964
01:40:20,662 --> 01:40:23,204
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I asked my colleagues to support the resolution.

965
01:40:24,225 --> 01:40:24,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Move for approval.

966
01:40:25,266 --> 01:40:26,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval.

967
01:40:26,126 --> 01:40:27,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

968
01:40:28,611 --> 01:40:29,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

969
01:40:30,272 --> 01:40:31,553
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is a great resolution.

970
01:40:31,633 --> 01:40:33,514
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely support the 311 system.

971
01:40:33,574 --> 01:40:42,220
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it does bring a great deal of transparency to the issues that, you know, the issues that the city addresses on an everyday basis.

972
01:40:42,901 --> 01:40:49,425
[SPEAKER_20]: But what I'd like to do is, if we could possibly find out what type of reporting is actually available from the system.

973
01:40:49,445 --> 01:40:52,767
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, usually these systems have all kinds of reporting that are available.

974
01:40:52,787 --> 01:40:54,348
[SPEAKER_20]: It'd be good to actually see what's available.

975
01:40:54,929 --> 01:40:57,110
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, in particular, I think it's great that we're going to

976
01:40:57,366 --> 01:41:19,898
[SPEAKER_20]: that we can get some type of reporting, but I would like to see, I mean, to be specific, the issues that people call about when they are reported, the department that handled the request, the status of the issue, when they're resolved and the duration of time it took to resolve the issues, because I think that will answer questions with regard to staffing and when we're looking at budgets.

977
01:41:19,998 --> 01:41:26,342
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we could get some detailed reporting with that information, I think that would be beneficial for everyone.

978
01:41:27,443 --> 01:41:27,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

979
01:41:27,863 --> 01:41:48,010
[SPEAKER_15]: So as amended by councilor Falco, that, uh, the city council also receive a report back from the mayor's office as to what type of reports the new system can generate and how they may be tabulated, presented and, uh, uh, have their numbers crunched.

980
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

981
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:49,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

982
01:41:50,711 --> 01:41:53,752
[SPEAKER_15]: On motion for approval, uh, madam vice president.

983
01:41:53,912 --> 01:41:54,992
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, president DelaRusso.

984
01:41:55,112 --> 01:41:56,893
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to thank my colleagues for, um,

985
01:41:58,265 --> 01:42:06,512
[SPEAKER_23]: the request, I think it goes along with requests we made a few months back when we did find out that the 311 system was going to be implemented.

986
01:42:06,892 --> 01:42:11,516
[SPEAKER_23]: We just asked for updates on how it was going to work, how we were going to be able to view the system.

987
01:42:11,996 --> 01:42:14,578
[SPEAKER_23]: So maybe we have not got that response.

988
01:42:14,918 --> 01:42:25,887
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm trying to look exactly on the date we requested that, but maybe a quick 30-minute committee of the whole meeting with whether it be the mayor, whoever, whatever department head is going to run the system.

989
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:32,524
[SPEAKER_23]: so that we can ask questions, because if there is glitches or anything like that, we're going to get the calls from the residents.

990
01:42:32,864 --> 01:42:33,504
[SPEAKER_23]: Who do we call?

991
01:42:33,584 --> 01:42:34,345
[SPEAKER_23]: What's the number?

992
01:42:34,825 --> 01:42:35,526
[SPEAKER_23]: How do we do it?

993
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:37,607
[SPEAKER_23]: How do we process it online?

994
01:42:37,667 --> 01:42:40,328
[SPEAKER_23]: Where do we go to look to see what order it's in?

995
01:42:40,469 --> 01:42:48,013
[SPEAKER_23]: So maybe if we could get a committee of the whole meeting to discuss, ask questions, and be able to understand what is being implemented.

996
01:42:48,193 --> 01:42:55,918
[SPEAKER_23]: From what I understand, the go date is March 2000, which is only a month or two away, so I would like to know

997
01:42:56,428 --> 01:43:06,637
[SPEAKER_23]: exactly how the program works myself so that I'm able to explain to residents who have questions with regards to how it works and what the process is.

998
01:43:06,978 --> 01:43:08,099
[SPEAKER_23]: So that would be my request.

999
01:43:08,119 --> 01:43:10,261
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be good to have a meeting on it, yes.

1000
01:43:10,281 --> 01:43:10,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1001
01:43:10,861 --> 01:43:18,348
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think one of the things is that because we received it in the springtime, everyone was trained on it, and now it hasn't been used.

1002
01:43:18,829 --> 01:43:23,472
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're doing retraining and they're going to do, uh, I don't know.

1003
01:43:23,592 --> 01:43:25,133
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll receive it all in the community.

1004
01:43:25,153 --> 01:43:26,934
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole chair recognizes council.

1005
01:43:27,254 --> 01:43:34,439
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to, uh, reiterate what council Longo just said that, uh, we need to have a presentation on how this is going to work.

1006
01:43:34,799 --> 01:43:38,061
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a very important system, uh, in our community.

1007
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:42,343
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, at the very least, I think we should have a committee, the whole meeting.

1008
01:43:42,383 --> 01:43:44,585
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh, the sooner we can set that up, the better.

1009
01:43:44,725 --> 01:43:44,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Well,

1010
01:43:45,323 --> 01:43:50,044
[SPEAKER_15]: we'll schedule something soon because this is something that the entire council has asked for for years.

1011
01:43:50,864 --> 01:43:55,125
[SPEAKER_23]: And I didn't even from through the chair, I didn't even know of a training that went on.

1012
01:43:55,205 --> 01:44:00,126
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think we all kind of just need to be brought on the same page that anybody can call us and ask questions.

1013
01:44:00,186 --> 01:44:02,626
[SPEAKER_23]: And we know how to navigate the system ourselves.

1014
01:44:03,026 --> 01:44:07,067
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, if a resident can't or isn't computer savvy, we can say, I'll look into it.

1015
01:44:07,087 --> 01:44:11,528
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me, and then we'll be able to check whether it's the website or some somewhere on the,

1016
01:44:12,042 --> 01:44:16,244
[SPEAKER_23]: Internet to be able to figure out, you know, how to answer our constituents' questions.

1017
01:44:16,284 --> 01:44:17,625
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be helpful for us.

1018
01:44:17,665 --> 01:44:18,005
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1019
01:44:18,365 --> 01:44:18,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1020
01:44:19,066 --> 01:44:20,866
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of approval, all those in favor?

1021
01:44:21,367 --> 01:44:22,087
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1022
01:44:22,487 --> 01:44:24,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1023
01:44:24,668 --> 01:44:35,134
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-016 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Substance Abuse Outreach and Prevention Coordinator update the Council on their efforts.

1024
01:44:35,434 --> 01:44:35,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor?

1025
01:44:36,452 --> 01:44:37,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1026
01:44:37,872 --> 01:44:46,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I recently had a discussion with Karen Rose at the Board of Health, who would be the department head that would be responsible for the Substance Abuse Outreach and Prevention Coordinator.

1027
01:44:46,914 --> 01:44:49,675
[SPEAKER_14]: She was pleased to inform me that the incumbent on the position, Ms.

1028
01:44:49,715 --> 01:44:53,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Penny Funiali, has had her child and is on maternity leave.

1029
01:44:53,776 --> 01:45:01,357
[SPEAKER_14]: So she will be unable to appear before the council to highlight some of the efforts and successes that the program has had since its inception.

1030
01:45:01,997 --> 01:45:04,318
[SPEAKER_14]: With that being said, Mr. President, Ms.

1031
01:45:04,358 --> 01:45:04,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Rose did

1032
01:45:05,246 --> 01:45:08,809
[SPEAKER_14]: commit to having Penny appear before the council when she does return.

1033
01:45:09,089 --> 01:45:12,091
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd ask that the council approve this resolution and then when Ms.

1034
01:45:12,151 --> 01:45:18,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Funigalli returns from her maternity leave, we ask her to come up here and tell us exactly what's going on with the new office and the new position that this council created.

1035
01:45:19,056 --> 01:45:19,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1036
01:45:19,877 --> 01:45:21,378
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1037
01:45:22,098 --> 01:45:22,759
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1038
01:45:22,879 --> 01:45:25,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carried.

1039
01:45:25,581 --> 01:45:32,066
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-018 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the City of Medford, uh, the Medford City Council is required to pass the 2016-2017

1040
01:45:34,305 --> 01:45:40,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Medford City budget and in a timely and complete information is required to perform this task.

1041
01:45:40,827 --> 01:45:57,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas the school department produces a written narrative budget summary with goals, objectives, priorities, and staffing vacancies, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request a budget template format from the administration for the upcoming budget for review and approval.

1042
01:45:57,594 --> 01:45:58,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

1043
01:45:58,474 --> 01:45:59,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1044
01:45:59,614 --> 01:46:03,736
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, one of the most important responsibilities that we have in the city council is to review and approve

1045
01:46:04,356 --> 01:46:05,437
[SPEAKER_20]: the yearly budget for the city.

1046
01:46:05,917 --> 01:46:13,603
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of our city to make sure that the budget and the budget process is fair and transparent.

1047
01:46:14,283 --> 01:46:18,607
[SPEAKER_20]: The resolution that I offer tonight is to take a proactive approach to the upcoming budget cycle.

1048
01:46:19,888 --> 01:46:28,714
[SPEAKER_20]: When I was on the school committee, we had a budget that had a written narrative with summaries and goals, and I believe that a city budget should be comparable.

1049
01:46:28,794 --> 01:46:32,397
[SPEAKER_20]: This year, I'd like to see a city budget with an overview and detailed analysis.

1050
01:46:32,965 --> 01:46:42,810
[SPEAKER_20]: Each department should produce a mission statement, organizational charts, a list of personnel goals, objectives, accomplishments, and performance metrics.

1051
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:45,932
[SPEAKER_20]: That's where the 311 system would really come in handy.

1052
01:46:46,832 --> 01:46:54,636
[SPEAKER_20]: Above all, I think that the budget needs to be easy to review and very descriptive so that the public can understand how their tax dollars are being spent.

1053
01:46:55,957 --> 01:47:00,419
[SPEAKER_20]: Information like this makes the process transparent, and it's much easier for residents to read.

1054
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:07,202
[SPEAKER_20]: Our current process seems to be a binder full of spreadsheets, and I think that it can be improved upon.

1055
01:47:08,403 --> 01:47:10,544
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure that the new administration will make improvements.

1056
01:47:10,564 --> 01:47:11,665
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm confident of that.

1057
01:47:12,005 --> 01:47:21,090
[SPEAKER_20]: But I believe that as a council, we should be proactive in this request of the aforementioned recommendations in preparation for the upcoming budget.

1058
01:47:21,631 --> 01:47:22,231
[SPEAKER_20]: I move for approval.

1059
01:47:23,111 --> 01:47:23,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1060
01:47:23,492 --> 01:47:27,114
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1061
01:47:27,174 --> 01:47:27,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1062
01:47:27,834 --> 01:47:30,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to commend Councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

1063
01:47:31,232 --> 01:47:37,795
[SPEAKER_13]: From my first term on the council, I had always been critical of our budget process and the budget that we've gotten.

1064
01:47:37,895 --> 01:47:44,498
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that this year we get a budget, not a budget summary like we've gotten in the past.

1065
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:55,303
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, I hope that Mr. Falco's motion for this new type of budget goes forward with our city administration.

1066
01:47:55,443 --> 01:47:58,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this will be our first budget with Mrs. Miller.

1067
01:47:58,838 --> 01:48:02,259
[SPEAKER_13]: and hopefully she'll take the suggestions, uh, uh, with her.

1068
01:48:03,499 --> 01:48:03,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1069
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:04,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1070
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:04,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor.

1071
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1072
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1073
01:48:08,561 --> 01:48:28,127
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a breath of fresh air to have someone with a council of Falco's background in budgeting, uh, in his, uh, profession, uh, on the council, because that's been a bone of contention, uh, with this council for many years, uh, receiving a line item budget from the administration and really nothing else.

1074
01:48:28,745 --> 01:48:32,268
[SPEAKER_19]: No narrative, no clear direction on which way the city's going.

1075
01:48:33,008 --> 01:48:40,273
[SPEAKER_19]: And with that being said, I happen to have done a little research on outcomes-based budgeting.

1076
01:48:40,954 --> 01:48:43,896
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're probably familiar with it, Councilor Falco.

1077
01:48:44,396 --> 01:48:48,159
[SPEAKER_19]: But if I could, Mr. President, I just want to read a little narrative.

1078
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:57,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I think this is the exact direction, at least I as one member of the council, and from what I'm hearing from other members of the council, would like to see take place in this community.

1079
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:09,589
[SPEAKER_19]: It states the new fiscal reality facing cities and towns across the Commonwealth necessitates that communities must be more judicious and prudent than ever before in their approach to providing services.

1080
01:49:10,349 --> 01:49:27,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Outcome-based budgeting, as opposed to the more traditional line-item incremental budgeting where expenditures are increased or decreased by a percentage from prior year levels, outcome-based budgeting is unique in that it ties in strategic planning,

1081
01:49:28,158 --> 01:49:29,319
[SPEAKER_19]: Performance management.

1082
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:42,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Outcome-based budgeting requires the mayor and department heads to develop an improved set of government priorities for the coming year, such as enhanced public safety or increased economic development.

1083
01:49:42,691 --> 01:49:48,355
[SPEAKER_19]: These larger priorities then cascade down through the departments and permeate each of their own annual work plans.

1084
01:49:48,836 --> 01:49:54,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Resources are then calibrated toward the specific activities that are designed to realize those outcomes.

1085
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:59,922
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I think that's exactly what we as a council have been talking about for years.

1086
01:50:00,603 --> 01:50:11,606
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's great to get a line item budget, and there's 10,000 line items on that, and we go through and we say, okay, last year you gave line item 003 10,000, this year it's getting 11,000.

1087
01:50:12,886 --> 01:50:14,046
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no rhyme to reason.

1088
01:50:14,086 --> 01:50:14,906
[SPEAKER_19]: Why is it getting 11,000?

1089
01:50:15,666 --> 01:50:16,187
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't know.

1090
01:50:16,907 --> 01:50:20,128
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, one line item goes down, one goes up.

1091
01:50:20,848 --> 01:50:23,768
[SPEAKER_19]: And it never really addresses priorities.

1092
01:50:24,088 --> 01:50:26,429
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been talking about public safety, the police department.

1093
01:50:26,709 --> 01:50:28,710
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been talking about the need for additional cruises.

1094
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:39,253
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been talking about the need to repair roads and sidewalks and so forth, the leaking ceilings and preventive maintenance in our community on some of our city-owned buildings.

1095
01:50:39,853 --> 01:50:44,875
[SPEAKER_19]: And really, every year, we never really address those particular issues in the budget.

1096
01:50:45,275 --> 01:50:50,017
[SPEAKER_19]: It's more or less just looking at last year's budget and adding or decreasing lines.

1097
01:50:52,057 --> 01:50:53,898
[SPEAKER_19]: There's really no rhyme to reason.

1098
01:50:54,365 --> 01:51:00,826
[SPEAKER_19]: And this outcomes-based budgeting, I think, it may not be the solve-all, but it allows us to hear from the different departments.

1099
01:51:01,226 --> 01:51:10,248
[SPEAKER_19]: It allows us, as Councilor Peto would state year after year, that if you had a wish list, you used to ask every department head, what is your wish list?

1100
01:51:10,929 --> 01:51:13,689
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, the department heads would either be open with you or not.

1101
01:51:14,129 --> 01:51:22,451
[SPEAKER_19]: But this outcomes-based budgeting forces their hand to say, hey, the administration wants to act upon public safety in this community.

1102
01:51:22,841 --> 01:51:36,106
[SPEAKER_19]: And those particular department heads that have public safety within their budget would have to raise particular areas in their budget to address the needs of the community and what direction the mayor wants to go in.

1103
01:51:36,566 --> 01:51:39,567
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

1104
01:51:39,927 --> 01:51:42,308
[SPEAKER_19]: I thank Councilor Falco for putting this on.

1105
01:51:43,008 --> 01:51:48,490
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, the ultimate goal is to ensure that each dollar in the city has a well-designed purpose.

1106
01:51:51,008 --> 01:51:56,051
[SPEAKER_19]: each dollar is accountable to whatever resources they're earmarked to.

1107
01:51:56,631 --> 01:52:05,215
[SPEAKER_19]: And as we all know, at the end of a budget year, at any given year, we're transferring millions of dollars that we thought were appropriated for this particular use.

1108
01:52:05,275 --> 01:52:11,657
[SPEAKER_19]: A million dollars is going towards this, and at the end of the year, we have a million dollar surplus.

1109
01:52:12,258 --> 01:52:19,281
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that speaks volumes on the need to dig a little deeper, I think,

1110
01:52:19,656 --> 01:52:26,279
[SPEAKER_19]: So, that's what Councilor Falco is saying, and I hope this is part of the new process and the budgeting process.

1111
01:52:26,319 --> 01:52:27,299
[SPEAKER_19]: I thank you for offering this.

1112
01:52:32,361 --> 01:52:34,122
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1113
01:52:34,162 --> 01:52:37,303
[SPEAKER_23]: I, too, want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

1114
01:52:37,323 --> 01:52:43,526
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't have the budget background, but I know two years ago we requested goals and objectives.

1115
01:52:44,426 --> 01:52:45,746
[SPEAKER_23]: To go even further is great.

1116
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:50,963
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's something that should be reported every year by every department head.

1117
01:52:51,303 --> 01:52:55,947
[SPEAKER_23]: Goals, objectives, I like how you've furthered it with priorities, staff vacancies, accomplishments.

1118
01:52:56,027 --> 01:53:02,432
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's necessary, and that's something that should have been done for a very long time, and I hope the administration makes that changes.

1119
01:53:03,353 --> 01:53:07,156
[SPEAKER_23]: One clarity, I just want to, you're looking for the template format.

1120
01:53:07,256 --> 01:53:14,542
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to make sure that this also includes, you're asking each department head for those list of things, or is that how the template works?

1121
01:53:17,388 --> 01:53:20,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1122
01:53:22,689 --> 01:53:23,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1123
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:29,931
[SPEAKER_20]: The template would basically be, I want to see what the administration is going to provide us with regard to data.

1124
01:53:29,991 --> 01:53:34,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they going to provide us with mission statements, organizational charts, list of personnel?

1125
01:53:34,192 --> 01:53:36,033
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are the types of things I think we should see.

1126
01:53:37,033 --> 01:53:43,334
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd like to know in advance, are they going to, you know, they should let us know, send us a template.

1127
01:53:43,354 --> 01:53:46,175
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to see for, you know, the DPW, for example.

1128
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:47,741
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to see a mission statement.

1129
01:53:47,761 --> 01:53:49,121
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to see an organizational chart.

1130
01:53:49,141 --> 01:53:52,623
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to see a list of personnel goals, objectives, accomplishments.

1131
01:53:52,643 --> 01:53:54,544
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're going to see that for each department.

1132
01:53:54,584 --> 01:53:57,086
[SPEAKER_20]: But I want them to confirm that they're going to send that to us.

1133
01:53:57,526 --> 01:54:03,789
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to find out when we're looking at a budget book in June that it's something different than what we would really like to see.

1134
01:54:03,849 --> 01:54:11,033
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why I'd like to, I'd really like them to confirm sooner than later that when it gets to budget season, this is what we're going to see.

1135
01:54:11,073 --> 01:54:16,236
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can be prepared and we can know how to, you know, we can better analyze the budget as a group.

1136
01:54:17,194 --> 01:54:28,802
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm in full support of getting the template, and I'm in full support of requesting a list of goals, objectives, priorities, and accomplishments from each and every department head months before.

1137
01:54:28,822 --> 01:54:38,588
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's a great idea, and I hope that's something that we can work as a council to almost mandate through the administration, because we are the ones that vote on the budget.

1138
01:54:38,668 --> 01:54:43,992
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we make it very clear that this is something that should be done, then I hope to see that done before June.

1139
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1140
01:54:46,081 --> 01:54:47,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilman Scott Pelley.

1141
01:54:48,083 --> 01:54:52,448
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, I'd like to applaud my fellow councilman, Mr. Falco.

1142
01:54:52,949 --> 01:55:04,101
[SPEAKER_04]: We were both on the school committee, and I remember our first meeting when the first budget we went through, we received a budget book, I believe Friday or Father's Day, and to vote on a Tuesday.

1143
01:55:04,622 --> 01:55:06,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So we learned relatively quick.

1144
01:55:07,417 --> 01:55:16,384
[SPEAKER_04]: that how we needed to work together collaboratively as a committee to make sure we get the answers that we need before we pass the budget onto the city council.

1145
01:55:17,104 --> 01:55:34,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the mayor will present us with a budget, and I think what John's asking for and what we've done in the past with the school committee with having pre-budget meetings where department heads presented us with all of that information gave us the tools to make sure that we made the proper decisions.

1146
01:55:35,418 --> 01:55:36,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the bone of contention

1147
01:55:37,107 --> 01:55:40,488
[SPEAKER_04]: that's been talked about recently is the PR person.

1148
01:55:40,508 --> 01:55:47,710
[SPEAKER_04]: The PR person is something we talked about back in May of 2011 as part of our pre-budget conversations.

1149
01:55:48,150 --> 01:56:00,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's important that this is how we, it's the first step that I think that led us in a direction on the school committee in a positive direction, making sure that we're working with transparency.

1150
01:56:00,973 --> 01:56:05,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I just want to applaud your resolution and

1151
01:56:06,726 --> 01:56:09,267
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty excited about making this happen, so thank you.

1152
01:56:09,827 --> 01:56:10,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

1153
01:56:10,968 --> 01:56:12,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1154
01:56:13,329 --> 01:56:14,249
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a quick point, too.

1155
01:56:14,989 --> 01:56:27,855
[SPEAKER_19]: This council has requested, I believe, unanimously over the last several budgets that also within our budget book, we receive a column that shows whether the account was in a deficit or had a surplus the previous year.

1156
01:56:28,535 --> 01:56:31,476
[SPEAKER_19]: And I, as one member, know that's very helpful to look at.

1157
01:56:32,196 --> 01:56:36,458
[SPEAKER_19]: And, for instance, snow and ice, we end up funded by hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.

1158
01:56:36,848 --> 01:56:41,409
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the only account that you can budget deficit spend.

1159
01:56:41,649 --> 01:56:55,732
[SPEAKER_19]: And but it's helpful, I think, especially as new members of the council, those two new members to see what accounts every year go into deficit, whether it's overtime or whatever have you, and then make adjustments accordingly.

1160
01:56:56,413 --> 01:57:01,114
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I think any good budget person will make those adjustments on the fly.

1161
01:57:01,574 --> 01:57:06,115
[SPEAKER_19]: So year after year, you don't have the same accounts that are in deficit or surplus.

1162
01:57:06,848 --> 01:57:08,109
[SPEAKER_19]: where money is being transferred.

1163
01:57:08,149 --> 01:57:18,037
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would again ask that be part of this report that the previous year that we receive whether or not that account was in a surplus or deficit.

1164
01:57:18,497 --> 01:57:20,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So as an amendment at the end of the motion.

1165
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:21,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1166
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:23,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Counselor Scarpelli.

1167
01:57:23,802 --> 01:57:24,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for clarity.

1168
01:57:27,347 --> 01:57:41,357
[SPEAKER_04]: as we move forward, the, the wishes of the school, this city council to ask for department heads to come to the rail or come to this meeting that would have to go through the mayor's office or that, that wouldn't be our privy, correct?

1169
01:57:41,377 --> 01:57:42,017
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

1170
01:57:42,057 --> 01:57:42,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1171
01:57:42,417 --> 01:57:51,924
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can, we can request the mayor's office that we ask for a pre-budget updates and from department as we move forward, just to make, make sure that we're clear.

1172
01:57:51,944 --> 01:57:55,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that council marks made that loud and clear, but we can always request.

1173
01:57:56,087 --> 01:57:56,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1174
01:57:56,751 --> 01:57:57,491
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, councilor.

1175
01:57:57,511 --> 01:57:58,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1176
01:57:59,412 --> 01:58:00,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1177
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:03,853
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing this matter forward.

1178
01:58:03,873 --> 01:58:06,534
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Councilor Scott Pelley hit the nail on the head.

1179
01:58:07,334 --> 01:58:07,954
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a partnership.

1180
01:58:08,854 --> 01:58:10,175
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a partnership between this council.

1181
01:58:10,195 --> 01:58:14,376
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a partnership between the administration and the school department and the community, Mr. President.

1182
01:58:14,576 --> 01:58:21,758
[SPEAKER_14]: And the school department had great success last year, putting together a school budget that was probably the best school budget that I've seen in a very long time.

1183
01:58:22,158 --> 01:58:26,179
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that part of the reason the budget was so successful, because they had

1184
01:58:26,775 --> 01:58:28,235
[SPEAKER_14]: the narrative budget summary that was there.

1185
01:58:28,315 --> 01:58:41,098
[SPEAKER_14]: They understood exactly what it was that they were working on and they didn't have to pry through 600 pages of line item budgets and ask every single question about every single line item because there was a narrative there, there was a mission there, there was an objective, a stated goal.

1186
01:58:41,518 --> 01:58:51,180
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was very pleased to vote in favor of the budget, Mr. President, because of the fact that the school department's budget was so strong and the work that it did in restoring adjustment counselors, so on and so forth.

1187
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:54,721
[SPEAKER_14]: We could go over the successes time and time again as we have in the past.

1188
01:58:55,800 --> 01:59:17,552
[SPEAKER_14]: However, we also passed a resolution back, I want to say in September, requesting that this council or the budget subcommittee meet quarterly with the administration to determine whether or not forecasts are meeting collections and to see where we are in terms of surplus and accounts and stuff like that, Mr. President.

1189
01:59:18,112 --> 01:59:24,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I'd like to see that those meetings start to begin getting called as this council did vote for unanimously by way of a roll call.

1190
01:59:25,215 --> 01:59:29,058
[SPEAKER_14]: With that being said, I certainly support this resolution that's before the council today.

1191
01:59:29,078 --> 01:59:29,859
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a great idea.

1192
01:59:29,899 --> 01:59:30,599
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a great approach.

1193
01:59:30,619 --> 01:59:35,142
[SPEAKER_14]: It sets the tone for us to start working together now on the most important job that we have, which is setting the budget.

1194
01:59:35,603 --> 01:59:37,804
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Mr. President, I move for approval and I'd ask for a roll call.

1195
01:59:38,425 --> 01:59:45,610
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval, the citizen at the podium will speak before we take a vote.

1196
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:46,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1197
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:48,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1198
01:59:48,832 --> 01:59:52,795
[SPEAKER_26]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1199
01:59:54,347 --> 02:00:00,388
[SPEAKER_26]: As a taxpayer, I also would like to commend and thank Councilor Falco.

1200
02:00:01,009 --> 02:00:15,092
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a great common sense request to the city to get some budget information and hopefully the best information possible in due time so it's not too late.

1201
02:00:16,592 --> 02:00:20,693
[SPEAKER_26]: And hopefully better spend our taxpayers' monies

1202
02:00:21,707 --> 02:00:22,627
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your listening.

1203
02:00:22,827 --> 02:00:23,087
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1204
02:00:23,347 --> 02:00:24,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

1205
02:00:25,028 --> 02:00:32,749
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of approval by council night as amended, all those in favor, roll call vote has been requested.

1206
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:37,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll council.

1207
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:43,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Caviello, council Falco, council night, vice president, Lennon, current council marks.

1208
02:00:44,072 --> 02:00:46,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Scott Pelley, president Della Russo.

1209
02:00:46,913 --> 02:00:47,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1210
02:00:47,373 --> 02:00:49,093
[SPEAKER_15]: For seven affirmative, none in the negative.

1211
02:00:49,682 --> 02:00:50,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1212
02:00:51,283 --> 02:00:52,343
[SPEAKER_15]: I must apologize.

1213
02:00:52,363 --> 02:00:53,363
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot.

1214
02:00:53,724 --> 02:00:56,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, it skipped over a resolution 16 dash 0 1 7.

1215
02:00:57,665 --> 02:01:11,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be resolved that park method update the council concerning what steps they are taking to ensure the prevention of cyber attacks to users of the smart phone payment application.

1216
02:01:11,531 --> 02:01:12,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor night.

1217
02:01:12,471 --> 02:01:14,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1218
02:01:14,592 --> 02:01:15,192
[SPEAKER_14]: As a frequent,

1219
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:28,289
[SPEAKER_14]: user of the smartphone application relative to the park mobile system, I received an article, and the article was in an online magazine called The Register.

1220
02:01:28,910 --> 02:01:32,272
[SPEAKER_14]: The headline was, Car Park Mobile Apps are Vulnerable to Hacking.

1221
02:01:33,233 --> 02:01:44,101
[SPEAKER_14]: And that made me rather concerned, so I continued to research, and I found another site called Hack Read, which said, researchers find critical vulnerabilities in the Android parking apps.

1222
02:01:45,287 --> 02:01:47,148
[SPEAKER_14]: and Info Security Magazine.

1223
02:01:47,428 --> 02:01:50,949
[SPEAKER_14]: The headline would read, Researchers Find Major Security Flaws in Parking Apps.

1224
02:01:51,469 --> 02:02:08,334
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's happening, Mr. President, is that because of substandard encryption, which, quite frankly, means nothing to me, but might mean something more to some people that are a little bit more tech-savvy than I, these phones are becoming vulnerable to attacks because the information is up in the cloud and people are able to get at it.

1225
02:02:09,015 --> 02:02:12,936
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, Mr. President, there have been a number of suggestions and recommendations made by these

1226
02:02:13,917 --> 02:02:24,919
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the biggest recommendations was that you use a credit card as opposed to a debit card to fund your purchases in your mobile app because of the fraud protections that are in the credit card system.

1227
02:02:25,639 --> 02:02:28,480
[SPEAKER_14]: However, Mr. President, we do have a parking program here in Medford.

1228
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,200
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a ParkMobile app here in Medford.

1229
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:38,602
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would like to see what steps the ParkMobile people are taking to ensure that we do not have substandard encryption and that our consumers are protected.

1230
02:02:39,180 --> 02:02:40,961
[SPEAKER_14]: from cyber attacks, Mr. President.

1231
02:02:41,241 --> 02:02:55,409
[SPEAKER_14]: And in segue to that, if anybody has been affected by a cyber attack of some sort, I would ask that they report the matter immediately to not only the police department, but also the Office of Consumer, the Medford Consumer Commission, rather.

1232
02:02:55,709 --> 02:02:57,511
[SPEAKER_14]: The First Floor of City Hall.

1233
02:02:57,591 --> 02:03:00,492
[SPEAKER_14]: First Floor of City Hall, the old Medford Savings Lives Office.

1234
02:03:01,213 --> 02:03:03,334
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd move for approval.

1235
02:03:03,594 --> 02:03:04,935
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that this is a basic

1236
02:03:05,654 --> 02:03:09,955
[SPEAKER_14]: resolution that will allow us to understand what steps are being taken to keep consumers in the community safe.

1237
02:03:10,456 --> 02:03:13,817
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1238
02:03:13,897 --> 02:03:14,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1239
02:03:15,497 --> 02:03:22,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing that we're talking about the parking, it's been about a year now with the parking just about, I think, almost a year.

1240
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:31,902
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like to see a report on our first year on monies collected, not collected, tickets, a full report.

1241
02:03:32,162 --> 02:03:33,743
[SPEAKER_13]: We got one about two months ago, I think.

1242
02:03:34,448 --> 02:03:36,349
[SPEAKER_15]: It was filled in detail, surprisingly so.

1243
02:03:36,489 --> 02:03:40,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so like I said, I think we're just about at the end of our first full year.

1244
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:45,132
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to see where we stand with that and where we're going.

1245
02:03:45,512 --> 02:03:48,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I see more and more meter heads popping up in the city.

1246
02:03:49,093 --> 02:03:51,454
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like to maybe get a report on that too.

1247
02:03:52,054 --> 02:03:52,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

1248
02:03:52,774 --> 02:04:03,538
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of approval by Councillor Knight, as amended by Councillor Caviello, that we receive the first annual full report in detail

1249
02:04:04,169 --> 02:04:09,954
[SPEAKER_15]: summary of action on the traffic parking enforcement.

1250
02:04:10,274 --> 02:04:11,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councillor Scarpelli.

1251
02:04:12,096 --> 02:04:27,229
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, to add along, because we're talking about traffic and parking, if we can, too, through the chair, I've gotten some calls about some of the signs in Meffitt Square, the new signs that have been erected that I believe you need a master's degree to read them and to follow along.

1252
02:04:27,749 --> 02:04:29,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been very difficult for some of our seniors

1253
02:04:32,031 --> 02:04:32,972
[SPEAKER_04]: to follow along.

1254
02:04:33,072 --> 02:04:38,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's six different bullets in one.

1255
02:04:38,714 --> 02:04:40,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Ms.

1256
02:04:40,595 --> 02:04:43,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Reynolds would say it was a carry on sentence as it keeps going on and on.

1257
02:04:43,676 --> 02:04:47,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone can look into that too, it's important to get clarification for that.

1258
02:04:48,418 --> 02:04:57,102
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Councilor Scappelli, that the Park Medford, which has a purview over those signs in the contract,

1259
02:04:59,381 --> 02:05:07,844
[SPEAKER_15]: review the content of the new square signs in Medford Square as they are difficult on the eye.

1260
02:05:11,685 --> 02:05:12,405
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion.

1261
02:05:13,025 --> 02:05:14,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi citizen, you're welcome to speak.

1262
02:05:14,826 --> 02:05:16,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1263
02:05:16,766 --> 02:05:18,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

1264
02:05:18,267 --> 02:05:19,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street.

1265
02:05:20,207 --> 02:05:22,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you opened the park Medford a little more, um,

1266
02:05:23,928 --> 02:05:35,515
[SPEAKER_01]: During the period that you were supposed to have the free Saturday parking, several people reported on Facebook and just parents speaking that they were paying for parking on the Saturday.

1267
02:05:35,535 --> 02:05:36,716
[SPEAKER_01]: The meters were not off.

1268
02:05:37,297 --> 02:05:40,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Park Medford still hasn't figured out how to turn their meters off.

1269
02:05:41,339 --> 02:05:45,302
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe when you get your report, you might want to see how many people paid when they weren't supposed to.

1270
02:05:45,322 --> 02:05:47,063
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems like a breach of contract.

1271
02:05:47,363 --> 02:05:50,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're always talking about the contract and how much it'll cost us to get out of it,

1272
02:05:51,141 --> 02:05:54,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there should be some ramifications when they don't honour their contracts.

1273
02:05:54,364 --> 02:05:59,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1274
02:05:59,108 --> 02:05:59,568
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President?

1275
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:01,270
[SPEAKER_25]: Sir?

1276
02:06:01,290 --> 02:06:04,232
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to speak about... Please state your name and address for the record.

1277
02:06:04,252 --> 02:06:05,754
[SPEAKER_25]: Bob Henton from Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

1278
02:06:05,774 --> 02:06:08,156
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to speak about the contract in one particular area.

1279
02:06:08,956 --> 02:06:15,482
[SPEAKER_25]: If you go back and look at the contract and look at the proposal that was made, we were talking at one point in time of possibly having zones here in the city of Medford.

1280
02:06:16,443 --> 02:06:22,147
[SPEAKER_25]: And to date, there are no zones, and none of the METAs are identified as being in any particular zone.

1281
02:06:22,707 --> 02:06:22,967
[SPEAKER_25]: As Ms.

1282
02:06:23,147 --> 02:06:30,752
[SPEAKER_25]: Rodriguez just got through saying, during this past month of December, people were putting money in the METAs, and the METAs were accepting them.

1283
02:06:31,452 --> 02:06:42,720
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the question needs to go a little bit further to the Park-Metford office to find out what their technology is, because they should be able to shut down that meter that indicates that they will not accept the money on any particular day.

1284
02:06:43,341 --> 02:06:54,829
[SPEAKER_25]: As far as the new meters in downtown Metford Square, I think Councilor Caviello can attest to this, because I think he was a product of it, putting the money in the meter, and the meter did take the money in Metford Square.

1285
02:06:55,270 --> 02:07:00,974
[SPEAKER_25]: So you have situations here that even where you have the pay park ones, and now you have the stanchions

1286
02:07:01,321 --> 02:07:03,282
[SPEAKER_25]: where you put the quarters in, there are some problems.

1287
02:07:04,003 --> 02:07:13,990
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it would behoove the council not only to have your first annual update, Councilor Caviello, as you were talking about, maybe to have them come in here and find out, especially with two new councillors, what your concerns might be.

1288
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:16,832
[SPEAKER_25]: They indicated that they have all this technology.

1289
02:07:16,872 --> 02:07:20,274
[SPEAKER_25]: They have this computer app technology and whatever it might be.

1290
02:07:20,835 --> 02:07:22,235
[SPEAKER_25]: But there definitely are concerns.

1291
02:07:22,276 --> 02:07:25,638
[SPEAKER_25]: There are people still getting tagged for no reason at all.

1292
02:07:25,678 --> 02:07:27,139
[SPEAKER_25]: And more importantly, there are no zones.

1293
02:07:27,379 --> 02:07:28,640
[SPEAKER_25]: City of Boston is very clear

1294
02:07:29,257 --> 02:07:34,639
[SPEAKER_25]: on how they address their issue relative toward their parking and their meters, their zones and their territories.

1295
02:07:35,219 --> 02:07:44,102
[SPEAKER_25]: It would be very easy to put zone locations on each and every one of the meters and each and every one of the, you know, it doesn't take a lot to put, you know, the number, whatever it might be.

1296
02:07:44,863 --> 02:07:46,863
[SPEAKER_25]: And you don't have to go through the same thing.

1297
02:07:47,123 --> 02:07:54,126
[SPEAKER_25]: And on Christmas Eve day, Christmas Eve day in the afternoon, people were getting tickets right up until six o'clock at night.

1298
02:07:54,566 --> 02:07:57,547
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's just a little bit disingenuous, as I said before,

1299
02:07:58,072 --> 02:08:04,154
[SPEAKER_25]: They're nothing but a bunch of bounty hunters coming here to Boston and Medford, Massachusetts, to get as much money as they can.

1300
02:08:04,734 --> 02:08:06,135
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's just not working out.

1301
02:08:06,335 --> 02:08:24,482
[SPEAKER_25]: And with the two new councils on here, I would hope that they would be brought up to date that the past council, the very past one in December, voted seven to nothing to give the senior citizens in the city of Medford the break of not being able to pay, because that was one of the concerns that was attributed by the president administration that they would do.

1302
02:08:24,602 --> 02:08:27,823
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think it's an issue that needs to be addressed, and I think it's an issue

1303
02:08:28,332 --> 02:08:31,533
[SPEAKER_25]: that should work well for the City of Medford, especially for the seniors in our city.

1304
02:08:32,513 --> 02:08:32,853
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1305
02:08:34,193 --> 02:08:36,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Vice President Mungo Kern.

1306
02:08:36,574 --> 02:08:36,834
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1307
02:08:36,874 --> 02:08:46,396
[SPEAKER_23]: If we could just maybe amend, if Councillor Knight doesn't mind, to ask Park Medford, you know, what's being done to shut off meters, and is that a possibility?

1308
02:08:46,556 --> 02:08:52,477
[SPEAKER_23]: We did ask before, and I believe they said they were working on it, so the residents are right.

1309
02:08:54,258 --> 02:08:57,960
[SPEAKER_23]: Sunday, the leaders should not be accepting money.

1310
02:08:58,020 --> 02:08:59,141
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not under contract.

1311
02:08:59,201 --> 02:09:00,922
[SPEAKER_23]: So I agree wholeheartedly.

1312
02:09:00,982 --> 02:09:02,523
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we can maybe get an update on that.

1313
02:09:03,764 --> 02:09:05,025
[SPEAKER_14]: On that amendment.

1314
02:09:05,085 --> 02:09:10,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I put the resolution forward to address issues of cyber security.

1315
02:09:10,869 --> 02:09:18,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I can understand why certain people are coming from Facebook and this guy got a ticket this day.

1316
02:09:19,254 --> 02:09:19,834
[SPEAKER_14]: It is what it is.

1317
02:09:20,575 --> 02:09:22,896
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an administrative procedure that's in place.

1318
02:09:22,976 --> 02:09:24,097
[SPEAKER_14]: If you feel as though you got a ticket,

1319
02:09:24,852 --> 02:09:26,733
[SPEAKER_14]: erroneously that you go through the appeals process.

1320
02:09:28,034 --> 02:09:32,236
[SPEAKER_14]: With that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem amending the resolution.

1321
02:09:33,536 --> 02:09:44,162
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the principle that I wrote for was just exclusively for cybersecurity, and we kind of went off on a little tangent and went down a different kind of road, Mr. President, and that's not where I was looking to go.

1322
02:09:44,782 --> 02:09:46,403
[SPEAKER_14]: But with that being said, I'd ask that we

1323
02:09:47,127 --> 02:09:49,089
[SPEAKER_14]: several amendments and move forward.

1324
02:09:50,289 --> 02:09:55,573
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval as amended and now to sever.

1325
02:09:56,214 --> 02:09:57,515
[SPEAKER_15]: So the amendments are?

1326
02:09:59,897 --> 02:10:00,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Annual update.

1327
02:10:02,439 --> 02:10:03,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Annual update.

1328
02:10:05,261 --> 02:10:07,042
[SPEAKER_14]: What technology do they have to shut the matter off?

1329
02:10:09,504 --> 02:10:10,385
[SPEAKER_14]: To shut the meters off.

1330
02:10:10,405 --> 02:10:10,905
[SPEAKER_14]: To shut the meters off.

1331
02:10:13,309 --> 02:10:14,830
[SPEAKER_15]: So then we'll take them one by one.

1332
02:10:14,990 --> 02:10:20,772
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the amendment for an annual update, all those in favor?

1333
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:21,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1334
02:10:21,972 --> 02:10:22,772
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1335
02:10:23,392 --> 02:10:24,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1336
02:10:26,333 --> 02:10:38,337
[SPEAKER_15]: The signs to be reviewed and report back to the city council as to the content of them, and can they be simplified for the average reader?

1337
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:40,601
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1338
02:10:40,841 --> 02:10:41,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1339
02:10:41,921 --> 02:10:42,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Those opposed?

1340
02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:43,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Carries.

1341
02:10:45,363 --> 02:10:59,131
[SPEAKER_15]: To have a check on shutting down the meters, are they shutting down when they're supposed to so that people aren't swindled into paying when they shouldn't have to?

1342
02:10:59,532 --> 02:11:00,332
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1343
02:11:00,352 --> 02:11:00,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1344
02:11:01,273 --> 02:11:01,933
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1345
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:14,230
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the main motion of Councilor Knight, that report be given to the City Council as to cyber attacks and efforts to maintain cyber security in the payment system.

1346
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:15,430
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1347
02:11:16,151 --> 02:11:16,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1348
02:11:16,551 --> 02:11:17,332
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1349
02:11:18,013 --> 02:11:19,153
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion carries.

1350
02:11:19,954 --> 02:11:21,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all.

1351
02:11:22,876 --> 02:11:25,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1352
02:11:26,379 --> 02:11:30,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Petition by Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford, Massachusetts, to discuss

1353
02:11:31,755 --> 02:11:37,598
[SPEAKER_15]: preparing Union and Swan Streets to be converted for a municipal parking lot.

1354
02:11:38,198 --> 02:11:41,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Citizen Martin, welcome and please state your name and address for the record.

1355
02:11:41,459 --> 02:11:43,700
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Gene Martin, Municipal Lots.

1356
02:11:44,181 --> 02:11:49,843
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway, this is, well, I'm going to be talking about two different little blocks.

1357
02:11:50,463 --> 02:11:51,684
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a citywide issue.

1358
02:11:51,724 --> 02:11:55,425
[SPEAKER_22]: This affects the Medford Square projects.

1359
02:11:55,886 --> 02:11:57,947
[SPEAKER_22]: This affects the business community.

1360
02:11:58,427 --> 02:12:00,968
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just want everybody to know that all of the

1361
02:12:01,469 --> 02:12:04,750
[SPEAKER_22]: department heads need to be in and understand what I'm trying to get across.

1362
02:12:05,150 --> 02:12:09,230
[SPEAKER_22]: Because this is a citywide project, even though it's going to be talking about two small blocks.

1363
02:12:11,231 --> 02:12:14,631
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, reorganizing Union and Swan Street.

1364
02:12:15,171 --> 02:12:19,132
[SPEAKER_22]: There are two small blocks between the police headquarters and the DPW yard.

1365
02:12:19,652 --> 02:12:24,693
[SPEAKER_22]: The first block is between Union and Swan, which are more like alleys than streets.

1366
02:12:25,413 --> 02:12:29,554
[SPEAKER_22]: And I recommend anybody just drive down Mystic Ave and Main

1367
02:12:30,281 --> 02:12:35,142
[SPEAKER_22]: And go up those, quote, streets, they're more like alleys than they are streets.

1368
02:12:36,162 --> 02:12:38,903
[SPEAKER_22]: The second block between Swan and James is a little bigger.

1369
02:12:39,663 --> 02:12:46,044
[SPEAKER_22]: These two blocks, separating the police facility and the DPW yards, are small privately owned businesses.

1370
02:12:46,684 --> 02:12:57,066
[SPEAKER_22]: Along Union Alley, and I call it alley, are the following, Alsar Automotive, Carly Fence, Stevens Auto, and Lew's Custom Exhaust.

1371
02:12:57,607 --> 02:12:59,967
[SPEAKER_22]: Swan Street, A&P, Collision Center,

1372
02:13:00,572 --> 02:13:05,513
[SPEAKER_22]: After that, a junkyard, complete eyesore, and then Eastern Tool Company.

1373
02:13:06,053 --> 02:13:13,734
[SPEAKER_22]: If you go down that road, if you look from above, and actually as you're going down it, there's a huge junk area.

1374
02:13:14,074 --> 02:13:15,314
[SPEAKER_22]: It just looks like an eyesore.

1375
02:13:16,375 --> 02:13:18,235
[SPEAKER_22]: On the left is a marble and granite company.

1376
02:13:18,535 --> 02:13:21,996
[SPEAKER_22]: James Street has all truck company.

1377
02:13:22,656 --> 02:13:30,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Unfortunately, the new public safety building is going to need at least the lots on Union to Swan Street to meet code.

1378
02:13:30,748 --> 02:13:38,771
[SPEAKER_22]: for the current footprint, which is one-third too small, and so union to Swan is not an option, but rather a mandate.

1379
02:13:40,431 --> 02:13:44,253
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether or not we move the businesses on James Street is still optional.

1380
02:13:44,933 --> 02:13:50,075
[SPEAKER_22]: Since we are going to have to disturb that area, we might as well do it right to begin with.

1381
02:13:50,795 --> 02:13:57,197
[SPEAKER_22]: It makes sense to turn those two whole blocks, including James Street, into city-owned lots

1382
02:13:57,775 --> 02:14:01,477
[SPEAKER_22]: so that we can increase our building space for other related departments.

1383
02:14:02,217 --> 02:14:06,680
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to work with these business owners and find them new lots for their businesses.

1384
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:16,525
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is where you come in, Mr. Delarusso and Mr. Carviello especially, because you're both on the rotary and you need to be, you know, pushing for this, I think.

1385
02:14:17,226 --> 02:14:25,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Not only do I see the new police fire 911 facility staying where it is, but I see buildings that house other city departments.

1386
02:14:26,538 --> 02:14:35,242
[SPEAKER_22]: in it like public health, building management, engineering, water and sewer, cemetery, any departments that seems compatible with police, fire, and DPW.

1387
02:14:36,462 --> 02:14:41,584
[SPEAKER_22]: The other aspect of this change is that it will impact the new square's view over the Mystic River.

1388
02:14:42,725 --> 02:14:44,125
[SPEAKER_22]: Currently, the view is ugly.

1389
02:14:45,586 --> 02:14:54,830
[SPEAKER_22]: So seriously, if you put those fancy condos above the storefronts, you know, where CVS is and all of that, they're gonna have an awful view.

1390
02:14:55,783 --> 02:15:02,268
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm telling you, if you look down, do the aerial thing from, that's why I did this, aerial view, it's all junky, it's ugly.

1391
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:13,297
[SPEAKER_22]: So it'll increase your property values of the Medford Square project as well, not to look over the river and then to, you know, to see all that junky stuff, mostly automotive places.

1392
02:15:13,698 --> 02:15:17,621
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm not saying get rid of them, I'm saying help us move them.

1393
02:15:18,602 --> 02:15:23,566
[SPEAKER_22]: One other aspect of this change is that it will impact the new square's view on the Mystic River.

1394
02:15:24,106 --> 02:15:25,267
[SPEAKER_22]: Currently, the view is ugly.

1395
02:15:25,812 --> 02:15:31,477
[SPEAKER_22]: As soon as these businesses are, some of these businesses are dumpy and crappy looking.

1396
02:15:32,458 --> 02:15:39,045
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you are going to gentrify the square with condos above the storefronts, then you need to clean up that view for them anyway.

1397
02:15:39,825 --> 02:15:41,767
[SPEAKER_22]: The losers appear to be the businesses.

1398
02:15:42,408 --> 02:15:49,595
[SPEAKER_22]: However, Carly Fence would do better on a front lot on Mystic Ave with a better eye-catching sign.

1399
02:15:50,541 --> 02:16:01,704
[SPEAKER_22]: The other businesses will have a harder time finding lots because they are automotive by nature and have a lot of grease and oil and stuff requirements.

1400
02:16:03,464 --> 02:16:10,706
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe that the city would be short sighted not to consider the whole area between the police station and the DPW lots.

1401
02:16:11,276 --> 02:16:18,518
[SPEAKER_22]: as possible office and building structures for city business, leaving more room in city hall for new areas of interest.

1402
02:16:19,158 --> 02:16:21,639
[SPEAKER_22]: As you know, the city is growing and it needs more space.

1403
02:16:22,379 --> 02:16:36,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, my point is, is that since this isn't going to happen tomorrow, we need to help plan with the five year vision of, you know, breaking ground at the police station.

1404
02:16:36,363 --> 02:16:38,424
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you do, you're going to have to do it where it is.

1405
02:16:38,922 --> 02:16:41,345
[SPEAKER_22]: because it's centrally located, it's easy to find.

1406
02:16:41,885 --> 02:16:44,508
[SPEAKER_22]: You want police, fire, and 911 all in the same area.

1407
02:16:45,009 --> 02:16:49,213
[SPEAKER_22]: Clearly the current building size is not big enough, the footprint is not big enough.

1408
02:16:49,534 --> 02:16:52,317
[SPEAKER_22]: So you're gonna have to take over that little alley anyway.

1409
02:16:53,362 --> 02:17:05,170
[SPEAKER_22]: So since you're going to do that and you're going to disturb the area, you might as well do it all in one shot with the business community, with all the department heads, with everybody on board and visualize what you want it to look like.

1410
02:17:05,911 --> 02:17:09,493
[SPEAKER_22]: And it'll serve as a, everybody will be happy.

1411
02:17:09,853 --> 02:17:15,437
[SPEAKER_22]: But what I'm saying is if we just take, take it by eminent domain, you're going to cause a lot of trouble.

1412
02:17:16,117 --> 02:17:19,740
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you, if I think that we all need to work with the business communities down there,

1413
02:17:20,170 --> 02:17:29,276
[SPEAKER_22]: and find them another home inside the city where these automotive, mostly automotive places, body shops and whatnot, can do their business along Mystic Ave or someplace.

1414
02:17:29,576 --> 02:17:30,696
[SPEAKER_22]: There's got to be someplace for them.

1415
02:17:31,277 --> 02:17:34,359
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you don't, you're going to have to take the ground anyway.

1416
02:17:35,099 --> 02:17:37,580
[SPEAKER_22]: And it'll cause problems if it happens abruptly.

1417
02:17:38,041 --> 02:17:38,801
[SPEAKER_22]: So plan it well.

1418
02:17:39,221 --> 02:17:39,542
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1419
02:17:41,883 --> 02:17:42,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1420
02:17:42,263 --> 02:17:45,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, Mr. Martin, if you'd like for your information.

1421
02:17:45,505 --> 02:17:48,387
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Knight,

1422
02:17:48,723 --> 02:17:50,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caput.

1423
02:17:50,144 --> 02:18:03,269
[SPEAKER_13]: For your information, there's going to be some building going on down there, so I think Joseph's Limousine is planning on building a building down there, because they were on the Board of Appeals docket for this one.

1424
02:18:03,829 --> 02:18:07,131
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know there is some construction slated for down there.

1425
02:18:07,251 --> 02:18:08,271
[SPEAKER_22]: So they're going to build higher?

1426
02:18:08,991 --> 02:18:10,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's nothing there on the property.

1427
02:18:10,372 --> 02:18:13,193
[SPEAKER_13]: They are going to build a permanent garage there.

1428
02:18:13,773 --> 02:18:13,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1429
02:18:13,953 --> 02:18:15,194
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I think, I don't know.

1430
02:18:15,214 --> 02:18:17,935
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys got to stop it, man, because where are you going to put the police station?

1431
02:18:18,298 --> 02:18:20,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, again, that's their property that they own.

1432
02:18:20,979 --> 02:18:21,279
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

1433
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:23,260
[SPEAKER_22]: But where's the police station going to go?

1434
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:24,720
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, that's their property that they own.

1435
02:18:24,740 --> 02:18:26,121
[SPEAKER_22]: We just can't go and- With all due respect.

1436
02:18:26,181 --> 02:18:27,321
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to argue.

1437
02:18:27,341 --> 02:18:28,201
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's their property.

1438
02:18:30,042 --> 02:18:32,903
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I understand that, sir, through the chair, with all due respect.

1439
02:18:33,003 --> 02:18:33,883
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know I respect you.

1440
02:18:36,964 --> 02:18:46,087
[SPEAKER_22]: The city has an obligation to provide public safety first before anything else, even my house.

1441
02:18:46,487 --> 02:18:47,868
[SPEAKER_22]: So when it comes to public safety,

1442
02:18:48,973 --> 02:18:51,335
[SPEAKER_22]: the city should be able to take my house for public safety.

1443
02:18:51,355 --> 02:18:51,935
[SPEAKER_22]: I wouldn't like it.

1444
02:18:52,316 --> 02:18:53,056
[SPEAKER_22]: I would not like it.

1445
02:18:53,637 --> 02:18:56,659
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's, that's the, where are you going to put the public safety building?

1446
02:18:57,179 --> 02:18:59,921
[SPEAKER_22]: If not in the Medford Square where it is, where are you going to put it?

1447
02:18:59,981 --> 02:19:00,642
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my question.

1448
02:19:00,942 --> 02:19:02,063
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll put that to the chair.

1449
02:19:02,743 --> 02:19:03,764
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll put that to the president.

1450
02:19:04,164 --> 02:19:08,207
[SPEAKER_22]: If not in Medford Square, right where it is, where are you going to put it?

1451
02:19:08,727 --> 02:19:09,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1452
02:19:09,688 --> 02:19:10,669
[SPEAKER_15]: The chair on

1453
02:19:12,655 --> 02:19:16,417
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1454
02:19:17,078 --> 02:19:17,898
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1455
02:19:18,599 --> 02:19:19,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1456
02:19:19,799 --> 02:19:20,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

1457
02:19:26,904 --> 02:19:27,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1458
02:19:27,584 --> 02:19:29,225
[SPEAKER_15]: And papers under suspension too?

1459
02:19:29,906 --> 02:19:30,686
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1460
02:19:30,706 --> 02:19:31,667
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1461
02:19:31,867 --> 02:19:34,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1462
02:19:34,628 --> 02:19:37,310
[SPEAKER_15]: 1516-026 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1463
02:19:37,770 --> 02:19:40,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Be resolved that the Medford City Council request a timeframe

1464
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:46,743
[SPEAKER_15]: for removing the three old payphone stands in Medford Square and one in West Medford.

1465
02:19:47,003 --> 02:19:49,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you asked on this not too long ago.

1466
02:19:49,064 --> 02:19:50,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did, Mr. President.

1467
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:55,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Two were taken out, but there's still one at 43 Salem Street.

1468
02:19:56,487 --> 02:20:07,192
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two in front of the CVS on Riverside Avenue, and there's one across from 491 High Street that is still left standing there, and they're just eyesores.

1469
02:20:08,292 --> 02:20:10,493
[SPEAKER_13]: on the sidewalk, there's no phones on them.

1470
02:20:10,833 --> 02:20:13,134
[SPEAKER_13]: 140 High Street?

1471
02:20:13,334 --> 02:20:13,694
[SPEAKER_13]: 43 Salem.

1472
02:20:14,214 --> 02:20:14,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1473
02:20:14,854 --> 02:20:19,716
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two at the CVS, in front of the CVS on Riverside Avenue with broken phones.

1474
02:20:20,696 --> 02:20:23,257
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's one across from 491 High Street.

1475
02:20:23,657 --> 02:20:24,257
[SPEAKER_13]: 491 High Street.

1476
02:20:24,537 --> 02:20:26,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Right in between St.

1477
02:20:26,378 --> 02:20:27,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Rayfield's Church and the gas station.

1478
02:20:28,818 --> 02:20:29,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1479
02:20:30,719 --> 02:20:30,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1480
02:20:31,019 --> 02:20:31,519
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not kiosks.

1481
02:20:31,859 --> 02:20:32,560
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not kiosks.

1482
02:20:36,815 --> 02:20:42,300
[SPEAKER_13]: They did take out the one at the Brookline Bank in front of the member's credit unit.

1483
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:46,744
[SPEAKER_13]: So those two were removed, but there's still some other ones that need to be removed, Mr. President.

1484
02:20:48,425 --> 02:21:01,576
[SPEAKER_15]: And you also had on 16-027 be resolved that the Memphis City Council request the electrical department to remove the hanging wires at the bus stop at 382 Main Street.

1485
02:21:02,056 --> 02:21:02,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, thank you, Mr. President.

1486
02:21:04,414 --> 02:21:16,259
[SPEAKER_13]: It was brought to my attention on Sunday that at 382 Main Street, which is Arthur's Pastry, right at the bus stop, there's been wires that have been hanging down, I guess for about a year.

1487
02:21:16,799 --> 02:21:21,761
[SPEAKER_13]: And I never really noticed them until Mr. Giordano brought them to my attention.

1488
02:21:22,161 --> 02:21:25,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we could have the electrical department go there and take them down, because they are kind of low.

1489
02:21:27,372 --> 02:21:27,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1490
02:21:28,012 --> 02:21:31,714
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion for approval for both those papers, all those in favor?

1491
02:21:32,234 --> 02:21:34,735
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1492
02:21:34,755 --> 02:21:35,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Carries.

1493
02:21:35,555 --> 02:21:57,004
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-028 offered by Councilor Knight, whereas January 6, 2016 marks the five year anniversary of his passing, and whereas Michael J. Callaghan was a lifelong resident of Medford, and whereas Michael J. Callaghan is credited with protecting and preserving Wright's Pond as an open space, and whereas Michael J. Callaghan is credited with 48 years of public service

1494
02:21:57,485 --> 02:22:01,828
[SPEAKER_15]: to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the citizenry of Medford.

1495
02:22:02,508 --> 02:22:15,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in honor of Michael J. Callahan, and be it further resolved that tonight's meeting be adjourned in remembrance of Governor's Counselor Michael J. Callahan.

1496
02:22:16,417 --> 02:22:19,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Please rise and join us in a moment of silence.

1497
02:22:19,699 --> 02:22:21,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think Counselor Knight wants to.

1498
02:22:22,281 --> 02:22:23,222
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, Mr. President.

1499
02:22:24,390 --> 02:22:28,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Michael Callahan was a good friend to me and many of us behind this rail, as well as many of us in the community.

1500
02:22:29,692 --> 02:22:30,673
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a mentor to me.

1501
02:22:30,713 --> 02:22:35,215
[SPEAKER_14]: He taught me more about government in the short time that I was able to know him and be around him.

1502
02:22:35,395 --> 02:22:38,556
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was a great guy who had his head on right.

1503
02:22:38,616 --> 02:22:43,918
[SPEAKER_14]: He understood that government was about people, about helping people, and about making sure that it's working for you, Mr. President.

1504
02:22:43,938 --> 02:22:44,699
[SPEAKER_14]: He's sadly missed.

1505
02:22:44,739 --> 02:22:45,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I think of him every day.

1506
02:22:46,039 --> 02:22:48,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate the Council indulging me as I bring this resolution forward.

1507
02:22:49,301 --> 02:22:49,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Counselor.

1508
02:23:04,006 --> 02:23:05,767
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple of papers in the hands of the clerk.

1509
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:11,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

1510
02:23:13,311 --> 02:23:25,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that long time Medford resident and my neighbor, Johnny Amari, be recognized for celebrating his 50th birthday.

1511
02:23:25,378 --> 02:23:26,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1512
02:23:27,099 --> 02:23:28,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1513
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:33,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Many of us know Johnny Amari for many years in this community.

1514
02:23:34,306 --> 02:23:38,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Johnny has been an active member of this community for a number of years.

1515
02:23:38,909 --> 02:23:39,850
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a great guy.

1516
02:23:39,890 --> 02:23:43,292
[SPEAKER_19]: He just celebrated his 50th birthday, Mr. President.

1517
02:23:43,913 --> 02:23:46,355
[SPEAKER_19]: I had the opportunity to attend his birthday party.

1518
02:23:47,315 --> 02:23:52,279
[SPEAKER_19]: And let me tell you, Johnny hasn't changed a bit over the years.

1519
02:23:52,819 --> 02:23:54,040
[SPEAKER_19]: He's the same guy I remember.

1520
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:57,442
[SPEAKER_19]: I grew up on Stearns Ave, right next door to Johnny.

1521
02:23:58,123 --> 02:24:00,985
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's the same gentleman I remember from years ago.

1522
02:24:01,954 --> 02:24:05,676
[SPEAKER_19]: And many of us refer to him as the mayor of South Method.

1523
02:24:06,496 --> 02:24:08,056
[SPEAKER_19]: And he truly is, Mr. President.

1524
02:24:08,116 --> 02:24:11,238
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a staple in that particular section of the city.

1525
02:24:11,658 --> 02:24:16,520
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just want to wish him a happy 50th and another 50 for Johnny.

1526
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:19,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy birthday, Johnny.

1527
02:24:19,541 --> 02:24:20,361
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1528
02:24:21,201 --> 02:24:21,862
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1529
02:24:21,942 --> 02:24:22,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1530
02:24:22,602 --> 02:24:23,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

1531
02:24:23,602 --> 02:24:30,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Winchester Street detour be discussed regarding public safety for area South Method residents.

1532
02:24:30,425 --> 02:24:31,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1533
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:33,151
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1534
02:24:33,531 --> 02:24:51,260
[SPEAKER_19]: MassDOT came out with their construction detour information just recently, and I received a number of calls from area residents that were concerned about the increased traffic coming down some of the side streets.

1535
02:24:52,121 --> 02:24:56,063
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know the south side of Harvard Street

1536
02:24:57,668 --> 02:25:02,191
[SPEAKER_19]: is to be completed and reopened on January 22nd.

1537
02:25:02,992 --> 02:25:09,738
[SPEAKER_19]: After the sidewalk is reopened, the gravel sidewalk on the north side will be closed for grading, curb, installation, and paving.

1538
02:25:10,138 --> 02:25:17,744
[SPEAKER_19]: The north side walk is estimated to be completed by February 5th, assuming no weather-related delays.

1539
02:25:18,365 --> 02:25:23,749
[SPEAKER_19]: And work cannot occur on the north side until the south side work is completed.

1540
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:26,882
[SPEAKER_19]: Each side requires its own lane closure.

1541
02:25:27,382 --> 02:25:35,186
[SPEAKER_19]: During the construction of the Harvard Street sidewalks, Winchester Street, and this is why I bring this up, Mr. President, is being used to detour traffic.

1542
02:25:35,627 --> 02:25:38,608
[SPEAKER_19]: The result of this is that there is an increase of speeding vehicles.

1543
02:25:39,389 --> 02:25:49,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Residents trying to exit their driveways onto Winchester from Morton, Granville, and Wareham are experiencing near misses trying to get out of their driveway.

1544
02:25:49,635 --> 02:25:52,136
[SPEAKER_19]: The recommendation from the neighbors I spoke with

1545
02:25:52,881 --> 02:26:18,138
[SPEAKER_19]: They'd like to see, at least for the next several weeks, the temporary electronic flashing speed sign, speed limit sign, appear on Winchester Street to try to slow down some of these people that are using this particular area now, and that an increase in police patrols during rush hours be implemented to help alleviate some of the concerns of the neighborhood, Mr. President.

1546
02:26:18,679 --> 02:26:22,261
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would ask that those two recommendations, the temporary electronic flashing

1547
02:26:22,617 --> 02:26:34,824
[SPEAKER_19]: speed sign be placed on Winchester Street, and increased patrols during rush hour, during the rush hours on Winchester and those surrounding Morton and Granville and Wareham.

1548
02:26:35,324 --> 02:26:35,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1549
02:26:36,024 --> 02:26:37,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of those concerns were brought to my attention.

1550
02:26:37,845 --> 02:26:41,507
[SPEAKER_15]: I've already spoken to the chief about them, but these are excellent measures, Councillor.

1551
02:26:41,547 --> 02:26:41,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1552
02:26:42,348 --> 02:26:43,848
[SPEAKER_15]: A motion for approval by Councillor Marks.

1553
02:26:43,908 --> 02:26:44,589
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favour?

1554
02:26:45,129 --> 02:26:45,769
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1555
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:46,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1556
02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:50,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councillor Caviello, we resolve that the Memphis City

1557
02:26:51,437 --> 02:26:59,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Council petition the traffic commission in regards to moving the Jersey barrier by the Craddock bridge so that people can cross the street to frequent businesses.

1558
02:27:00,519 --> 02:27:03,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Also request temporary crosswalk in that position.

1559
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:04,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caviello.

1560
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1561
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:20,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, you know, we spoke about this last week in the meeting, and on a Wednesday night, I met with the DOT, with Representative Donato at Carol's Restaurant, and they came down and promised to make

1562
02:27:22,410 --> 02:27:25,011
[SPEAKER_13]: the necessary changes to that.

1563
02:27:25,031 --> 02:27:36,335
[SPEAKER_13]: And we explained to them how, you know, making an opening in one of those Jersey barriers would help out the people because now when they're parking on the other side there, they have to walk all the way up to the corner of the cross.

1564
02:27:37,475 --> 02:27:42,277
[SPEAKER_13]: They agreed to do it, and up until today, they still haven't done it.

1565
02:27:42,357 --> 02:27:51,000
[SPEAKER_13]: And I spoke with Representative Donato again, and he has recommended that we petition the traffic commission to get them to get on the

1566
02:27:51,373 --> 02:27:52,253
[SPEAKER_13]: the construction company.

1567
02:27:52,514 --> 02:27:59,417
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, when they do that, if we could possibly put in a temporary crosswalk, so make it a little bit easier for people to cross there.

1568
02:27:59,457 --> 02:28:02,678
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, you know, they're killing the business over there.

1569
02:28:03,139 --> 02:28:06,860
[SPEAKER_13]: At least we should do our part to help out any way we can.

1570
02:28:07,361 --> 02:28:07,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

1571
02:28:08,781 --> 02:28:14,004
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, Councilor Marks.

1572
02:28:14,064 --> 02:28:16,645
[SPEAKER_19]: I thank Councilor Caviello for bringing up this important issue.

1573
02:28:17,145 --> 02:28:20,867
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I would state, Mr. President, when DOT was before us,

1574
02:28:21,492 --> 02:28:23,192
[SPEAKER_19]: with all their high-paid salaries.

1575
02:28:23,873 --> 02:28:26,233
[SPEAKER_19]: They mentioned there's going to be a 24-hour hotline.

1576
02:28:26,513 --> 02:28:28,594
[SPEAKER_19]: There's going to be contact people we can get a hold of.

1577
02:28:29,014 --> 02:28:46,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we're hearing we have to petition our own traffic commission because we're unable to get a hold of DOT, as Councilor Caviello just mentioned, to make some small — these are minor changes, which makes — Mr. President, we met with them at 10 o'clock that evening, and they agreed to make these changes, and they just ignored it.

1578
02:28:47,159 --> 02:28:47,359
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1579
02:28:47,579 --> 02:28:47,779
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1580
02:28:48,019 --> 02:28:49,820
[SPEAKER_19]: So — so, that's my issue.

1581
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:50,700
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, if —

1582
02:28:51,519 --> 02:28:58,884
[SPEAKER_19]: elected officials, as Councilor Caviello, are unable to address some of the minor concerns, Mr. President.

1583
02:28:59,284 --> 02:29:01,246
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we have to put a halt on this project.

1584
02:29:01,786 --> 02:29:02,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe it's about time.

1585
02:29:02,747 --> 02:29:21,079
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mentioned this several months ago, and, you know, I got a lot of feedback from people that were supportive of it, that we put a temporary halt on the project until some of these questions that are being asked by area businesses, Mr. President, and issues that Councilor Caviello just mentioned about the Jersey Barriers

1586
02:29:21,472 --> 02:29:29,295
[SPEAKER_19]: are addressed, because it seems to me that DOT is not a willing partner in this, and they're going to go down kicking on every issue.

1587
02:29:29,915 --> 02:29:41,679
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, you know, if the council sees fit, I think we should offer a resolution, Mr. President, asking that if these issues are not addressed immediately, then a halt to the project be taken.

1588
02:29:42,059 --> 02:29:43,079
[SPEAKER_19]: And we take a vote on that, Mr. President.

1589
02:29:43,099 --> 02:29:43,559
[SPEAKER_19]: The President.

1590
02:29:43,780 --> 02:29:46,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a suitable amendment, Counselor?

1591
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:48,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor, if my colleague would like, I'd be happy to put that on.

1592
02:29:48,461 --> 02:29:50,862
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Counselor Marks.

1593
02:29:51,448 --> 02:29:53,790
[SPEAKER_15]: So on that motion, did you want to speak council?

1594
02:29:54,510 --> 02:29:54,670
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1595
02:29:55,130 --> 02:29:55,491
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1596
02:29:55,791 --> 02:29:57,972
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, all those in favor, roll call vote.

1597
02:29:57,992 --> 02:29:59,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President roll call vote has been requested.

1598
02:29:59,973 --> 02:30:03,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll timeline.

1599
02:30:03,836 --> 02:30:08,819
[SPEAKER_19]: So we know when we can, uh, should we wait a week to get a response?

1600
02:30:08,979 --> 02:30:12,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we'll go into the traffic commission, which means monthly on this.

1601
02:30:13,002 --> 02:30:15,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, they don't meet again until next month.

1602
02:30:15,863 --> 02:30:16,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

1603
02:30:17,044 --> 02:30:18,565
[SPEAKER_19]: Which is right.

1604
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:21,082
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems like a long time to wait.

1605
02:30:21,562 --> 02:30:25,246
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, I mean, we were here on Tuesday.

1606
02:30:25,266 --> 02:30:29,870
[SPEAKER_14]: We passed the resolution that was seven days ago, which was five business days ago.

1607
02:30:29,970 --> 02:30:36,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caviello met them there Wednesday evening at 10 o'clock, which was in essence, really Thursday morning.

1608
02:30:36,296 --> 02:30:37,978
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was only three business days ago.

1609
02:30:38,419 --> 02:30:40,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to give them an ample opportunity to get it done.

1610
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:41,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I think council marks is on the right track.

1611
02:30:41,981 --> 02:30:46,224
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to put some sort of timeline in there to see if we can effectuate this change in a certain period of time.

1612
02:30:46,544 --> 02:30:53,148
[SPEAKER_14]: But I also want to be cognizant of the fact that it's really only been three business days that have passed since the request was made.

1613
02:30:53,268 --> 02:30:57,251
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if we've gotten a refusal back from DLT saying that they're not going to do it.

1614
02:31:01,073 --> 02:31:01,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Please counsel.

1615
02:31:02,214 --> 02:31:05,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the DLT came the next morning, they removed,

1616
02:31:06,313 --> 02:31:10,917
[SPEAKER_13]: the barrels and the barriers from in front of one of the businesses.

1617
02:31:11,777 --> 02:31:18,403
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said that that next morning, he would also open a space up between the Jersey barrier to let the people cross.

1618
02:31:19,003 --> 02:31:25,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Then, according to Representative Donato, he's saying that they're not doing it now.

1619
02:31:25,068 --> 02:31:27,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Counselor Scarpelli.

1620
02:31:28,151 --> 02:31:35,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, please, forgive my naive train of thought here, but what city department,

1621
02:31:36,633 --> 02:31:40,678
[SPEAKER_04]: and director is overseeing the building.

1622
02:31:40,698 --> 02:31:41,539
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be OCD.

1623
02:31:41,579 --> 02:31:45,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So if OCD, why don't we... The city engineer has called you the point person on this project.

1624
02:31:45,804 --> 02:31:56,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that we, for immediate action, we make the amendment that we send the department that's directly in charge there in the morning to give us an answer ASAP.

1625
02:31:58,198 --> 02:31:59,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that be the engineering department, Mr. President?

1626
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:04,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm under the impression that the engineer has been the point person.

1627
02:32:04,483 --> 02:32:08,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Based on my discussions with Mr. Daley from the DOT, that engineering has been.

1628
02:32:08,766 --> 02:32:13,310
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could do that also.

1629
02:32:14,891 --> 02:32:20,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Refer to the traffic commission as well as the engineering department for immediate action.

1630
02:32:20,695 --> 02:32:23,657
[SPEAKER_15]: And Councilor Marks, you wanted a time frame if you would.

1631
02:32:23,998 --> 02:32:27,100
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say if we don't hear, if this is not resolved by next Tuesday,

1632
02:32:27,714 --> 02:32:31,897
[SPEAKER_19]: And next Tuesday we take a vote to stop the project to stop the project.

1633
02:32:31,957 --> 02:32:32,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring the matter forward next week.

1634
02:32:33,098 --> 02:32:33,839
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not fixed.

1635
02:32:34,179 --> 02:32:42,646
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we could have an amendment that we have a suitable answer as to why this wasn't done, it'd be just small fixes.

1636
02:32:43,346 --> 02:32:47,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was all supposed to be worked out for the benefit of the businesses.

1637
02:32:49,271 --> 02:32:56,777
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion for approval, all those in favor, all those opposed motion carries unanimously records.

1638
02:32:59,325 --> 02:33:01,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, before we go to the records.

1639
02:33:01,726 --> 02:33:02,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes, by all means.

1640
02:33:07,267 --> 02:33:23,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, over the last, I think it's been three months now, I put on two separate resolutions that were voted unanimously by this council asking about the temporary speed bumps that were placed on Harvard Street and Central Ave.

1641
02:33:24,571 --> 02:33:27,592
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm under the impression that the one on Harvard Street now is gone.

1642
02:33:28,673 --> 02:33:29,814
[SPEAKER_19]: as recently as a day.

1643
02:33:30,914 --> 02:33:31,815
[SPEAKER_19]: That has been removed.

1644
02:33:32,175 --> 02:33:35,776
[SPEAKER_19]: I have yet to get a response on two separate resolutions.

1645
02:33:35,937 --> 02:33:47,922
[SPEAKER_19]: Those two locations were part of the pilot program that involved three raised, not speed bumps, three raised crosswalks, of which Winthrop Street was the only one that was placed in.

1646
02:33:48,423 --> 02:33:50,323
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've yet to get a response, Mr. President.

1647
02:33:50,624 --> 02:33:57,547
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there's a new administration now, but I'm hoping that we can get a response back from someone in engineering or someone in DPW.

1648
02:33:58,046 --> 02:34:17,642
[SPEAKER_19]: or someone in the building that's in the know why these two speed bumps have popped up in the community, why one now is gone, and what's happening with the raised crosswalks that the mayor came out with a press conference saying that this was part of the initial pilot program to help with pedestrian safety in our community.

1649
02:34:17,782 --> 02:34:18,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Three years ago.

1650
02:34:18,803 --> 02:34:25,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, three years ago, and to help mitigate some of the concerns we have with increased speeding in our community, Mr. President.

1651
02:34:26,420 --> 02:34:28,021
[SPEAKER_19]: So I really would like to get an answer on that.

1652
02:34:28,321 --> 02:34:29,981
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a public safety concern.

1653
02:34:30,621 --> 02:34:32,902
[SPEAKER_19]: This is, this is not just some pie in the sky issue.

1654
02:34:33,182 --> 02:34:34,643
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a public safety concern.

1655
02:34:34,883 --> 02:34:38,484
[SPEAKER_19]: We read all the time in the paper about pedestrians being struck and killed.

1656
02:34:39,345 --> 02:34:40,645
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not in every other community.

1657
02:34:40,665 --> 02:34:41,685
[SPEAKER_19]: It's in our community too.

1658
02:34:42,186 --> 02:34:47,507
[SPEAKER_19]: And, and really, uh, to not address these concerns is a detrimental Mr. President.

1659
02:34:48,088 --> 02:34:54,830
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, on the motion of council marks that the, uh, uh, mayor's office report back immediately to the city council,

1660
02:34:55,652 --> 02:35:08,241
[SPEAKER_15]: regarding the status of the raised crosswalks, the aforementioned raised crosswalks, and the temporary speed bump program on Harvard and also on Central.

1661
02:35:09,422 --> 02:35:11,083
[SPEAKER_15]: On a motion for approval, all those in favor?

1662
02:35:11,663 --> 02:35:12,304
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1663
02:35:12,364 --> 02:35:13,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1664
02:35:13,645 --> 02:35:19,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Records of the meeting of January 5th, 2016 were passed to Councilor Caviello.

1665
02:35:20,012 --> 02:35:23,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor, how did you find those?

1666
02:35:24,433 --> 02:35:25,353
[SPEAKER_15]: And I find them in order.

1667
02:35:26,374 --> 02:35:27,434
[SPEAKER_15]: And you move approval?

1668
02:35:27,614 --> 02:35:28,194
[SPEAKER_15]: I move approval.

1669
02:35:28,374 --> 02:35:30,795
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval of the records of the January 15th.
