241
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:01,568
[SPEAKER_08]: The purpose of this hearing is to hear the Medford Community Development Board on the following item.

242
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:14,765
[SPEAKER_08]: proposed amendment to the City of Medford zoning map, specifically to amend the Salem Street Corridor District to rezone the parcels currently zoned MX-2 within the Salem Street and Park Street node to MX-1 as shown on the map entitled Salem Street Corridor Zoning, dated March 3rd, 2025.

243
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:26,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Project materials can be viewed in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Room 308, or on the City's website for the Community Development Board and clicking Current CD Board Filings.

[SPEAKER_08]: Call 781-393-2501 for any aids and accommodations.

245
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,529
[SPEAKER_08]: TDD 781-393-2516.

246
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:37,731
[SPEAKER_08]: The city of Medford is an EEOAA 504 employer.

247
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:47,634
[SPEAKER_08]: For additional information, contact the office of the city clerk at 781-393-2425 by order of the Medford city council, signed Richard Alicio, assistant city clerk.

248
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:55,297
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we do have a letter from the community development board.

249
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:00,664
[SPEAKER_08]: from September 15th.

250
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:09,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We referred this proposed amendment to the Community Development Board, and they met on it in a public hearing, and they have sent it back to us.

251
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:25,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure, or at least I'm not seeing a letter since then, but we do have Danielle Evans from the Planning Office, and Danielle, if you could present on this amendment, let us know what it is about, and then we will go to questions and comments from councilors, and then I'll open the public hearing.

252
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:33,287
[SPEAKER_36]: Good evening, Danielle Evans, senior planner.

253
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:46,582
[SPEAKER_36]: So this map change was initiated by the mayor to change the MX2, which is the node by the intersection of Park Street and Salem Street.

254
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:53,131
[SPEAKER_36]: to change that back to the original Community Development Board recommendation, which was the MX1.

255
00:36:54,091 --> 00:37:04,514
[SPEAKER_36]: The differences between those two districts are primarily it's the height where the MX1 can go up to four stories with incentives.

256
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:09,955
[SPEAKER_36]: and the MX2 can go up to six stories with incentives.

257
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:27,179
[SPEAKER_36]: And then there were two changes in the use table that is different between the two districts, and that is the, in the MX2, the brewery taproom is allowed by right, but is not allowed in the MX1.

258
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:43,717
[SPEAKER_36]: And the other use is a new defined term, which is the neighborhood medical office, which is different from the original all-encompassing medical office use.

259
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:49,402
[SPEAKER_36]: And I can find that definition if you all need that.

260
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:22,318
[SPEAKER_36]: So the neighborhood medical office use, which is allowed in the MX2 and not the MX1, is defined as office of a physician, dentist, or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital as defined in section 94-12 definitions.

261
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:31,924
[SPEAKER_36]: The office area shall not exceed 1500 square feet of gross floor area, shall have no more than five employees, and shall operate only between the hours of 8 a.m.

262
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:32,165
[SPEAKER_36]: and 7 p.m.

263
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:41,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

264
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:44,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Community Development Board referred this back.

265
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:46,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they make any amendments or as much as their recommendation?

266
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:51,224
[SPEAKER_36]: Nope, it basically is the same what they had recommended.

267
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,948
[SPEAKER_36]: I guess it was March, I think.

268
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:57,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So their recommendation is to approve the amendment?

269
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

270
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:58,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

271
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:09,970
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor's communicated to us and communicated to the public that approval of this amendment is essentially she wants us to approve this before we can move forward on the zoning project.

272
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any updates on that relative to this or is anyone else from the office planning to attempt to talk about that?

273
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:34,114
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not a signatory on that contract, but my understanding is that once this change, if this change passes, then we could execute an extension with the consultants in this land strategies group.

274
00:39:34,134 --> 00:39:34,834
[SPEAKER_36]: They changed their name.

275
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:48,240
[SPEAKER_36]: and then get back to the important work of first embarking on rezoning Medford Square and then focusing on some of the commercial quarters.

276
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,281
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not sure which particular order.

277
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:56,686
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that's still being negotiated between, I think, yourself and the mayor.

278
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:01,690
[SPEAKER_36]: I haven't really been too involved with that stuff.

279
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:05,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was just wondering, I know the council received an email today kind of with some generalities.

280
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know if you had like a document or anything about that.

281
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:12,733
[SPEAKER_36]: I only had, I received the email.

282
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:13,954
[SPEAKER_36]: I was copied on it.

283
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,414
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, great.

284
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:16,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

285
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:21,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions or comments from the council for senior planner Evans?

286
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Or general comments on this amendment as proposed?

287
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:30,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng?

288
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:35,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a question about this note in particular.

289
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:55,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the reasons why in earlier this year we voted not to accept that this specific recommendation was that we had been told that it would be harder for someone to come in and build on the property there if it had a lower height restriction, lower story restriction, because

290
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,713
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I think for a number of Councilors, our priority is to make sure that that's not a dirt pit going forward.

291
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:17,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you explain to us how, if we can expect to see building at this node, even if we make it tougher to build with the kind of lower story requirements?

292
00:41:19,883 --> 00:41:20,223
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

293
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,725
[SPEAKER_36]: So through the president,

294
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,706
[SPEAKER_36]: Sorry about that, but try not to yell too much.

295
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:37,217
[SPEAKER_36]: So the pit actually had a use variance and a site plan approval for a three story building but they have not moved forward with that.

296
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:43,284
[SPEAKER_36]: So, the four stories is more dense than what was approved there.

297
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:49,205
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know if it was financing or what has stalled that project.

298
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:55,429
[SPEAKER_36]: I have kids that go to the Roberts School and I'd like to see that pit filled up too with something useful.

299
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,185
[SPEAKER_36]: But the four stories, I don't think, would be detrimental.

300
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:19,582
[SPEAKER_36]: We already have a applicant further up on Salem Street, the MX1, that is proposing a four-story building with the incentive, which they're eligible for because they're building a completely enclosed garage.

301
00:42:22,115 --> 00:42:22,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

302
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:26,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean I think for for me I'm just speaking for myself as a Councilor.

303
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:33,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure I'm open minded to a change here I just want to make sure that the policy reasons.

304
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:39,940
[SPEAKER_09]: which we undertake this change line up with the policy reasons why we didn't make this change earlier on in the year.

305
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:53,803
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's important to me to know that, you know, when we think about financing, when we think about the feasibility of a project coming through there, that this change from MX2 to 1 won't hinder any progress that we might want there.

306
00:42:54,504 --> 00:43:05,413
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, I think the idea was that at six stories, they likely weren't those those sites were too small that they likely would not be able to be developed the six stories anyways.

307
00:43:07,984 --> 00:43:12,448
[SPEAKER_36]: but there is some like assembling of parcels and there are some historic buildings there.

308
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:17,133
[SPEAKER_36]: The historical commission actually was also in favor of it being reduced.

309
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:29,245
[SPEAKER_36]: And that was part of the input that was received during the original public hearings where the CD board voted to decrease that to the four stories.

310
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:42,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to be clear about that, is the worry that the assembling of the parcels would let a building be six stories, and that was a concern that that would be too high?

311
00:43:47,398 --> 00:43:52,979
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, the idea was, the fear was, what is the six stories?

312
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:57,200
[SPEAKER_36]: This can't be built anyways on these parcels because you couldn't fit everything there.

313
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:07,241
[SPEAKER_36]: But I'm not privy to who is buying the different parcels, but I've just heard kind of like through the grapevine that that's something that's happening.

314
00:44:07,421 --> 00:44:16,628
[SPEAKER_36]: And one of the parts of the ordinance talks about parcels at front on Salem Street being able to be taller.

315
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:19,229
[SPEAKER_36]: And if they're going far further back,

316
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:32,622
[SPEAKER_36]: then it could be possible there could be detrimental impacts for some of the residential parcels behind because the lots would be much deeper than originally anticipated.

317
00:44:32,642 --> 00:44:38,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I think those are all the questions I have about this note in particular.

318
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:44,929
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want it said on the record that I don't think it's, and this isn't about you, Danielle.

319
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:46,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate all the hard work that you've been doing.

320
00:44:47,697 --> 00:45:05,346
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to put it on a record going forward as a city that I don't think it's the healthiest to, you know, to dangle the fate of an important city project that has been an objective of the city across multiple administrations and city councils over years, and to make that contingent on

321
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:09,355
[SPEAKER_09]: fulfilling the mayor's priorities with one particular intersection.

322
00:45:10,455 --> 00:45:20,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we as a community can have more shared discourse about where we want to see these projects go forward, what we think has not been great, what can get better.

323
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:29,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can have those conversations maturely without, you know, risking jeopardizing the city's future going forward.

324
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,660
[SPEAKER_09]: But that being said,

325
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:34,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear from the community.

326
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:39,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear from both sides who, you know, there are people who feel strongly about MX1 and MX2.

327
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:44,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear from the CDB and their recommendations as well.

328
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:51,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, he explained, I think, a number of reasons for us to think about as a council too.

329
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:52,150
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thanks.

330
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:53,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

331
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any further questions for Planner Evans?

332
00:45:58,972 --> 00:45:59,212
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys?

333
00:45:59,652 --> 00:45:59,872
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

334
00:46:00,092 --> 00:46:00,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

335
00:46:01,147 --> 00:46:03,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse Council President.

336
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:06,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Council that means online, my bad, Matt, go ahead.

337
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:07,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

338
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:18,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So I spoke with the mayor over the phone about this and I do appreciate that she took the time I speak, I think to speak to many members of this council individually.

339
00:46:20,532 --> 00:46:21,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to this meeting and.

340
00:46:23,173 --> 00:46:45,523
[SPEAKER_04]: uh her from from what she from what she said to me her motivations for sending this back had less to do with the uh the density themselves the density itself strictly speaking and more due to the differences and the rules around neighborhood uh medical clinics between mx1 and mx2

341
00:46:49,065 --> 00:47:15,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did go through the three meetings that are on record, the January 22nd, CDB, the March 5th, CDB, and the March 11th city council meeting, and sort of counted up who was supportive of this, and who was not, and who mentioned their preferences about MX1 and MX2.

342
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:47,562
[SPEAKER_04]: basically in terms of public feedback that we have from those meetings uh the you know the january 22nd meeting you did see like more people opposed than were in favor at the march 5th meeting you saw far far more in favor of the rezoning than opposed and at the uh city council meeting there were far more in favor than opposed and like all in all unique individuals it was about

343
00:47:48,303 --> 00:48:00,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about 27 that were opposed, 37 that were in favor, and four that had kind of mixed or just different sorts of concerns.

344
00:48:00,215 --> 00:48:06,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm stating that because when people are talking about these meetings, there tends to be a good amount of

345
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,535
[SPEAKER_04]: revisionism that happens when we're talking about what was actually said at these meetings.

346
00:48:15,217 --> 00:48:23,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But my question for you, having gotten that out of the way, is could you explain a little bit about the process by which a

347
00:48:25,851 --> 00:48:48,933
[SPEAKER_04]: neighborhood medical clinic could be opened in mx2 and if that differs from what what we have now and if there could be any possibility of There could be any possibility of addressing concerns there besides reverting from mx2 to mx1 because I'm like

348
00:48:50,593 --> 00:48:53,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like this public quit pro quo process.

349
00:48:53,134 --> 00:49:04,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been public about this in the past, but I do think that it is important for residents to be clear about what's going on there.

350
00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:05,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

351
00:49:10,678 --> 00:49:11,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Danielle, go ahead.

352
00:49:12,298 --> 00:49:16,699
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm just gonna, I don't wanna speak off the cuff, so I'm just trying to get my,

353
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:44,981
[SPEAKER_04]: ordinance to load but was the question was if I'm understanding correctly what would be the process to establish a neighborhood medical office use yeah sorry I I said a lot there the two the two questions were what would it what is the process for establishing a neighborhood medical office in an mx2 and does that differ from the process that was there under the I guess not I guess the

354
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:48,342
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the, the previous zoning, the special permit.

355
00:49:49,682 --> 00:50:15,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And is there, is there any possibility since this was what the mayor told me, um, her main concern was, is there any possibility, um, of updating the zoning such that the, um, such that there could be like a, you know, different forms of MX two that would disallow neighborhood medical offices and potentially address residents concerns there.

356
00:50:19,932 --> 00:50:24,194
[SPEAKER_36]: So the previous zoning didn't have this neighborhood medical office use.

357
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,336
[SPEAKER_36]: It was simply medical office.

358
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:36,260
[SPEAKER_36]: And so the neighborhood medical office use limits the use by number of employees, the size and hours of operation.

359
00:50:37,441 --> 00:50:44,845
[SPEAKER_36]: The idea was that this could be dentist office, small kind of, not destination kind of,

360
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,912
[SPEAKER_36]: uses that would be, you know, open super early or open super late.

361
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:58,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, what was the process under the old zoning for medical offices in general in this area?

362
00:51:00,175 --> 00:51:02,015
[SPEAKER_36]: It was a special permit.

363
00:51:02,415 --> 00:51:02,676
Okay.

364
00:51:03,596 --> 00:51:05,737
[SPEAKER_36]: I'd have to find the old zoning.

365
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:13,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there was that proposed medical project that was, that was special permit community development board.

366
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:14,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay.

367
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:16,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what Salem Street was before, I think.

368
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:23,414
[SPEAKER_36]: I think it was, I'm fairly certain that the city council was the permit granting authority.

369
00:51:23,594 --> 00:51:23,694
[SPEAKER_36]: No.

370
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:24,114
[SPEAKER_36]: You weren't?

371
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:24,735
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

372
00:51:27,676 --> 00:51:28,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it never came to us.

373
00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:31,799
[SPEAKER_36]: It's because it never, they withdrew it.

374
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:36,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro.

375
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:46,687
[SPEAKER_32]: The neighborhood medical office was an invented construction for the purpose of this project because

376
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:59,634
[SPEAKER_32]: A proposed medical clinic was interested in a parcel on Salem Street, and the neighborhood was very resistant to it.

377
00:52:00,314 --> 00:52:10,378
[SPEAKER_32]: And this was invented to avoid having to allow a certain kind of medical office to open on Salem Street on this one intersection.

378
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:17,160
[SPEAKER_32]: And we are now discussing how we can get around ever allowing

379
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:24,405
[SPEAKER_32]: clinic for medication assisted treatment for people with substance use disorder to open at this one intersection.

380
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:27,808
[SPEAKER_32]: And we're talking around it in a very strange way.

381
00:52:27,828 --> 00:52:31,452
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we can just say exactly what it is because we know what it is.

382
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:43,022
[SPEAKER_32]: Somebody wanted, a company wanted to come in and open a clinic for medication assisted treatment, including Suboxone and Methadone, which is allowed and legal.

383
00:52:44,043 --> 00:52:51,965
[SPEAKER_32]: And the process by which it could open is that it would appear before the Community Development Board in Medford.

384
00:52:52,925 --> 00:53:03,347
[SPEAKER_32]: And it would have had to get a special permit, like many stores and restaurants have to get special permits on Salem Street.

385
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,027
[SPEAKER_32]: So that was the process.

386
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,908
[SPEAKER_32]: We have now invented MX1, MX2.

387
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:16,560
[SPEAKER_32]: MX2 allows medical offices, but you have to get a special permit.

388
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:21,665
[SPEAKER_32]: MX1 does not allow medical offices even with a special permit.

389
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:28,052
[SPEAKER_32]: And that is why we are being asked to change this intersection from MX2

390
00:53:29,513 --> 00:53:33,096
[SPEAKER_32]: With two extra stories which nobody I think cares about.

391
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:46,629
[SPEAKER_32]: I think what everybody cares about is that we never have the possibility of there ever being any doctor's office at this intersection, lest there be a clinic for somebody with a drug addiction issue.

392
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:54,304
[SPEAKER_32]: and somebody with a child has to explain that addiction happens.

393
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:56,406
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what we're talking about.

394
00:53:56,726 --> 00:54:10,459
[SPEAKER_32]: So we are now holding up our entire discussion of zoning in the city of Medford until this council agrees to never let there be

395
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:15,548
[SPEAKER_32]: clinic for medication assisted treatment at the intersection of Park and Salem Street.

396
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:16,790
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what we're doing.

397
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,473
[SPEAKER_32]: So if we agree to it, then we can talk about zoning again.

398
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:23,799
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's why we're all fumbling over our words.

399
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,845
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's the difference between MX1 and MX2.

400
00:54:32,508 --> 00:54:33,149
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. President?

401
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:34,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Danielle.

402
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:42,496
[SPEAKER_36]: I just wanted to clarify that in the previous zoning, the medical office use, it was Board of Appeals.

403
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:53,244
[SPEAKER_36]: It was the SPGA in the apartment one, in the apartment two, and in the industrial office, office two, and that's city council.

404
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:53,684
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

405
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:57,447
[SPEAKER_36]: So the city board wasn't actually a special permit granting authority.

406
00:54:57,487 --> 00:54:58,508
[SPEAKER_36]: They were just advisory.

407
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,449
[SPEAKER_36]: And it never made it that far.

408
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:00,890
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

409
00:55:01,654 --> 00:55:14,443
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Councilor Leming's question was, so under the old zoning, and I believe this was an apartment district, then the special permit granting authority for any medical office was the Zoning Board of Appeals.

410
00:55:15,664 --> 00:55:15,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

411
00:55:16,205 --> 00:55:24,531
[SPEAKER_08]: And then under the current zoning, which is MX2, medical offices, large medical offices are not allowed at all already.

412
00:55:25,295 --> 00:55:36,421
[SPEAKER_08]: And the neighborhood medical office, which is as councilors are noted, kind of this creation to have just very limited and small, basically, I think the argument was low impact.

413
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:50,388
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think Councilor was are also speaks to a real point that it's, it's about a specific, specific type of use of medication assisted treatment that's currently allowed in the MX two zone with a special permit from the community development board.

414
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:52,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

415
00:55:52,701 --> 00:56:01,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the proposed amendment, reducing moving from MX2 to MX1 would mean no large medical offices, which is already how it is now.

416
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:06,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also no neighborhood medical with those limitations.

417
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:08,574
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

418
00:56:08,874 --> 00:56:09,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

419
00:56:10,295 --> 00:56:12,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And Councilor Leming, there was another part to your question.

420
00:56:19,768 --> 00:56:22,189
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that pretty much answered it.

421
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that's satisfactory.

422
00:56:25,371 --> 00:56:27,732
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, great.

423
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:30,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any other questions for Planner Evans?

424
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:37,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no questions from the council for Planner Evans, thank you.

425
00:56:38,397 --> 00:56:39,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

426
00:56:39,558 --> 00:56:47,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will then hear from councillors on their thoughts on this amendment, and then I will open the public hearing to people who want to speak on this amendment.

427
00:56:48,098 --> 00:56:49,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Any Councilors would like to speak?

428
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:50,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

429
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:52,900
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

430
00:56:56,281 --> 00:57:06,344
[SPEAKER_27]: I think like some other Councilors, I am quite bothered by the idea that any zoning we might be able to do

431
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:15,234
[SPEAKER_27]: is held up by this one thing that the mayor has decided that she wants for whatever reason.

432
00:57:15,254 --> 00:57:29,727
[SPEAKER_27]: I think Councilor Leming made it clear that if we look only at people who spoke at public meetings, more people spoke in favor of the change that we suggested than spoke against it.

433
00:57:32,544 --> 00:57:42,592
[SPEAKER_27]: Honestly, my entire experience of this zoning process, I have been quite shocked by the mayor's approach over the last few months.

434
00:57:43,353 --> 00:57:44,694
[SPEAKER_27]: I entered the city council.

435
00:57:45,314 --> 00:57:57,264
[SPEAKER_27]: I was presented with plans that the community had worked on for years with thousands of residents contributing to these plans, a climate plan, a housing plan, a comprehensive plan.

436
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:14,366
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you go to City Hall and you read the comprehensive plan, which sort of incorporates all of these plans, the first page is the mayor saying how proud she is of this, how much community input there was, that she is completely behind these plans.

437
00:58:15,386 --> 00:58:18,268
[SPEAKER_27]: And then I was told we had 18 months.

438
00:58:20,685 --> 00:58:25,390
[SPEAKER_27]: to make the zoning of our city match these plans.

439
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:37,241
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you look, and by the way, the mayor hired a consultant to work with us for 18 months, and the other person who was involved every two weeks in those meetings was the mayor's staff.

440
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:42,306
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have the mayor's staff, the mayor's plans, the mayor's consultant,

441
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,186
[SPEAKER_27]: and a city council tasked with doing this in 18 months.

442
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:58,009
[SPEAKER_27]: And then suddenly, 17 months in, the mayor is deeply unhappy and raises this as an issue for the four months of the election.

443
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:05,171
[SPEAKER_27]: I do not know, honestly, I am baffled by that behavior.

444
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:07,952
[SPEAKER_27]: I do not know what that was about.

445
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,613
[SPEAKER_27]: But I will say that I,

446
00:59:12,794 --> 00:59:33,191
[SPEAKER_27]: and proud of the plans that this community spent many years making, sending 15,000 postcards to get people involved and engaged, getting thousands and thousands of comments, surveys, holding neighborhood meetings, having online maps with thousands of comments on the maps.

447
00:59:34,411 --> 00:59:42,676
[SPEAKER_27]: And when I read the documents, I think they paint a beautiful vision of this city.

448
00:59:43,757 --> 00:59:52,983
[SPEAKER_27]: And the number one thing in between us and having housing that matches what our seniors need,

449
00:59:54,216 --> 01:00:05,325
[SPEAKER_27]: having walkable neighborhoods, having vibrant squares, the number one thing in between where we are now and that vision is our 37-year-old zoning.

450
01:00:07,627 --> 01:00:21,078
[SPEAKER_27]: So the idea that if we don't vote in favor of one tiny change on one corner, because the mayor wants us to, that she will tank the entire zoning project

451
01:00:22,546 --> 01:00:25,010
[SPEAKER_27]: That does not sit well with me.

452
01:00:29,297 --> 01:00:30,979
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm going to say what I want.

453
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:46,005
[SPEAKER_27]: is for the mayor to publicly commit, I understand that it takes time, you gotta send an RFP, if we're gonna have zoning continue for the amount of time that will properly engage the residents of this city, which I have wanted since the beginning.

454
01:00:46,385 --> 01:01:01,657
[SPEAKER_27]: We have not had anywhere near enough neighborhood meetings, enough postcards going out, enough texts going out to residents of the city to ensure that their voices are heard and that we match the zoning to the micro needs of our neighborhoods, each neighborhood.

455
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:16,416
[SPEAKER_27]: So I get it, it takes time to set up the RFP and make that happen, but I need a before I want to move forward on anything zoning wise, I want to see a public statement from the mayor that we will have

456
01:01:17,996 --> 01:01:29,801
[SPEAKER_27]: funding for the consultants to help us for the amount of time it will take for us to zone our city so that it matches the visions that were created by this community.

457
01:01:30,802 --> 01:01:40,266
[SPEAKER_27]: We also need funding to do proper outreach and that funding should be run to be able to be, the outreach should be run by the city council.

458
01:01:40,686 --> 01:01:42,967
[SPEAKER_27]: Zoning is a purview of the city council and not the mayor.

459
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,548
[SPEAKER_27]: The mayor gets to have input because it is her staff.

460
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:48,369
[SPEAKER_27]: She's the one hiring the consultants.

461
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,230
[SPEAKER_27]: And those people are in those meetings.

462
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:53,532
[SPEAKER_27]: Literally every single meeting, they are there advising us.

463
01:01:53,632 --> 01:01:55,933
[SPEAKER_27]: And we are doing the things that they are advising us to do.

464
01:01:56,753 --> 01:01:58,534
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not like we're running off the course.

465
01:01:59,155 --> 01:02:07,499
[SPEAKER_27]: You can watch those zoning meetings, and you'll see, pardon me, that the consultants are like, this is our recommendation for making

466
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:15,645
[SPEAKER_27]: that your zoning, your 40-year-old zoning match Comprehensive Plan Part 2, Section E, Letter 2D.

467
01:02:18,307 --> 01:02:21,970
[SPEAKER_27]: We need to know that there's an RFP, public statement from there.

468
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:22,891
[SPEAKER_27]: There's an RFP.

469
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:25,113
[SPEAKER_27]: It will be funded for the consultants to come back.

470
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:30,638
[SPEAKER_27]: There will be funding for the City Council to run comms, to have communications about the zoning.

471
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:38,114
[SPEAKER_27]: And we have to make sure that that includes neighborhood meetings, in-person and Zoom neighborhood meetings.

472
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:49,680
[SPEAKER_27]: And frankly, I can't understand why we have to rush through this before we have proper communications and outreach to the community about even this part.

473
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:54,543
[SPEAKER_27]: We clearly have not had proper communications with the community.

474
01:02:55,544 --> 01:02:59,346
[SPEAKER_27]: And yet somehow we are supposed to rush this part through.

475
01:03:01,587 --> 01:03:04,250
[SPEAKER_27]: So I am deeply, deeply frustrated.

476
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:09,334
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm mostly frustrated because the visions of this community are about to be tanked.

477
01:03:11,616 --> 01:03:12,217
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

478
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,941
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

479
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:18,923
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

480
01:03:20,565 --> 01:03:22,206
[SPEAKER_25]: I appreciate all my colleagues input.

481
01:03:22,246 --> 01:03:22,707
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the

482
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:27,478
[SPEAKER_25]: The resounding cry we hear is the lack of public participation.

483
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:51,305
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think President Baez said it himself that something that I talked about from day one from these meetings is that the former city council really stressed for the RFP to be written to the consultant that we were bringing in to really have community meetings that go into the neighborhoods that

484
01:03:52,032 --> 01:03:59,677
[SPEAKER_25]: really impact the neighborhoods that are being zoned so the people in those neighborhoods can shape their neighborhoods with the city's efforts.

485
01:04:00,678 --> 01:04:11,425
[SPEAKER_25]: And as I listened to my colleagues, I know Councilor Leming gave numbers of people that were in favor, people that weren't, people that were in favor.

486
01:04:12,226 --> 01:04:21,492
[SPEAKER_25]: Something that I did from those meetings is went back and looked at who was at that podium that was in favor.

487
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:28,387
[SPEAKER_25]: And unfortunately, they were Method residents and everybody has a voice, but they weren't from that quarter.

488
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:42,339
[SPEAKER_25]: They weren't the residents, most of the residents from that area, not to say all, but when we did have that opportunity to be heard in that area, in that zoned area, the Roberts, there were 200 people.

489
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,823
[SPEAKER_25]: And it was residents, I would say 99% lived in that neighborhood.

490
01:04:49,708 --> 01:05:03,352
[SPEAKER_25]: So that was a true indication of what we just talked about, is really bringing more outreach into those neighborhoods so we can get a vision of what people want in their own neighborhoods as we grow our community.

491
01:05:03,372 --> 01:05:04,492
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I don't disagree.

492
01:05:05,512 --> 01:05:06,913
[SPEAKER_25]: We do need zoning changes.

493
01:05:07,273 --> 01:05:10,714
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's a loud cry that's needed.

494
01:05:10,754 --> 01:05:15,135
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that this council needs to go forward with zoning changes that

495
01:05:17,105 --> 01:05:20,968
[SPEAKER_25]: support what we're looking for as a progressive community.

496
01:05:21,888 --> 01:05:36,579
[SPEAKER_25]: And you could see that we haven't, and we have issues and what's happening in Medford Square, we have issues, what went out before the elections, what kind of get everybody motivated and really get involved in this process of the election.

497
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:44,965
[SPEAKER_25]: But the truth of the matter is the only one time we did have to go into that, into a neighborhood,

498
01:05:45,632 --> 01:05:48,314
[SPEAKER_25]: that was being affected directly, we did that.

499
01:05:49,815 --> 01:05:53,137
[SPEAKER_25]: And we had a great opportunity to listen to those neighbors.

500
01:05:53,897 --> 01:05:56,419
[SPEAKER_25]: And then we brought that to the community development board, right?

501
01:05:56,439 --> 01:06:02,463
[SPEAKER_25]: We brought that to the board and the board listened and then they came back with the request of those neighbors.

502
01:06:02,763 --> 01:06:03,624
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think we did that.

503
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,043
[SPEAKER_25]: So, although I'm not happy with the mayor, I've never, that's been public knowledge.

504
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:20,610
[SPEAKER_25]: I haven't sat here and said, I sit here night after night to the point where I believe the meeting before the election, Councilor Bears celebrated me.

505
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:22,571
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we toasted and sang, we all hugged.

506
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:24,272
[SPEAKER_25]: It was kumbaya, if you remember.

507
01:06:24,953 --> 01:06:31,777
[SPEAKER_25]: And it was because it was a night that we were like, okay, this isn't ideal we're talking about tonight.

508
01:06:31,837 --> 01:06:33,458
[SPEAKER_25]: This isn't ideal, this isn't what we want.

509
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:47,090
[SPEAKER_25]: However you feel, the only reason why I fully support this is because this piece did go to the neighbors.

510
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:51,412
[SPEAKER_25]: This piece, you listened to the people that live in that neighborhood.

511
01:06:52,893 --> 01:06:56,635
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, I don't belittle the fact that people came to that podium because it's their podium.

512
01:06:57,424 --> 01:07:05,426
[SPEAKER_25]: But when you're giving your address and you're living on Grove Street or Woburn Street or Fulton Heights, you don't live in that neighborhood.

513
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:07,247
[SPEAKER_25]: You could shake your head as much as you want.

514
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:15,850
[SPEAKER_25]: The majority of the people that spoke lived, that spoke negatively about that, lived in that quarter, lived in that neighborhood.

515
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:17,610
[SPEAKER_25]: You could say all you want.

516
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:20,171
[SPEAKER_25]: But this is exactly what we're talking about.

517
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,351
[SPEAKER_25]: This is why we're here right now.

518
01:07:22,192 --> 01:07:23,732
[SPEAKER_25]: It's because we had an opportunity to do that.

519
01:07:23,772 --> 01:07:24,172
[SPEAKER_25]: We did.

520
01:07:24,892 --> 01:07:26,913
[SPEAKER_25]: So moving forward, I agree with all of you.

521
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:49,553
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that Councilor Bears informed me that we did get an email from the mayor and she has committed, not publicly, but she has committed to moving forward with funding for more comprehensive plan of communication, bringing in an outside professional to work with our team to start getting the word out to our neighborhoods when it talks about zoning.

522
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:56,818
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not belittling the fact how hard Councilor Collins worked in trying to get us to this point,

523
01:07:58,637 --> 01:08:06,163
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'll say it again, the biggest issue that I had at the time was the fact that we weren't going into the neighborhoods.

524
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:15,810
[SPEAKER_25]: So I feel strongly that this is a move that will move us forward.

525
01:08:15,911 --> 01:08:26,339
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel that this is an opportunity that we secure funding to get the communication that's needed to move the zoning forward and accomplish what we need.

526
01:08:26,639 --> 01:08:27,520
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would move to,

527
01:08:28,391 --> 01:08:32,834
[SPEAKER_25]: to move in favor in this resolution, Mr. President.

528
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:33,375
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you.

529
01:08:35,016 --> 01:08:36,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

530
01:08:36,597 --> 01:08:40,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And just before I recognize Councilor Collins, I just want to echo you, Councilor Scarpelli.

531
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:49,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the issue that I had was we didn't, Mayor didn't give us the money for the meetings, you know, and that was really a big problem, I think, in hindsight.

532
01:08:50,453 --> 01:08:55,777
[SPEAKER_08]: we tried to move forward with the not enough resources to do it because we thought it was really important.

533
01:08:57,379 --> 01:09:01,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I mean, and Councilor Callahan went over the timeline, right?

534
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:05,185
[SPEAKER_08]: That could have been remedied on month two, not month 17.

535
01:09:05,565 --> 01:09:09,328
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I just wanted to note that piece of it.

536
01:09:09,428 --> 01:09:14,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, as you noted, right, we were on that last council together and we put out the RFP that said we wanted the meetings.

537
01:09:15,473 --> 01:09:17,795
[SPEAKER_08]: We got the proposals back that said, well, with $150,000, this is all we can do for you.

538
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:39,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I am grateful that it looks like we're going to have a more robust package that really focuses on that so that we can do that piece of the work that I you know, and I was talking about it back in July right if we had if we had gotten that funding and those resources from the mayor earlier on, then I think

539
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:47,099
[SPEAKER_08]: we would have been able to explain, A, explain better what the proposals were and hear from more people about how to change them.

540
01:09:47,139 --> 01:09:50,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when we did hear from people, we made a lot of changes.

541
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:55,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Even this one change here was one of 12 changes that was suggested and we did 11 of them, right?

542
01:09:56,703 --> 01:10:04,867
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I really hope we can move forward better with those resources to do zoning right.

543
01:10:06,428 --> 01:10:07,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

544
01:10:09,894 --> 01:10:12,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Bears.

545
01:10:15,136 --> 01:10:15,977
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll be very clear.

546
01:10:15,997 --> 01:10:19,038
[SPEAKER_15]: I could be a yes on this amendment.

547
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:24,561
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no problem changing Park and Salem from MX2 to MX1.

548
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:26,242
[SPEAKER_15]: It is not a hill to die on for me.

549
01:10:26,262 --> 01:10:30,624
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's sad that we can't have neighborhood medical uses on Salem Street.

550
01:10:30,984 --> 01:10:34,365
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm grateful that we have medical uses allowed elsewhere nearby in the community.

551
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:35,766
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a hill to die on.

552
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:44,295
[SPEAKER_15]: But our mayor has explicitly made this into a hill that Medford's entire investment in comprehensive planning could die on.

553
01:10:45,095 --> 01:10:49,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Her late July public letter to President Bears made it clear, if we don't kiss the ring on Park and Salem.

554
01:10:52,779 --> 01:10:53,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Good note to end on.

555
01:11:00,543 --> 01:11:01,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it on purpose?

556
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:02,024
[SPEAKER_15]: The truth comes out.

557
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:03,625
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been enemies this whole time.

558
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:09,431
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll start that whole sentence again.

559
01:11:09,451 --> 01:11:37,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Her late July public letter to President Bears made it clear, if we don't kiss the ring on Park at Salem, she will not sign a contract extension with Innes Associates, meaning that our comprehensive plan will go back on the shelf to do nothing, that the hundreds of hours that residents spent helping to create a shared vision for a better, greener, more affordable Medford will do nothing, and that the input that so many people have shared about how to improve the zoning process will be for nothing.

560
01:11:38,842 --> 01:11:44,766
[SPEAKER_15]: What I find very sad and wasteful is that this actually doesn't have to feel bad.

561
01:11:45,747 --> 01:11:47,068
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't have to be combative.

562
01:11:48,629 --> 01:11:52,911
[SPEAKER_15]: I personally as one Councilor would be fine to take this vote and approve the amendment and move on.

563
01:11:53,372 --> 01:11:59,956
[SPEAKER_15]: But what I am not happy to do and what I won't do is give away our only leverage for ensuring that the zoning project goes forward at all.

564
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,338
[SPEAKER_15]: And that with the next contract, we get it right.

565
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:28,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Doing it right means a lot of things that my colleagues have spoken to already, more community and in neighborhood meetings, more opportunities for public comment and input, more time to digest information between meetings and in between decisions, more and better information available online, more and better promotion of the meetings that we do have, the things that pretty much all of us have been asking about for years that residents have been asking for, that Councilors have been asking for since the first RFP in 2023.

566
01:12:31,569 --> 01:12:43,816
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like we have closed some distance in the past 48 hours between the mayor's initial draft of a contract extension and what the council, broadly speaking, is asking for.

567
01:12:44,657 --> 01:12:53,702
[SPEAKER_15]: But this kind of last-minute, handshaky, low-commitment, non-public negotiation process is not how the process of planning our future should work.

568
01:12:55,889 --> 01:13:03,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish that it were possible for me to participate in this negotiation with trust, but frankly, I have no trust left to lose.

569
01:13:04,131 --> 01:13:19,096
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually did have a little bit of trust left to lose for a while there, and then our mayor decided to use this as an opportunity to hold hostage the resources for public engagement that the community has been asking for for a year and a half, apparently just to score a political point on us.

570
01:13:21,482 --> 01:13:29,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Now she is asking us to trust her that she cares about this process and wants to collaborate and participate and that she wants to see it done right.

571
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:32,574
[SPEAKER_15]: What has she done to earn our trust about that?

572
01:13:34,135 --> 01:13:38,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it when we had to fight her for three years just to get funding to start the zoning review in the first place?

573
01:13:40,157 --> 01:13:49,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it when she ignored nearly all of our zoning stakeholder meetings for 18 months and my offers to meet with her one-on-one every week to keep her involved and then tried to claim that she was excluded from the process?

574
01:13:51,140 --> 01:14:05,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it this part where she's insisting that we, after Salem Street, revisit and change the Mystic Avenue rezoning, which the CDB approved 11 months ago, because she didn't bother to learn about that process while we were going through it in public meetings?

575
01:14:07,483 --> 01:14:21,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Or was it the part where for the last year and a half, she ignored the city council's repeated requests to help us with promoting and advertising our zoning meetings while still finding time to send letters and text blasts about zoning that were inflammatory and misleading.

576
01:14:23,907 --> 01:14:25,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop treating us like we're stupid.

577
01:14:28,148 --> 01:14:30,369
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been trying to collaborate on this for two years.

578
01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:33,910
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been doing it on the mayor's shoestring for two years.

579
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:46,997
[SPEAKER_15]: We tried doing a comprehensive zoning overhaul for $100,000 with no communication resources and no community engagement resources on a very tight schedule, because that was what she agreed to fund.

580
01:14:48,898 --> 01:14:53,279
[SPEAKER_15]: We all tried to make the best of that process in the ways that we could, and I'm including residents in that.

581
01:14:54,339 --> 01:15:00,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Many, many residents took it upon themselves to participate, even though it was much, much harder than it should have been.

582
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:03,781
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am sorry for not recognizing that sooner.

583
01:15:05,426 --> 01:15:12,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Behind the rail, I was essentially serving as a pro bono zoning communications officer for a lot of this term because we lack the capacity.

584
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:19,719
[SPEAKER_15]: And other Councilors, Councilor Scarpelli has been sounding the alarm about the lack of neighborhood meetings and outreach all term.

585
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:20,220
[SPEAKER_15]: He was right.

586
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,821
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just not sustainable.

587
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:24,663
[SPEAKER_15]: We had much less than we needed.

588
01:15:25,243 --> 01:15:27,745
[SPEAKER_15]: And to do that again would be setting ourselves up for failure.

589
01:15:28,606 --> 01:15:43,639
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will be damned if I throw away our only leverage for a better, slower, more accessible, more successful process just because she is attempting to do a goodwill tour with Councilors now that the election is over and making promises that she has no reason to keep.

590
01:15:44,019 --> 01:15:45,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's give her a reason to keep them.

591
01:15:46,662 --> 01:15:48,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Since this has been made a quid pro quo,

592
01:15:49,286 --> 01:15:51,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I as one Councilor will need the quote spelled out very clearly.

593
01:15:51,848 --> 01:16:17,927
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not vote yes on this amendment until I see a public written commitment from the mayor for a new zoning RFP that includes at least $100,000 just for communications and community engagement support, and will occur on a timeline that will allow us to actually discuss all of our squares, corridors, Tufts institutional zone, residential areas and parking, and transportation demand management, rushing nothing,

594
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:20,190
[SPEAKER_15]: not running out of time for anything.

595
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:30,973
[SPEAKER_15]: We will not be freed from difficult conversations or controversy, but we can be free from hostage taking and an erosion of checks and balances.

596
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:33,774
[SPEAKER_15]: We're only planning the future of the city here.

597
01:16:35,315 --> 01:16:37,195
[SPEAKER_15]: The community deserves a lot more from this process.

598
01:16:37,955 --> 01:16:43,797
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not consent to let us be set up for failure because we have too much to gain by doing this right.

599
01:16:44,737 --> 01:16:47,398
[SPEAKER_15]: We're fighting for better and I won't settle for less.

600
01:16:49,778 --> 01:16:52,263
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to vote no on this, but I will not vote to advance it.

601
01:16:52,283 --> 01:16:56,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll leave it there.

602
01:16:58,076 --> 01:16:59,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

603
01:16:59,178 --> 01:17:00,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming then Councilor Lazzaro.

604
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:07,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm in pretty much the same boat as Vice President Collins.

605
01:17:08,137 --> 01:17:12,439
[SPEAKER_04]: If you forced a vote tonight on it, I'd be a no.

606
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:16,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I could potentially be moved to a yes if everything were spelled out.

607
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:28,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, from my perspective, most of the zoning conversations with the mayor have been Council President Bears and Council Vice President Collins kind of trying to work with her

608
01:17:29,285 --> 01:17:51,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Behind closed doors and they can't really tell us like tell the rest of council what's going on because of open meeting law I I think like what I don't like about this the most is this sort of like game of Communicating with council via press release which I told the mayor very explicitly, you know, please don't do that.

609
01:17:51,636 --> 01:17:57,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I only learned about the intention to push this to push the

610
01:17:59,285 --> 01:18:25,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Salem Street amendments back to council and the press release that came the day after the preliminaries I Appreciated you know The fact that she was willing to speak with people like individual Councilors this week I would like moving forward for her to do that You know once a month one-on-one with everybody just so that we didn't have these issues moving forward and we weren't just suddenly hit with more of these

611
01:18:26,013 --> 01:18:36,682
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, surprise Game of Chicken press releases where you just suddenly put out a quid pro quo to the council in public without really telling us about it beforehand.

612
01:18:36,702 --> 01:18:37,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean,

613
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:50,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really communication that gets me because I don't like, you know, Council President Bears and Vice President Collins have done their best to sort of let the rest of us know what's going on.

614
01:18:50,546 --> 01:18:55,409
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's only so much you can really say due to open meeting law.

615
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:57,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the mayor is

616
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:15,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about how she doesn't hasn't really been following along with the process, I'm more than happy to chat about it one on one behind the scenes just because we don't have the same OML constraints when it's individual Councilors in the mayor.

617
01:19:18,582 --> 01:19:25,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked, I requested the mayor in our conversation to come tonight and discuss this.

618
01:19:25,946 --> 01:19:29,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe that she is there.

619
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:39,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like there to be more of a, more openness with regards to what every party is thinking moving forward.

620
01:19:39,633 --> 01:19:42,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, yeah, I really,

621
01:19:44,572 --> 01:19:48,014
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about what my colleagues have chatted about as well.

622
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:57,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's really this game of like communicating via press release and playing chicken with council, which we saw quite a bit of last year that I don't appreciate more than anything else.

623
01:19:57,318 --> 01:19:58,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for listening.

624
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:01,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

625
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:02,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro.

626
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:05,263
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to clarify something.

627
01:20:05,303 --> 01:20:13,867
[SPEAKER_32]: I was, when I was speaking before about the medical offices, I just wanted to say what, say the quiet part out loud,

628
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:26,379
[SPEAKER_32]: what we were trying to talk around, and why a lot of these conversations about this particular intersection became so incendiary in the community.

629
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:40,702
[SPEAKER_32]: The new qualification with the neighborhood medical, and it can't open until 8 a.m., and it has to close at 6 p.m., and it can only have five employees, and it has to be 1,500 square feet.

630
01:20:40,762 --> 01:20:41,902
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a tiny office.

631
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:47,583
[SPEAKER_32]: Five employees, I mean, that's a very small medical office.

632
01:20:48,444 --> 01:21:08,870
[SPEAKER_32]: And even that, that was created because so many people in the community did not want there to be, medication assisted treatment centers are open early in the morning because people take daily medicine before they go to work or before they take their kids to school.

633
01:21:10,235 --> 01:21:12,976
[SPEAKER_32]: That's how that sort of medicine works.

634
01:21:15,017 --> 01:21:22,999
[SPEAKER_32]: And that kind of office would not open in that space anyway, even if it was MX2.

635
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,520
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would like to clarify that for people.

636
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,682
[SPEAKER_32]: One of the reasons why I thought it was important that it be

637
01:21:31,535 --> 01:21:43,006
[SPEAKER_32]: zoned for MX2 there, it's because I spoke with somebody who lives in that neighborhood who is disabled and said, it would be really nice if there was a doctor's office that I could get to that was close by.

638
01:21:43,887 --> 01:21:56,238
[SPEAKER_32]: And that was compelling enough to me to say, that would be nice if even via a special permit process, there could be a medical office, even a tiny one, even one that's not that effective,

639
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,666
[SPEAKER_32]: even one that couldn't really help a person that much.

640
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:01,647
[SPEAKER_32]: There are a lot of seniors who live in that neighborhood.

641
01:22:01,787 --> 01:22:05,028
[SPEAKER_32]: It would be nice if they could have access to a medical office that they don't have to travel to.

642
01:22:05,468 --> 01:22:16,973
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's something that I think, regardless of the heights of the buildings, four stories versus six stories, with a step back, with incentives, I do not think is that different.

643
01:22:17,013 --> 01:22:22,295
[SPEAKER_32]: And I doubt that that many people are going to need to build a six-story building in that neighborhood,

644
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:24,355
[SPEAKER_32]: particular intersection.

645
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:32,638
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, very similar to what Vice President Collins said, this is absolutely not a hill I need to die on.

646
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:40,541
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to be really clear how this conversation started in this city.

647
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:51,204
[SPEAKER_32]: It started with a company asking to open a clinic to help people who are a protected class of residents who

648
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:53,635
[SPEAKER_32]: have a disease.

649
01:22:55,256 --> 01:23:12,808
[SPEAKER_32]: And people got so angry about that, that there was a generalized uproar saying, we will absolutely not allow those people to get the help they need in this neighborhood.

650
01:23:13,508 --> 01:23:15,650
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's where we are now.

651
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,832
[SPEAKER_32]: And that is why

652
01:23:20,235 --> 01:23:23,137
[SPEAKER_32]: We've gone back again to Salem Street to talk about this again.

653
01:23:24,057 --> 01:23:31,121
[SPEAKER_32]: I am not saying that I am fighting for the possibility of a methadone clinic to open on Salem Street.

654
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:31,722
[SPEAKER_32]: It will not.

655
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:42,628
[SPEAKER_32]: There is no possibility that it will, because even if it was MX2, there could be no medication-assisted treatment clinic opening on Salem Street anymore.

656
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:45,570
[SPEAKER_32]: That's been made very explicitly clear.

657
01:23:47,405 --> 01:23:51,087
[SPEAKER_32]: What I was hoping for is maybe somebody could see a doctor at that intersection.

658
01:23:51,387 --> 01:23:53,669
[SPEAKER_32]: And it looks like they won't be able to.

659
01:23:55,509 --> 01:23:57,470
[SPEAKER_32]: It looks like that possibility has been eliminated.

660
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:09,556
[SPEAKER_32]: If we change this intersection back to MX1, or we accept the CDB's recommendation to change it to MX1, nobody will go to the doctor at this intersection.

661
01:24:11,377 --> 01:24:12,958
[SPEAKER_32]: And that seems really important

662
01:24:15,602 --> 01:24:16,322
[SPEAKER_32]: to the mayor.

663
01:24:18,863 --> 01:24:26,526
[SPEAKER_32]: So okay, I guess the seniors and the disabled people and everybody else who needs to go to a doctor who is everybody needs to go to a doctor.

664
01:24:27,806 --> 01:24:32,648
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess they will have to travel away from Park and Salem to do that.

665
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:50,113
[SPEAKER_32]: and, uh, fine if that is what it takes for us to do the rest of our zoning project, because everybody that I talked to, uh, in the past year or so about this zoning project when I talked about commercial zoning and building up our squares and corridors and bringing in revenue for our city.

666
01:24:50,714 --> 01:24:52,175
[SPEAKER_32]: With increased commercial.

667
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:53,756
[SPEAKER_32]: Everybody said Absolutely.

668
01:24:53,796 --> 01:24:54,196
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, my gosh.

669
01:24:54,216 --> 01:24:55,217
[SPEAKER_32]: That's such a great idea.

670
01:24:55,257 --> 01:25:02,243
[SPEAKER_32]: That's exactly what we need to do so we can have better services in the city so we can take care of our vulnerable residents so we can have

671
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:07,581
[SPEAKER_32]: a vibrant, bustling community that takes care of the people that live here.

672
01:25:08,101 --> 01:25:11,583
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's what we want to do, because the next thing on the list is Medford Square.

673
01:25:11,663 --> 01:25:21,387
[SPEAKER_32]: And you know what needs to happen in Medford Square in order to allow for the building project that

674
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:41,204
[SPEAKER_32]: the city put out the RFP for, the housing that's going to go up and the maybe replacing the condemned building where Ebisuya was and CVS and the daycare, maybe all of those projects can move forward if we can update the zoning in Medford Square.

675
01:25:42,024 --> 01:25:47,448
[SPEAKER_32]: We can't do that until we make sure that nobody can go to the doctor at the intersection of Park and Salem Street.

676
01:25:49,987 --> 01:25:50,507
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess so.

677
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,071
[SPEAKER_32]: It's confusing that we have to do that, but I guess if that's the only path forward, that can be what we do.

678
01:26:00,692 --> 01:26:02,693
[SPEAKER_32]: Just as long as we're really explicit about what we're doing.

679
01:26:06,614 --> 01:26:07,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

680
01:26:08,655 --> 01:26:12,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further comments from members of the Council at this time on this proposal?

681
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:18,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, I'm going to open the public hearing for comments in person and on Zoom.

682
01:26:19,463 --> 01:26:22,924
[SPEAKER_08]: You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in person.

683
01:26:23,005 --> 01:26:23,965
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have three minutes.

684
01:26:25,886 --> 01:26:30,629
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are on Zoom, please rename yourself to have a first name and a last name.

685
01:26:30,729 --> 01:26:33,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, I will not recognize you on Zoom.

686
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:35,491
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not gonna have Zoom bombers.

687
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:37,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll start at the podium.

688
01:26:37,152 --> 01:26:40,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna ask for your name and address for the record.

689
01:26:40,374 --> 01:26:42,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me one second, because I need to get the timer set up.

690
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I really hope it works.

691
01:26:53,016 --> 01:26:53,317
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

692
01:26:55,003 --> 01:26:56,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have some hands on Zoom.

693
01:26:56,283 --> 01:26:59,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to alternate between in-person and Zoom.

694
01:26:59,524 --> 01:27:00,805
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start at the podium.

695
01:27:01,325 --> 01:27:02,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

696
01:27:02,765 --> 01:27:03,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

697
01:27:03,926 --> 01:27:04,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, good evening.

698
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:08,447
[SPEAKER_19]: Paulette Vartabedian, 27 Central Lab Medford.

699
01:27:09,087 --> 01:27:11,608
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to clarify some things for myself as well.

700
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:19,930
[SPEAKER_19]: If this did go through on Salem Street as MX2, my understanding was there would be able to be a medical clinic there.

701
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:23,311
[SPEAKER_19]: And with special permit, a methadone clinic

702
01:27:24,028 --> 01:27:25,008
[SPEAKER_19]: could go in there.

703
01:27:25,388 --> 01:27:26,649
[SPEAKER_19]: That's how I understood it.

704
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:29,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Paulette, I'm going to let you make your comment.

705
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:30,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll write down what your questions are.

706
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,490
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I have answers for them, I'll answer.

707
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:32,890
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

708
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:53,315
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other thing is, I don't personally appreciate being skirting around the issue as medical clinic and not saying the word methadone, because everyone that is affected by this can see through certain Councilors avoiding that issue.

709
01:27:53,944 --> 01:28:15,792
[SPEAKER_19]: The other thing is we don't appreciate being cast as not wanting to help people that are in a specific protected class, but that is also ignoring people that live in the Salem Street issue that are a protected class, which is the elderly, of which I am one.

710
01:28:16,592 --> 01:28:23,197
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it's ridiculous to bring up these things and to also try to make us look like the bad guys.

711
01:28:23,617 --> 01:28:35,125
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd like to know who certain people in this council spoke to about this medical office, because I'm sure it was nobody in the Salem Street area who was directly affected by this.

712
01:28:35,785 --> 01:28:39,708
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also want to bring up, which is kind of out of the contact,

713
01:28:40,308 --> 01:28:48,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Why not have this medical office in West Medford where there is a commuter rail and a bus line?

714
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:51,811
[SPEAKER_19]: It's much more easily accessed than the Salem Street.

715
01:28:52,091 --> 01:28:54,392
[SPEAKER_19]: Why is this being pushed down our throat?

716
01:28:54,772 --> 01:29:08,496
[SPEAKER_19]: And I understand that this is off, supposedly off topic now as far as the methadone clinic, but honestly, I don't trust this council and I don't trust certain members of the council that that will not go through.

717
01:29:08,756 --> 01:29:09,797
[SPEAKER_19]: But thank you very much.

718
01:29:10,797 --> 01:29:11,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

719
01:29:11,158 --> 01:29:24,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And Paula, just really quickly, and I think Danielle already said it, and Emily, but under the MX2, it was only this neighborhood medical definition, which actually came out of the community meeting Councilor Scarpelli was talking about.

720
01:29:24,105 --> 01:29:30,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was open later in the morning, limited hours, less than five employees, and a very small square foot.

721
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:31,830
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the current is.

722
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:35,532
[SPEAKER_08]: If this amendment was accepted, then no medical at all.

723
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, yeah, I understood that.

724
01:29:38,553 --> 01:29:46,295
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that even leaving a little bit open to that happening, it's gonna happen and we don't want it.

725
01:29:46,455 --> 01:29:47,435
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the wrong place.

726
01:29:47,496 --> 01:29:48,776
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care if it's 8 a.m.

727
01:29:48,996 --> 01:29:49,896
[SPEAKER_19]: to 7 p.m.

728
01:29:50,777 --> 01:29:59,939
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's gonna be the way that that area, my area, is going to continue to vote and we're not gonna go away under the carpet.

729
01:30:00,259 --> 01:30:01,300
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyway, thank you.

730
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

731
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,301
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'm gonna go to Zoom.

732
01:30:06,122 --> 01:30:10,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go to Rebecca Davidson on Zoom.

733
01:30:10,483 --> 01:30:12,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Rebecca, name and address for the record, please.

734
01:30:12,523 --> 01:30:13,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

735
01:30:16,824 --> 01:30:18,125
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, thank you so much.

736
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:22,485
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just wanted to, can you hear me?

737
01:30:22,706 --> 01:30:24,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Rebecca, you should be able to start your video.

738
01:30:24,906 --> 01:30:27,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I could just get your name and address for the record, please.

739
01:30:28,127 --> 01:30:29,247
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, can you hear me OK?

740
01:30:31,185 --> 01:30:36,188
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, Rebecca Davidson and I'm at 26 Farragut Ave.

741
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:46,695
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just wanted to state that I'm a resident of Salem Street in this area and have been raising my family here for the last few years.

742
01:30:47,435 --> 01:30:53,499
[SPEAKER_34]: I also grew up in Medford and I'm directly affected by this zoning effort as are many of my family members.

743
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,822
[SPEAKER_34]: And I wanna see more growth in small business development in my area.

744
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:00,310
[SPEAKER_34]: And for the record, I'm a homeowner.

745
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:07,532
[SPEAKER_34]: And for that, I really think that even though that shouldn't matter, I've heard that that comes up a lot in these conversations.

746
01:31:08,072 --> 01:31:12,933
[SPEAKER_34]: And as a homeowner and somebody who lives in this area, I think that we need updated zoning.

747
01:31:13,773 --> 01:31:16,334
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that the process so far has been very thoughtful.

748
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:20,795
[SPEAKER_34]: I've attended multiple meetings and feel that there's been a lot of opportunities for input.

749
01:31:22,308 --> 01:31:30,017
[SPEAKER_34]: And I also want to clarify that this proposal won't mean immediate change, but it will pave the way for some important development that our city desperately needs.

750
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:38,846
[SPEAKER_34]: And I also just wanted to say that, you know, some of the things that I've heard in the past are related to this being an environmental justice community.

751
01:31:39,807 --> 01:31:44,771
[SPEAKER_34]: And what that means is that we really should have equitable access to resources and benefits.

752
01:31:45,412 --> 01:31:55,259
[SPEAKER_34]: And we would need updated zoning in order, for example, to have a small grocery store in the area, to have healthy food access, which currently there really isn't much of in this area.

753
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,822
[SPEAKER_34]: The other part of environmental justice is meaningful engagement with the community.

754
01:32:00,442 --> 01:32:05,944
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's why I very much support what our Councilors have discussed relative to community involvement.

755
01:32:06,504 --> 01:32:09,526
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that we need to have more communications, more engagement.

756
01:32:09,546 --> 01:32:10,686
[SPEAKER_34]: We need a budget for that.

757
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:13,627
[SPEAKER_34]: So I really appreciated that proposal being brought up.

758
01:32:14,188 --> 01:32:19,130
[SPEAKER_34]: That seems like a no-brainer, given that's something that everyone will benefit from, as with this proposal.

759
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:25,675
[SPEAKER_34]: So far, I feel like there has been good involvement of the community and that's been reflected, but we could use more of it.

760
01:32:26,055 --> 01:32:28,597
[SPEAKER_34]: And for that, we will need a budget in order to do that.

761
01:32:29,157 --> 01:32:32,900
[SPEAKER_34]: So overall, I just want to say that I'm in support of continuing the zoning effort.

762
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:41,867
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it will improve our neighborhood now and in the future, bring great businesses, address some of our housing crisis issues, and really help our community thrive.

763
01:32:42,147 --> 01:32:42,528
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

764
01:32:42,548 --> 01:32:46,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

765
01:32:47,011 --> 01:32:48,032
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go back to the podium.

766
01:32:48,715 --> 01:32:51,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

767
01:32:52,037 --> 01:32:54,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Ralph Klein, 172 Park Street, Medford Mass.

768
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:01,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm directly affected by this, and I'm appalled at some of these Councilors saying we're against medical offices.

769
01:33:02,524 --> 01:33:03,925
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one problem with that.

770
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:12,151
[SPEAKER_02]: The latest proposal I've seen for that pit on Salem Street is 14 units with 0.8 pocket spaces per unit.

771
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:15,553
[SPEAKER_02]: With five people in the medical office, that's one office.

772
01:33:16,678 --> 01:33:18,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they going to park, and where are the people going to park?

773
01:33:19,599 --> 01:33:23,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally crazy to put a medical office there with five employees.

774
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:24,060
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just one.

775
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:27,501
[SPEAKER_02]: There's mostly, with this proposal, there's three businesses going in there.

776
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:30,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are the other people going to park?

777
01:33:31,602 --> 01:33:38,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are these people who could, elderly, who may not get public transportation, may have to drive, even walk?

778
01:33:39,624 --> 01:33:41,564
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, there's businesses that are there now.

779
01:33:42,544 --> 01:33:43,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on Park Street.

780
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:46,651
[SPEAKER_02]: with the cycle place.

781
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:52,454
[SPEAKER_02]: They park all down Park Street because there's no parking on that end because of the sink building.

782
01:33:54,655 --> 01:33:57,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived in Medford for 68 years, the same place.

783
01:33:58,938 --> 01:34:03,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been contacted, and neither have half of my neighbors between Park and Central.

784
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked everybody right there, which is directly affected by the zoning.

785
01:34:08,063 --> 01:34:09,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's gotten notices.

786
01:34:09,784 --> 01:34:13,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked out and saw the city engineer drawing lines down the street one morning.

787
01:34:14,246 --> 01:34:14,967
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this about?

788
01:34:16,085 --> 01:34:18,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're putting a bicycle lane, a proposed bicycle lane.

789
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:20,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, can I be informed about that?

790
01:34:20,348 --> 01:34:20,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

791
01:34:21,609 --> 01:34:22,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Never informed anything.

792
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:24,131
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting was 45 days later.

793
01:34:25,672 --> 01:34:27,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't have known if I hadn't seen the guy out there drawing lines.

794
01:34:28,354 --> 01:34:30,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Never informed, found out it passed.

795
01:34:31,737 --> 01:34:32,658
[SPEAKER_02]: How does this go through?

796
01:34:34,059 --> 01:34:35,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Barry Clemente, I wish he was back.

797
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:38,022
[SPEAKER_02]: He told us everything that was going on in the city of Medford.

798
01:34:38,467 --> 01:34:41,208
[SPEAKER_02]: The robocalls you're making should be for every citizen.

799
01:34:41,228 --> 01:34:42,289
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't have to sign up.

800
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:45,890
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in that area, you people need to find out what's going on.

801
01:34:47,551 --> 01:34:48,411
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't listen to us.

802
01:34:49,512 --> 01:34:51,753
[SPEAKER_02]: This SF1, it should be.

803
01:34:52,213 --> 01:34:53,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be SF2.

804
01:34:53,894 --> 01:34:58,776
[SPEAKER_02]: The building at 169 Park Street is four stories tall.

805
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:03,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same height as the Potter building, which sits directly on Salem Street across from that pit.

806
01:35:04,901 --> 01:35:06,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Four stories is plenty capable.

807
01:35:06,822 --> 01:35:08,303
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 20 units in that building.

808
01:35:09,444 --> 01:35:10,345
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a larger area.

809
01:35:11,846 --> 01:35:12,786
[SPEAKER_02]: They have parking there.

810
01:35:13,006 --> 01:35:15,088
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one and a half parking spaces per unit.

811
01:35:15,908 --> 01:35:20,371
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something the neighborhood worked on with the person who built it in the city.

812
01:35:21,212 --> 01:35:25,795
[SPEAKER_02]: There's six visitor's parking spaces and a snow removal area.

813
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:29,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's this going to go in that Pet on Sale Street with 0.8 parking spaces?

814
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:31,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get real here.

815
01:35:32,339 --> 01:35:33,460
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that we're against.

816
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,611
[SPEAKER_02]: a medical office, or anything like that.

817
01:35:37,471 --> 01:35:39,211
[SPEAKER_02]: We need real things.

818
01:35:40,352 --> 01:35:42,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Reality sets in at some point.

819
01:35:42,812 --> 01:35:45,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not against people going to the doctors right there.

820
01:35:46,113 --> 01:35:49,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it so imperative the doctor's office can be right on the corner there?

821
01:35:49,674 --> 01:35:50,954
[SPEAKER_02]: What's so imperative about that?

822
01:35:50,974 --> 01:35:52,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Direct your comments to the chair, please.

823
01:35:53,275 --> 01:35:54,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I'm talking to people who spoke.

824
01:35:55,195 --> 01:35:56,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's just the rules.

825
01:35:56,155 --> 01:35:56,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, though.

826
01:35:57,296 --> 01:35:57,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

827
01:35:57,736 --> 01:35:58,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke to you a few times.

828
01:35:58,876 --> 01:36:02,057
[SPEAKER_02]: You were at the meeting at the Roberts, one of the few meetings that was held

829
01:36:02,859 --> 01:36:07,481
[SPEAKER_02]: By the city, councilors came to, I spoke directly to you at that meeting.

830
01:36:09,362 --> 01:36:10,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an issue with you.

831
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:11,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke right at your face.

832
01:36:11,464 --> 01:36:11,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

833
01:36:12,584 --> 01:36:14,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So I speak to the person who says these things.

834
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:16,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I let them know I know who said it.

835
01:36:16,726 --> 01:36:17,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what they're doing.

836
01:36:18,087 --> 01:36:18,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear you.

837
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:20,428
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that we ask people to direct it to me.

838
01:36:20,448 --> 01:36:21,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I take the heat.

839
01:36:21,749 --> 01:36:22,629
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's fine.

840
01:36:22,649 --> 01:36:23,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I will direct it to you.

841
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:26,792
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like people to know that I know who said what.

842
01:36:26,992 --> 01:36:27,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

843
01:36:29,594 --> 01:36:31,215
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to listen to the people in the neighborhood.

844
01:36:31,235 --> 01:36:33,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, the setback thing, six-story setback.

845
01:36:34,297 --> 01:36:38,220
[SPEAKER_02]: The people behind that building have to look at the setback.

846
01:36:39,621 --> 01:36:41,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Going down Salem Street, oh, it's beautiful.

847
01:36:42,383 --> 01:36:42,983
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to see it.

848
01:36:43,003 --> 01:36:44,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only four stories.

849
01:36:44,885 --> 01:36:46,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I sit there and look at the back of the building.

850
01:36:47,166 --> 01:36:54,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, with the new zoning thing, you came four houses down on Park Street for the new zoning that could go up six stories.

851
01:36:55,352 --> 01:36:56,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Four homes, it's not Salem Street.

852
01:36:57,672 --> 01:36:59,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back into the neighborhood.

853
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:02,996
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to look at this better.

854
01:37:03,197 --> 01:37:09,962
[SPEAKER_02]: SF1 should be what it's zoned as, not just for the medical clinics, for the building and the people who live in that area.

855
01:37:11,183 --> 01:37:13,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy what you people are trying to throw down our throats.

856
01:37:14,986 --> 01:37:15,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear you, Ralph.

857
01:37:15,466 --> 01:37:16,007
[SPEAKER_08]: You're over time.

858
01:37:16,447 --> 01:37:18,949
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to speak again, we will come back around for another minute after.

859
01:37:18,969 --> 01:37:19,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

860
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:19,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Ralph.

861
01:37:21,105 --> 01:37:22,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

862
01:37:22,326 --> 01:37:24,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go to Zachary Chertok on Zoom.

863
01:37:25,489 --> 01:37:26,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

864
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:27,670
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

865
01:37:28,631 --> 01:37:30,493
[SPEAKER_35]: Zachary Chertok, 5 Almond Street.

866
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:33,695
[SPEAKER_35]: First, I'd like to clarify that there is active primary care between B.I.

867
01:37:33,755 --> 01:37:46,306
[SPEAKER_35]: Lahey and Atrius in Medford Square, now walkable in part due to the rotary that also happens to have increased the time gap between public transit on Salem Street, as I've taken the counts now for three weeks, visible from my condo.

868
01:37:47,650 --> 01:37:55,754
[SPEAKER_35]: Next, despite council, let me stated in 10, it really doesn't appear as though the Councilors reviewed the recording and transcript from the board meeting in September and prep for this council meeting.

869
01:37:55,814 --> 01:37:58,616
[SPEAKER_35]: It also doesn't appear that the council has in full reviewed again.

870
01:37:58,656 --> 01:38:02,758
[SPEAKER_35]: The mayor's full requirements for extension of the zoning consultation contract.

871
01:38:03,478 --> 01:38:16,212
[SPEAKER_35]: The reasons for reducing MX one to MX one stem from the allowable commercial space use cases as the uses and concern can't be regulated out specifically per commentary from the head of planning, development and sustainability.

872
01:38:16,232 --> 01:38:20,076
[SPEAKER_35]: Alicia hunt that was brought up at the last board meeting when she was asked.

873
01:38:20,737 --> 01:38:32,929
[SPEAKER_35]: Under the new designation that still doesn't have a formalized ratified key despite past zoning for the quarter, the process of incursion of a variable use clinic is not clear for any diversified uses or designations of a clinic.

874
01:38:33,589 --> 01:38:37,293
[SPEAKER_35]: The policy for approval remains in question and hasn't kept up with the intent.

875
01:38:37,913 --> 01:38:39,075
[SPEAKER_35]: Alicia noted this as well.

876
01:38:39,695 --> 01:38:49,343
[SPEAKER_35]: I would remind the council that the council also defied public input on the recommendations of the CD board to slip in a last minute amendment to the proposed zoning separate from the zoning passage for Salem Street.

877
01:38:49,903 --> 01:38:54,126
[SPEAKER_35]: The current condition was put in place from the council's defiance of the CD board and public appeal.

878
01:38:55,027 --> 01:39:18,840
[SPEAKER_35]: Further to and to echo Councilor Scarpelli, in tabulating the people speaking up about these issues especially relative to the lack of existing conditions understanding relative to the feasible density in tandem with the considerations for viable lot size for development, the majority of people through address tracing who spoke up with concerns versus those without were those from the neighborhood where this will have an impact including myself.

879
01:39:19,793 --> 01:39:29,258
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll reiterate that the comprehensive plan is not a master plan and actually calls for measured master planning toward this particular project in the neighborhood zoning and the corridors.

880
01:39:29,418 --> 01:39:44,146
[SPEAKER_35]: Ultimately, the lack of engineering going into the proposal as passed allows for uses that are not viable on the designated lot size, which had the engineering been done properly up to standard prior to the design, this would have been discovered and the maximal allowance would have been set at MX1.

881
01:39:45,336 --> 01:39:54,325
[SPEAKER_35]: In response to Councilor Callaghan, Innes confirmed as much back at the Roberts when we had the community meeting, the one and only, and after a lot of pressure on the council.

882
01:39:54,985 --> 01:40:02,953
[SPEAKER_35]: And if you refer to the Wellington section as an example, you can see the difference between what a properly studied and planned city section looks like relative to what we're dealing with here.

883
01:40:03,874 --> 01:40:10,381
[SPEAKER_35]: The crux comes down to the continued lack of engineering tantamount to an unengineered process for the zoning for it to have been done right.

884
01:40:10,961 --> 01:40:27,037
[SPEAKER_35]: Despite repeated asks for the measures to be put forth to justify the proposals, in tandem with legal and engineering compliance, the City Council, Planning and Permitting Committee, the City Board, and the Department of Planning, Development and Sustainability have failed to proffer them, and that's largely where the Mayor's concerns lie.

885
01:40:27,698 --> 01:40:36,522
[SPEAKER_35]: and to address the comms issue and to caution against revisionist history and selective history on the part of the council, I would have liked to have seen your current fervor prior to the election.

886
01:40:37,002 --> 01:40:38,963
[SPEAKER_35]: It was nowhere to be seen until you were called out.

887
01:40:39,303 --> 01:40:39,723
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

888
01:40:41,444 --> 01:40:42,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

889
01:40:42,625 --> 01:40:44,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll go back to in-person.

890
01:40:45,966 --> 01:40:47,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

891
01:40:47,327 --> 01:40:48,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

892
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:51,408
[SPEAKER_38]: Good evening.

893
01:40:51,428 --> 01:40:52,869
[SPEAKER_38]: Nick Joleo, Forty Robinson Road.

894
01:40:53,755 --> 01:41:03,101
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm in favor of the amendment, but before I discuss why let me first just say that the agenda for this meeting tonight the whole agenda was not posted to the city website until 1115 this morning.

895
01:41:04,538 --> 01:41:07,741
[SPEAKER_38]: I had to call the city clerk's office and ask where it was.

896
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:09,482
[SPEAKER_38]: And only then was it uploaded.

897
01:41:10,003 --> 01:41:10,883
[SPEAKER_38]: This isn't acceptable.

898
01:41:11,364 --> 01:41:19,851
[SPEAKER_38]: Residents need adequate notice of what the council is going to address at a meeting so they can do appropriate research, prepare their remarks, and make logistical arrangements to be here.

899
01:41:20,131 --> 01:41:21,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Nick, I'm going to just pause you there.

900
01:41:21,532 --> 01:41:23,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I can answer that and I'll give you the rest of your time.

901
01:41:23,634 --> 01:41:23,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

902
01:41:23,774 --> 01:41:24,195
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on me.

903
01:41:24,795 --> 01:41:26,316
[SPEAKER_08]: not on Rich Alicia or anybody else.

904
01:41:26,996 --> 01:41:31,277
[SPEAKER_08]: As you may know, we've been without a city clerk for some time here.

905
01:41:31,357 --> 01:41:32,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Rich has been filling in.

906
01:41:32,637 --> 01:41:37,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually been doing all the agendas myself and it was early Friday morning.

907
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:41,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It did go up on the events calendar and was linked in the folder on the website.

908
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:45,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't press the, and it was posted in the clerk's office.

909
01:41:45,561 --> 01:41:51,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't press the publish button on civic clerk, cause that's my job right now, but that's on me.

910
01:41:51,783 --> 01:41:52,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

911
01:41:52,983 --> 01:41:56,144
[SPEAKER_08]: When I got heard from Rich, that's when I pressed the button.

912
01:41:56,204 --> 01:41:57,525
[SPEAKER_08]: So my apologies for that.

913
01:41:57,745 --> 01:41:59,685
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for the apology and explanation.

914
01:41:59,705 --> 01:42:00,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you got it.

915
01:42:00,646 --> 01:42:04,127
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll continue now with my thoughts on why I'm in favor of the amendment.

916
01:42:04,947 --> 01:42:11,789
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm in favor of the amendment because the six-story height maximum allowed by MX2 is excessive in this area, which is residential.

917
01:42:12,369 --> 01:42:19,372
[SPEAKER_38]: But I'm also in favor because rezoning that node, MX1, is going to eliminate, as we've discussed, this very vaguely defined use

918
01:42:20,252 --> 01:42:21,493
[SPEAKER_38]: neighborhood medical office.

919
01:42:21,773 --> 01:42:26,335
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think as others have pointed out before me, this would likely encompass a methadone clinic.

920
01:42:26,635 --> 01:42:37,779
[SPEAKER_38]: And I hope we can all agree, regardless of what a person might think about the utility of having one of these anywhere, that putting one a few blocks away from a school, an elementary school for that matter, is not a good idea.

921
01:42:37,799 --> 01:42:48,104
[SPEAKER_38]: And I don't think that requiring a special permit from the Community Development Board would be an adequate safeguard, and that we are better just forbidding the use altogether in this node.

922
01:42:49,467 --> 01:42:51,929
[SPEAKER_38]: But again, I'm not opposed to having one of these in Medford.

923
01:42:51,949 --> 01:42:53,389
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just a question of where we put it.

924
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:57,052
[SPEAKER_38]: It really isn't wise to put one near where their children, in my opinion.

925
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:04,416
[SPEAKER_38]: And I hope that the council will not only approve the amendment tonight, but also revisit other decisions made for this quarter.

926
01:43:04,776 --> 01:43:07,738
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't think there's anything wrong with making changes to our zoning ordinance.

927
01:43:07,878 --> 01:43:13,842
[SPEAKER_38]: I've never thought that our zoning ordinance, given how old it is, has been perfect and that could not use any revisions at all.

928
01:43:13,862 --> 01:43:15,083
[SPEAKER_38]: It certainly should be revisited.

929
01:43:15,503 --> 01:43:20,528
[SPEAKER_38]: And I would hope that the Councilors tonight would not view a yes vote on this as some sort of admission of defeat.

930
01:43:21,048 --> 01:43:26,974
[SPEAKER_38]: I think this legislative process is designed for this kind of thinking let's look, what's not working, how do we fix it.

931
01:43:27,715 --> 01:43:36,483
[SPEAKER_38]: And we want to make sure of course that our zoning decisions reflect what people who live in our neighborhoods want, you have to think of the overwhelming opposition at that Roberts meeting.

932
01:43:37,614 --> 01:43:44,019
[SPEAKER_38]: And again, the CDB had originally recommended to you based on all the public feedback they had received, approval, and it was rejected.

933
01:43:44,179 --> 01:43:46,681
[SPEAKER_38]: So we're just kind of wasting time here.

934
01:43:46,722 --> 01:43:48,723
[SPEAKER_38]: We have to retrace our steps, revisit it.

935
01:43:49,584 --> 01:43:50,465
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just not efficient.

936
01:43:51,265 --> 01:43:51,586
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

937
01:43:53,387 --> 01:43:54,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

938
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:56,149
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go back to Zoom.

939
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:00,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheryl Rodriguez, name and address for the record, please.

940
01:44:00,673 --> 01:44:01,694
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

941
01:44:04,358 --> 01:44:05,618
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez.

942
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:08,219
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm in favor of MX1.

943
01:44:08,419 --> 01:44:09,880
[SPEAKER_37]: It's more appropriate for this block.

944
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:16,902
[SPEAKER_37]: The pit has a variance for one parking space per unit and could only achieve three stories with commercial and two levels of residential.

945
01:44:17,682 --> 01:44:29,125
[SPEAKER_37]: The 360 Sound Street project is seeking high frequency transit 0.8 parking spaces and could only achieve four stories with commercial and three residential floors, even though it doesn't qualify for high frequency transit.

946
01:44:29,526 --> 01:44:32,266
[SPEAKER_37]: So zoning isn't feasible here without removing parking minimums.

947
01:44:32,406 --> 01:44:33,867
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that what this council is planning?

948
01:44:34,307 --> 01:44:36,909
[SPEAKER_37]: Because without that, there's no reason for MX2 here.

949
01:44:37,569 --> 01:44:43,513
[SPEAKER_37]: We don't wanna risk a methadone dispensary because it fits neighborhood medical with the exception of the hours of operation.

950
01:44:44,174 --> 01:44:48,336
[SPEAKER_37]: And there's no reason to believe there couldn't be an exception or they couldn't just follow those hours.

951
01:44:48,396 --> 01:44:49,917
[SPEAKER_37]: So we want no medical uses.

952
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:53,460
[SPEAKER_37]: It's too close to the neighborhood and the school to be allowed.

953
01:44:56,005 --> 01:45:03,587
[SPEAKER_37]: Most of the people who spoke in favor of the zoning mistakenly thought it would allow affordable housing, which means they didn't understand what they were in favor of.

954
01:45:03,687 --> 01:45:08,968
[SPEAKER_37]: So those counts should be redone to find out who was actually in favor of what is actually proposed here.

955
01:45:09,468 --> 01:45:14,370
[SPEAKER_37]: The comprehensive plan calls for study, not zoning based on the opinion of the city council.

956
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:19,391
[SPEAKER_37]: I think many are misinterpreting or misunderstanding the comprehensive plan and its function.

957
01:45:20,194 --> 01:45:29,559
[SPEAKER_37]: but the neighborhood negotiated with the consultant and planning and President Bears was there and we overwhelmingly wanted MX-1 with no medical uses.

958
01:45:29,919 --> 01:45:31,300
[SPEAKER_37]: So this neighborhood was heard.

959
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,341
[SPEAKER_37]: We didn't get all that we wanted.

960
01:45:33,361 --> 01:45:35,542
[SPEAKER_37]: This was a compromise that we made.

961
01:45:36,303 --> 01:45:40,465
[SPEAKER_37]: You should vote for this change because it's the right thing to do and a more feasible option.

962
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,967
[SPEAKER_37]: Even MX-1 is highly unlikely to be possible.

963
01:45:44,551 --> 01:45:47,592
[SPEAKER_37]: The Community Development Board recognized this in the first place.

964
01:45:47,952 --> 01:45:53,233
[SPEAKER_37]: This council voted against this initially, but we should not be leveraged used by this council.

965
01:45:53,773 --> 01:45:56,334
[SPEAKER_37]: Our zoning is live, unlike most of the city.

966
01:45:56,794 --> 01:46:02,835
[SPEAKER_37]: And Alicia Hunt says this area was urgent to zone because of developer activity and developer pressure.

967
01:46:03,215 --> 01:46:05,136
[SPEAKER_37]: So this is not something that won't happen.

968
01:46:05,196 --> 01:46:06,876
[SPEAKER_37]: This is something that is happening.

969
01:46:07,276 --> 01:46:13,518
[SPEAKER_37]: So we need action now and not to be part of some elaborate plan to gain funds and leverage later.

970
01:46:13,898 --> 01:46:14,278
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

971
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:18,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

972
01:46:18,731 --> 01:46:19,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go back to the podium.

973
01:46:20,612 --> 01:46:21,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

974
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:22,693
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

975
01:46:24,454 --> 01:46:26,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Nick Ulig, 62 Tainer Street.

976
01:46:28,597 --> 01:46:44,567
[SPEAKER_05]: As someone with a child at the Roberts, and as a Nick who actually lives in the area in question, I want to say unequivocally that I think that upzoning the Salem Corridor, as was enumerated by the CDB, by council, by the zoning consultants, all that excellent work, I think it was a good thing.

977
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:51,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think that upzoning the Salem Park node to either MX1 or MX2 is a good thing.

978
01:46:51,554 --> 01:46:52,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Either one would be a step forward.

979
01:46:53,134 --> 01:46:55,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Either one would be an improvement over what we have now.

980
01:46:55,975 --> 01:46:57,615
[SPEAKER_05]: My personal preference is for MX2.

981
01:46:58,195 --> 01:47:03,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything we can do to allow new businesses and new housing at this location is good and MX2 provides more flexibility in that regard.

982
01:47:04,796 --> 01:47:11,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually shocked to learn just earlier in this meeting that a brew pub would be allowed under MX2 and not under MX1.

983
01:47:11,218 --> 01:47:12,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like a tap room or something?

984
01:47:13,398 --> 01:47:15,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, it was, yes.

985
01:47:15,159 --> 01:47:16,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, that would be a huge loss.

986
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe, speaking on that flexibility, I believe that many have sensationalized it.

987
01:47:24,702 --> 01:47:28,963
[SPEAKER_05]: MX2 does allow medical uses with the restrictions that many people have pointed out earlier.

988
01:47:29,503 --> 01:47:34,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Square footage, number of employees, the need for a CDB-granted special permit, which includes the need for public consultation.

989
01:47:36,105 --> 01:47:41,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Seizing on last year's justifiably intense discussions around the opening of a methadone clinic within this node,

990
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:45,717
[SPEAKER_05]: A proposal that was made under the old zoning and which was completely rescinded.

991
01:47:46,357 --> 01:47:50,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Opponents of densification have tried to claim that MX2 will somehow pose a threat to the neighborhood.

992
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:59,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I very much disagree with this assertion and want to remind everyone that there is no proposal whatsoever at present for a similar development anywhere in that node.

993
01:48:00,024 --> 01:48:08,569
[SPEAKER_05]: MX2 allows medical uses, as Councilor Lazzaro previously said, so that things like small medical practices or dental clinics, some of which already exist on that corridor, could continue to be built.

994
01:48:10,182 --> 01:48:19,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to mention that while I'm happy to see either MX1 or MX2 zoning at this node, I find it very distressing to see this being negotiated via ultimatum on behalf of the mayor.

995
01:48:19,925 --> 01:48:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: The council, as enumerated extensively by earlier comments, was just trying to do what they were told to do and to deliver on the goals set out at the beginning of 2024.

996
01:48:28,067 --> 01:48:36,749
[SPEAKER_05]: To force the entire city's rezoning effort to a halt with its future hinging on a single aspect of a single node in the city is not reasonable.

997
01:48:37,688 --> 01:48:51,204
[SPEAKER_05]: As mentioned previously, council adopted 11 of the 12 CDB recommendations on the Salem Street rezoning and focusing on the one that was not adopted and using it as a wedge issue to hold up vital work being done on the rest of the city's behalf is not what I want to see from my government.

998
01:48:51,928 --> 01:48:54,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford needs progress to be made on this file across the city.

999
01:48:55,311 --> 01:49:03,958
[SPEAKER_05]: It cannot only be concentrated in Glenwood along Salem Street and on Mystic Avenue, the only corridors that have up to until now been approved in this initiative.

1000
01:49:04,558 --> 01:49:16,708
[SPEAKER_05]: The current situation is holding my neighborhood hostage over a small difference in policy, but also holding the whole city back and accomplishing things that the mayor herself signed off on and appropriated funds for nearly two years ago.

1001
01:49:17,443 --> 01:49:23,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Policy should not be done by fiat, and this is not the way to engender collaborative and constructive work by municipal government on this file.

1002
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:29,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I expect better of the mayor, and I hope all of Medford's elected government can work together moving forward on this issue.

1003
01:49:29,811 --> 01:49:30,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1004
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:31,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1005
01:49:31,692 --> 01:49:35,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go back to Zoom.

1006
01:49:35,334 --> 01:49:37,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a few more people on Zoom, so it'll be back and forth.

1007
01:49:37,956 --> 01:49:40,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go to Patricia Cherry on Zoom.

1008
01:49:41,598 --> 01:49:42,859
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have three minutes.

1009
01:49:43,419 --> 01:49:45,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

1010
01:49:48,793 --> 01:49:51,995
[SPEAKER_31]: Hello, my name is Patricia Cherry, 20 Wellesley Street, Medford.

1011
01:49:54,837 --> 01:50:05,543
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to say about the zoning, I really, I hate the tone of the some of the Councilors shaming people for their opinions.

1012
01:50:07,244 --> 01:50:12,447
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not it doesn't come off, you know, very well to people that live in the city.

1013
01:50:12,587 --> 01:50:15,509
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's it's become kind of a tactic used.

1014
01:50:16,272 --> 01:50:33,362
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, if you don't want a certain something done, whether it be a methadone clinic or and it's against what the city council wants, they shame people and use terminology that is it's very hurtful.

1015
01:50:34,042 --> 01:50:35,123
[SPEAKER_31]: I just have to say that.

1016
01:50:35,923 --> 01:50:44,308
[SPEAKER_31]: But as far as the methadone clinic that was everybody was up in arms about, I think that a lot of people

1017
01:50:45,522 --> 01:50:48,966
[SPEAKER_31]: didn't understand what you guys were trying to do.

1018
01:50:49,807 --> 01:50:51,648
[SPEAKER_31]: There wasn't a lot of communication.

1019
01:50:52,429 --> 01:51:05,622
[SPEAKER_31]: And when you hear something like that, a lot of people don't have a lot of knowledge about treatments for people who, you know, who have addiction and their blueprint of seeing clinics like this is methadone mild.

1020
01:51:06,603 --> 01:51:07,364
[SPEAKER_31]: That's all they see.

1021
01:51:08,165 --> 01:51:08,966
[SPEAKER_31]: So of course,

1022
01:51:09,408 --> 01:51:19,854
[SPEAKER_31]: when something like this is being proposed or the thought of it being proposed, coming into a neighborhood where there are kids right down the street, it's scary to some people.

1023
01:51:20,794 --> 01:51:31,860
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that instead of people going out and having conversations and trying to go back and forth with each other's opinions, they were being shamed.

1024
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,681
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, you just don't want people to get help.

1025
01:51:34,861 --> 01:51:36,582
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, and I heard this new thing, you're a NIMBY.

1026
01:51:38,673 --> 01:51:42,395
[SPEAKER_31]: And I just think we need to start to get away from that stuff in this city.

1027
01:51:42,455 --> 01:51:44,295
[SPEAKER_31]: We've had enough of it for so long.

1028
01:51:44,315 --> 01:51:51,958
[SPEAKER_31]: I also, you know, I hear a lot of people, whenever they want to make a point, they use the most vulnerable, the most vulnerable.

1029
01:51:52,879 --> 01:52:05,364
[SPEAKER_31]: And I don't necessarily think that some of their points are going to help out the most vulnerable, but they use that terminology because they know it shames people.

1030
01:52:06,713 --> 01:52:08,934
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, I guess that's all, that's what I'm trying to say.

1031
01:52:08,954 --> 01:52:14,776
[SPEAKER_31]: I do have some other things to talk about the affordable housing because I think we're using wrong terminology there.

1032
01:52:14,796 --> 01:52:17,917
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, but I'm going to be meeting with Zach on that.

1033
01:52:17,937 --> 01:52:25,780
[SPEAKER_31]: I won't get into that now, but I just really wish you guys would take into consideration that people have opinions that may differ.

1034
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,541
[SPEAKER_31]: Try not to shame them.

1035
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:33,563
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't use words like, you know, you don't want to help people or you're against people who are addicted.

1036
01:52:34,527 --> 01:52:40,990
[SPEAKER_31]: you're racist, like these things, the tone is just, it's not good.

1037
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:43,051
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not good for the city, that's all.

1038
01:52:44,411 --> 01:52:45,231
[SPEAKER_31]: But I appreciate y'all.

1039
01:52:47,332 --> 01:52:49,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment, Patricia, looking forward to our meeting.

1040
01:52:50,193 --> 01:52:50,594
[SPEAKER_31]: Absolutely.

1041
01:52:50,674 --> 01:52:55,396
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, back to the podium.

1042
01:52:58,897 --> 01:53:00,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, there you go.

1043
01:53:00,678 --> 01:53:01,538
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on now, my bad.

1044
01:53:02,226 --> 01:53:04,627
[SPEAKER_26]: Trisha Pelley, 53 Garfield Avenue.

1045
01:53:05,307 --> 01:53:11,429
[SPEAKER_26]: So since tonight's meeting idea is honesty, I'm very confused.

1046
01:53:11,489 --> 01:53:12,649
[SPEAKER_26]: We had so many meetings.

1047
01:53:12,709 --> 01:53:15,370
[SPEAKER_26]: We had a lot of community input.

1048
01:53:15,490 --> 01:53:17,571
[SPEAKER_26]: And then we need to have more community input.

1049
01:53:17,591 --> 01:53:18,791
[SPEAKER_26]: We haven't had any meetings.

1050
01:53:18,851 --> 01:53:21,552
[SPEAKER_26]: Did we have meetings or did we not was my number one question.

1051
01:53:22,352 --> 01:53:34,135
[SPEAKER_26]: since we are now, I am in favor of the MX1 qualification and zoning for our area because it goes against any of the medical clinics that we fought so hard against.

1052
01:53:34,716 --> 01:53:40,477
[SPEAKER_26]: And let's be very clear, this wasn't because we didn't know that it was a methadone dispensary.

1053
01:53:40,817 --> 01:53:42,138
[SPEAKER_26]: We were very clear with that.

1054
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:44,718
[SPEAKER_26]: It was the company that was coming in.

1055
01:53:44,798 --> 01:53:49,700
[SPEAKER_26]: It was Habit Opco, which is actually the company that is responsible

1056
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,462
[SPEAKER_26]: for mass and cast.

1057
01:53:51,882 --> 01:54:04,819
[SPEAKER_26]: It is the company that is responsible for Springfield, and it is the company that two or three months later, was written up in the New York Times under federal investigation for holding psychologically.

1058
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:09,282
[SPEAKER_26]: ill patients against their will because they had the right insurance.

1059
01:54:09,322 --> 01:54:10,542
[SPEAKER_26]: So insurance fraud.

1060
01:54:10,922 --> 01:54:14,704
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that the kind of companies we want to bring into Medford?

1061
01:54:15,104 --> 01:54:25,349
[SPEAKER_26]: And not only that, we have five medical dispensaries in the area that meet the needs within a four-mile radius.

1062
01:54:25,689 --> 01:54:28,310
[SPEAKER_26]: We are more than covered from a per capita basis.

1063
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:33,032
[SPEAKER_26]: So let's not try to taint it that we are NIMBY, that we just didn't want it.

1064
01:54:33,292 --> 01:54:34,173
[SPEAKER_26]: There wasn't a need.

1065
01:54:34,533 --> 01:54:35,693
[SPEAKER_26]: It was the wrong company.

1066
01:54:36,033 --> 01:54:46,959
[SPEAKER_26]: And now we do not trust this council as a result of that to allow blanket medical clinics, because none of us have the time to watch and monitor what's going on.

1067
01:54:47,739 --> 01:54:55,965
[SPEAKER_26]: So and finally, any methadone clinic or any medical clinic in that area, we can't even keep the trash properly picked up.

1068
01:54:56,485 --> 01:54:58,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Have you seen the rats in the neighborhood?

1069
01:54:58,627 --> 01:55:00,388
[SPEAKER_26]: And now you want to add medical waste?

1070
01:55:00,929 --> 01:55:06,673
[SPEAKER_26]: How do we know we're not going to have urine sample cups running down the street and needles?

1071
01:55:07,113 --> 01:55:09,455
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, let's be real here.

1072
01:55:09,895 --> 01:55:11,656
[SPEAKER_26]: So MX1 is fine.

1073
01:55:11,936 --> 01:55:12,817
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much.

1074
01:55:13,197 --> 01:55:15,559
[SPEAKER_26]: We've clarified quite a few things this evening.

1075
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:16,760
[SPEAKER_26]: I appreciate it.

1076
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:19,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1077
01:55:19,184 --> 01:55:20,465
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go to Zoom.

1078
01:55:20,485 --> 01:55:22,207
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Donna Silva on Zoom.

1079
01:55:22,247 --> 01:55:23,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Donna, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1080
01:55:23,969 --> 01:55:26,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you could provide your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1081
01:55:27,252 --> 01:55:30,816
[SPEAKER_28]: Donna Silva, 1536 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1082
01:55:31,757 --> 01:55:36,341
[SPEAKER_28]: And I obviously do not live anywhere near Salem Street.

1083
01:55:38,186 --> 01:55:40,368
[SPEAKER_28]: I spit and hit Arlington.

1084
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:51,859
[SPEAKER_28]: But I want to thank the people that have been speaking tonight, and Zachary, Nick, Cheryl, the woman that just spoke, I'm sorry I didn't grab your name.

1085
01:55:55,116 --> 01:55:57,997
[SPEAKER_28]: These are Medford residents that this is affecting.

1086
01:55:58,457 --> 01:55:59,698
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not affecting me.

1087
01:55:59,718 --> 01:56:03,659
[SPEAKER_28]: I live way on the other side of Medford.

1088
01:56:04,119 --> 01:56:07,660
[SPEAKER_28]: But as someone said earlier, put it in West Medford.

1089
01:56:08,821 --> 01:56:11,281
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go, because the commuter rail is there.

1090
01:56:11,782 --> 01:56:15,723
[SPEAKER_28]: I worked in Boston at 125 High Street.

1091
01:56:16,523 --> 01:56:21,445
[SPEAKER_28]: I walked Canal Street every day, Monday through Friday, twice a day.

1092
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,338
[SPEAKER_28]: Bay Cove.

1093
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,606
[SPEAKER_28]: Are any of you familiar with Bay Cove?

1094
01:56:25,747 --> 01:56:27,854
[SPEAKER_28]: You can shake your head yes, if you are.

1095
01:56:28,436 --> 01:56:29,198
[SPEAKER_28]: I walked there.

1096
01:56:30,265 --> 01:56:38,130
[SPEAKER_28]: I would go in the morning, early in the morning when they opened, as one of the Councilors said, early in the morning, they were there.

1097
01:56:38,771 --> 01:56:40,732
[SPEAKER_28]: I would come home at four o'clock.

1098
01:56:41,173 --> 01:56:44,115
[SPEAKER_28]: They, some of them would still be there, not all of them.

1099
01:56:44,415 --> 01:56:56,163
[SPEAKER_28]: So let's not cookie cutter this and say, oh, they have to take their children to school and also they have to go to work because they are addicts.

1100
01:56:57,647 --> 01:56:58,008
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay?

1101
01:56:58,970 --> 01:57:01,136
[SPEAKER_28]: I have helped many of addicts.

1102
01:57:01,877 --> 01:57:06,348
[SPEAKER_28]: So don't even go there with even trying to look at me as not helping people.

1103
01:57:07,749 --> 01:57:09,030
[SPEAKER_28]: and caring about people.

1104
01:57:09,550 --> 01:57:17,655
[SPEAKER_28]: As one of our Councilors stood up last year in a meeting and walked out and stormed out and said, we don't care.

1105
01:57:18,155 --> 01:57:19,356
[SPEAKER_28]: Of course we care.

1106
01:57:20,276 --> 01:57:21,237
[SPEAKER_28]: Of course we do.

1107
01:57:21,797 --> 01:57:28,101
[SPEAKER_28]: But these people live in that neighborhood and they're raising families and there are restaurants there.

1108
01:57:29,777 --> 01:57:42,447
[SPEAKER_28]: And not every, and I'm not saying that every addict that is going to get treatment is going to walk out of there and hang around and stay, but there are some that are going to.

1109
01:57:42,907 --> 01:57:48,572
[SPEAKER_28]: And for the four, five, six of them that do is four, five, six too many.

1110
01:57:50,662 --> 01:57:53,224
[SPEAKER_28]: because I'll take any of you for lunch.

1111
01:57:54,005 --> 01:57:58,849
[SPEAKER_28]: I will buy you lunch at any restaurant in Boston, Capitol Grill, anywhere you wanna go.

1112
01:57:59,210 --> 01:58:04,034
[SPEAKER_28]: You sit on Canal Street with me and let's see what goes on during the course of the day.

1113
01:58:04,194 --> 01:58:04,975
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll take all of you.

1114
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:10,120
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't care because you need to see what does happen.

1115
01:58:11,241 --> 01:58:15,965
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's unfair to put these people that are living in that neighborhood

1116
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:20,980
[SPEAKER_28]: to put them in the position because you don't live there.

1117
01:58:22,601 --> 01:58:27,663
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, let's put it in West Medford because the commuter rail's there, right?

1118
01:58:28,603 --> 01:58:36,526
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, and I know I'm past my time, but I wanna thank all of you and I do agree with the zoning, increasing it.

1119
01:58:36,726 --> 01:58:40,527
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree with just, I mean, West Medford is a dump.

1120
01:58:41,468 --> 01:58:42,808
[SPEAKER_28]: So we need to do something.

1121
01:58:42,988 --> 01:58:47,150
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm in agreement, but let's put our heads together and not be like Congress.

1122
01:58:49,019 --> 01:58:50,000
[SPEAKER_28]: Grow up, everyone.

1123
01:58:51,141 --> 01:58:51,581
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1124
01:58:53,103 --> 01:58:53,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1125
01:58:56,686 --> 01:58:57,947
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go back to the podium.

1126
01:58:58,368 --> 01:59:00,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1127
01:59:01,130 --> 01:59:02,892
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Micah Kesselman at 499 Main Street.

1128
01:59:03,032 --> 01:59:04,393
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a city council speaker.

1129
01:59:05,915 --> 01:59:13,902
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's talk about the way that this has actually gone down and compared to what's happening at the national level.

1130
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:29,170
[SPEAKER_13]: The mayor has basically held this process hostage to force through a discussion about two floors of height and then also demand that

1131
01:59:31,612 --> 01:59:42,940
[SPEAKER_13]: that there would be no medical allowed whatsoever in this area while the state and the country, but especially Massachusetts is in the middle of a healthcare access crisis.

1132
01:59:43,641 --> 01:59:47,644
[SPEAKER_13]: The healthcare system in Massachusetts is actively collapsing right now.

1133
01:59:48,344 --> 01:59:58,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it's mind boggling that anyone wants to actually put any additional obstructions and hurdles to providing healthcare to people.

1134
01:59:58,772 --> 01:59:59,292
[SPEAKER_13]: That's crazy.

1135
02:00:00,144 --> 02:00:06,567
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing that I also want to bring up is we were talking a lot about like, oh, the people who live in the neighborhood should be allowed to shape the neighborhood.

1136
02:00:07,108 --> 02:00:09,129
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree, but you know what that means?

1137
02:00:09,609 --> 02:00:16,172
[SPEAKER_13]: That means letting them do things with their property that they own that they think is good for their property.

1138
02:00:16,672 --> 02:00:17,813
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what zoning is.

1139
02:00:18,413 --> 02:00:21,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Mixed use one is more restricted.

1140
02:00:21,875 --> 02:00:25,817
[SPEAKER_13]: You are actually making it harder for the people who live in the neighborhood

1141
02:00:26,303 --> 02:00:30,729
[SPEAKER_13]: and own that property to do what they want with their own property.

1142
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:40,122
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you really want people to shape their own neighborhood, and this is gonna be something that most people won't agree with me on, which I understand, but you wanna have much more permissive zoning.

1143
02:00:40,803 --> 02:00:42,025
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really what you want.

1144
02:00:43,300 --> 02:01:07,549
[SPEAKER_13]: So really what this boils down to is incompetent governance, someone not governing, not actually running a city in the best interests of the people who live in the city, just engaging in cynical, petty little brinksmanship games that are terrible for the city at the end of the day, and spreading nonsense.

1145
02:01:09,470 --> 02:01:11,250
[SPEAKER_13]: How much input did you guys have on the methadone clinic?

1146
02:01:13,259 --> 02:01:15,640
[SPEAKER_13]: The city council didn't propose the methadone clinic?

1147
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, yeah, that's out of your hands.

1148
02:01:18,961 --> 02:01:20,741
[SPEAKER_13]: So what the hell are people talking about?

1149
02:01:20,821 --> 02:01:21,421
[SPEAKER_13]: This is crazy.

1150
02:01:22,602 --> 02:01:23,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, that's my time.

1151
02:01:24,102 --> 02:01:25,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Other people want to use up their three minutes.

1152
02:01:25,883 --> 02:01:26,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1153
02:01:27,403 --> 02:01:28,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your comment.

1154
02:01:28,783 --> 02:01:29,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to Zoom.

1155
02:01:29,484 --> 02:01:30,724
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Jane Marcus.

1156
02:01:30,884 --> 02:01:33,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Jane, name and address for the record, please.

1157
02:01:33,305 --> 02:01:34,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

1158
02:01:36,289 --> 02:01:37,889
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, my name is Jane Marcus.

1159
02:01:38,129 --> 02:01:39,930
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 65 Tainter Street.

1160
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:47,292
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm in the Salem Street Corridor, and I live around the corner from the Roberts Elementary School.

1161
02:01:47,932 --> 02:01:50,872
[SPEAKER_23]: I support changing the zoning back to MX1.

1162
02:01:51,533 --> 02:02:05,596
[SPEAKER_23]: And from a process standpoint, I find it very disturbing that we had many meetings with the Community Development Board, and I find that the City Council is overriding the Community Development Board as if they're stupid.

1163
02:02:07,317 --> 02:02:18,326
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't understand why the city council feels they know more and have a better process that they should override the board that is in charge of making that recommendation.

1164
02:02:18,366 --> 02:02:25,772
[SPEAKER_23]: So I urge you to follow the recommendation of the Community Development Board, as is our process here in Medford.

1165
02:02:25,872 --> 02:02:31,136
[SPEAKER_23]: I understand that you're angry with the mayor, but I'm one of the many, many people

1166
02:02:31,556 --> 02:02:41,626
[SPEAKER_23]: who have contacted the mayor asking for the mayor's help to stop the methadone clinics from coming to next to the Roberts Elementary School.

1167
02:02:42,126 --> 02:02:46,971
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't like the tone of the city council saying we're bad people.

1168
02:02:47,031 --> 02:02:48,453
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't want to help people.

1169
02:02:48,853 --> 02:02:54,514
[SPEAKER_23]: because we don't want our elementary school students to be walking past addicts.

1170
02:02:55,015 --> 02:02:59,516
[SPEAKER_23]: That is not unreasonable that we want a safe walk to school.

1171
02:03:00,016 --> 02:03:03,957
[SPEAKER_23]: Here in our neighborhood, almost all the kids walk to school.

1172
02:03:03,997 --> 02:03:17,060
[SPEAKER_23]: I see them walk past my house twice a day, every school day, and I want those kids to have a safe walk, and I don't want someone telling me that that is not a good thing for the kids to have a safe walk to school.

1173
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:22,842
[SPEAKER_23]: We know from the benefit of other communities that a methadone clinic can be a danger.

1174
02:03:22,942 --> 02:03:29,524
[SPEAKER_23]: Not only will children encounter unstable addicts, but they may also encounter discarded needles.

1175
02:03:30,264 --> 02:03:33,706
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not what we want for our elementary school students.

1176
02:03:33,906 --> 02:03:35,006
[SPEAKER_23]: I live in the neighborhood.

1177
02:03:35,446 --> 02:03:37,547
[SPEAKER_23]: I see the kids walk to school with joy.

1178
02:03:37,967 --> 02:03:43,169
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't want to have a methadone clinic that's going to impact our community.

1179
02:03:43,609 --> 02:03:54,516
[SPEAKER_23]: And we've been told repeatedly at all the meetings that we've had thus far that the city's afraid of being sued if we turn down a permit for a methadone clinic.

1180
02:03:54,916 --> 02:03:59,059
[SPEAKER_23]: So if one is proposed, we're going to have it if the zoning allows it.

1181
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:03,021
[SPEAKER_23]: The zoning should never allow the methadone clinic.

1182
02:04:03,482 --> 02:04:08,285
[SPEAKER_23]: And we had a meeting at the Roberts Elementary School where all the neighbors got up

1183
02:04:08,905 --> 02:04:15,269
[SPEAKER_23]: And the people who live in the neighborhood saying, no, we don't want a methadone clinic around the corner from our school.

1184
02:04:15,309 --> 02:04:18,550
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't want addicts watching our kids walking to school.

1185
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:20,711
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't want this for our neighborhood.

1186
02:04:21,032 --> 02:04:30,577
[SPEAKER_23]: So for people to say that someone who doesn't live in the neighborhood should be able to be a cheerleader for the methadone clinic,

1187
02:04:31,177 --> 02:04:32,498
[SPEAKER_23]: That just doesn't seem right.

1188
02:04:32,918 --> 02:04:42,862
[SPEAKER_23]: So I want you to listen to the Community Development Board, take into consideration that process, and I respectfully ask you to approve the MX-1 zoning.

1189
02:04:42,942 --> 02:04:43,362
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1190
02:04:44,663 --> 02:04:45,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1191
02:04:45,523 --> 02:04:49,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go to Councilor Lazzaro, then we'll come back to the public hearing.

1192
02:04:50,105 --> 02:04:50,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1193
02:04:51,906 --> 02:04:53,647
[SPEAKER_32]: I just have a quick point of information.

1194
02:04:56,472 --> 02:05:04,297
[SPEAKER_32]: A clinic for medication-assisted treatment would be treatment for people who are in recovery from opioid use disorder.

1195
02:05:04,617 --> 02:05:17,624
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you are observing needles in your neighborhood, an effective way to address that would be different methods of helping people get into or stay in recovery.

1196
02:05:18,805 --> 02:05:22,607
[SPEAKER_32]: One of the ways to do that is with a clinic

1197
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:33,328
[SPEAKER_32]: increasing access to medication-assisted treatment or sober homes or other avenues of treatment.

1198
02:05:33,428 --> 02:05:50,021
[SPEAKER_32]: But one of the ways that you can treat opioid use disorder, which is administered sometimes with a needle, but methadone and Suboxone are not administered with needles, is by increasing access to sources of recovery.

1199
02:05:50,041 --> 02:05:51,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1200
02:05:55,565 --> 02:05:56,930
[SPEAKER_08]: back to the podium.

1201
02:05:57,051 --> 02:05:58,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

1202
02:05:58,396 --> 02:05:59,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

1203
02:06:00,665 --> 02:06:03,986
[SPEAKER_07]: David McKenna to Vine Street, just one block away from this node.

1204
02:06:04,026 --> 02:06:05,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am a neighbor.

1205
02:06:05,486 --> 02:06:08,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I think something's been lost in the conversation tonight.

1206
02:06:08,407 --> 02:06:16,829
[SPEAKER_07]: MX1, MX2, there is no methadone clinic that is allowed by the zoning because even MX2 has restrictions on the hours.

1207
02:06:16,989 --> 02:06:21,751
[SPEAKER_07]: It requires a special permit, five employee limit, 1,500 square foot.

1208
02:06:22,551 --> 02:06:26,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would have to be approved by the community development board with input from the community.

1209
02:06:26,092 --> 02:06:28,353
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're talking about is a dentist

1210
02:06:30,345 --> 02:06:39,627
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, maybe a sole practitioner with a secretary and a nurse, you know, maybe that scope, we're not talking about methadone clinic.

1211
02:06:39,967 --> 02:06:43,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Neighborhood medical office actually specifically says no clinics.

1212
02:06:43,828 --> 02:06:47,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the definition of neighborhood medical office that there are no clinics allowed.

1213
02:06:47,829 --> 02:06:50,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So MX1, MX2, I feel like we've lost the thread.

1214
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:55,271
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no methadone clinic on the table at this intersection.

1215
02:06:56,131 --> 02:06:58,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I support the council doing whatever you all need to do.

1216
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:09,902
[SPEAKER_07]: to move the zoning forward in the city, to rezone Medford Square, to rezone West Medford Square, and to revitalize our tax base as everybody wants to do.

1217
02:07:11,322 --> 02:07:23,487
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need more assurances from the mayor to do that, I think you should get those more assurances of whatever contract needs to be in place for us to successfully grow our tax base, especially in Medford Square.

1218
02:07:24,587 --> 02:07:30,689
[SPEAKER_07]: But if MX one is what it takes, then I urge you to do MX one because we have a lot at stake for our city.

1219
02:07:33,589 --> 02:07:38,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I've heard some people claim that the city council did not listen to public input on the Salem Street zoning.

1220
02:07:38,631 --> 02:07:43,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people even wrote it on flyers and distribute them across the city during the election to try to do political damage.

1221
02:07:44,272 --> 02:07:47,113
[SPEAKER_07]: But I personally attended every meeting, including the one at the Roberts.

1222
02:07:48,725 --> 02:07:58,154
[SPEAKER_07]: and a majority of public commenters supported the Community Development Board Plan and a majority of that group also asked for greater density.

1223
02:08:00,075 --> 02:08:03,939
[SPEAKER_07]: A minority of opponents gave public comment at the

1224
02:08:04,939 --> 02:08:11,326
[SPEAKER_07]: March 11th meeting where they asked the City Council to reject the entire Community Development Board proposal.

1225
02:08:11,726 --> 02:08:18,774
[SPEAKER_07]: The people who are now saying please do MX1 on March 11th said scrap the entire plan and start from zero.

1226
02:08:19,835 --> 02:08:35,656
[SPEAKER_07]: they've latched onto this issue again in the election to try to do political damage to the city council and they've somehow convinced the mayor to shut down rezoning across the entire city to adopt the proposal that they gave public comment against just a few months ago.

1227
02:08:36,698 --> 02:08:41,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So the city council already passed 11 out of 12 recommendations from the community development board.

1228
02:08:42,339 --> 02:08:48,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I urge you, if it's gonna move the bigger zoning project forward, adopt the 12th recommendation through the MX1.

1229
02:08:50,881 --> 02:08:55,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also urge the mayor to go back and listen to all of those public meetings that are recorded.

1230
02:08:56,122 --> 02:09:01,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And the people who have just given comment in favor of MX1 did not give that comment.

1231
02:09:01,703 --> 02:09:05,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And on March 11th, they said, shut down the whole project.

1232
02:09:05,851 --> 02:09:07,192
[SPEAKER_07]: and they were not interested in this.

1233
02:09:07,252 --> 02:09:11,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're not reliable negotiators.

1234
02:09:12,454 --> 02:09:15,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I urge you all to do whatever it takes.

1235
02:09:15,595 --> 02:09:17,636
[SPEAKER_07]: We need Medford Square to be revitalized.

1236
02:09:17,696 --> 02:09:18,697
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a huge effort.

1237
02:09:19,817 --> 02:09:21,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's part of the comprehensive plan.

1238
02:09:21,778 --> 02:09:24,599
[SPEAKER_07]: You already have draft plans in place.

1239
02:09:24,659 --> 02:09:26,740
[SPEAKER_07]: And so please move that forward as quickly as possible.

1240
02:09:27,541 --> 02:09:28,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1241
02:09:29,461 --> 02:09:30,922
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go to Zoom.

1242
02:09:31,442 --> 02:09:32,723
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Megan on Zoom.

1243
02:09:32,743 --> 02:09:34,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please, Megan.

1244
02:09:37,573 --> 02:09:38,273
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi, thank you.

1245
02:09:38,634 --> 02:09:40,535
[SPEAKER_29]: Megan Searle, 100th Station Landing.

1246
02:09:43,857 --> 02:09:47,319
[SPEAKER_29]: Yep, floor is yours.

1247
02:09:47,339 --> 02:09:47,419
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1248
02:09:47,439 --> 02:09:57,945
[SPEAKER_29]: There were 116 opioid-related deaths in Medford between the years 2015 and 2022, suggesting that Medford is not immune from the opioid crisis.

1249
02:09:59,025 --> 02:10:06,510
[SPEAKER_29]: There may be some benefit to residents to have an easily accessible clinic, though I hear and understand that there are clinics nearby as well.

1250
02:10:07,410 --> 02:10:15,713
[SPEAKER_29]: While HABIT-OPCO may not have been a good fit for Medford for a number of reasons, it doesn't make sense to me to exclude medication-assisted treatment clinics en masse.

1251
02:10:16,333 --> 02:10:18,834
[SPEAKER_29]: These clinics can be designed in very different ways.

1252
02:10:18,994 --> 02:10:26,637
[SPEAKER_29]: The ones that are best run and integrated into their environment tend to do things like cap their patient numbers, provide parking, and have room for indoor waiting.

1253
02:10:27,217 --> 02:10:30,739
[SPEAKER_29]: When this happens, these clinics are essentially like any other medical facility.

1254
02:10:31,619 --> 02:10:42,543
[SPEAKER_29]: Many people with histories of opioid use disorders have had their lives turned around by medication-assisted treatment, particularly suboxone, which is a very effective medicine that can allow people to live very normal lives.

1255
02:10:43,323 --> 02:10:53,347
[SPEAKER_29]: While a poorly run methadone-only clinic is probably not something we would want for Medford, I want to be clear that there is a wide range of different clinics, and I believe they should not be excluded, as if they are all the same.

1256
02:10:54,167 --> 02:11:01,691
[SPEAKER_29]: A well run medically assisted treatment facility that offers suboxone in particular would be very different from a poorly run methadone only clinic.

1257
02:11:02,152 --> 02:11:04,833
[SPEAKER_29]: And I believe this distinction is important to consider.

1258
02:11:05,153 --> 02:11:05,473
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1259
02:11:07,635 --> 02:11:08,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1260
02:11:08,655 --> 02:11:09,916
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go back to the podium.

1261
02:11:10,456 --> 02:11:11,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

1262
02:11:11,657 --> 02:11:12,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll have three minutes.

1263
02:11:13,578 --> 02:11:16,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

1264
02:11:18,248 --> 02:11:41,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple of points this evening, but firstly, I am concerned that this conversation is so explicitly centered on whether or not a substance use disorder treatment clinic, a place that helps people struggling with addiction, would be allowed to open up in this neighborhood or elsewhere in the city.

1265
02:11:42,940 --> 02:12:01,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the thing that's really that I'm sort of struggling with tonight is that it sounds as far as I please correct me if I'm mistaken about this, but it seems like the city is trying to change the zoning to, you know, specifically single out, you know, people with with a particular medical condition.

1266
02:12:02,852 --> 02:12:12,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And that, you know, concerns me, particularly because I if I'm not mistaken that that violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.

1267
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:19,885
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, you know, if the way that this is sort of mechanically happening at this stage if that doesn't.

1268
02:12:22,152 --> 02:12:40,639
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, if that doesn't come into play here, but it bothers me to watch the, you know, the city, you know, contemplating how to, you know, specifically target a group with a particular illness.

1269
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:49,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I'd like to just ask, like, do we know if like the mayor has gotten like the advice of the city solicitor on whether or not that is,

1270
02:12:52,222 --> 02:12:53,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's interesting.

1271
02:12:54,163 --> 02:12:59,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what Councilor Scott probably said, he was on camera, is that actually the city solicitor is no longer with the city.

1272
02:13:00,067 --> 02:13:00,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1273
02:13:02,108 --> 02:13:08,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we know if there has been like some sort of like legal opinion on that, that saw it?

1274
02:13:08,152 --> 02:13:11,594
[SPEAKER_11]: It just, that concerns me.

1275
02:13:11,634 --> 02:13:17,838
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess I would just say that like, you know, taken all together, I'm really concerned that the mayor seems to be,

1276
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:41,965
[SPEAKER_11]: um going to the city's boards and and bodies and and to city staff and um you know trying to construct this this you know kind of class canon kind of situation maybe that's not the right metaphor or whatever but but basically like trying to blackmail the city over over zoning it it really

1277
02:13:43,361 --> 02:13:49,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, strikes me as is unfair and sort of tyrannical that this is how we're, we're, we're doing business here.

1278
02:13:50,085 --> 02:13:54,587
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, I support what the city council is doing with, with rezoning.

1279
02:13:54,627 --> 02:13:57,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I trust you guys will make the right, uh, you know, decision with this.

1280
02:13:57,969 --> 02:14:11,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I do hope that we, you know, are, are being like a really intentional about, you know, how we treat people with different, um, you know, needs and disabilities in our community and how welcoming we are to them.

1281
02:14:13,225 --> 02:14:21,242
[SPEAKER_11]: And I support the next, I can't stay, but I support what's coming next as well.

1282
02:14:21,282 --> 02:14:21,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1283
02:14:23,868 --> 02:14:24,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1284
02:14:24,508 --> 02:14:34,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Just really quickly, before I go back to answer the question, legal counsel was part of the discussion on the development of the neighborhood medical definition.

1285
02:14:35,931 --> 02:14:45,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's kind of a Councilor Tseng our Harvard Law School student can correct me if I'm wrong about this, but there's kind of two elements of this.

1286
02:14:49,061 --> 02:14:52,243
[SPEAKER_08]: As written, council said, this doesn't discriminate against anyone.

1287
02:14:52,583 --> 02:15:01,969
[SPEAKER_08]: But now we're in a situation where also the intent of the bodies creating this definition comes into play.

1288
02:15:02,009 --> 02:15:08,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, obviously, the discussion tonight is going to be part of any record on legislative intent.

1289
02:15:09,234 --> 02:15:13,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's really where a question may or may not come in.

1290
02:15:15,568 --> 02:15:31,635
[SPEAKER_08]: As Councilor Lazzaro noted, this has been created to solve a problem without just to address something that people want to address without actually saying what it is and how that will be discussed if this ever were to come into a court of law, I think is a really open question.

1291
02:15:33,276 --> 02:15:33,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1292
02:15:34,256 --> 02:15:34,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm no lawyer.

1293
02:15:34,877 --> 02:15:35,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng?

1294
02:15:36,426 --> 02:15:37,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that Reid is correct.

1295
02:15:39,068 --> 02:15:44,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the case law is about a situation where a zoning permit is denied.

1296
02:15:46,134 --> 02:15:53,580
[SPEAKER_09]: But pretty much every case in that situation at the circuit court level rules against the municipality and lets the methadone clinic come in.

1297
02:15:54,721 --> 02:16:04,729
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's correct, that intent matters a lot here and the conversations that we have in public, especially from elected officials, really affects what municipalities can and cannot do.

1298
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:18,902
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some, I have to read more into it, but there's some discussion in the opinions about the role of municipality versus discrimination against those who need medical treatment, medical help.

1299
02:16:20,921 --> 02:16:29,168
[SPEAKER_09]: overall case law is quite clear that when the intent exists to discriminate against those seeking care, the municipality will lose.

1300
02:16:32,190 --> 02:16:32,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1301
02:16:32,730 --> 02:16:36,053
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go back to the public hearing.

1302
02:16:36,093 --> 02:16:39,196
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Michael Dewberry on Zoom.

1303
02:16:39,236 --> 02:16:40,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

1304
02:16:40,577 --> 02:16:41,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

1305
02:16:42,518 --> 02:16:42,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.

1306
02:16:42,939 --> 02:16:43,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Dewberry, 50 Park Street.

1307
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to the council and the neighbors for having this discussion, one in a long series.

1308
02:16:50,924 --> 02:16:55,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've probably been to like, feels like 20 of these at some point, at this point.

1309
02:16:56,928 --> 02:16:59,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'm about two blocks from Salem Park.

1310
02:16:59,109 --> 02:17:01,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not the closest possible neighbor, but I'm pretty close.

1311
02:17:02,352 --> 02:17:03,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to the dentist on Salem Street.

1312
02:17:03,773 --> 02:17:05,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy my sub sandwiches on Salem Street.

1313
02:17:05,894 --> 02:17:09,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I go down to the hardware store, get my paint and tools.

1314
02:17:11,558 --> 02:17:13,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I am pro-density however we can get it.

1315
02:17:14,619 --> 02:17:24,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited about the possibility of both housing and commercial, whether it's a brewery or a coffee shop or a micro grocery store, whatever we can get.

1316
02:17:24,706 --> 02:17:27,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the more density we have, the better.

1317
02:17:27,508 --> 02:17:29,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, my wife is 40 weeks pregnant.

1318
02:17:32,083 --> 02:17:49,051
[SPEAKER_03]: and with a future robert school student um and she's a little bit mad that i'm on this call i'm not doing something more important but i just keep hearing that like oh the neighbor doesn't support this but i've been at like i said a dozen or maybe two dozen meetings including the last two cdb meetings where there's an even split

1319
02:17:49,972 --> 02:17:55,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Of people prone against the density and every time we keep hearing like no one support.

1320
02:17:55,157 --> 02:17:55,918
[SPEAKER_03]: No one supports density.

1321
02:17:55,938 --> 02:17:58,861
[SPEAKER_03]: The neighborhood feels this and I'm not going to make any claims with neighbor fields.

1322
02:17:58,881 --> 02:18:00,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the data speaks for itself.

1323
02:18:00,923 --> 02:18:07,190
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had plenty of people on both sides, but yeah, we want this in the neighborhood and like, I'm not afraid of medical uses.

1324
02:18:07,710 --> 02:18:10,614
[SPEAKER_03]: know, we have medical in Medford Square, we have a dentist already on Salem Street.

1325
02:18:11,334 --> 02:18:17,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's reasonable to keep, to prevent those blanketly.

1326
02:18:19,424 --> 02:18:25,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The explanation that the CDB president gave I thought was quite good at the last meeting about like what the

1327
02:18:25,913 --> 02:18:29,416
[SPEAKER_03]: constraints and outcomes are not concerned about that at all.

1328
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:32,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a little bit weird that we're fixated on it.

1329
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:36,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And one more process note I wanted to mention.

1330
02:18:38,103 --> 02:18:38,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take whatever we can get.

1331
02:18:39,004 --> 02:18:40,465
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's MX1, great.

1332
02:18:40,485 --> 02:18:41,285
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's MX2, great.

1333
02:18:41,365 --> 02:18:46,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that a mix of both would make more sense, because this is a pretty large area.

1334
02:18:47,050 --> 02:18:52,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe tapering down from MX2 at the intersection to MX1 further down the blocks would make sense.

1335
02:18:52,394 --> 02:18:53,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have the support.

1336
02:18:53,715 --> 02:18:56,036
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the consultant being rehired to make that kind of determination.

1337
02:18:56,576 --> 02:19:01,899
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's a little weird to have this, uh, you know, sword hanging over the consultant.

1338
02:19:01,939 --> 02:19:04,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you better do what the mayor likes or you're not gonna get your contract renewed.

1339
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:08,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some amount of that is always implicit, but I hope the council can find a resolution that, um,

1340
02:19:11,289 --> 02:19:12,510
[SPEAKER_03]: makes it clear that we're all in this together.

1341
02:19:14,411 --> 02:19:15,132
[SPEAKER_03]: We all want things.

1342
02:19:15,152 --> 02:19:16,173
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not gonna get everything we want.

1343
02:19:16,193 --> 02:19:16,993
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just trying to negotiate.

1344
02:19:17,013 --> 02:19:18,575
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not trying to strong arm anybody.

1345
02:19:19,315 --> 02:19:23,639
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just trying to respond to what the neighborhood wants, which I believe is more density, however we can get it.

1346
02:19:23,999 --> 02:19:33,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want this to block the entire process of rezoning the entire city because it's important that we find more housing and support more commercial development.

1347
02:19:34,147 --> 02:19:34,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1348
02:19:34,647 --> 02:19:38,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1349
02:19:39,127 --> 02:19:39,828
[SPEAKER_08]: appreciate your comment.

1350
02:19:39,968 --> 02:19:42,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

1351
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

1352
02:19:44,532 --> 02:19:46,133
[SPEAKER_30]: Anna Meyer, 6 Douglas Road.

1353
02:19:46,614 --> 02:19:53,920
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to say briefly, start just by echoing Amy Hannah's comments that what I'm in favor of is being able to move forward with zoning.

1354
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:57,503
[SPEAKER_30]: And I trust the Council and the incoming City Council of what it's going to take to get there.

1355
02:19:58,644 --> 02:19:59,425
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that a

1356
02:19:59,845 --> 02:20:03,807
[SPEAKER_30]: Medford that is more dense where I can walk to get health care on Salem Street, which I currently do.

1357
02:20:03,847 --> 02:20:16,314
[SPEAKER_30]: I go to the dentist there where there is more affordable housing so I can live in a neighborhood where my friends in helping and professions and public professions can afford to live here and stay here is something I'm in favor of and I'm looking forward to moving forward with that.

1358
02:20:17,194 --> 02:20:23,818
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll just also say briefly that I know that there is no active proposal for a methadone clinic and it's nothing the city council is proposing.

1359
02:20:24,298 --> 02:20:31,746
[SPEAKER_30]: And at the same time, it's alarming to me how many of my neighbors are standing up to argue against more zoning again on the

1360
02:20:32,795 --> 02:20:38,076
[SPEAKER_30]: potential that there could be another proposal for a methadone clinic maybe sometime in the future.

1361
02:20:38,876 --> 02:20:55,719
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that we all thrive when our zoning provides for businesses and medical offices and housing that's gonna keep us all safe and we will all thrive in a Medford that has updated zoning that will provide for the needs of all of our community members.

1362
02:20:56,019 --> 02:20:56,339
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1363
02:20:56,359 --> 02:20:58,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1364
02:21:00,369 --> 02:21:06,152
[SPEAKER_08]: got a couple more going to go back to zoom Sophie are on zoom name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

1365
02:21:07,172 --> 02:21:16,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, this is Sophie Rex i'm at 78 calling street i'm here really to register my disappointment with the mayor and to briefly share my support for the rezoning efforts.

1366
02:21:17,762 --> 02:21:20,324
[SPEAKER_16]: as a single family historical homeowner in particular.

1367
02:21:20,344 --> 02:21:24,407
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not afraid of apartments or renters or methadone clinics.

1368
02:21:24,527 --> 02:21:35,755
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually worked at a methadone clinic for two and a half years and then for another year and a half at Boston Healthcare for the Homeless program, which is right near, I don't like to call it methadone mile, but what people are referring to like that.

1369
02:21:36,916 --> 02:21:42,000
[SPEAKER_16]: I never saw a single needle outside of the clinic that I worked at in Cambridge.

1370
02:21:43,083 --> 02:21:56,948
[SPEAKER_16]: And while I can truly sincerely appreciate some of the legitimate questions that are being raised, including about Habit OpCo as a company, I just want to share that the level of fear about these services is really unwarranted.

1371
02:21:58,395 --> 02:22:06,682
[SPEAKER_16]: even whether or not a clinic can come to Medford like the last speaker, it does concern me how people speak about these services generally.

1372
02:22:06,702 --> 02:22:15,008
[SPEAKER_16]: I do just also want to share that I talk with tough students at my job every single week, and I'm often trying to connect them with resources in the community.

1373
02:22:16,009 --> 02:22:20,373
[SPEAKER_16]: And when I suggest a place in Davis Square, their eyes light up because they know it.

1374
02:22:20,413 --> 02:22:21,433
[SPEAKER_16]: They get ice cream.

1375
02:22:22,274 --> 02:22:24,196
[SPEAKER_16]: They buy Halloween costumes at Goodwill.

1376
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:25,036
[SPEAKER_16]: They go bowling.

1377
02:22:25,076 --> 02:22:25,917
[SPEAKER_16]: They go to the movies.

1378
02:22:26,611 --> 02:22:28,894
[SPEAKER_16]: They check out the new bookshop or the boba shop.

1379
02:22:29,595 --> 02:22:37,267
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when I mentioned that there's a great counseling option in Medford Square right near the library, they look confused.

1380
02:22:37,287 --> 02:22:38,148
[SPEAKER_16]: They look nervous.

1381
02:22:38,228 --> 02:22:40,111
[SPEAKER_16]: They've literally never heard of Medford Square.

1382
02:22:40,131 --> 02:22:42,695
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of make it a joke, but they have no idea.

1383
02:22:43,744 --> 02:22:51,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Even though it's about equidistant to campus for most of them, they've never visited our beautiful library or Colleen's or Ray Augusto or the Chevalier.

1384
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:58,455
[SPEAKER_16]: They literally don't know it exists because Davis Square is a busy, fun place on a Saturday night and Medford Square is decidedly not.

1385
02:22:59,216 --> 02:23:02,799
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm very supportive of expanding our zoning any way we can.

1386
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:09,224
[SPEAKER_16]: And like some of the previous speakers, MX1, MX2, it feels like whatever you gotta do to move it forward.

1387
02:23:09,364 --> 02:23:09,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1388
02:23:12,406 --> 02:23:13,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1389
02:23:14,840 --> 02:23:17,101
[SPEAKER_08]: going to go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

1390
02:23:17,261 --> 02:23:18,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

1391
02:23:21,484 --> 02:23:22,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1392
02:23:22,684 --> 02:23:26,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street, East Medford.

1393
02:23:27,767 --> 02:23:36,192
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I want to apologize if my phone blew up with a phone call at the start of the meeting over an hour ago.

1394
02:23:36,212 --> 02:23:38,453
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one of our residents.

1395
02:23:38,893 --> 02:23:41,795
[SPEAKER_10]: She was very irate and yelling at me because

1396
02:23:42,237 --> 02:23:45,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Channel 22 Comcast was not coming through for this meeting.

1397
02:23:46,278 --> 02:23:51,040
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully it got rectified, because I did not want to interrupt your meeting an hour ago.

1398
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:55,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to knock on the door, it was locked, no response.

1399
02:23:55,921 --> 02:23:59,763
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully it's working for everyone.

1400
02:23:59,783 --> 02:24:09,486
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as Salem Street goes, I'll make it very, very brief.

1401
02:24:10,885 --> 02:24:20,427
[SPEAKER_10]: because I'm repeating myself from last five meetings on the same subject, Salem Street is congested enough as is.

1402
02:24:21,207 --> 02:24:25,168
[SPEAKER_10]: My uncle had three family with a store attached to it, still there.

1403
02:24:26,188 --> 02:24:30,188
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's congested in my opinion.

1404
02:24:31,609 --> 02:24:37,710
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can do anything is get that large gas station out of the three of them that takes up the whole block around Otter Street.

1405
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:39,130
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get that,

1406
02:24:40,284 --> 02:24:47,607
[SPEAKER_10]: from the owner who lives in Winchester to give it up or Eminent Domain there, that's a nice big parcel, it's a whole block.

1407
02:24:48,907 --> 02:24:50,027
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be tremendous.

1408
02:24:50,828 --> 02:25:04,653
[SPEAKER_10]: But otherwise, I wouldn't do too much more because it's already gonna be like Somerville with the Somerville congestion and the issues with or without heroin or methadone.

1409
02:25:06,733 --> 02:25:08,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Go easy on Salem Street, please.

1410
02:25:20,990 --> 02:25:21,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Andy.

1411
02:25:21,490 --> 02:25:25,431
[SPEAKER_08]: We're checking on channel 22, but it did seem to be up, and Jim is going to confirm.

1412
02:25:27,152 --> 02:25:28,572
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go back to Zoom.

1413
02:25:28,873 --> 02:25:30,833
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Barry Ingber.

1414
02:25:30,853 --> 02:25:33,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1415
02:25:40,916 --> 02:25:42,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

1416
02:25:43,777 --> 02:25:45,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1417
02:25:46,754 --> 02:25:56,818
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's pretty clear to almost everybody that we need rezoning in Medford, both to effectively address the affordable housing crisis and to promote commercial development.

1418
02:25:57,719 --> 02:26:08,063
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to express my strong support for the city council's efforts and disappointment in the mayor's efforts to put roadblocks in the way at the last minute.

1419
02:26:09,238 --> 02:26:16,320
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very blatant bullying, and I think it needs to be called out as such.

1420
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:37,166
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to note the irony of the hysteria around a treatment clinic that isn't going to happen, while nobody seems disturbed about Anthony's Liquors, whose patrons are not in treatment.

1421
02:26:38,176 --> 02:26:40,918
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want people to kind of ponder that.

1422
02:26:42,719 --> 02:26:43,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1423
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:46,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1424
02:26:47,401 --> 02:26:51,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no one else in person, we'll stay on Zoom.

1425
02:26:51,424 --> 02:26:52,684
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Miranda Briseño.

1426
02:26:52,764 --> 02:26:53,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

1427
02:26:53,905 --> 02:26:54,766
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

1428
02:26:57,847 --> 02:27:00,369
[SPEAKER_40]: Hi, Miranda Briseño to Taylor Street.

1429
02:27:01,950 --> 02:27:04,951
[SPEAKER_40]: Don't live in the area, but do you want to register my support for

1430
02:27:06,577 --> 02:27:08,078
[SPEAKER_40]: moving the zoning project along.

1431
02:27:08,158 --> 02:27:14,844
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it's been well established throughout this meeting that a methadone clinic is not coming to Medford, especially at this particular location.

1432
02:27:14,864 --> 02:27:24,193
[SPEAKER_40]: Similar to other speakers, it's disappointing to hear a lot of the misinformation being spread about the people who would use this clinic and the presumed behaviors they would take part in.

1433
02:27:25,384 --> 02:27:28,845
[SPEAKER_40]: for those that are worried about needles being left around the city.

1434
02:27:30,086 --> 02:27:40,890
[SPEAKER_40]: I look forward to advocating with you for an increase in sharp containers around Medford so that we can reduce this potential hazardous waste.

1435
02:27:42,090 --> 02:27:52,434
[SPEAKER_40]: Something probably every speaker has mentioned tonight is that they've made multiple versions of their comments, whether they are for or against the current proposal or amendment on the table over the last year or so.

1436
02:27:52,694 --> 02:27:54,495
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that's a clear indication

1437
02:27:55,109 --> 02:28:00,250
[SPEAKER_40]: that this process has taken so long and it's really iterative.

1438
02:28:00,290 --> 02:28:05,292
[SPEAKER_40]: There's not a lot of clear communication about what's been happening.

1439
02:28:06,112 --> 02:28:19,016
[SPEAKER_40]: And lest we forget that the council doesn't have any power to appropriate themselves funds or communication to the public about what is happening about their meetings and whatnot, that all of that power sits with the mayor.

1440
02:28:19,636 --> 02:28:21,957
[SPEAKER_40]: And it's been really disappointing to see her

1441
02:28:23,979 --> 02:28:27,961
[SPEAKER_40]: take the stance that she has no idea what's going on when she's the one in charge.

1442
02:28:29,042 --> 02:28:34,845
[SPEAKER_40]: And for people not to be disappointed in that is quite shocking to me.

1443
02:28:36,006 --> 02:28:46,971
[SPEAKER_40]: I wouldn't want the leader of my city to say that they were unaware of a big project that's been happening over 18 months and that they're shocked by what they've been hearing.

1444
02:28:48,212 --> 02:28:50,393
[SPEAKER_40]: But yeah, that's just what I want to register.

1445
02:28:50,533 --> 02:28:53,455
[SPEAKER_40]: Like everyone else has said, I just want this to move forward.

1446
02:28:54,066 --> 02:28:56,908
[SPEAKER_40]: and it's unfortunate that the mayor has put us in this position.

1447
02:29:00,050 --> 02:29:00,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1448
02:29:01,351 --> 02:29:02,412
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go back to the podium.

1449
02:29:02,692 --> 02:29:03,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

1450
02:29:03,993 --> 02:29:05,134
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

1451
02:29:06,415 --> 02:29:09,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street, Medford.

1452
02:29:09,417 --> 02:29:14,361
[SPEAKER_14]: I first off just want to appreciate the

1453
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:21,455
[SPEAKER_14]: long term efforts of the city council to move the zoning reform forward.

1454
02:29:22,015 --> 02:29:27,220
[SPEAKER_14]: I respect whatever decision you come to tonight about MX1 or MX2.

1455
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:41,111
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I have a question on, it seems to me from having attended many city council meetings at this point, that any business that wants to open in Medford,

1456
02:29:42,112 --> 02:29:45,954
[SPEAKER_14]: has to be approved by the council, is that correct?

1457
02:29:48,055 --> 02:29:53,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, the... Any business that wants to open anywhere in Medford... That's a complicated question.

1458
02:29:55,319 --> 02:29:58,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Certain businesses require certain licenses, some don't.

1459
02:29:59,821 --> 02:30:05,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's also the special permit condition for zoning, which is actually an even higher condition than that.

1460
02:30:05,937 --> 02:30:10,280
[SPEAKER_08]: An example, if you're serving hot food, you need to get a certain type of license.

1461
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:14,323
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a lawyer's office, I don't think you have to get any kind of license.

1462
02:30:14,383 --> 02:30:17,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are kind of, that's a very, very oversimplified answer.

1463
02:30:18,617 --> 02:30:32,431
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't live in the Salem Street area, but it sounds like there are two parcels that potentially could be developed under the new zoning, whichever it gets zoned by.

1464
02:30:33,231 --> 02:30:36,735
[SPEAKER_14]: And they would be commercial properties, presumably.

1465
02:30:38,982 --> 02:30:43,804
[SPEAKER_08]: The MX zoning allows for a first floor commercial and then housing above it.

1466
02:30:43,924 --> 02:30:49,906
[SPEAKER_14]: So would those type of arrangements need to come before the city council to get approval?

1467
02:30:50,286 --> 02:30:52,287
[SPEAKER_08]: That's again a somewhat complicated question.

1468
02:30:53,027 --> 02:30:57,708
[SPEAKER_08]: At really any significant scale, a project has to go through what's called site plan review.

1469
02:30:58,969 --> 02:31:01,590
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's through the planning board, through the community development board.

1470
02:31:04,089 --> 02:31:05,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it again goes back to zone.

1471
02:31:05,951 --> 02:31:11,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, there's three zoning can say three things I can say mixed use building.

1472
02:31:11,756 --> 02:31:16,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that means that it's by right and that doesn't mean there's nothing else after that point.

1473
02:31:17,161 --> 02:31:21,064
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be a special permit and then there's a special permit granting authority or it can say no.

1474
02:31:21,264 --> 02:31:22,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's, it's not allowed at all.

1475
02:31:23,967 --> 02:31:31,832
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, in an MX zone, a mixed-use building is generally by right, but it still has to conform to all of the other conditions.

1476
02:31:32,132 --> 02:31:40,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's over a certain size and scale, it goes through a site plan review process through the Community Development Board, and there's kind of public engagement through that.

1477
02:31:40,437 --> 02:31:42,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's what I was wondering.

1478
02:31:42,659 --> 02:31:49,303
[SPEAKER_14]: So there will be points at which the public can weigh in on any development that might happen there.

1479
02:31:49,683 --> 02:31:49,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1480
02:31:51,974 --> 02:31:53,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Any is the only word I have.

1481
02:31:53,916 --> 02:31:55,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Development over a certain size, yes.

1482
02:31:56,058 --> 02:31:57,439
[SPEAKER_14]: And MX means mixed.

1483
02:31:57,619 --> 02:31:58,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Mixed, yeah.

1484
02:31:58,480 --> 02:32:00,642
[SPEAKER_08]: MX is, yeah, it's shorthand for mixed.

1485
02:32:00,942 --> 02:32:01,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1486
02:32:01,562 --> 02:32:01,963
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it.

1487
02:32:04,144 --> 02:32:05,886
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll go back to Zoom.

1488
02:32:05,906 --> 02:32:07,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Genesis Perez.

1489
02:32:07,587 --> 02:32:10,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Genesis, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1490
02:32:12,051 --> 02:32:16,895
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, my name is Genesis Perez, and I live at 229 Main Street.

1491
02:32:18,476 --> 02:32:20,318
[SPEAKER_33]: So I guess I just want to

1492
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:46,572
[SPEAKER_33]: um, express my support for affordable housing, however that can be procured, and I'm honestly quite disappointed by the comments I have heard, um, discriminating against the potential for any sort of, um, medical, uh, facility being constructed in the city, as if

1493
02:32:47,599 --> 02:33:00,329
[SPEAKER_33]: there, they could never know someone who might need that facility, or as if those people could pose such a, um, a danger to anyone around them.

1494
02:33:00,570 --> 02:33:02,211
[SPEAKER_33]: I just find that very concerning.

1495
02:33:02,531 --> 02:33:15,522
[SPEAKER_33]: And frankly, I will definitely be attending more of these council meetings in the future, um, to, um, express my opinions in, um,

1496
02:33:16,733 --> 02:33:18,254
[SPEAKER_33]: in disagreement with those, I guess.

1497
02:33:19,175 --> 02:33:29,622
[SPEAKER_33]: But yeah, so just expressing support for affordable housing however we can procure it, because there are so many students here who need affordable housing.

1498
02:33:29,662 --> 02:33:37,908
[SPEAKER_33]: But also, it would be amazing to have a more robust community here in Medford.

1499
02:33:38,028 --> 02:33:44,272
[SPEAKER_33]: And like someone mentioned, something more akin to Davis Square here at Medford Square would be very nice to see.

1500
02:33:44,873 --> 02:33:45,193
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1501
02:33:47,847 --> 02:33:49,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for your comment.

1502
02:33:49,388 --> 02:33:50,428
[SPEAKER_08]: We will stay on zoom.

1503
02:33:51,008 --> 02:33:55,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go to Caitlin Robinson, Caitlin name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

1504
02:33:58,011 --> 02:33:58,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you.

1505
02:33:59,331 --> 02:34:02,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Caitlin Robinson, 31 Everett street.

1506
02:34:02,972 --> 02:34:06,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a resident of this neighborhood that we're talking about.

1507
02:34:07,074 --> 02:34:11,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I live two blocks from the intersection of Salem and park.

1508
02:34:12,236 --> 02:34:13,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I,

1509
02:34:13,767 --> 02:34:24,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of the many people in the neighborhood who spoke in favor of upzoning this area and whose comments seem to be dismissed by many of the public speakers.

1510
02:34:25,676 --> 02:34:28,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the work that the city council is doing.

1511
02:34:29,318 --> 02:34:40,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to register my disappointment in the mayor and the tactics that she's been using in this, which are tactics I've

1512
02:34:41,085 --> 02:34:45,847
[SPEAKER_00]: come to expect to see more at the federal level and not here in our city.

1513
02:34:47,908 --> 02:34:53,391
[SPEAKER_00]: I want us to go forward with the zoning process.

1514
02:34:54,111 --> 02:34:57,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very concerned about the whole idea of

1515
02:35:00,129 --> 02:35:15,157
[SPEAKER_00]: shifting this down to MX1 specifically to prohibit medical uses, because I'm wondering about the precedent that that will set as we look to zoning other squares and corridors.

1516
02:35:15,477 --> 02:35:29,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be the same conversation over again with the idea that we are going to outlaw all medical uses out of fear about the possibility for something like a methadone clinic?

1517
02:35:30,978 --> 02:35:31,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1518
02:35:33,780 --> 02:35:34,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1519
02:35:35,622 --> 02:35:41,628
[SPEAKER_08]: We will stay on zoom we'll go to run being name and address for the record please and you'll have three minutes.

1520
02:35:42,668 --> 02:35:44,030
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi, run being 37 Woodrow Avenue.

1521
02:35:47,984 --> 02:36:00,527
[SPEAKER_39]: I just wanted to call in and express deep and sincere thanks for the many, I think, unseen and uncounted hours that the folks sitting on the council have put into this over the past nearly two years now.

1522
02:36:00,547 --> 02:36:09,449
[SPEAKER_39]: I particularly want to call out at least what I've seen of Councilor Collins, as she mentioned in what I thought was a very compelling and

1523
02:36:11,049 --> 02:36:21,195
[SPEAKER_39]: persuasive speech about why we shouldn't let this die on the vine, having to serve as a Councilor and de facto communications officer because there's no budget for communications.

1524
02:36:21,295 --> 02:36:36,785
[SPEAKER_39]: I think Councilor Collins and all of your colleagues really did an excellent job communicating this to the community, building a comprehensive website with lots of links and good information and summaries, creating a newsletter, attending

1525
02:36:37,325 --> 02:36:41,188
[SPEAKER_39]: you know, community sessions, above and beyond and outside of council sessions.

1526
02:36:41,768 --> 02:36:58,561
[SPEAKER_39]: And, you know, I think that for the mayor to kind of come in and give this list of demands, because it wasn't because what City Council did in a very compressed timeline 18 month contract with Innis, and, you know, no budget really other than just paying Innis.

1527
02:37:00,648 --> 02:37:01,749
[SPEAKER_39]: was incredible.

1528
02:37:01,969 --> 02:37:23,808
[SPEAKER_39]: And then to say, well, I'm not going to give you the very modest ask that Councilor Bears made, which was, I think, an additional $50,000 for communications and to extend the contract through the end of 26, which is basically 12 more months to do this work that could, based on what the mayor is saying she wants, I think should take closer to two years, if we're being realistic.

1529
02:37:25,369 --> 02:37:31,214
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, I think that some of what the Councilors have said here, particularly Callahan and Collins have said.

1530
02:37:33,235 --> 02:37:38,640
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, I don't know that it makes that big of a difference on this is this particular corner.

1531
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:49,348
[SPEAKER_39]: I think city council did a really great job listening to and incorporating feedback from the community and consideration towards some of the legitimate concerns, you know, particular nature of a medical

1532
02:37:50,449 --> 02:38:07,280
[SPEAKER_39]: use aside, there were some concerns about the volume of activity and traffic, such that, you know, okay they made some adjustments to define neighborhood clinic, you know, I think that the community is being clear here in this meeting wait wait wait, we do want to be able to see a dentist we do want to be able to see a primary care and neighborhood medical.

1533
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:11,643
[SPEAKER_39]: was carefully crafted and perfectly defined to allow that type of use.

1534
02:38:12,603 --> 02:38:19,128
[SPEAKER_39]: A practitioner owned business that provides, you know, helpful, friendly neighborhood service to the folks that live there.

1535
02:38:19,328 --> 02:38:27,393
[SPEAKER_39]: And that could include medication assisted treatment, you know, a low volume clinic that's serving people with a disease, you know, wouldn't be very disruptive to a neighborhood.

1536
02:38:28,314 --> 02:38:36,920
[SPEAKER_39]: I think we should allow that in all the neighborhoods that would be, that would diffuse the impact of, you know, say like an urgent care clinic that's open

1537
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:40,985
[SPEAKER_39]: you know, 4am to midnight and is loud and has a lot of traffic.

1538
02:38:41,045 --> 02:38:43,047
[SPEAKER_39]: I mean, it could be any type of clinic.

1539
02:38:43,228 --> 02:38:45,210
[SPEAKER_39]: Anyway, I don't I think that's neither here nor there.

1540
02:38:45,310 --> 02:38:53,421
[SPEAKER_39]: I think this meeting is ostensibly about MX one to MX two, but it's really about the mayor's list of demands and I would kind of hate to see the council, just as a

1541
02:38:54,182 --> 02:39:02,887
[SPEAKER_39]: Forget who said it, but kiss the ring on this one, especially after a resounding endorsement of, you know, the current council through the current election.

1542
02:39:03,327 --> 02:39:19,956
[SPEAKER_39]: I think you all should assert your voice and, you know, represent the people that voted for you and move this process forward and and, you know, have a have a inverse list of demands to the mayor to say, hey, you know, this is this is not the way business is done.

1543
02:39:19,996 --> 02:39:21,737
[SPEAKER_39]: This is not the way we want to have business done.

1544
02:39:23,218 --> 02:39:25,239
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, I'm very disappointed she's not here.

1545
02:39:25,259 --> 02:39:27,661
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm very disappointed at the way she's handled this.

1546
02:39:29,042 --> 02:39:34,206
[SPEAKER_39]: I think that whole ultimatum needs to be retracted and a level conversation needs to be started.

1547
02:39:34,646 --> 02:39:34,906
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1548
02:39:36,007 --> 02:39:36,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1549
02:39:38,749 --> 02:39:39,069
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1550
02:39:40,370 --> 02:39:44,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Last person on Zoom, seeing no one in the chamber, I will go to Eileen Lerner.

1551
02:39:44,493 --> 02:39:45,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

1552
02:39:45,934 --> 02:39:47,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

1553
02:39:51,060 --> 02:39:55,803
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1554
02:39:56,524 --> 02:40:00,886
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm here to support the council and the zoning.

1555
02:40:00,906 --> 02:40:05,229
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think the work that's been done is incredible.

1556
02:40:07,231 --> 02:40:18,178
[SPEAKER_20]: I admire all of you a tremendous amount because not only did you have to do the work, but then all the criticism and negativity that has surrounded it.

1557
02:40:19,277 --> 02:40:40,951
[SPEAKER_20]: but I want, it takes a lot of strength to do what you guys have done, but I'm really excited about what you've done because I think in the end, all of this will be forgotten and we'll have a city that'll be more vibrant and we'll look back and say, wow, how'd that happen?

1558
02:40:41,051 --> 02:40:46,015
[SPEAKER_20]: But I mean, we're surrounded by cities that are thriving and we're limping.

1559
02:40:47,041 --> 02:40:47,942
[SPEAKER_20]: limping along.

1560
02:40:48,102 --> 02:40:56,049
[SPEAKER_20]: So the idea that we're going to be competitive with surrounding cities is really exciting to me.

1561
02:40:56,349 --> 02:41:01,753
[SPEAKER_20]: And it'll be more vibrant and more fun and more colorful.

1562
02:41:02,034 --> 02:41:04,616
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you all for what you've done.

1563
02:41:04,636 --> 02:41:08,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the comment.

1564
02:41:08,899 --> 02:41:12,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone who hasn't yet had a chance to speak who would like to speak?

1565
02:41:15,601 --> 02:41:18,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, is there anyone who's already spoken who'd like to speak for one more minute?

1566
02:41:19,444 --> 02:41:20,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing one at the podium.

1567
02:41:22,746 --> 02:41:24,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Ralph, we'll take you for one more minute.

1568
02:41:25,248 --> 02:41:26,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Ralph Klein, 172 Park Street.

1569
02:41:27,830 --> 02:41:28,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not against everything.

1570
02:41:30,472 --> 02:41:31,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure that out.

1571
02:41:31,653 --> 02:41:34,695
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look down Salem Street, they're all three-story buildings.

1572
02:41:34,715 --> 02:41:38,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have 25% with four stories.

1573
02:41:39,238 --> 02:41:41,019
[SPEAKER_02]: We've allowed that for the buildings that are there.

1574
02:41:42,040 --> 02:41:44,782
[SPEAKER_02]: On Hadley Place, it went from a one-family home

1575
02:41:45,803 --> 02:41:51,227
[SPEAKER_02]: to eight, 800% increase in that one property in density.

1576
02:41:51,868 --> 02:41:56,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Going down Salem Street, how many one-family homes do you see in that area?

1577
02:41:56,451 --> 02:41:58,473
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not just talking about Park Street corner.

1578
02:41:59,354 --> 02:42:00,955
[SPEAKER_02]: You're rezoning that whole section.

1579
02:42:01,035 --> 02:42:02,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's making about this one corner.

1580
02:42:03,237 --> 02:42:04,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about the one corner.

1581
02:42:04,638 --> 02:42:05,819
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the whole area.

1582
02:42:07,340 --> 02:42:09,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about methadone clinics and all these clinics going in there.

1583
02:42:10,402 --> 02:42:13,925
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the parking involved with the buildings, and like you say,

1584
02:42:14,627 --> 02:42:19,070
[SPEAKER_02]: A doctor's office has people coming in, people going, three people staff.

1585
02:42:19,150 --> 02:42:20,111
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to have parking.

1586
02:42:20,671 --> 02:42:22,613
[SPEAKER_02]: The city isn't allowing for that kind of parking.

1587
02:42:23,874 --> 02:42:30,638
[SPEAKER_02]: If the 14 units from zero is a 1400% increase in that area with no parking.

1588
02:42:32,439 --> 02:42:35,442
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about not moving forward.

1589
02:42:35,462 --> 02:42:40,165
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about moving forward in reality, not in fantasy land.

1590
02:42:41,445 --> 02:42:43,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd like to see that corner developed.

1591
02:42:43,646 --> 02:42:48,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived there with that pit there the whole time, since they tore it down.

1592
02:42:49,027 --> 02:42:50,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard different stories.

1593
02:42:50,487 --> 02:42:52,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was electrocuted there, which held it up.

1594
02:42:52,408 --> 02:42:52,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard one.

1595
02:42:54,068 --> 02:42:55,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the problem is there.

1596
02:42:55,889 --> 02:43:01,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It started out as nine units, almost acceptable, decently.

1597
02:43:01,491 --> 02:43:04,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But 14, and then, like I say, medical offices.

1598
02:43:04,571 --> 02:43:10,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's against the medical office, but this is the whole block, not just that one spot.

1599
02:43:11,041 --> 02:43:11,922
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the whole area.

1600
02:43:12,322 --> 02:43:15,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Go down there, drive through there, and see how many houses are being worked on.

1601
02:43:16,565 --> 02:43:19,828
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another house right across from Pure Italy.

1602
02:43:20,869 --> 02:43:21,990
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a two-family.

1603
02:43:22,010 --> 02:43:22,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now three.

1604
02:43:22,550 --> 02:43:24,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Another 25% increase right there.

1605
02:43:25,553 --> 02:43:27,454
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 1,500 units going up in Medford.

1606
02:43:28,996 --> 02:43:30,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Improving density, you're already doing it.

1607
02:43:32,418 --> 02:43:34,240
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to look at it reality-wise.

1608
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: MX1 is the way to go.

1609
02:43:36,482 --> 02:43:40,245
[SPEAKER_02]: 25% increase for the properties is not

1610
02:43:41,333 --> 02:43:46,677
[SPEAKER_02]: exorbitant, six stories, 75% or 100% increase.

1611
02:43:47,597 --> 02:43:50,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Three stories to six.

1612
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:51,400
[SPEAKER_02]: What's real?

1613
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:52,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Where would you want to be?

1614
02:43:55,102 --> 02:43:56,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it where it belongs.

1615
02:43:56,403 --> 02:43:57,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate the comment, Ralph.

1616
02:43:57,864 --> 02:44:07,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, something for me, you know, people can feel the mayor has a reason for this, at least that she communicated to someone for wanting this amendment.

1617
02:44:08,517 --> 02:44:16,484
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and there's been so much conversation around why the council didn't adopt this one, but did adopt that one.

1618
02:44:16,504 --> 02:44:28,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I think something that got missed for me all the way back in March, I think it was said more clearly in the Community Development Board meeting, which I hadn't actually looked at until after we had looked at this, after we had voted.

1619
02:44:29,913 --> 02:44:40,099
[SPEAKER_08]: was, I think, the point that I think Danielle made and maybe someone else behind the rail made, which is that, by and large, the six-story piece of this isn't even possible in that area anyway.

1620
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:54,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if that point had—if we had gotten more information and kind of a clearer communication on that and that signal had come through the noise in the meeting, that may have changed this specific decision, you know, many, many months ago.

1621
02:44:54,707 --> 02:44:54,767
[SPEAKER_08]: And

1622
02:44:57,231 --> 02:45:02,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's both a testament to and a warning on what Councilor Leming made the point of, right?

1623
02:45:03,253 --> 02:45:08,714
[SPEAKER_08]: There were a lot of people who came to our meeting on March 11th and said, we'll have every recommendation except this one.

1624
02:45:09,094 --> 02:45:11,935
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have every recommendation except going from MX1 to MX2.

1625
02:45:12,735 --> 02:45:21,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And we heard that and we said, okay, we heard from the community development board, there's a lot of great recommendations, but we also just heard from a bunch of people in this meeting that they want this one not to be adopted.

1626
02:45:22,522 --> 02:45:35,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I didn't even remember hearing that piece of information that's like, well, the MX to six story piece is really hard here anyway it actually may be feasibility and logic wise isn't the answer, you know, going from three to six versus three to four.

1627
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:37,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it speaks to.

1628
02:45:39,156 --> 02:45:55,387
[SPEAKER_08]: how we need to handle this, having the resources, having the communication, the mayor appropriating actually significant and sufficient resources to accomplish the goals that we need to accomplish and not trying to do things on a shoestring and not trying to do things, do really important things without the resources.

1629
02:45:55,587 --> 02:45:57,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, I appreciate what you said, right?

1630
02:45:58,209 --> 02:46:01,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Going from three to four, that's one thing, going from three to six feels really different.

1631
02:46:02,372 --> 02:46:04,073
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate that.

1632
02:46:04,863 --> 02:46:10,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're done with public comments, so I'll just say I'm pretty much where a lot of folks who've spoken tonight are.

1633
02:46:11,327 --> 02:46:15,189
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to move forward on this really important project for our city.

1634
02:46:19,331 --> 02:46:25,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really have a huge issue from the density question perspective about the MX2 to MX1.

1635
02:46:26,075 --> 02:46:27,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I could vote for this amendment.

1636
02:46:28,460 --> 02:46:32,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I would really like to see what is exactly the plan going forward.

1637
02:46:32,904 --> 02:46:42,832
[SPEAKER_08]: If this is a quid pro quo, if this is, you know, unless you do this, we don't do the zoning project, any part of it, then what is that zoning project?

1638
02:46:42,912 --> 02:46:43,672
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the commitment?

1639
02:46:43,832 --> 02:46:45,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a couple of people asked for public commitment.

1640
02:46:46,274 --> 02:46:49,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a good conversation with the mayor today.

1641
02:46:49,077 --> 02:46:50,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel

1642
02:46:51,265 --> 02:46:58,171
[SPEAKER_08]: like it's getting somewhere, but I wasn't sure from the email that we got, you know, what are we starting when?

1643
02:46:58,671 --> 02:47:00,292
[SPEAKER_08]: What's in each phase of the process?

1644
02:47:00,933 --> 02:47:07,878
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're doing a new RFP to bring in all those resources and have the funding for them, you know, when does that happen?

1645
02:47:08,919 --> 02:47:12,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just really what I think needs to get ironed out personally.

1646
02:47:13,303 --> 02:47:19,968
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my perspective individually, which I've tried to hold off on saying until we move through the discussion.

1647
02:47:21,009 --> 02:47:24,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Councilor, actually Councilor Leming had to stand up first and then you, Councilor Callahan.

1648
02:47:24,472 --> 02:47:24,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming.

1649
02:47:26,393 --> 02:47:44,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just like to point out, I'd just like to talk about one thing that was brought up by, it was only brought up by one public commenter, but I've heard it said like a few times in the preceding months, which is that the expectation that

1650
02:47:46,108 --> 02:48:09,504
[SPEAKER_04]: the city council and elected body follow every single recommendation made by the community development board and appointed body is a little bit absurd and I just like to that needs to be made clear for anybody in this process moving forward because throughout the entire rezoning process we have

1651
02:48:10,565 --> 02:48:19,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Rejected exactly one recommendation by the community development board, which was what we're talking about now The city council is an elected body.

1652
02:48:19,129 --> 02:48:33,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a it's a decision-making body The community development board is an appointed body and it is meant to make recommendations and on top of that it's on top of that it's even

1653
02:48:35,996 --> 02:48:36,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1654
02:48:36,776 --> 02:48:49,300
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of that, it's even a little bit more absurd because in most other municipalities, the Community Development Board or the Planning Board is confirmed by the City Council.

1655
02:48:50,061 --> 02:48:52,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Medford, it's not.

1656
02:48:52,641 --> 02:48:58,903
[SPEAKER_04]: For weird, for weird historic reasons, the Community Development Board is only appointed by the mayor.

1657
02:48:58,963 --> 02:49:00,344
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been hearing about

1658
02:49:01,084 --> 02:49:10,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Different people who were appointed to the community development board that we were never like the city council was never informed to them We don't know anything about them.

1659
02:49:10,931 --> 02:49:26,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to request the resumes of recent appointees to the community development board they have the newer appointees have less planning experience than the ones that uh previously were uh, the ones that were previously appointed back when their uh,

1660
02:49:28,363 --> 02:49:33,264
[SPEAKER_04]: back when their responsibilities were primarily site plan review and not zoning.

1661
02:49:35,525 --> 02:49:50,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's the fact that we rejected, we only ever rejected one recommendation in this entire rezoning process means that the clear expectation is that an elected body rubber stamp every decision made by an appointed body.

1662
02:49:50,949 --> 02:49:54,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not a healthy way to move forward in this process because it's November, 2025.

1663
02:49:56,170 --> 02:49:59,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are still talking about Salem Street.

1664
02:50:01,052 --> 02:50:11,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor also wants to go back and talk about Mystic Avenue, which was also, which also should be done.

1665
02:50:11,755 --> 02:50:13,395
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't go back.

1666
02:50:13,435 --> 02:50:19,157
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't go back and sort of redo everything every single time there is a disagreement in this process.

1667
02:50:19,197 --> 02:50:20,938
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not how you get things done.

1668
02:50:22,018 --> 02:50:35,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we should have, like, we should be on to, like, I would like it if this, uh, if we're talking about Medford square or Boston Avenue or some of the other, some of the other corridors in the city, but this is, this is not a good way to do business.

1669
02:50:35,727 --> 02:50:47,795
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I hope that we can have more communication and sort of set, uh, expectations, uh, between the mayor and the city council a little bit more clearly moving forward.

1670
02:50:51,376 --> 02:50:54,838
[SPEAKER_08]: And Councilor Lueb and Councilor Callahan.

1671
02:50:55,098 --> 02:50:55,379
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks.

1672
02:50:55,839 --> 02:51:13,630
[SPEAKER_27]: I would really like to make a motion that we continue the public hearing until the mayor can publicly commit to fully funding the zoning that our city committed to in the many public plans that thousands of residents participated in.

1673
02:51:15,814 --> 02:51:19,677
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion from Councilor Callahan to continue the public hearing to our next regular meeting.

1674
02:51:20,937 --> 02:51:22,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second on that motion?

1675
02:51:22,578 --> 02:51:24,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1676
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:26,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any discussion on the motion?

1677
02:51:30,884 --> 02:51:33,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to, sorry, I didn't know if that was a motion or not.

1678
02:51:34,005 --> 02:51:37,548
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you had like an intent to move, but okay.

1679
02:51:37,648 --> 02:51:41,650
[SPEAKER_08]: You would like to, I mean, we could do a motion to approve.

1680
02:51:43,211 --> 02:51:44,192
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do a straw poll.

1681
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,041
[SPEAKER_08]: If we do a motion to approve and then it goes down.

1682
02:51:49,441 --> 02:51:49,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1683
02:51:50,581 --> 02:51:52,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1684
02:51:52,362 --> 02:51:54,302
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1685
02:51:54,842 --> 02:51:58,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's a motion from councilor Callahan to continue for one week.

1686
02:51:58,743 --> 02:52:00,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll, we will have this on next week.

1687
02:52:01,004 --> 02:52:05,625
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor could say what the plan is going forward before next week.

1688
02:52:06,065 --> 02:52:06,366
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure.

1689
02:52:06,506 --> 02:52:08,606
[SPEAKER_27]: I just wanted to be clear in my state.

1690
02:52:08,706 --> 02:52:14,228
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I think I was clear before, but in case this is the only thing that, um, is heard, I just wanted to be clear.

1691
02:52:14,288 --> 02:52:15,068
[SPEAKER_27]: So, okay.

1692
02:52:16,363 --> 02:52:16,583
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1693
02:52:16,603 --> 02:52:21,166
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion from Councilor Callahan to continue the public hearing for one week, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1694
02:52:22,247 --> 02:52:23,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

1695
02:52:25,870 --> 02:52:27,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Vice President Collins.

1696
02:52:29,292 --> 02:52:34,075
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to state that I really appreciate the discussion that we've had about this tonight behind the rail and with residents.

1697
02:52:34,816 --> 02:52:40,660
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to underline what I interpret as the intent of Councilor Callahan's statement.

1698
02:52:42,001 --> 02:52:43,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to reopen the public hearing next week.

1699
02:52:45,890 --> 02:52:55,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I will, I intend to hold my approval on this until we get a clear written out proposal from the mayor that includes a project timeline.

1700
02:52:57,075 --> 02:53:03,778
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if that's ambitious to do in one week, but I hope that she will meet our enthusiasm and resolve.

1701
02:53:04,518 --> 02:53:05,678
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to put that on the record.

1702
02:53:05,878 --> 02:53:06,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1703
02:53:07,379 --> 02:53:07,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1704
02:53:09,580 --> 02:53:11,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no further discussion on the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1705
02:53:15,189 --> 02:53:16,090

02:53:28,238 --> 02:53:28,318
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_24]: President Pierce.

1718
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:31,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1719
02:53:32,081 --> 02:53:32,721
[SPEAKER_24]: Seven in the.

1720
02:53:38,022 --> 02:53:38,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I heard it.

1721
02:53:40,925 --> 02:53:42,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Six days from now, we're going to talk about it again.

1722
02:53:42,867 --> 02:53:45,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've made some progress.

1723
02:53:46,770 --> 02:53:47,071
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1724
02:53:47,651 --> 02:53:51,354
[SPEAKER_08]: So seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1725
02:53:51,374 --> 02:53:53,656
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes and the public hearing is continued for one week.

1726
02:53:55,918 --> 02:53:56,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1727
02:53:57,019 --> 02:53:57,260
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

02:54:07,842 --> 02:54:08,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

1729

[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1731
02:54:19,170 --> 02:54:20,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Paper 25-105.

1732
02:54:20,431 --> 02:54:26,716
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to take from the paper, paper number 25-105.

1733
02:54:27,336 --> 02:54:31,919
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the Mayor's veto of the amended Values Line Local Investments Ordinance.

1734
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:33,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by.

1735
02:54:34,021 --> 02:54:35,382

[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1739
02:54:43,937 --> 02:54:44,857
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins?

1740
02:54:44,877 --> 02:54:44,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1741
02:54:46,018 --> 02:54:46,858
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1742
02:54:46,878 --> 02:54:46,938
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1743
02:54:48,259 --> 02:54:48,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming?

1744
02:54:49,399 --> 02:54:49,719
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1745
02:54:51,240 --> 02:54:52,060
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1746
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:52,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1747
02:54:53,561 --> 02:54:54,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Tseng?

1748
02:54:54,261 --> 02:54:55,381
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1749
02:54:55,401 --> 02:54:56,061
[SPEAKER_24]: President Bears?

1750
02:54:56,302 --> 02:54:56,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1751
02:54:57,062 --> 02:54:58,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Semi-affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

1752
02:54:58,923 --> 02:54:59,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins?

1753
02:55:02,364 --> 02:55:03,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Bears.

1754
02:55:04,865 --> 02:55:09,927
[SPEAKER_15]: This paper before us is the amended values aligned local investment ordinance.

1755
02:55:12,757 --> 02:55:14,063
[SPEAKER_15]: The City Council will discuss this.

1756
02:55:16,713 --> 02:55:19,655
[SPEAKER_15]: on several city council meetings throughout the late summer and fall of this year.

1757
02:55:20,736 --> 02:55:21,697
[SPEAKER_15]: It's being returned to us.

1758
02:55:22,397 --> 02:55:29,964
[SPEAKER_15]: It was returned to us last meeting, and I motion to table it because the mayor vetoed the ordinance on October 9th.

1759
02:55:30,985 --> 02:55:34,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Accompanying her veto was a letter outlining her objections.

1760
02:55:36,249 --> 02:55:39,272
[SPEAKER_15]: It is listed on the city website, so I won't attempt to paraphrase it.

1761
02:55:39,392 --> 02:55:39,872
[SPEAKER_15]: It's her words.

1762
02:55:41,393 --> 02:55:42,154
[SPEAKER_15]: She put it up publicly.

1763
02:55:43,575 --> 02:55:44,216
[SPEAKER_15]: She mentioned

1764
02:55:44,856 --> 02:55:47,578
[SPEAKER_15]: several concerns with the ordinance.

1765
02:55:48,759 --> 02:55:50,340
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them was the potential for litigation.

1766
02:55:50,960 --> 02:55:58,706
[SPEAKER_15]: As one Councilor, I failed to imagine a scenario where a person who deemed themselves aggrieved or injured by this ordinance would want to remedy that through a lawsuit.

1767
02:55:58,986 --> 02:56:00,527
[SPEAKER_15]: That does not seem rational to me.

1768
02:56:01,786 --> 02:56:07,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Her letter outlined quote financial implications that have quote yet to be evaluated by the city's financial teams.

1769
02:56:08,428 --> 02:56:10,268
[SPEAKER_15]: I find that vague enough to be insubstantial.

1770
02:56:11,289 --> 02:56:11,829
[SPEAKER_15]: What does that mean?

1771
02:56:12,069 --> 02:56:12,989
[SPEAKER_15]: What are the implications?

1772
02:56:13,089 --> 02:56:14,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Why have they not been evaluated?

1773
02:56:15,190 --> 02:56:20,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Her letter mentioned a concern that the ordinance would expose city employees to personal and professional liability.

1774
02:56:20,971 --> 02:56:22,372
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't make sense to me on its face.

1775
02:56:23,932 --> 02:56:26,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Our city financial employees are not private contractors.

1776
02:56:27,682 --> 02:56:33,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Why would they be exposed to personal liability by doing the work of analyzing and adhering to the city's investment regulations?

1777
02:56:34,087 --> 02:56:35,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Reads like a scare tactic, frankly.

1778
02:56:35,688 --> 02:56:42,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Her letter further mentioned an objection that the council did not thoroughly vet this ordinance and seek input from the relevant stakeholders within the city.

1779
02:56:42,873 --> 02:56:44,494
[SPEAKER_15]: That is false.

1780
02:56:45,155 --> 02:56:45,635
[SPEAKER_15]: This has been a...

1781
02:56:47,296 --> 02:56:58,079
[SPEAKER_15]: thorough multi-month process born of community advocacy vetted by legal counsel, revised and amended before passage based on feedback, both from the community and from employees within city hall.

1782
02:57:00,739 --> 02:57:03,260
[SPEAKER_15]: I would motion to override the mayor's veto and approve this ordinance.

1783
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:11,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion of vice president Collins to override seconded by council Lazzaro.

1784
02:57:11,982 --> 02:57:13,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there further discussion by members of the council?

1785
02:57:15,840 --> 02:57:16,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1786
02:57:18,842 --> 02:57:27,690
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to thank the legal team that reviewed this material.

1787
02:57:27,950 --> 02:57:38,378
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know that it is the responsibility of our legal representation to try to preserve the city from liability in all forms.

1788
02:57:38,499 --> 02:57:42,202
[SPEAKER_32]: But the people that worked on this

1789
02:57:43,795 --> 02:57:44,956
[SPEAKER_32]: did their due diligence.

1790
02:57:45,556 --> 02:58:11,550
[SPEAKER_32]: My understanding is that it's not a risk and also that the responsibility, our responsibility and as the people spending our taxpayers funds is to spend them ethically

1791
02:58:12,934 --> 02:58:14,735
[SPEAKER_32]: Um.

1792
02:58:15,656 --> 02:58:19,819
[SPEAKER_32]: I think this is.

1793
02:58:21,260 --> 02:58:25,123
[SPEAKER_32]: This was a decision that was not made lightly, and I appreciate.

1794
02:58:25,964 --> 02:58:30,048
[SPEAKER_32]: Where the thinking for this video came from, but, um.

1795
02:58:31,128 --> 02:58:31,589
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's

1796
02:58:43,002 --> 02:59:02,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to start with how we got here today, which is that a lot of residents have felt frustrated for a very long time that their national government and their state governments haven't been standing up and representing their values and have actually, in fact, been contradicting those values.

1797
02:59:05,210 --> 02:59:16,302
[SPEAKER_09]: we've gotten to a place where that dispiritedness, that despair that people feel, has led people to ask their local governments to act.

1798
02:59:17,263 --> 02:59:19,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is a part of democracy, right?

1799
02:59:19,986 --> 02:59:25,792
[SPEAKER_09]: When it feels like other institutional players are fundamentally unaccountable,

1800
02:59:26,908 --> 02:59:34,251
[SPEAKER_09]: when it feels like they feel unaccountable to us, the people, people seek help at the next available layer.

1801
02:59:34,491 --> 02:59:38,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And municipal governments, local governments are that last line of defense.

1802
02:59:40,194 --> 02:59:47,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that this is a serious and complicated ordinance, but as I've said in the past,

1803
02:59:48,973 --> 02:59:57,080
[SPEAKER_09]: making sure that our investments align with who we are as a city is a very basic notion that we should support.

1804
02:59:57,501 --> 03:00:00,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is bigger than any one conflict.

1805
03:00:00,143 --> 03:00:04,007
[SPEAKER_09]: This is about a whole system of how we invest.

1806
03:00:05,208 --> 03:00:09,932
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to where we are today with overriding the veto,

1807
03:00:11,213 --> 03:00:17,038
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I want to respond to some points that the mayor laid out in her letter.

1808
03:00:18,299 --> 03:00:24,604
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one of which is this criticism that we didn't do our due diligence as a council.

1809
03:00:24,644 --> 03:00:36,395
[SPEAKER_09]: But the truth is, we can count at least nine rounds of review with other councilors, stakeholders, city staff, financial staff, legal staff.

1810
03:00:37,148 --> 03:00:43,011
[SPEAKER_09]: where Councilors, especially Council President Bears has been working on the text of this ordinance.

1811
03:00:43,211 --> 03:01:03,720
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what, like when this ordinance was first proposed, I had my own problems with it, but I know Council President Bears well enough to know that he addressed those concerns and that he worked hard to bring together stakeholders from all across the city to reach a draft that we could most agree on as a city.

1812
03:01:05,462 --> 03:01:19,657
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to the legal dimensions that the mayor has cited, I don't, you know, even in my own early interpretation of what that memo said, I don't think it was anywhere near comprehensive.

1813
03:01:20,777 --> 03:01:25,300
[SPEAKER_09]: in terms of its rejection of this ordinance as a problem for the city.

1814
03:01:26,681 --> 03:01:37,810
[SPEAKER_09]: It cited this Section 55B of Chapter 44 of Mass General Laws, and then didn't really explain why that meant that we couldn't pass this ordinance.

1815
03:01:38,150 --> 03:01:42,173
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you actually take a deeper look at what that law says,

1816
03:01:42,933 --> 03:01:46,615
[SPEAKER_09]: It requires the accruement of the highest amount of interest.

1817
03:01:47,115 --> 03:01:48,816
[SPEAKER_09]: But stocks aren't interest.

1818
03:01:49,716 --> 03:01:51,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Stocks are appreciations in value.

1819
03:01:52,197 --> 03:01:52,997
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not interest.

1820
03:01:54,338 --> 03:01:58,399
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you read the plain language of the statute, this ordinance does not conflict with it.

1821
03:02:01,763 --> 03:02:13,528
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been, I've worked hard with residents over the last few weeks to look at case law, both in Massachusetts and outside of Massachusetts about situations where this type of ordinance is not allowed.

1822
03:02:13,588 --> 03:02:17,409
[SPEAKER_09]: And none of that has come up in Westlaw or Alexis.

1823
03:02:17,469 --> 03:02:19,410
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the main search engines for case law.

1824
03:02:20,010 --> 03:02:22,631
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I feel pretty comfortable moving forward with this.

1825
03:02:23,212 --> 03:02:27,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, the types of investments we make as a city matter.

1826
03:02:29,274 --> 03:02:46,548
[SPEAKER_09]: making sure that we are being more creative and more true to our values when it comes to investments, you know, even with the limits that state law sets, I think is a valuable thing for our city to make the correct investments and to force ourselves to be more innovative, I think is a valuable thing for all of us.

1827
03:02:46,788 --> 03:02:50,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will vote yes to override the veto tonight.

1828
03:02:54,094 --> 03:02:54,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Chancellor Callahan.

1829
03:02:54,695 --> 03:02:57,497
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1830
03:03:00,350 --> 03:03:06,313
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, the last time she tried to convince us not to do this, it was two arguments.

1831
03:03:06,374 --> 03:03:08,555
[SPEAKER_27]: And you should really just go back and listen to what I said then.

1832
03:03:09,035 --> 03:03:14,018
[SPEAKER_27]: Two arguments, one of which was obviously unrelated to this ordinance.

1833
03:03:14,338 --> 03:03:21,962
[SPEAKER_27]: And the other one was basically saying that, oh, state law says we, as a city council, have to value profit over the values of our residents.

1834
03:03:22,423 --> 03:03:28,306
[SPEAKER_27]: And I tore that up last time because I don't take kindly to being told that I have to do that.

1835
03:03:28,386 --> 03:03:29,327
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not going to do that.

1836
03:03:30,468 --> 03:03:32,890
[SPEAKER_27]: Now we have three or four totally different reasons.

1837
03:03:33,310 --> 03:03:33,871
[SPEAKER_27]: And you know what?

1838
03:03:34,551 --> 03:03:37,554
[SPEAKER_27]: I have difficulty taking any of this seriously.

1839
03:03:38,555 --> 03:03:39,135
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

1840
03:03:39,155 --> 03:03:52,247
[SPEAKER_27]: I read through these reasons, and, you know, Councilor Collins, Councilor Tseng have gone through them specifically, but none of them really appear to have any validity.

1841
03:03:53,308 --> 03:03:55,650
[SPEAKER_27]: And in my opinion,

1842
03:03:56,797 --> 03:04:06,505
[SPEAKER_27]: We are responding to our residents who have been caused enormous amounts of pain and harm.

1843
03:04:07,065 --> 03:04:10,468
[SPEAKER_27]: We have been asked to become neutral.

1844
03:04:10,768 --> 03:04:11,709
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all.

1845
03:04:12,529 --> 03:04:16,032
[SPEAKER_27]: All we've been asked to do is to stop doing harm.

1846
03:04:17,133 --> 03:04:21,637
[SPEAKER_27]: And I understand that there are two sides to this question, and I understand that

1847
03:04:22,713 --> 03:04:28,194
[SPEAKER_27]: people feel harmed no matter what we do and that there is probably some harm being done.

1848
03:04:28,755 --> 03:04:38,017
[SPEAKER_27]: But honestly, we are being asked to be neutral when clearly some of our residents are being caused grievous harm.

1849
03:04:38,437 --> 03:04:41,138
[SPEAKER_27]: And I believe this is what our residents want.

1850
03:04:42,278 --> 03:04:45,559
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe this is the values that people in Medford share.

1851
03:04:46,759 --> 03:04:50,860
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't appreciate just being thrown a bunch of

1852
03:04:52,242 --> 03:04:54,284
[SPEAKER_27]: you know, pretty random reasons.

1853
03:04:55,505 --> 03:04:58,688
[SPEAKER_27]: So I will be voting to override the veto.

1854
03:05:04,313 --> 03:05:06,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

1855
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:09,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1856
03:05:10,901 --> 03:05:37,132
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, as much as I respect my colleagues and especially the legal background so far, I'm going to stick with the ruling whether I believe in a legal counsel or not, but the liability legally and any negative ramifications to the community as a whole until we get more information

1857
03:05:38,300 --> 03:05:44,382
[SPEAKER_25]: I couldn't support to not move past the mayor's veto.

1858
03:05:44,402 --> 03:06:02,826
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's important right now that again, like we just continued because we want something more in depth and we have two conflicting situations, whether we believe in it or not, that's not the issue again, because I know that politics is funny and

1859
03:06:03,514 --> 03:06:09,562
[SPEAKER_25]: The word will go back out that George is MAGA and I'm a Trumpster and racist.

1860
03:06:09,702 --> 03:06:18,194
[SPEAKER_25]: So but again, my my reasoning again is we were given legal response.

1861
03:06:19,042 --> 03:06:26,825
[SPEAKER_25]: that said that we would be in violation and it would cost us some legal grief in the future.

1862
03:06:26,885 --> 03:06:31,426
[SPEAKER_25]: So I could not support this until we get more information.

1863
03:06:31,466 --> 03:06:38,149
[SPEAKER_25]: So if that's the way of voting yes or no, I'll be voting no tonight.

1864
03:06:38,169 --> 03:06:39,089
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1865
03:06:39,909 --> 03:06:40,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1866
03:06:40,930 --> 03:06:46,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to say for the record that I think Councilor Scarpelli's position

1867
03:06:48,227 --> 03:06:52,189
[SPEAKER_08]: is fair given the context of what this administration has said and done, right?

1868
03:06:52,309 --> 03:06:57,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they've raised questions providing no answers.

1869
03:06:58,232 --> 03:07:02,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And that has been their process throughout this ordinance.

1870
03:07:02,634 --> 03:07:08,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it also was something that we saw in the discussion that we just had, right?

1871
03:07:08,917 --> 03:07:10,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Feels like we've gotten to a better place on the zoning.

1872
03:07:10,838 --> 03:07:13,580
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel like maybe we're close to a deal, but the answers, it's like,

1873
03:07:14,903 --> 03:07:17,645
[SPEAKER_08]: we can't just operate on feelings and vibes and questions.

1874
03:07:18,125 --> 03:07:20,427
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to operate on plans and answers.

1875
03:07:21,268 --> 03:07:23,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I get it.

1876
03:07:24,550 --> 03:07:34,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I think one of the reasons that I feel just like this whole process around this specific ordinance, the values aligned investments ordinance, like I've talked about my principles.

1877
03:07:35,619 --> 03:07:37,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I've, I've said them very clearly.

1878
03:07:37,420 --> 03:07:38,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I've, I've,

1879
03:07:39,395 --> 03:07:45,380
[SPEAKER_08]: cried in very public meeting for a couple different times about it.

1880
03:07:45,420 --> 03:07:51,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure, you know, my mom's basement's full of my tears or whatever they're saying.

1881
03:07:53,186 --> 03:08:00,752
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, like there's emotions and values and this is a meaningful thing.

1882
03:08:00,852 --> 03:08:03,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started working on this almost a year ago.

1883
03:08:05,356 --> 03:08:08,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the first five or six months, it was,

1884
03:08:10,233 --> 03:08:15,076
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to meet with this administration to get their input, to get input from legal counsel.

1885
03:08:15,556 --> 03:08:16,977
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a whole process around that.

1886
03:08:17,077 --> 03:08:18,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we got a letter back from counsel.

1887
03:08:18,758 --> 03:08:24,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I incorporated like 95% of what they sent over and KP Law said, well, here's our issues with the first draft.

1888
03:08:24,622 --> 03:08:25,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you make these changes?

1889
03:08:25,562 --> 03:08:26,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, cool, great.

1890
03:08:26,703 --> 03:08:27,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we can.

1891
03:08:28,124 --> 03:08:30,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the administration, I sent the new draft.

1892
03:08:30,065 --> 03:08:32,987
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration says, okay, we still have these more questions.

1893
03:08:33,027 --> 03:08:34,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you meet with retirement board?

1894
03:08:34,328 --> 03:08:36,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you meet with the commissions of trust funds?

1895
03:08:36,769 --> 03:08:38,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you meet with the treasurer?

1896
03:08:38,761 --> 03:08:41,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I met with all of them, and I incorporated more changes.

1897
03:08:41,123 --> 03:08:42,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we came back with another draft.

1898
03:08:43,125 --> 03:08:44,926
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we moved forward on that.

1899
03:08:44,946 --> 03:08:49,190
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration came to that meeting, and they said, well, we still have yet these issues with it.

1900
03:08:49,210 --> 03:08:53,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we've reviewed it twice, and you've incorporated most of what we've said.

1901
03:08:54,154 --> 03:08:55,175
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have more issues.

1902
03:08:55,796 --> 03:08:56,857
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have more questions.

1903
03:08:57,597 --> 03:08:59,719
[SPEAKER_08]: But at that time, I think this was August, we said,

1904
03:09:02,021 --> 03:09:03,402
[SPEAKER_08]: can you please send us two memos?

1905
03:09:03,802 --> 03:09:08,363
[SPEAKER_08]: One is a legal analysis and your legal objections, so we can look at those.

1906
03:09:09,144 --> 03:09:10,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And one was a set of policy objections.

1907
03:09:10,884 --> 03:09:26,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you just disagree with this as a policy, like you don't support this policy for political or whatever reasons, tell us that in one document, and then tell us the parts of this that you think are a problem with the law in another document.

1908
03:09:27,270 --> 03:09:28,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And we never got either of those documents.

1909
03:09:29,656 --> 03:09:34,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got an email a little bit before our meeting in September that some of us never even got.

1910
03:09:34,200 --> 03:09:35,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was frustrating.

1911
03:09:37,162 --> 03:09:47,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we voted for it to try to get back, you know, maybe some, I think that was the first reading we said, please send us some comments because it has to be advertised and then we'll have a third reading vote.

1912
03:09:48,091 --> 03:09:50,252
[SPEAKER_08]: We never got those, those, those things.

1913
03:09:50,292 --> 03:09:51,653
[SPEAKER_08]: So we took a third reading vote.

1914
03:09:53,015 --> 03:09:55,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the mayor just sends us back a veto and

1915
03:09:56,802 --> 03:10:02,607
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, okay, I disagree with this for these open questions, but it wasn't here are the things you need to change to make this work.

1916
03:10:03,027 --> 03:10:04,428
[SPEAKER_08]: It was never here are the answers.

1917
03:10:04,948 --> 03:10:07,751
[SPEAKER_08]: We have questions, we've looked into it.

1918
03:10:08,091 --> 03:10:08,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are our answers.

1919
03:10:09,472 --> 03:10:11,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what's workable on our end.

1920
03:10:12,715 --> 03:10:20,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins tabled it a few weeks ago, giving the administration yet more time to come back to us and say, here's why we vetoed.

1921
03:10:20,861 --> 03:10:22,002
[SPEAKER_08]: We've looked into the questions.

1922
03:10:22,062 --> 03:10:22,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are the answers.

1923
03:10:22,983 --> 03:10:25,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's how we think we can get to yes on this.

1924
03:10:26,841 --> 03:10:30,966
[SPEAKER_08]: no response, no communication, no answers to our questions.

1925
03:10:32,327 --> 03:10:40,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if someone, my fellow colleague here says I feel really worried about the unanswered questions that the mayor's asked, I get that.

1926
03:10:41,898 --> 03:10:44,441
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just ask what will make them answer the questions.

1927
03:10:45,382 --> 03:10:47,404
[SPEAKER_08]: And at this point, we have something before us

1928
03:10:48,152 --> 03:10:49,153
[SPEAKER_08]: We put it into the law.

1929
03:10:49,633 --> 03:10:58,361
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're really worried about it, now they'll just have to finally send us the memo we asked for three months ago that says, these are the things that we think are wrong and we think should be changed.

1930
03:10:58,441 --> 03:11:00,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Because now it's an amendment to an ordinance.

1931
03:11:00,663 --> 03:11:04,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only way that you can do that is by writing an ordinance and writing language.

1932
03:11:05,507 --> 03:11:07,849
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wish that wasn't the process.

1933
03:11:09,795 --> 03:11:14,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish the last 10 months could have been four months and they could have been collaborative.

1934
03:11:14,299 --> 03:11:20,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, it wasn't the moving of the goalposts where, you know, every time we incorporate all the changes, it's still not enough.

1935
03:11:21,785 --> 03:11:22,446
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't that.

1936
03:11:23,467 --> 03:11:25,488
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not how the administration operates.

1937
03:11:25,588 --> 03:11:26,990
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not how they chose to operate on this.

1938
03:11:27,090 --> 03:11:30,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's just a lot of last minute stuff.

1939
03:11:34,143 --> 03:11:43,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it, you know, I think one of the main reasons that I hear this administration is like well we're doing a lot of work and you know it feels like triage mode all the time because there's not enough people who work in this building.

1940
03:11:44,971 --> 03:11:46,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I that's why I ran for office right.

1941
03:11:47,634 --> 03:11:49,995
[SPEAKER_08]: But at a certain point work has to get done.

1942
03:11:50,376 --> 03:11:55,900
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're not going to fix the zoning to raise the money to hire more people to make this building work better.

1943
03:11:56,721 --> 03:12:02,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're not going to actually spend less time on this by doing it right the first time instead of having

1944
03:12:03,192 --> 03:12:10,015
[SPEAKER_08]: time after time after time after time of moving the goalposts and doing the legal analysis, right?

1945
03:12:10,055 --> 03:12:15,878
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, you can call it pennywise pound foolish, you can call it poor time management, you could call it being overwhelmed.

1946
03:12:15,918 --> 03:12:26,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's a million different explanations, and I'm sure that the folks in the mayor's office have a really different feeling and interpretation about why it's hard to run this city than maybe we do.

1947
03:12:29,144 --> 03:12:30,745
[SPEAKER_08]: But at some point, something's gotta give.

1948
03:12:31,912 --> 03:12:42,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And if these are serious questions that the administration wants to put the time into to tell us what they think the answers are, we will have an ordinance, and every ordinance can be amended.

1949
03:12:43,130 --> 03:12:44,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are here for that process.

1950
03:12:47,680 --> 03:13:02,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I think too often we end up in this position where we feel like we have to do something we don't have to do, or we're asked to do something we don't have to do because we never got the answers that we asked for, or we didn't get the resources that we needed, or the funding wasn't appropriated, or the staff aren't there.

1951
03:13:03,704 --> 03:13:06,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to give a preview, but next week we're doing the tax classification hearing.

1952
03:13:07,285 --> 03:13:14,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Something we asked for in the budget was the staffing in the assessor's office so that we could really do a homeowner residential tax exemption.

1953
03:13:15,936 --> 03:13:20,818
[SPEAKER_08]: the funding was never appropriated, the staff were never hired, and we're gonna get told next week that that's not possible to do.

1954
03:13:21,799 --> 03:13:28,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a lot more interested in building the city we know is possible than continuing to be the city of no.

1955
03:13:28,582 --> 03:13:30,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm gonna vote yes.

1956
03:13:34,405 --> 03:13:36,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

1957
03:13:38,987 --> 03:13:42,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, is there discussion by members of the public on this matter?

1958
03:13:43,169 --> 03:13:44,230
[SPEAKER_08]: There are two hands on Zoom.

1959
03:13:44,948 --> 03:13:49,331
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's anyone at the podium, we'll go to the podium first.

1960
03:13:49,371 --> 03:13:50,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

1961
03:13:50,371 --> 03:13:51,332
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have three minutes.

1962
03:13:53,513 --> 03:13:53,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

1963
03:13:56,175 --> 03:13:57,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, podium first.

1964
03:13:58,236 --> 03:13:59,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Three minutes starting now.

1965
03:13:59,177 --> 03:14:00,018
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we'll go to Zoom and back.

1966
03:14:00,618 --> 03:14:03,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

1967
03:14:04,420 --> 03:14:06,602
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am first.

1968
03:14:09,181 --> 03:14:20,566
[SPEAKER_13]: going to say that I'm sort of here on behalf of the Medford for Palestine group that has been working and advocating for this ordinance, among other groups that have been advocating for it as well.

1969
03:14:21,886 --> 03:14:31,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am submitting, I don't know what the procedure is for this, but we've put together a rebuttal in response to the mayor's litany of

1970
03:14:33,060 --> 03:14:53,190
[SPEAKER_13]: incorrect and vacuous assertions and mischaracterizations of the ordinance and the process of drafting it and explaining why it is in fact imminently practicable and why we don't see any, now this is not being presented as like a legal opinion, but

1971
03:14:54,305 --> 03:15:15,333
[SPEAKER_13]: we don't see any legal risk with the ordinance at all based on what KP law provided that they, such that they gave any sort of Kogan legal analysis of why the ordinance would be in violation of state fiduciary investment law.

1972
03:15:18,395 --> 03:15:18,575
[SPEAKER_13]: They,

1973
03:15:20,088 --> 03:15:28,475
[SPEAKER_13]: it appears that they are misreading the plain language of the mass general laws in that circumstance.

1974
03:15:28,855 --> 03:15:34,560
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just have to sort of assume and infer what they're trying to say because they didn't actually say anything.

1975
03:15:35,160 --> 03:15:36,321
[SPEAKER_13]: That wasn't just conclusory.

1976
03:15:36,882 --> 03:15:41,826
[SPEAKER_13]: So we took our best guess at what they were trying to say and put a response to it.

1977
03:15:41,846 --> 03:15:42,406
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm submitting this,

1978
03:15:43,832 --> 03:15:47,153
[SPEAKER_13]: City Council, as I don't know, evidence, record, whatever you want to call it.

1979
03:15:49,494 --> 03:16:13,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I will also say that, you know, from my own personal perspective, again, this is another example of, and Councilors, you have gone over this many times so far, this last few months, of the Mayor's Office acting in patently bad faith, not even attempting to provide the veneer of

1980
03:16:13,865 --> 03:16:21,370
[SPEAKER_13]: of collaborative work in governance that is needed from someone, needed from an office in that position.

1981
03:16:22,091 --> 03:16:41,304
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is beyond frustrating that we are at this point where we have to constantly argue against this deluge of gish gallop nonsense to just get minimal basic things done that other cities have no problem getting done.

1982
03:16:41,964 --> 03:16:43,025
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crazy.

1983
03:16:43,916 --> 03:16:45,117
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know what?

1984
03:16:46,318 --> 03:16:50,680
[SPEAKER_13]: The last election showed that the city's sick of it.

1985
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:51,701
[SPEAKER_13]: This is garbage.

1986
03:16:52,421 --> 03:16:58,245
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll just say that the mayor's on a pip and it isn't looking good for her for next year.

1987
03:16:58,485 --> 03:17:01,147
[SPEAKER_13]: So think about that.

1988
03:17:01,167 --> 03:17:07,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

1989
03:17:07,110 --> 03:17:09,352
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Zachary Turcotte on Zoom.

1990
03:17:09,512 --> 03:17:11,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

1991
03:17:12,402 --> 03:17:14,284
[SPEAKER_35]: Zachary Chertok, 5 Almond Street.

1992
03:17:14,604 --> 03:17:22,111
[SPEAKER_35]: The issue with this ordinance remains is from the first reading that the structure and language of the ordinance are where the problems lie regardless of the intent of the ordinance.

1993
03:17:22,852 --> 03:17:29,839
[SPEAKER_35]: It is poorly engineered policy in its current form as reviewed by financial policy, State Department and legal experts even from within my own network.

1994
03:17:30,479 --> 03:17:36,845
[SPEAKER_35]: The policy needs to be better structured for accountability, evaluation, liability and risk management and enforcement towards its intent.

1995
03:17:37,566 --> 03:17:44,688
[SPEAKER_35]: This is not about asking the council to be neutral, but to put the work into engineer actionable policy that can be managed now and into the future for the city.

1996
03:17:45,349 --> 03:17:54,372
[SPEAKER_35]: The council has been asked to address very specific concerns and what has been returned has been fly by revisions without in depth action toward addressing very real concerns and liabilities.

1997
03:17:55,132 --> 03:18:01,634
[SPEAKER_35]: Expert review and draft revision was submitted to the council and made public and is on public record as such prior to the first reading.

1998
03:18:02,114 --> 03:18:12,896
[SPEAKER_35]: And the mayor's concerns along with those from KP Law further reinforced those concerns by the third reading, not to mention those presented from the city's finance team read aloud by Councilor Scarpelli at the time of the first reading.

1999
03:18:13,517 --> 03:18:15,837
[SPEAKER_35]: The problem lies with the poor engineering of the policy.

2000
03:18:16,417 --> 03:18:23,059
[SPEAKER_35]: It is the council's job to engineer the policy adequately in response to the critique and not to look for someone else to whom to pass the buck.

2001
03:18:23,779 --> 03:18:32,827
[SPEAKER_35]: I should also note that should the veto be overridden without addressing the real implications of the noted issues, the citizenry has further options to ensure that the policy is held to account.

2002
03:18:33,588 --> 03:18:38,673
[SPEAKER_35]: As for collaboration, this ordinance has not so reflected the stated effort by the council.

2003
03:18:38,853 --> 03:18:39,293
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2004
03:18:41,936 --> 03:18:42,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

2005
03:18:42,817 --> 03:18:43,838
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go back to the podium.

2006
03:18:44,018 --> 03:18:45,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

2007
03:18:45,219 --> 03:18:46,260
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

2008
03:18:48,028 --> 03:18:48,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?

2009
03:18:48,448 --> 03:18:49,309
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my first time doing this.

2010
03:18:49,609 --> 03:18:51,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Will Duffy for First Street.

2011
03:18:51,850 --> 03:18:52,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep it brief.

2012
03:18:53,550 --> 03:18:56,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm super proud of this ordinance that the council wrote.

2013
03:18:57,452 --> 03:19:02,834
[SPEAKER_06]: As a resident, I felt like really, really represented when I heard about it being passed initially in June.

2014
03:19:03,494 --> 03:19:06,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I was extremely disappointed to hear that the mayor vetoed it.

2015
03:19:07,395 --> 03:19:08,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I called the mayor.

2016
03:19:08,436 --> 03:19:09,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I emailed the mayor.

2017
03:19:09,276 --> 03:19:10,477
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife emailed the mayor.

2018
03:19:12,197 --> 03:19:13,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Never really got a response from her.

2019
03:19:14,796 --> 03:19:19,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would really, really look favorably upon the council overriding this veto.

2020
03:19:19,777 --> 03:19:27,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just really, really proud of our city council for writing it, passing it, and hopefully potentially overriding it tonight, overriding the veto part of it.

2021
03:19:29,459 --> 03:19:30,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2022
03:19:32,619 --> 03:19:36,260
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two folks who haven't spoken yet on Zoom.

2023
03:19:36,280 --> 03:19:39,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone else in the chamber who hasn't spoken yet who'd like to speak?

2024
03:19:39,721 --> 03:19:41,601
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's just stretching.

2025
03:19:43,872 --> 03:19:46,092
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll go to Munir Germanus.

2026
03:19:46,132 --> 03:19:47,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

2027
03:19:47,753 --> 03:19:48,353
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

2028
03:19:51,193 --> 03:19:54,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Munir Germanus, I live at 3 Summit Road.

2029
03:19:55,654 --> 03:20:12,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to express my sincere appreciation of the work of the city council, or the transparent work of the city council, as opposed to the really opaque work of the administration.

2030
03:20:13,971 --> 03:20:21,217
[SPEAKER_01]: The tactics that the administration has used are very clear.

2031
03:20:21,237 --> 03:20:24,360
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing that's transparent about it.

2032
03:20:26,102 --> 03:20:40,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the last election showed that the majority of folks in Medford support this council because they support our values and they stand behind these values.

2033
03:20:41,166 --> 03:20:50,009
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fully, fully appreciate your work, and I recommend that you override this veto.

2034
03:20:51,289 --> 03:21:04,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, at the same time, tried to get the mayor to communicate why she vetoed this, and I showed my sincere displeasure at her veto.

2035
03:21:06,274 --> 03:21:07,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I got silence.

2036
03:21:09,387 --> 03:21:18,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do urge each and every member of this council, each and every member of this council to override this veto.

2037
03:21:18,192 --> 03:21:18,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2038
03:21:20,413 --> 03:21:21,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your comment.

2039
03:21:24,535 --> 03:21:26,576
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Genesis Perez on Zoom.

2040
03:21:26,616 --> 03:21:28,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Genesis, name and address for the record.

2041
03:21:28,037 --> 03:21:28,757
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

2042
03:21:29,958 --> 03:21:33,619
[SPEAKER_33]: Hello, my name is Genesis Perez, and I'm at 229 Main Street.

2043
03:21:34,520 --> 03:21:38,262
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just want to express my disappointment with the mayor.

2044
03:21:39,220 --> 03:21:41,461
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, and her veto of this ordinance.

2045
03:21:41,521 --> 03:21:48,223
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm very much in support of this ordinance, and I'm thankful for all the work that you're doing there on the council.

2046
03:21:49,143 --> 03:21:58,346
[SPEAKER_33]: And, um, yeah, I just wanted to show my support and gratitude to you all and urge you to all vote to override the veto.

2047
03:21:58,666 --> 03:21:59,366
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you very much.

2048
03:21:59,386 --> 03:22:02,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

2049
03:22:03,381 --> 03:22:10,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone either in person or on Zoom who would like to speak on this who hasn't spoken yet?

2050
03:22:10,288 --> 03:22:16,855
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, seeing none, we'll go back to the podium.

2051
03:22:16,875 --> 03:22:18,797
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Micah for a minute.

2052
03:22:22,061 --> 03:22:22,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Micah Castleman, 499 Main Street.

2053
03:22:24,207 --> 03:22:31,833
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to point out that even tonight we heard detractors talk or a detractor talk about the ordinance.

2054
03:22:32,273 --> 03:22:40,939
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you listen to what they're saying beyond their fancy, beyond a lot of like fancy jargon and words, and you know, I don't, I'm just a simple city council speaker.

2055
03:22:40,979 --> 03:22:45,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a network of financial experts at my beck and call to do analysis for me.

2056
03:22:45,162 --> 03:22:47,763
[SPEAKER_13]: It was empty.

2057
03:22:47,803 --> 03:22:48,364
[SPEAKER_13]: It was hollow.

2058
03:22:48,484 --> 03:22:49,685
[SPEAKER_13]: It was completely vapid.

2059
03:22:50,225 --> 03:22:52,667
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no specificity, no granularity.

2060
03:22:53,222 --> 03:22:59,969
[SPEAKER_13]: nothing actionable, nothing with focus, nothing that we can actually take and say, oh, that's what you think is actually wrong.

2061
03:23:00,490 --> 03:23:09,058
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's because every time the specifics get brought up, such as, oh, it wasn't amended between the first and third reading,

2062
03:23:11,715 --> 03:23:18,619
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you talking, like it was amended between the first time it was introduced to the chambers and when it was brought for a vote.

2063
03:23:19,120 --> 03:23:31,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Significantly, substantially amended after consulting with residents and experts and putting in practicability, addressing practicability concerns.

2064
03:23:33,369 --> 03:23:49,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, if you want to say that there's something wrong with this ordinance or really with any sort of ordinance or policy put forward by the council, all that I'm asking is you specificity actually give something actionable.

2065
03:23:49,813 --> 03:23:55,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Just saying no conclusively for the sake of saying no is worthless.

2066
03:23:56,034 --> 03:23:56,934
[SPEAKER_13]: It's garbage.

2067
03:23:57,514 --> 03:23:57,874
Thank you.

2068
03:23:59,895 --> 03:24:00,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2069
03:24:02,962 --> 03:24:05,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any further comment by members of the public on this item?

2070
03:24:10,528 --> 03:24:23,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to override the Mayor's veto of the values aligned local investments ordinance.

2071
03:24:24,660 --> 03:24:25,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2072
03:24:27,962 --> 03:24:28,823
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan.

2073
03:24:29,123 --> 03:24:29,243
Yes.

2074
03:24:30,204 --> 03:24:31,205
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

03:24:32,645 --> 03:24:33,405
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2076
03:24:33,425 --> 03:24:33,485
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2077
03:24:35,006 --> 03:24:35,767
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming.

2078
03:24:36,207 --> 03:24:36,567
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2079
03:24:37,988 --> 03:24:38,908
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2080
03:24:38,928 --> 03:24:38,988
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2081
03:24:40,509 --> 03:24:41,270
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Tseng.

2082
03:24:41,290 --> 03:24:41,350
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2083
03:24:42,650 --> 03:24:43,391
[SPEAKER_08]: President Piers.

2084
03:24:43,671 --> 03:24:46,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, 16 affirmative, one of the negative, the motion passes.

2085
03:24:47,553 --> 03:24:54,397
[SPEAKER_08]: All the rights require two thirds majority, six one is higher than two thirds.

2086
03:24:55,952 --> 03:24:58,773
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, last agenda item, public participation.

2087
03:24:58,793 --> 03:25:03,334
[SPEAKER_08]: To participate outside of Zoom, please email arlicio at medford-ma.gov.

2088
03:25:03,914 --> 03:25:08,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone who'd like to speak for three minutes on an issue of import to them?

2089
03:25:09,735 --> 03:25:11,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Ellen, name and address for the record, please.

2090
03:25:11,376 --> 03:25:11,816
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

2091
03:25:12,036 --> 03:25:14,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street.

2092
03:25:16,157 --> 03:25:17,377
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say how

2093
03:25:19,465 --> 03:25:22,366
[SPEAKER_14]: how impressed and how proud I am of the city council.

2094
03:25:23,267 --> 03:25:44,477
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel, I don't have the right words to say it, but the amount of work and due diligence and patience and listening that you guys do in support of the things we all care about is, I'm so grateful for it and I'm so impressed by it and I'm honored to have worked

2095
03:25:45,497 --> 03:25:50,618
[SPEAKER_14]: on most of your reelection campaigns, and the community has really spoken.

2096
03:25:50,638 --> 03:25:56,600
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope you feel the love and support and appreciation that we feel for all of you.

2097
03:25:57,320 --> 03:25:57,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2098
03:25:58,781 --> 03:25:59,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2099
03:25:59,201 --> 03:26:05,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, three minutes.

2100
03:26:05,963 --> 03:26:07,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's me again.

2101
03:26:07,623 --> 03:26:08,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

2102
03:26:08,623 --> 03:26:09,324
[SPEAKER_13]: You're doing good tonight.

2103
03:26:09,584 --> 03:26:14,245
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been sworn once, been relatively kind,

2104
03:26:17,713 --> 03:26:41,161
[SPEAKER_13]: I am here yet again because another city council meeting has gone by and the mayor has continued to completely fail to protect citizens or acknowledge the threat to residents of the city that ICE and federal overreach poses in their flagrantly unlawful, illegal, unchecked behavior.

2105
03:26:42,420 --> 03:26:51,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a week ago, we saw in Fitchburg, a man in having a seizure and ripped out of his car while he was holding his child.

2106
03:26:52,746 --> 03:27:03,472
[SPEAKER_13]: And the cop there was yelling at bystanders rather than doing anything to protect the people he was charged with protecting, buck wild.

2107
03:27:03,973 --> 03:27:09,016
[SPEAKER_13]: What's even crazier to me though, is that not even that the mayor's office hasn't done

2108
03:27:10,172 --> 03:27:16,854
[SPEAKER_13]: anything, but again, they continue to not even acknowledge that this is one of the biggest things harming our community right now.

2109
03:27:17,414 --> 03:27:18,314
[SPEAKER_13]: It's unacceptable.

2110
03:27:18,734 --> 03:27:20,295
[SPEAKER_13]: It's absolutely unacceptable.

2111
03:27:21,795 --> 03:27:24,676
[SPEAKER_13]: People are still being abducted from off the street.

2112
03:27:26,016 --> 03:27:33,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Children, citizens even, not that that actually matters, like their due process is being denied.

2113
03:27:35,099 --> 03:27:38,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Again and again, what they are doing has been found to be illegal.

2114
03:27:40,297 --> 03:27:53,282
[SPEAKER_13]: And the worst thing is, is that we could do something, the mayor could do something, law enforcement here could try and do something, but they might have to step into ambiguous gray areas of law.

2115
03:27:53,842 --> 03:27:57,003
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, what the hell is happening on the other side?

2116
03:27:57,703 --> 03:28:01,825
[SPEAKER_13]: If you cannot even risk a little bit of ambiguity,

2117
03:28:03,957 --> 03:28:08,760
[SPEAKER_13]: to protect the residents of the city that you are charged to protect, then what's your point?

2118
03:28:09,340 --> 03:28:10,160
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the point of you?

2119
03:28:11,241 --> 03:28:13,562
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm here again to rant about this.

2120
03:28:13,582 --> 03:28:15,163
[SPEAKER_13]: I will continue ranting about this.

2121
03:28:15,663 --> 03:28:20,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, the mayor is on a performance improvement plan.

2122
03:28:20,386 --> 03:28:26,529
[SPEAKER_13]: So this would be something that could show improvement.

2123
03:28:27,390 --> 03:28:33,373
[SPEAKER_13]: She wants a KPI to target, protecting the residents of this city is one of them.

2124
03:28:34,885 --> 03:28:35,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2125
03:28:37,267 --> 03:28:37,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

2126
03:28:38,007 --> 03:28:43,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do just want to note that, okay, I don't know.

2127
03:28:44,012 --> 03:28:51,758
[SPEAKER_08]: It, you know, we saw a video in Fitchburg when I was, something that I woke up to last week was a video here, someone on one of our streets.

2128
03:28:52,278 --> 03:29:02,445
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and just neighbors trying to talk to their other neighbors to see if they can figure out who this person was so they could try to tell this person's family.

2129
03:29:03,326 --> 03:29:03,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's here.

2130
03:29:05,361 --> 03:29:22,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really happy Wednesday morning, and another another morning last week I was feeling devastated and powerless and really wishing that, you know, some of the calls that this Council has made for more action at this local level would would be heeded and heard by our city government.

2131
03:29:22,595 --> 03:29:25,617
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, Councilor Callahan.

2132
03:29:28,180 --> 03:29:28,520
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2133
03:29:29,520 --> 03:29:31,201
[SPEAKER_27]: President Bearss, you did steal my thunder.

2134
03:29:31,881 --> 03:29:48,845
[SPEAKER_27]: Last week, a resident that I have known for many, many years reached out to me early in the morning with a video that he had made himself of someone being abducted by ICE right outside his door.

2135
03:29:51,763 --> 03:29:58,225
[SPEAKER_27]: Upon seeing that they were being videoed, the ICE agents covered their faces with masks.

2136
03:29:59,766 --> 03:30:02,687
[SPEAKER_27]: The entire video was very disturbing to see.

2137
03:30:02,707 --> 03:30:09,990
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have a solution.

2138
03:30:12,537 --> 03:30:30,042
[SPEAKER_27]: I do think that more communications, I think we could, we clearly need a little bit more follow-up because we passed an ordinance that we should be informed every two weeks from our police chief about any ICE activity here in Medford.

2139
03:30:30,082 --> 03:30:37,564
[SPEAKER_27]: And I do not recollect being informed here in these public meetings, which I believe is what was supposed to happen.

2140
03:30:38,124 --> 03:30:39,885
[SPEAKER_27]: I just want to say for anyone listening,

2141
03:30:42,436 --> 03:30:43,456
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll only speak for myself.

2142
03:30:43,476 --> 03:30:45,557
[SPEAKER_27]: I am open to ideas.

2143
03:30:45,697 --> 03:30:52,898
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm open to ideas of what the city council could do, of what the mayor or the administration or the police could do.

2144
03:30:52,918 --> 03:31:05,461
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, we have come up with a number of things and done those things, but we are always really open to listening.

2145
03:31:05,701 --> 03:31:06,001
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2146
03:31:08,502 --> 03:31:09,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And Councilor Kelly and Councilor Lazzaro.

2147
03:31:11,944 --> 03:31:12,404
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2148
03:31:12,945 --> 03:31:13,705
[SPEAKER_32]: Point of information.

2149
03:31:13,745 --> 03:31:26,051
[SPEAKER_32]: Next Wednesday week from today, we will have a public health and Community Safety Committee meeting at six o'clock, where the police chief who had been on a leap of absence for personal reasons for good.

2150
03:31:26,071 --> 03:31:28,813
[SPEAKER_32]: Few months quite a while.

2151
03:31:29,513 --> 03:31:30,974
[SPEAKER_32]: He is now returned.

2152
03:31:31,854 --> 03:31:32,755
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, he will be

2153
03:31:41,917 --> 03:31:45,018
[SPEAKER_32]: the Medford Police Department is aware of regarding ICE.

2154
03:31:47,559 --> 03:31:57,963
[SPEAKER_32]: And I look forward to getting more frequent updates, even if the report is we are not aware of ICE activity because we are not participating in ICE activity.

2155
03:32:00,084 --> 03:32:05,746
[SPEAKER_32]: The more dialogue we can have with our police department and accountability that we can maintain, the better.

2156
03:32:08,026 --> 03:32:09,527
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's coming up next week.

2157
03:32:10,488 --> 03:32:16,893
[SPEAKER_32]: And I do think that continuing dialogue with our permanent police chief is good.

2158
03:32:16,953 --> 03:32:24,398
[SPEAKER_32]: We had interim Chief Covino was great as well, but we weren't able to keep up that consistent communication.

2159
03:32:24,999 --> 03:32:29,302
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm looking forward to Chief Buckley being back and being able to talk about that.

2160
03:32:29,562 --> 03:32:31,143
[SPEAKER_32]: I saw the video too, it's really horrible.

2161
03:32:32,104 --> 03:32:33,425
[SPEAKER_32]: It was a Medford resident.

2162
03:32:33,565 --> 03:32:36,807
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not, it's very unsettling.

2163
03:32:38,522 --> 03:32:42,243
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you, Micah, again for speaking up.

2164
03:32:44,724 --> 03:32:45,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2165
03:32:46,164 --> 03:32:47,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further public comment?

2166
03:32:47,685 --> 03:32:47,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy?

2167
03:32:47,825 --> 03:32:47,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2168
03:32:49,205 --> 03:32:49,505
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2169
03:32:49,525 --> 03:32:51,026
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no one on Zoom, so we'll go to you.

2170
03:32:51,626 --> 03:32:52,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

2171
03:32:52,846 --> 03:32:53,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have three minutes.

2172
03:32:57,128 --> 03:32:57,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

2173
03:32:58,008 --> 03:33:01,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Castagnetti, Cushion Street, East Mayfair, Mass.

2174
03:33:02,069 --> 03:33:04,610
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of stuff going on here.

2175
03:33:05,030 --> 03:33:07,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't want to age off all the tea in China.

2176
03:33:09,647 --> 03:33:10,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.

2177
03:33:12,028 --> 03:33:17,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the old adage is true, you cannot satisfy all the people, especially at one particular time.

2178
03:33:19,210 --> 03:33:29,912
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, first, I should probably congratulations to you councillors on the re-election.

2179
03:33:31,193 --> 03:33:34,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope it was a good and fair election.

2180
03:33:35,074 --> 03:33:38,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, also special thanks to all the

2181
03:33:39,685 --> 03:33:41,725
[SPEAKER_10]: politician wannabes who ran.

2182
03:33:42,626 --> 03:33:45,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep the faith because our country needs you.

2183
03:33:45,246 --> 03:33:59,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Number three, charter review also passed with term limits, but it would be better still if we term limited the Congress and the Senate and more in Washington, D.C., in our opinion.

2184
03:34:01,729 --> 03:34:07,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Was this meeting scheduled for Tuesday night, last night on the 11th originally?

2185
03:34:08,827 --> 03:34:09,507
[SPEAKER_08]: months ago.

2186
03:34:09,527 --> 03:34:12,268
[SPEAKER_10]: It was originally originally way back.

2187
03:34:12,568 --> 03:34:15,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was changed because of Veterans Day six months ago.

2188
03:34:15,309 --> 03:34:15,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2189
03:34:17,150 --> 03:34:17,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2190
03:34:18,110 --> 03:34:21,371
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyways, I wanted to say happy Veterans Night after.

2191
03:34:23,592 --> 03:34:29,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it wasn't for our veterans from World War Two, we'd be speaking German here if we'd be alive at all.

2192
03:34:31,095 --> 03:34:36,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Japanese on the West Coast, or maybe Spanish, up to the man based in Dixon line.

2193
03:34:37,537 --> 03:34:38,157
[SPEAKER_10]: The veterans

2194
03:34:39,773 --> 03:34:41,074
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not respected enough.

2195
03:34:42,975 --> 03:34:45,097
[SPEAKER_10]: They tried to throw me in Vietnam back in 68.

2196
03:34:45,277 --> 03:34:49,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen my friends come back in body bags from Haines Square.

2197
03:34:50,300 --> 03:34:52,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Another one coming back missing an arm and a leg.

2198
03:34:53,202 --> 03:34:56,404
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw around Mr. Marcelino, Barry Park.

2199
03:34:58,225 --> 03:34:59,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just horrible.

2200
03:35:00,106 --> 03:35:04,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine if you walked a half mile in their shoes, what they did.

2201
03:35:04,669 --> 03:35:07,011
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not respected enough.

2202
03:35:07,472 --> 03:35:09,974
[SPEAKER_10]: So a thank you is not good enough, in my opinion.

2203
03:35:10,314 --> 03:35:13,956
[SPEAKER_10]: A heartfelt prayer is what I like to say to these soldiers.

2204
03:35:16,518 --> 03:35:17,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Please hear my prayer.

2205
03:35:19,059 --> 03:35:30,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Almighty God, creator of heaven, earth, all sentient beings, and more, please get me and all of us to be and do the best that we can, now, always, forever and ever, in our quest for eternal, blissful peace.

2206
03:35:32,007 --> 03:35:32,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Amen.

2207
03:35:32,548 --> 03:35:34,409
[SPEAKER_10]: God help them, wherever they are.

2208
03:35:36,115 --> 03:35:44,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And hooray, I think I've seen some holiday lights coming back from the VFW of Veterans Party on Sunday night along the footbridge in the Mystic River.

2209
03:35:45,803 --> 03:35:46,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray.

2210
03:35:50,507 --> 03:35:51,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comment.

2211
03:35:57,892 --> 03:35:58,173
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2212
03:35:58,553 --> 03:36:00,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone else who'd like to speak during public comment?

2213
03:36:03,717 --> 03:36:04,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2214
03:36:06,355 --> 03:36:13,017
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion adjourned by councillor everyone, councillors, councillor Lazzaro seconded by councillor Scarpelli.

2215

[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2216
03:36:18,039 --> 03:36:19,600
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it got to me at the same time.
