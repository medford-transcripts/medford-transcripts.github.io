6
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:56,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicole works for everyone in the city of Method, and I think there's a big emphasis on children and students.

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Nicole, thank you for coming on the show.

[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna get right into it, Nicole.

12
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:05,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's do it.

13
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,945

00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:11,646
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you all about?

00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:13,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what am I all about?

17
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a current school committee member here in Medford.

18
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:20,710
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just finishing up my first term, running for my second term for re-election.

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,671
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mom.

20
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:23,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two children.

21
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:25,552
[SPEAKER_00]: One graduated from Medford High this year.

22
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:28,494
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a rising 10th grader.

23
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:33,284
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a very, very busy person.

24
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:33,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

25
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew up in Medford.

26
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,307
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Medford High.

27
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:39,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked for Medford Public Schools in the past as a paraprofessional.

28
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work for a neighboring district.

29
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:45,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the administrative assistant for the director and assistant director of special ed.

30
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:46,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

31
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:46,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

32
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:47,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

33
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:48,179
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great stuff.

34
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:49,347
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

35
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:52,750
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also a very busy person.

36
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:53,812
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.

37
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,876
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now we'll get into what it's all about, what's going on.

38
00:01:57,976 --> 00:01:58,657
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let's do it.

39
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:02,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a couple of reasons, just why you're seeking re-election.

40
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:04,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's more work to do.

41
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:05,765
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more work to do.

42
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:06,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love my job.

43
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:10,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I love working for the school committee.

44
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I love representing this city.

45
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:15,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't represent one group or one person.

46
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to City Hall for myself.

47
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So I represent every citizen, and that makes me really proud.

48
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:27,007
[SPEAKER_00]: And to think that I can be the voice of our students and our staff, that means everything to me.

49
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:31,011
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust them with my children, and I'm happy that they trust me.

50
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do.

51
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

52
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take that for granted at all.

53
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:37,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't.

54
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's the type of person you are.

55
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:39,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

56
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:41,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we love having you on the show.

57
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:41,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

58
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:49,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you want to share some of your, you know, what you would, what you believe to be past accomplishments?

59
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:50,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

60
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:52,341
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done a lot, but you want to fill us in?

61
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:55,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, school committee never sleeps, I can tell you that.

62
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,886
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on 24-7.

63
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,949
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just, you know, showing up for a couple of meetings a month.

64
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,451
[SPEAKER_00]: You are really on all the time.

65
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:05,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the thing that I'm probably most proud of is that I won.

66
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:10,200
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grassroots single person, you know, running for office.

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not affiliated with any groups.

68
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:27,331
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I run everything on my own my social media I have a treasurer but besides that I don't have a campaign manager and you know I'm my own manager I guess basically a one-woman show that's it

69
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for everybody that helps me.

70
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:36,395
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have an amazing village in Medford, and I'm grateful for every single person.

71
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:40,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Working on the school committee, you know, obviously budget season is very difficult.

72
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:45,097
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, last year especially, it was very difficult.

73
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:49,318
[SPEAKER_00]: This year was definitely easier with the override.

74
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:51,258
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, grateful to keep those jobs.

75
00:03:54,595 --> 00:04:00,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading up to my run for election, I worked very closely with the school committee before even running for office.

76
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:06,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped them revise the building and intervention policy, and I was really, really proud of that.

77
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:14,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was involved in hiring our new principal, which is Monta Cabral, so I was on that search committee, too, and I'm proud of that.

78
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:17,439
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very proud of you.

79
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bullying, that needed to be revised.

80
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:21,863
[SPEAKER_01]: And you did a great job.

81
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:22,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

82
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:23,064
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.

83
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,065
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for every child.

84
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:24,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

85
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:25,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Every child.

86
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:26,807
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot going on.

87
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:27,628
[SPEAKER_01]: There really was.

88
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:40,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you feel was the school committee's most important action or decision in the past

89
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:42,578
[SPEAKER_01]: term.

90
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:48,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything going on?

91
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:53,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything going on?

92
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:55,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, actions that you took.

93
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:56,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Actions that we took, all right.

94
00:04:56,787 --> 00:05:00,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think budget, money is probably the most important thing, right?

95
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the override was huge.

96
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:05,933
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that we're going to use that money wisely.

97
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:12,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the most important thing to me in talking about the budget and the override.

98
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure the money that we do have we were using properly.

99
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:19,466
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to see that the money is going where it said it's going.

100
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes me happy.

101
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:30,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I think transitioning to a new superintendent after Dr. Evey left and now transitioning to our interim superintendent.

102
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:33,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Galussi.

103
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:38,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year we'll, you know, search for a new one or keep Dr. Galussi, however that turns out.

104
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:40,127
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think obviously a new Meffitt High building.

105
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:43,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, I mean, so there's a lot of issues ongoing.

106
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:46,188
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on and I'd like to stay apart and see everything through.

107
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:46,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.

108
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,069
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really end.

109
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:49,809
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's a continuation.

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,071
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a continuation.

111
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:52,571
[SPEAKER_01]: More work.

112
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:53,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

113
00:05:54,772 --> 00:06:00,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell our audience what is your number one issue, if you have a number one issue?

114
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:02,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a number one issue.

115
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,257
[SPEAKER_01]: The school committee will have to deal with.

116
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:18,591
[SPEAKER_00]: well i mean next election yeah so i would i would definitely say you know transitioning to a new superintendent or you know or or sticking with dr galusi who's been doing a great job proud of her um i really would love to

117
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:22,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Showcase our you know our highlights here at method high.

118
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:41,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the method vocational technical high school is really the CTE program is a crown jewel here It really really is I'm lucky enough that both of my kids are Voki's Jacqueline was in the culinary program when she was here and Dominic is accepted to the electrical program, and I'm really proud of that and I think that it's

119
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:47,224
[SPEAKER_00]: important to note that you can be a vocational student and still go to college.

120
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:50,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's really a myth that needs to be busted.

121
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:52,107
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really does.

122
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,007
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.

123
00:06:53,027 --> 00:07:00,831
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and my daughter's heading off to college and she was in culinary, you know, um, and I also think that I would really love to see a lot more Mustang pride come back.

124
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:08,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I think old school, you know, you've, you've lived in Medford, you went to Medford high, you have that Mustang pride in you.

125
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,676
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember the song as everybody came in on,

126
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:34,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanksgiving morning or the pep rally and I think that we've lost some of that You know, I would love to see us have more pride, you know in our sports, you know in the athletic department We have a new athletic director coming in which is great And I definitely think Obviously academics is has to be a top priority and I think you know a new building whether you know we

127
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:41,794
[SPEAKER_00]: revamp the whole place or, you know, whatever, but that's to be seen.

128
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:43,556
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that we need to have pride here.

129
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Be proud of where you come from.

130
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:48,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, the sports teams.

131
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:52,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, both my, yes, yes.

132
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a bunch of those GBL games.

133
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

134
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:58,659
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to every home football game I was at.

135
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,601
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter played for the softball team.

136
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:02,762
[SPEAKER_00]: She was on varsity.

137
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:08,346
[SPEAKER_00]: My son was junior varsity and called up for varsity and he was at, you know, that GBL winning games.

138
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so great to watch the energy.

139
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:17,894
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that people that, you know, from the city or other parents come to watch the games of other students that are just excited.

140
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we really need to get back into that.

141
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:21,577
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's huge.

142
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:23,819
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big part of what's going on in high school.

143
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:24,520
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,723
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in school is citywide.

145
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:30,646
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just for people who have kids at school.

146
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:31,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

147
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:32,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.

148
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:32,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

149
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:34,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good point.

150
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,572
[SPEAKER_01]: So next question.

151
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:44,098
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is working cohesively with your fellow

152
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,904
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, committee members, you know, now and in the future.

153
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:49,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

154
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:50,205
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see?

155
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:51,447
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you feel?

156
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:54,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really feel like no one should come to City Hall for themselves.

157
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we work for the citizens.

158
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,664
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't work for the five or 7,000 people that vote for you.

159
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:04,427
[SPEAKER_00]: You work for all citizens.

160
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:07,769
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, 50, 60,000 citizens here in Medford.

161
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,151
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I want to represent them all, you know, I really do.

162
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:22,400
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it means, you know, stopping and talking everywhere I am, which happens everywhere you go, you know, you know, it's funny, you know, I'll go out with girlfriends and people will be like, oh, there she goes.

163
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,881
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's true, it's true.

164
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:27,282
[SPEAKER_00]: People want your attention and I think people want to be heard.

165
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:35,687
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can be that listening ear for someone to say, this happened to me or I'm really excited about this, I'm all for it.

166
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's really important.

167
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:43,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, working with our fellow members, the mayor, the superintendent, our assistant superintendents.

168
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:47,412
[SPEAKER_00]: All the department heads the directors it is important.

169
00:09:47,452 --> 00:10:06,420
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important that the staff is heard The teachers are heard the students the families, you know I'm I I think really you don't walk into City Hall for yourself and if you walk into City Hall as an elected official and you are there for yourself then You're not there for the right reasons You know

170
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:10,277
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great answer.

171
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's coming from your heart.

172
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:13,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

173
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:18,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how much that means, because I'm not going to get into too much here.

174
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a politician.

175
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a mom.

176
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,363
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely not a politician.

177
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:23,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a politician.

178
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:24,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Just with that answer alone.

179
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:25,264
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a politician.

180
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:26,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mom that wanted to see change.

181
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:29,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do represent the whole city.

182
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is

183
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:32,107
[SPEAKER_01]: So important.

184
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:33,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear people talk.

185
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:35,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear everybody's opinions.

186
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,873
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what side of the aisle you're on, I think that we need to really meet in the middle.

187
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,194
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what brings community.

188
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:43,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

189
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

190
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:47,979
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, well, that question to me, that was like, wow.

191
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:48,479
Oh.

192
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,860
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was wow.

193
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,721
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to wow you, John.

194
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:51,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you did.

195
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:54,183
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great answer.

196
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:55,584
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't hear that often.

197
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:56,485
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't.

198
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,225
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my truth.

199
00:10:58,286 --> 00:10:58,907
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my truth.

200
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:15,440
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it i really don't and i'm sure the audience is going to appreciate it that that's very very important um uh all right so now let's get into the money stuff all right let's get a question about that all right i know no one wants to talk about it

201
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more of it.

202
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:21,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish the city had more of it.

203
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:22,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

204
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:22,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

205
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:33,194
[SPEAKER_01]: The status, you know, the override, the $7 million, is there any way you can give us a little bit of the status of, you know, what happened?

206
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:34,555
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened with that money?

207
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:34,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

208
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,096
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing with it?

209
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:37,597
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in my bank account.

210
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:39,359
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not, we're not out to dinner with it.

211
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,320
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.

212
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no.

213
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,343
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, well obviously, uh,

214
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,593
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we've really needed to work harder on maintenance, especially of our buildings.

215
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,154
[SPEAKER_00]: That has definitely lacked.

216
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:55,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to think things are getting fixed.

217
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,317
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important.

218
00:11:57,158 --> 00:12:00,560
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor has been great in helping us out, obviously, with funds.

219
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,022
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the biggest part of the city budget.

220
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:04,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big deal.

221
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:08,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So override, we just passed the teacher's contract.

222
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not on the negotiating team, but the teacher's contract was finalized.

223
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:15,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they said in three months, which is unheard of.

224
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:16,876
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a great job.

225
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:17,796
[SPEAKER_00]: They really did.

226
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:21,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously a lot of work goes into that.

227
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm grateful for the negotiating team in that aspect.

228
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:30,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Our schedule will be changing and our day will be longer.

229
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:32,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all went into that.

230
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:34,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so we have to revamp everything.

231
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:42,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so the high school have yeah I want to say it's a little bit over an hour maybe an hour and a quarter a week Yeah, yeah of

232
00:12:46,023 --> 00:13:04,621
[SPEAKER_00]: you know school time right so learning time and that's important you know academics at the end of the day is why we're here yeah so so yeah so I'm really proud of that um you know like I said I definitely want money to go where it's supposed to go and what better to invest in than our children right and the staff that's here you know we want to keep

233
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:08,296
[SPEAKER_00]: the best of the best here.

234
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:10,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do believe we have it.

235
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of everybody.

236
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

237
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's money.

238
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:15,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to know.

239
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's nice to know.

240
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,730
[SPEAKER_00]: The money did not go towards our new high school.

241
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,011
[SPEAKER_00]: I had heard that many times.

242
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, we need to do that because we have a new high school.

243
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,636
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, that's not why we're doing the override.

244
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:32,919
[SPEAKER_01]: You too, yeah, because everyone thought, oh, yeah, the money, yeah, well, it's only one year, it was going to the school, and I'm like, no.

245
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:36,941
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, yeah, no, my bills changed, you know, my tax bill changed too, you know, so.

246
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you get it all the time, I'm sure.

247
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

248
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:45,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, it's almost comical sometimes.

249
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:51,727
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, here's another thing that I really am interested in.

250
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,128
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are interested in, I think.

251
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,514
[SPEAKER_01]: update, any update, on the plans for a new high school?

252
00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:03,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to build a new one?

253
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,436
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do something with what we have?

254
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Is anything going anywhere yet?

255
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a sports mom, right?

256
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,980
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids play sports.

257
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,882
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to these other complexes and I'm like, why don't we have this?

258
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:16,684
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we had this.

259
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:18,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we need a new high school?

260
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:20,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you know what I mean?

261
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,189
[SPEAKER_00]: The old Mefford High burned down.

262
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,390
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom was at Mefford High.

263
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:24,932
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to this school.

264
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,553
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't changed, right?

265
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:30,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I've graduated 30 years ago, 30 plus.

266
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,324
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I mean, we need, who wants to come to work every day?

267
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:41,703
[SPEAKER_00]: in you know, in not the best environment, right?

268
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:45,608
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody deserves heat and air conditioning and windows and whatnot.

269
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:49,673
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MSBA process is a long process, five to seven years.

270
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:52,676
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not on the committee, but we are updated on it.

271
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:56,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we are moving, I believe we're in the third phase, if I'm correct.

272
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:04,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you know, the team is working really diligently at getting everything passed in ahead of schedule, which is great.

273
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:05,806
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of parts of it.

274
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:10,389
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really proud that so many people in the community wanted to jump in with their expertise.

275
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:11,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.

276
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,650
[SPEAKER_00]: That's community to me.

277
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:16,873
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think you want to come into a building every day that makes you feel good.

278
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:22,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, you know, in my office, everybody says, I love your area, it feels like home.

279
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:30,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know what, I want people to feel comfy when they come into my area, you know, we're here a lot of hours, you know, and our staff works hard and our kids work hard.

280
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:35,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want it to be, you know, a welcoming environment, foster learning.

281
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,019
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still a lot going on.

282
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a lot going on there.

283
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:38,999
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.

284
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long process.

285
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,780
[SPEAKER_01]: The wheels are turning.

286
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,361
[SPEAKER_00]: The wheels are definitely turning.

287
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:43,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

288
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:48,183
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, the MSBA is who tells us what will happen.

289
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:50,564
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we can have grand ideas.

290
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:53,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they'll scale it back for us, if I'm correct.

291
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:55,886
[SPEAKER_00]: But absolutely, yeah.

292
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:57,968
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, yeah, we have to be realistic.

293
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:05,714
[SPEAKER_00]: There are great parts of this campus and there are parts that really need to be revamped, you know, and there's no doubt about that.

294
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:10,658
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and so I think, you know, obviously this high school was built

295
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:15,400
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, 5,000 kids, I think, at the beginning, right?

296
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the, you know, at the time.

297
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:19,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I clapped for over 700 kids graduating.

298
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:21,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, exactly.

299
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:22,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think mine was 300.

300
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:25,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how many was in my daughter's.

301
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,246
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, overall, enrollment has declined.

302
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,647
[SPEAKER_00]: People's families have shrunk, right?

303
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,288
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't have six kids anymore.

304
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:33,388
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too expensive.

305
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:37,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, enrollment goes down over time.

306
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we'd have to tailor it to what the enrollment projections are.

307
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:43,640
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, all of that goes into it.

308
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

309
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:48,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you've, uh, you know, you've answered the next couple of questions.

310
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:52,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to get into, you know, I mean, what do you think?

311
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:54,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, listen, what I love.

312
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:57,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't, we all want exactly.

313
00:16:57,794 --> 00:16:59,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

314
00:16:59,216 --> 00:16:59,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

315
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:01,959
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a possibility that they're going to rehab.

316
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:02,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

317
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

318
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

319
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

320
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessarily a whole brand new building.

321
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have a building, B building, both.

322
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:09,544
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

323
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:10,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is a lot.

324
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,387
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big campus and we don't, you know.

325
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the enrollment is down over the last 50 years, right?

326
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,153
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 60 years, whatever it's been.

327
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:27,061
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, tailor it to what we need and what our, you know, our hopes are of what Mefford High will be, would be great.

328
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:28,282
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key, tailoring it.

329
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:29,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, tailoring it.

330
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,004
[SPEAKER_01]: To what you need now.

331
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:32,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Tailoring, tailoring it, you know, and projections.

332
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I gotta bring up, you know, we did a,

333
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,114
[SPEAKER_01]: vocational school show with Rich Cormier.

334
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,159
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone hasn't seen that show, go back and watch it.

335
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:41,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great show.

336
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge Vogue fan.

337
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:44,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not go to the Vogue.

338
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:44,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.

339
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:46,386
[SPEAKER_00]: But my kids, yes.

340
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:49,050
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a tour of the vocational school.

341
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I had more fun doing that show because I thought, yeah, it's incredible.

342
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:54,835
[SPEAKER_00]: The bistro, I have to rave about the bistro.

343
00:17:54,935 --> 00:18:05,845
[SPEAKER_00]: I go once a week for lunch and I try to, you know, promote it on social media as much as much as possible because, you know, the food is actually really, really good.

344
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,186
[SPEAKER_00]: The price is

345
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:17,870
[SPEAKER_00]: more than right, right, you know, and this is real life experience for these kids, like that's such hand on experience, like, where do you get that at school?

346
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:28,953
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think busy hands, you know, are, you know, yeah, you know, busy hands keeps them busy, you know, so stay focused, stay focused.

347
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:30,674
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?

348
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:31,315
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

349
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:32,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

350
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,380
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you want to graduate and go into the workforce.

351
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,061
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

352
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:44,631
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to graduate and continue that the path that you've been on in high school to college or, you know, fostering greatness.

353
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:45,752
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a waiting list.

354
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:47,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is still a waiting list.

355
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:48,414
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a waiting list.

356
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:49,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?

357
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:49,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it's great.

358
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is great.

359
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:52,736
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.

360
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:53,497
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great, yeah.

361
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:59,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, years ago, they used to offer up some of the programs to other areas because we couldn't fill the programs and they needed the space.

362
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,821
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not the case anymore.

363
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did hire, I want to say it was another culinary teacher.

364
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,485
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of new hires because the programs are thriving.

365
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:10,706
[SPEAKER_00]: They're exploding.

366
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,267
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thriving, and that's great.

367
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:13,507
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me happy.

368
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:19,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like I say I just that was a great show and a boy.

369
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:44,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot Yeah, that tour is the best When I went to school, it was like whoa, well, you know when I went to school too You couldn't cross that line either a Medford high student or you were a Vogue student and you did not cross the line There were different start times different end times You knew you know, and I think that it was really looked down upon which is so sad because it has it really was and it is so

370
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,760
[SPEAKER_00]: different now, and you know, I'm really proud of that.

371
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:47,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Really proud.

372
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:48,923
[SPEAKER_01]: All good stuff.

373
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:49,844
[SPEAKER_00]: All good stuff.

00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:50,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the good stuff.

375
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:51,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me happy.

376
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:52,767
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love the good stuff.

377
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:52,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?

378
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:56,551
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good and the bad, it's reality, so gotta be realistic.

379
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,192
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta make the bad good sometimes.

380
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:58,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

381
00:19:58,813 --> 00:19:59,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the best you can.

382
00:19:59,514 --> 00:19:59,934
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

383
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:04,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, you know, I could go on for a little bit longer, but

384
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:06,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a talker too, so go for it.

385
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question.

386
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make this the last question.

387
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:11,425
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, go for it.

388
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,606
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we covered a lot.

389
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:13,867
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.

390
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:17,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have you come back on someday.

391
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:18,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm around.

392
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:18,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Medford.

393
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:20,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know, I know.

394
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:23,255
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the last question.

395
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked this, and I want to make sure that,

396
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:41,770
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is your, if you had your least favorite and your most favorite thing to do in Medford, it could be more than one thing, but what is your least and most favorite thing to do?

397
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I would say my least favorite thing to do in Medford is drive.

398
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:47,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?

399
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,928
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic, you know, I work in Somerville.

400
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:55,191
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me sometimes 45 minutes to get to Somerville from Medford.

401
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:56,793
[SPEAKER_00]: I think days I could walk quicker.

402
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

403
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:04,521
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody has different modes of transportation, which is great, but it's a lot, you know, so it's a lot.

404
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:09,165
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think probably driving is probably my least favorite.

405
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:12,529
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to give a lot more time when you're even just, you know,

406
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:14,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going local.

407
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going local.

408
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,812
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to give yourself a little bit extra time.

409
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:19,800
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably driving is my least favorite.

410
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:24,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, no, that makes sense, because yeah, I have to drive to Somerville.

411
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I drop someone off at the Y, you know, sometimes four or five times a week, and I agree with you.

412
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:36,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the traffic sometimes, and when the kids are back in school, it's incredible.

413
00:21:36,704 --> 00:21:43,987
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible, and just so you know, there's still traffic on Winthrop Street, even when school is out, because I sit in that some days, too.

414
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what's going on with Tuesdays, but Tuesdays is not a good traffic day ever.

415
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:48,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.

416
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,845
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now we got your least favorite, which is driving.

417
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people agree with you on that.

418
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,946
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a top one.

419
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:56,707
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good answer.

420
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:57,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

421
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:58,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And favorite.

422
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:00,009
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing.

423
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:03,931
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing to do in Medford is to go for a walk in the cemetery.

424
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a lot of peace there.

425
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:07,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk through the woods.

426
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk up on the stairs.

427
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,635
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit, I think.

428
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:14,157
[SPEAKER_00]: The wildlife in the cemetery is amazing.

429
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:17,579
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of pictures on my own personal social media about that.

430
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,040
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunset.

431
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the deers come out to me.

432
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:28,525
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen coyote and fox and deer and the bucks are out now with their full rack.

433
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:30,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just really amazing to me.

434
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:35,669
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a hawk the other day that, you know, was chewing on some prey.

435
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is happening right here in my backyard.

436
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:41,352
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a beautiful, peaceful place.

437
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,653
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is a peaceful place.

438
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:43,994
[SPEAKER_00]: So it brings me a lot of peace in there.

439
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:44,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

440
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:50,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I have a lot of family, a lot of friends up there.

441
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I do go up there.

442
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:53,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I get up there once a week.

443
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:54,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, it is.

444
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:55,497
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to go every day.

445
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:56,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.

446
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:57,198
