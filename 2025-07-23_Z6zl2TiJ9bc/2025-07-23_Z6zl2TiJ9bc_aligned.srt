00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:26,144
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:28,386
I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:37,554
The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:42,599
So let's give a really big welcome to our guest today, Nicole Brandly.

5
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:49,156
Nicole is a hard-working and current member of our Method School Committee.

6
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:56,899
Nicole works for everyone in the city of Method, and I think there's a big emphasis on children and students.

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,081
So, Nicole, thank you for coming on the show.

8
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:00,841
Thank you for having me.

9
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,122
We really do appreciate it.

10
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:02,502
I love it.

11
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:04,643
We're gonna get right into it, Nicole.

12
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:05,604
Okay, let's do it.

13
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,945
I start off with, just give us a little background.

14
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:09,886
Who's Nicole?

15
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:11,646
What are you all about?

16
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:13,847
Well, what am I all about?

17
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,248
Well, I'm a current school committee member here in Medford.

18
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:20,710
I'm just finishing up my first term, running for my second term for re-election.

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,671
I'm a mom.

20
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:23,552
I have two children.

21
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:25,552
One graduated from Medford High this year.

22
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:28,494
And then I have a rising 10th grader.

23
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:33,284
You're a very, very busy person.

24
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:33,725
Yeah.

25
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,106
And I grew up in Medford.

26
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,307
I went to Medford High.

27
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:39,610
I've worked for Medford Public Schools in the past as a paraprofessional.

28
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,833
And I work for a neighboring district.

29
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:45,396
I'm the administrative assistant for the director and assistant director of special ed.

30
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:46,437
Very good.

31
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:46,958
Yeah.

32
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:47,338
Great.

33
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:48,179
That's great stuff.

34
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:49,347
It really is.

35
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:52,750
You're also a very busy person.

36
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:53,812
I am.

37
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,876
All right, so now we'll get into what it's all about, what's going on.

38
00:01:57,976 --> 00:01:58,657
OK, let's do it.

39
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:02,982
Give us a couple of reasons, just why you're seeking re-election.

40
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:04,163
Well, there's more work to do.

41
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:05,765
There's more work to do.

42
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:06,706
And I love my job.

43
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:10,850
I love working for the school committee.

44
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,592
I love representing this city.

45
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:15,815
I don't represent one group or one person.

46
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,777
I don't go to City Hall for myself.

47
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,621
So I represent every citizen, and that makes me really proud.

48
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:27,007
And to think that I can be the voice of our students and our staff, that means everything to me.

49
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:31,011
I trust them with my children, and I'm happy that they trust me.

50
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,300
And they do.

51
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,362
I appreciate that.

52
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,624
I don't take that for granted at all.

53
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:37,405
I know you don't.

54
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,067
I know that's the type of person you are.

55
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:39,587
Thank you.

56
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:41,369
And that's why we love having you on the show.

57
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:41,770
Thanks.

58
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:49,858
I mean, you want to share some of your, you know, what you would, what you believe to be past accomplishments?

59
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:50,018
Sure.

60
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:52,341
You've done a lot, but you want to fill us in?

61
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:55,084
Well, school committee never sleeps, I can tell you that.

62
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,886
We are on 24-7.

63
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,949
It's not just, you know, showing up for a couple of meetings a month.

64
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,451
You are really on all the time.

65
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:05,835
I think the thing that I'm probably most proud of is that I won.

66
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:10,200
I'm a grassroots single person, you know, running for office.

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,982
I'm not affiliated with any groups.

68
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:27,331
you know I run everything on my own my social media I have a treasurer but besides that I don't have a campaign manager and you know I'm my own manager I guess basically a one-woman show that's it

69
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,454
I'm grateful for everybody that helps me.

70
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:36,395
I feel like I have an amazing village in Medford, and I'm grateful for every single person.

71
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:40,656
Working on the school committee, you know, obviously budget season is very difficult.

72
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:45,097
You know, last year especially, it was very difficult.

73
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:49,318
This year was definitely easier with the override.

74
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:51,258
You know, grateful to keep those jobs.

75
00:03:54,595 --> 00:04:00,722
Leading up to my run for election, I worked very closely with the school committee before even running for office.

76
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:06,928
I helped them revise the building and intervention policy, and I was really, really proud of that.

77
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:14,156
And I was involved in hiring our new principal, which is Monta Cabral, so I was on that search committee, too, and I'm proud of that.

78
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:17,439
We're very proud of you.

79
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,262
And the bullying, that needed to be revised.

80
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:21,863
And you did a great job.

81
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:22,263
Thank you.

82
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:23,064
I appreciate it.

83
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,065
It was for every child.

84
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:24,645
I know.

85
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:25,686
Every child.

86
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:26,807
There was a lot going on.

87
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:27,628
There really was.

88
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:40,599
So what do you feel was the school committee's most important action or decision in the past

89
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:42,578
term.

90
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:48,542
Was there anything going on?

91
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:53,045
Anything going on?

92
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:55,006
Yeah, I mean, actions that you took.

93
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:56,747
Actions that we took, all right.

94
00:04:56,787 --> 00:05:00,910
Well, I think budget, money is probably the most important thing, right?

95
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,311
I mean, the override was huge.

96
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:05,933
We want to make sure that we're going to use that money wisely.

97
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:12,359
I think that was the most important thing to me in talking about the budget and the override.

98
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,282
I just wanted to make sure the money that we do have we were using properly.

99
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:19,466
And I'm happy to see that the money is going where it said it's going.

100
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,927
And that makes me happy.

101
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:30,196
I think transitioning to a new superintendent after Dr. Evey left and now transitioning to our interim superintendent.

102
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:33,199
Dr. Galussi.

103
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:38,004
Next year we'll, you know, search for a new one or keep Dr. Galussi, however that turns out.

104
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:40,127
And I think obviously a new Meffitt High building.

105
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:43,186
Right, I mean, so there's a lot of issues ongoing.

106
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:46,188
There's a lot going on and I'd like to stay apart and see everything through.

107
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:46,848
Right, yeah.

108
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,069
It doesn't really end.

109
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:49,809
No, no, it's a continuation.

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,071
It's always a continuation.

111
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:52,571
More work.

112
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:53,571
Absolutely.

113
00:05:54,772 --> 00:06:00,975
Can you tell our audience what is your number one issue, if you have a number one issue?

114
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:02,036
Oh, a number one issue.

115
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,257
The school committee will have to deal with.

116
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:18,591
well i mean next election yeah so i would i would definitely say you know transitioning to a new superintendent or you know or or sticking with dr galusi who's been doing a great job proud of her um i really would love to

117
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:22,533
Showcase our you know our highlights here at method high.

118
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:41,617
I think the method vocational technical high school is really the CTE program is a crown jewel here It really really is I'm lucky enough that both of my kids are Voki's Jacqueline was in the culinary program when she was here and Dominic is accepted to the electrical program, and I'm really proud of that and I think that it's

119
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:47,224
important to note that you can be a vocational student and still go to college.

120
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:50,326
I think that that's really a myth that needs to be busted.

121
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:52,107
You know, it really does.

122
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,007
It really does.

123
00:06:53,027 --> 00:07:00,831
You know, and my daughter's heading off to college and she was in culinary, you know, um, and I also think that I would really love to see a lot more Mustang pride come back.

124
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:08,615
I think old school, you know, you've, you've lived in Medford, you went to Medford high, you have that Mustang pride in you.

125
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,676
You remember the song as everybody came in on,

126
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:34,993
Thanksgiving morning or the pep rally and I think that we've lost some of that You know, I would love to see us have more pride, you know in our sports, you know in the athletic department We have a new athletic director coming in which is great And I definitely think Obviously academics is has to be a top priority and I think you know a new building whether you know we

127
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:41,794
revamp the whole place or, you know, whatever, but that's to be seen.

128
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:43,556
But I think that we need to have pride here.

129
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,318
Be proud of where you come from.

130
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:48,141
And by the way, the sports teams.

131
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:52,253
Yes, both my, yes, yes.

132
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,655
I was at a bunch of those GBL games.

133
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,616
Absolutely.

134
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:58,659
I went to every home football game I was at.

135
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,601
My daughter played for the softball team.

136
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:02,762
She was on varsity.

137
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:08,346
My son was junior varsity and called up for varsity and he was at, you know, that GBL winning games.

138
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,269
And it's so great to watch the energy.

139
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:17,894
And I love that people that, you know, from the city or other parents come to watch the games of other students that are just excited.

140
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,296
And I think that we really need to get back into that.

141
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:21,577
I think that that's huge.

142
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:23,819
It's a big part of what's going on in high school.

143
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:24,520
It really is.

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,723
What happens in school is citywide.

145
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:30,646
It's not just for people who have kids at school.

146
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:31,827
I agree.

147
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:32,407
Good point.

148
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:32,968
Thanks.

149
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:34,709
Very good point.

150
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,572
So next question.

151
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:44,098
How important is working cohesively with your fellow

152
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,904
You know, committee members, you know, now and in the future.

153
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:49,745
Absolutely.

154
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:50,205
What do you see?

155
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:51,447
What do you feel?

156
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:54,490
Well, I really feel like no one should come to City Hall for themselves.

157
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,401
I feel like we work for the citizens.

158
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,664
You don't work for the five or 7,000 people that vote for you.

159
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:04,427
You work for all citizens.

160
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:07,769
So, you know, 50, 60,000 citizens here in Medford.

161
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,151
I feel like I want to represent them all, you know, I really do.

162
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:22,400
And if it means, you know, stopping and talking everywhere I am, which happens everywhere you go, you know, you know, it's funny, you know, I'll go out with girlfriends and people will be like, oh, there she goes.

163
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,881
But it's true, it's true.

164
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:27,282
People want your attention and I think people want to be heard.

165
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:35,687
And if I can be that listening ear for someone to say, this happened to me or I'm really excited about this, I'm all for it.

166
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,628
So I think that that's really important.

167
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:43,211
Of course, working with our fellow members, the mayor, the superintendent, our assistant superintendents.

168
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:47,412
All the department heads the directors it is important.

169
00:09:47,452 --> 00:10:06,420
It is important that the staff is heard The teachers are heard the students the families, you know I'm I I think really you don't walk into City Hall for yourself and if you walk into City Hall as an elected official and you are there for yourself then You're not there for the right reasons You know

170
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:10,277
That is a great answer.

171
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,478
And I know it's coming from your heart.

172
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:13,178
I do.

173
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:18,881
I can't tell you how much that means, because I'm not going to get into too much here.

174
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,402
I'm not a politician.

175
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,042
I'm a mom.

176
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,363
You're definitely not a politician.

177
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:23,223
I'm not a politician.

178
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:24,444
Just with that answer alone.

179
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:25,264
I'm not a politician.

180
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:26,985
I'm a mom that wanted to see change.

181
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:29,106
And you do represent the whole city.

182
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,027
And I think that is

183
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:32,107
So important.

184
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:33,508
I hear people talk.

185
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:35,329
I want to hear everybody's opinions.

186
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,873
No matter what side of the aisle you're on, I think that we need to really meet in the middle.

187
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,194
And that's what brings community.

188
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:43,075
Exactly.

189
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,096
Thanks.

190
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:47,979
That's why, well, that question to me, that was like, wow.

191
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:48,479
Oh.

192
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,860
No, it was wow.

193
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,721
I love to wow you, John.

194
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:51,862
Well, you did.

195
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:54,183
That's a great answer.

196
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:55,584
You don't hear that often.

197
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:56,485
You just don't.

198
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,225
That's my truth.

199
00:10:58,286 --> 00:10:58,907
That's my truth.

200
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:15,440
appreciate it i really don't and i'm sure the audience is going to appreciate it that that's very very important um uh all right so now let's get into the money stuff all right let's get a question about that all right i know no one wants to talk about it

201
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,022
I wish I had more of it.

202
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:21,284
I wish the city had more of it.

203
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:22,145
I hear you.

204
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:22,786
I hear you.

205
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:33,194
The status, you know, the override, the $7 million, is there any way you can give us a little bit of the status of, you know, what happened?

206
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:34,555
What happened with that money?

207
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:34,835
Yeah.

208
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,096
What are we doing with it?

209
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:37,597
It's not in my bank account.

210
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:39,359
We're not, we're not out to dinner with it.

211
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,320
That's for sure.

212
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,621
Um, no.

213
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,343
So, um, well obviously, uh,

214
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,593
I think that we've really needed to work harder on maintenance, especially of our buildings.

215
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,154
That has definitely lacked.

216
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:55,016
And I'd like to think things are getting fixed.

217
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,317
That's very important.

218
00:11:57,158 --> 00:12:00,560
The mayor has been great in helping us out, obviously, with funds.

219
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,022
We are the biggest part of the city budget.

220
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:04,708
And that's a big deal.

221
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:08,210
So override, we just passed the teacher's contract.

222
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,213
I was not on the negotiating team, but the teacher's contract was finalized.

223
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:15,855
I believe they said in three months, which is unheard of.

224
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:16,876
They did a great job.

225
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:17,796
They really did.

226
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:21,619
Obviously a lot of work goes into that.

227
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,422
And I'm grateful for the negotiating team in that aspect.

228
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:30,025
Our schedule will be changing and our day will be longer.

229
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:32,427
And that all went into that.

230
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:34,470
Yes, so we have to revamp everything.

231
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:42,519
Yes, so the high school have yeah I want to say it's a little bit over an hour maybe an hour and a quarter a week Yeah, yeah of

232
00:12:46,023 --> 00:13:04,621
you know school time right so learning time and that's important you know academics at the end of the day is why we're here yeah so so yeah so I'm really proud of that um you know like I said I definitely want money to go where it's supposed to go and what better to invest in than our children right and the staff that's here you know we want to keep

233
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:08,296
the best of the best here.

234
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:10,078
And I really do believe we have it.

235
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,440
I'm really proud of everybody.

236
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,241
Yeah.

237
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,543
So that's money.

238
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:15,224
Nice to know.

239
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,146
Yeah, it's nice to know.

240
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,730
The money did not go towards our new high school.

241
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,011
I had heard that many times.

242
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,813
Like, oh, we need to do that because we have a new high school.

243
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,636
I'm like, that's not why we're doing the override.

244
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:32,919
You too, yeah, because everyone thought, oh, yeah, the money, yeah, well, it's only one year, it was going to the school, and I'm like, no.

245
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:36,941
No, no, yeah, no, my bills changed, you know, my tax bill changed too, you know, so.

246
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,522
Yeah, you get it all the time, I'm sure.

247
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,122
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

248
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:45,764
I'm telling you, it's almost comical sometimes.

249
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:51,727
But, you know, here's another thing that I really am interested in.

250
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,128
A lot of people are interested in, I think.

251
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,514
update, any update, on the plans for a new high school?

252
00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:03,035
Are we going to build a new one?

253
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,436
We're going to do something with what we have?

254
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,778
Is anything going anywhere yet?

255
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,900
I am a sports mom, right?

256
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,980
My kids play sports.

257
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,882
I go to these other complexes and I'm like, why don't we have this?

258
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:16,684
I wish we had this.

259
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:18,805
So do we need a new high school?

260
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:20,987
Yes, you know what I mean?

261
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,189
The old Mefford High burned down.

262
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,390
My mom was at Mefford High.

263
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:24,932
I went to this school.

264
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,553
It hasn't changed, right?

265
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:30,898
I've graduated 30 years ago, 30 plus.

266
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,324
And so, yeah, I mean, we need, who wants to come to work every day?

267
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:41,703
in you know, in not the best environment, right?

268
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:45,608
You know, everybody deserves heat and air conditioning and windows and whatnot.

269
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:49,673
So the MSBA process is a long process, five to seven years.

270
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:52,676
I am not on the committee, but we are updated on it.

271
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:56,661
So yes, we are moving, I believe we're in the third phase, if I'm correct.

272
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:04,305
Yeah, and you know, the team is working really diligently at getting everything passed in ahead of schedule, which is great.

273
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:05,806
There's a lot of parts of it.

274
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:10,389
And I'm really proud that so many people in the community wanted to jump in with their expertise.

275
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:11,290
I love that.

276
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,650
That's community to me.

277
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:16,873
You know, I think you want to come into a building every day that makes you feel good.

278
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:22,114
Right, you know, in my office, everybody says, I love your area, it feels like home.

279
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:30,737
And I'm like, you know what, I want people to feel comfy when they come into my area, you know, we're here a lot of hours, you know, and our staff works hard and our kids work hard.

280
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:35,038
So you want it to be, you know, a welcoming environment, foster learning.

281
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,019
So there's still a lot going on.

282
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,399
Oh, there's a lot going on there.

283
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:38,999
There's a lot.

284
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,840
It's a long process.

285
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,780
The wheels are turning.

286
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,361
The wheels are definitely turning.

287
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:43,061
Absolutely.

288
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:48,183
And at the end of the day, the MSBA is who tells us what will happen.

289
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:50,564
So yes, we can have grand ideas.

290
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:53,805
And I think they'll scale it back for us, if I'm correct.

291
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:55,886
But absolutely, yeah.

292
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:57,968
So I think, yeah, we have to be realistic.

293
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:05,714
There are great parts of this campus and there are parts that really need to be revamped, you know, and there's no doubt about that.

294
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:10,658
So, yeah, and so I think, you know, obviously this high school was built

295
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:15,400
for, you know, 5,000 kids, I think, at the beginning, right?

296
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,841
Back in the, you know, at the time.

297
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:19,182
I clapped for over 700 kids graduating.

298
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:21,323
Yeah, you know, exactly.

299
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:22,143
And I think mine was 300.

300
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:25,105
I don't even know how many was in my daughter's.

301
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,246
But, you know, overall, enrollment has declined.

302
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,647
People's families have shrunk, right?

303
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,288
People don't have six kids anymore.

304
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:33,388
It's too expensive.

305
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:37,210
So obviously, enrollment goes down over time.

306
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,652
So, you know, we'd have to tailor it to what the enrollment projections are.

307
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:43,640
So yeah, all of that goes into it.

308
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,441
Yeah.

309
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:48,445
So I think you've, uh, you know, you've answered the next couple of questions.

310
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:52,028
I was going to get into, you know, I mean, what do you think?

311
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:54,491
I mean, you know, listen, what I love.

312
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:57,574
I mean, we don't, we all want exactly.

313
00:16:57,794 --> 00:16:59,116
Exactly.

314
00:16:59,216 --> 00:16:59,656
Yes.

315
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:01,959
There's a possibility that they're going to rehab.

316
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:02,659
Absolutely.

317
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,140
Yeah.

318
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,860
Absolutely.

319
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,120
Yeah.

320
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,582
And it's not necessarily a whole brand new building.

321
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,724
I mean, we have a building, B building, both.

322
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:09,544
You know what I mean?

323
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:10,725
Like, this is a lot.

324
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,387
This is a big campus and we don't, you know.

325
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,472
Like I said, the enrollment is down over the last 50 years, right?

326
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,153
You know, 60 years, whatever it's been.

327
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:27,061
So, you know, tailor it to what we need and what our, you know, our hopes are of what Mefford High will be, would be great.

328
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:28,282
That's the key, tailoring it.

329
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:29,123
Yeah, tailoring it.

330
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,004
To what you need now.

331
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:32,047
Tailoring, tailoring it, you know, and projections.

332
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,049
Yeah, and I gotta bring up, you know, we did a,

333
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,114
vocational school show with Rich Cormier.

334
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,159
If anyone hasn't seen that show, go back and watch it.

335
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:41,840
It's a great show.

336
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,981
I'm a huge Vogue fan.

337
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:44,223
I did not go to the Vogue.

338
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:44,764
I didn't know.

339
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:46,386
But my kids, yes.

340
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:49,050
You get a tour of the vocational school.

341
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,172
I had more fun doing that show because I thought, yeah, it's incredible.

342
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:54,835
The bistro, I have to rave about the bistro.

343
00:17:54,935 --> 00:18:05,845
I go once a week for lunch and I try to, you know, promote it on social media as much as much as possible because, you know, the food is actually really, really good.

344
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,186
The price is

345
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:17,870
more than right, right, you know, and this is real life experience for these kids, like that's such hand on experience, like, where do you get that at school?

346
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:28,953
And, you know, I think busy hands, you know, are, you know, yeah, you know, busy hands keeps them busy, you know, so stay focused, stay focused.

347
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:30,674
What's going on?

348
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:31,315
I love it.

349
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:32,376
I love it.

350
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,380
I mean, you want to graduate and go into the workforce.

351
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,061
That's great.

352
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:44,631
You want to graduate and continue that the path that you've been on in high school to college or, you know, fostering greatness.

353
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:45,752
But there was a waiting list.

354
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:47,534
Yeah, there is still a waiting list.

355
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:48,414
It's still a waiting list.

356
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:49,094
Can you imagine?

357
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:49,955
I know, it's great.

358
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,696
I mean, it is great.

359
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:52,736
It's great.

360
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:53,497
It's great, yeah.

361
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:59,820
I mean, years ago, they used to offer up some of the programs to other areas because we couldn't fill the programs and they needed the space.

362
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,821
And that is not the case anymore.

363
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,543
And we did hire, I want to say it was another culinary teacher.

364
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,485
There were a couple of new hires because the programs are thriving.

365
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:10,706
They're exploding.

366
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,267
We're thriving, and that's great.

367
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:13,507
That makes me happy.

368
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:19,150
Yeah, I like I say I just that was a great show and a boy.

369
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:44,178
I learned a lot Yeah, that tour is the best When I went to school, it was like whoa, well, you know when I went to school too You couldn't cross that line either a Medford high student or you were a Vogue student and you did not cross the line There were different start times different end times You knew you know, and I think that it was really looked down upon which is so sad because it has it really was and it is so

370
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,760
different now, and you know, I'm really proud of that.

371
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:47,942
Really proud.

372
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:48,923
All good stuff.

373
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:49,844
All good stuff.

374
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:50,724
I like the good stuff.

375
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:51,285
Makes me happy.

376
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:52,767
We all love the good stuff.

377
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:52,987
Right?

378
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:56,551
But the good and the bad, it's reality, so gotta be realistic.

379
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,192
You gotta make the bad good sometimes.

380
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:58,793
Absolutely.

381
00:19:58,813 --> 00:19:59,494
Do the best you can.

382
00:19:59,514 --> 00:19:59,934
That's right.

383
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:04,239
Alright, you know, I could go on for a little bit longer, but

384
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:06,540
I'm a talker too, so go for it.

385
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,141
Next question.

386
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,824
I'm going to make this the last question.

387
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:11,425
All right, go for it.

388
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,606
I think we covered a lot.

389
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:13,867
We did.

390
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:17,811
I'd like to have you come back on someday.

391
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:18,171
I'm around.

392
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:18,731
I'm in Medford.

393
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:20,313
I know, I know, I know.

394
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:23,255
But this is the last question.

395
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,599
I asked this, and I want to make sure that,

396
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:41,770
You know, what is your, if you had your least favorite and your most favorite thing to do in Medford, it could be more than one thing, but what is your least and most favorite thing to do?

397
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,915
Okay, so I would say my least favorite thing to do in Medford is drive.

398
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:47,556
Right?

399
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,928
The traffic, you know, I work in Somerville.

400
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:55,191
It takes me sometimes 45 minutes to get to Somerville from Medford.

401
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:56,793
I think days I could walk quicker.

402
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,254
Right.

403
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:04,521
You know, everybody has different modes of transportation, which is great, but it's a lot, you know, so it's a lot.

404
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:09,165
So, yeah, I think probably driving is probably my least favorite.

405
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:12,529
I think you have to give a lot more time when you're even just, you know,

406
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:14,286
Just going local.

407
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,068
Just going local.

408
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,812
You have to give yourself a little bit extra time.

409
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:19,800
So probably driving is my least favorite.

410
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:24,859
Okay, no, that makes sense, because yeah, I have to drive to Somerville.

411
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,342
I drop someone off at the Y, you know, sometimes four or five times a week, and I agree with you.

412
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:36,604
I live in the traffic sometimes, and when the kids are back in school, it's incredible.

413
00:21:36,704 --> 00:21:43,987
It's incredible, and just so you know, there's still traffic on Winthrop Street, even when school is out, because I sit in that some days, too.

414
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,608
And I don't know what's going on with Tuesdays, but Tuesdays is not a good traffic day ever.

415
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:48,449
Yeah, there you go.

416
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,845
All right, so now we got your least favorite, which is driving.

417
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,686
And I think a lot of people agree with you on that.

418
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,946
That might be a top one.

419
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:56,707
That's a good answer.

420
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:57,067
Thank you.

421
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:58,768
And favorite.

422
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:00,009
My favorite thing.

423
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:03,931
My favorite thing to do in Medford is to go for a walk in the cemetery.

424
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,292
I find a lot of peace there.

425
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:07,813
I walk through the woods.

426
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,254
I walk up on the stairs.

427
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,635
I sit, I think.

428
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:14,157
The wildlife in the cemetery is amazing.

429
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:17,579
a lot of pictures on my own personal social media about that.

430
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,040
The sunset.

431
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,981
I think the deers come out to me.

432
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:28,525
But I've seen coyote and fox and deer and the bucks are out now with their full rack.

433
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:30,806
And it's just really amazing to me.

434
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:35,669
There was a hawk the other day that, you know, was chewing on some prey.

435
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,791
And I was like, this is happening right here in my backyard.

436
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:41,352
It's just a beautiful, peaceful place.

437
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,653
It really is a peaceful place.

438
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:43,994
So it brings me a lot of peace in there.

439
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:44,794
I hear you.

440
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:50,076
Unfortunately, I have a lot of family, a lot of friends up there.

441
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,516
I do go up there.

442
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:53,137
I get up there once a week.

443
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:54,117
And you're right, it is.

444
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:55,497
I try to go every day.

445
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:56,317
I really do.

446
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:57,198
I find a lot of peace there.

447
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:59,878
Every time I go up, there's plenty of wildlife.

448
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:02,259
And I also see a lot of people walking around.

449
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,120
Yeah, it's a great place to walk.

450
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,460
Yeah, it's a great place to walk.

451
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,520
But that's good.

452
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,421
Thanks.

453
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:12,042
You gave me two answers that I don't think anyone else would give me, the cemetery and driving.

454
00:23:12,222 --> 00:23:13,083
Well, there you go.

455
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:13,744
Well, I'm unique.

456
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:14,985
There's no doubt about it.

457
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,886
Listen, I really do mean this.

458
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,526
I appreciate you coming on the show.

459
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:21,746
Thank you.

460

461
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:22,586
Thank you.

462
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,067
