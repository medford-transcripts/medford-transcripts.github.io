1
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:24,672
[SPEAKER_01]: call a meeting to order first thing is the review of the minutes from last time October I believe sure didn't meet in November correct can you is this noise should I mute myself can you hear them drilling out there is that the dental office

2
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:31,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, do I have a motion to approve the minutes from October 2024?

3
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:34,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve the minutes from October.

4
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Doctor.

5
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, roll call.

6
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:41,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have a second first, I guess?

7
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:42,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

8
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:44,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

9
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, roll call.

[SPEAKER_03]: Kathleen Charbonneau?

15
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:53,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

16
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:57,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, motion to approve, accepted, thank you.

17
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:11,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so next on our agenda, we have representatives from MorphoCeuticals at 200 Boston Avenue.

18
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:22,505
[SPEAKER_03]: They've submitted a permit for an application for an institution to use regulated biological agents as part of a permit application

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:32,984
[SPEAKER_03]: We request that the applicants present an overview of the use of our DNA or other regulated biological agents during a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Health.

20
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:49,532
[SPEAKER_03]: This presentation shall include a general introduction of the institution, its mission, its research or production plans, a timeline of the use of our DNA or regulated biological agents, an overview of the applicant's biosecurity risk assessment and program,

21
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,320
[SPEAKER_03]: and the discussion of the facilities in general.

22
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,486
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure if you want to introduce yourselves for folks that are here from MorphoCeuticals.

23
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:01,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

24
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:03,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.

25
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:05,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

26
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:07,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Maestan Bogheri.

27
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:09,974
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a scientist at MorphoCeuticals.

28
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:16,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And so representing MorphoCeuticals to get actually the permits from the Medford Board of Health.

29
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,777
[SPEAKER_00]: and nice to meet all of you guys.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, should I start with the presentation?

31
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:33,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, is there anyone else that here from Office of Certicals that you want to introduce?

32
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:40,088
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just I think Isabel and Nicole, they're from Spotlight, so they're helping us.

33
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

34
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:44,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

35
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:46,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to continue.

36
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:47,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

37
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:53,382
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'll give you a brief overview of the MorphoCytical.

38
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:56,946
[SPEAKER_00]: MorphoCytical is located at 200 Boston Avenue, Medford.

39
00:02:57,586 --> 00:03:11,581
[SPEAKER_00]: So, mainly we are focused on understanding the bioelectric and the bioelectron profile of different tissues during actually different conditions in healthy and disease or disorder conditions.

40
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:19,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are also focusing on regeneration, different types of actual regeneration for different organs.

41
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:40,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So to address our questions regarding the bioelectric profile of different tissues, we need to use actually different fluorescent proteins or reporters that they can tell us what is the actual status of the membrane potential or cell potential.

42
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:47,050
[SPEAKER_00]: So to achieve this, we have to use, actually, adeno-associated virus.

43
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:53,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be able to infect the living animals, like the living mouse or mice.

44
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And also different types of the cells.

45
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:03,359
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we need to actually use AAV or adeno-associated virus.

46
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:06,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, please.

47
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:07,301
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

48
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:20,462
[SPEAKER_00]: So, morphocyticals, actually, we are using different auto recombinant DNA or like as a plasmid form.

49
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:26,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, they are actually inducing different transgenes or fluorescent voltage sensors.

50
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:35,051
[SPEAKER_00]: So either we will prepare them here at house or we can buy them actually, you know, from different commercial vendors.

51
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:44,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for the AVV also we might be actually make it in the house or we might actually buy from commercial vendors.

52
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,915
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the time and also the other factors.

53
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:50,457
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are using mice now.

54
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:57,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these mice will be divided to different groups for different treatment and also different AAV injections.

55
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:06,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually we will perform fluorescent imaging and also spatial biology experiments.

56
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:17,424
[SPEAKER_00]: to find the membrane potential and also change in membrane potential and protein distribution in real time.

57
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:30,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I said previously, we must have to use AAV because we want to infect the living mice and living mouse, and that's why we have to use a virus that can infect these mice and cells.

58
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:32,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, please.

59
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:39,693
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, more physical located at 200 Boston Avenue in Medford.

60
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:50,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have total 1,500 square feet of this space, like 1,100 square feet of lab, and some like 400 square feet of office.

61
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:59,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now currently five employees and so the lab actually designed as a BSL2 lab.

62
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,124
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a one main laboratory lab and also attached tissue culture room.

63
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:13,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So the office actually segregated from the lab and tissue culture by a single space or a single pass air.

64
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:19,923
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we have actually one class two type A2 biosafety cabinet.

65
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:23,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to get access to the morphositicals, we are using the keycard.

66
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:26,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, please.

67
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:31,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the overview, like a map of the morphocyticals.

68
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:39,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So here actually is the, like I can see, but there is a lab and then attached to the lab is the tissue culture room.

69
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:44,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, like it's the office or non lab areas.

70
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:46,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Next please.

71
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:53,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we are using different types of materials here at MorphoCyticals.

72
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:58,698
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are using human actually source materials only.

73
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:01,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using cell lines that drive from human.

74
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:19,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are using actually viral vectors, and for now, specifically, we are using adeno-associated viruses that actually they are categorized as a BSL-1 viruses, and all these viruses are actually inter-replicated incompetent.

75
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:23,325
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot come out from the cells after infection.

76
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:30,366
[SPEAKER_00]: So, also we are using animal materials and our main actual animal now we are using is mice.

77
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,988
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are collaborating with Tufts University.

78
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:42,912
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using their actual vivarium and also we are buying the mouse from different vendors like Charles Devere Laboratory or Jackson Laboratory.

79
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:44,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, please.

80
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:53,217
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a different safety program and policies.

81
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:59,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of safety, we have the biosafety manuals and exposure control plan.

82
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,581
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an emergency action plan.

83
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:04,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a chemical hygiene plan also.

84
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:13,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of BPPs, so all the employees and more physical members

85
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:16,915
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be vaccinated for different vaccines.

86
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:23,679
[SPEAKER_00]: vaccines like the HPV and also other types of vaccinations.

87
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:36,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a plan to actually do yearly titration for the HPV and maybe other, actually, you know, the vaccines.

88
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:47,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we have a contract with Mount Vernon Occupational Health Service to provide all these necessary occupational health services.

89
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:49,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next please.

90
00:08:51,380 --> 00:09:02,648
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one of the important things that actually our policy, one of our more important policy is everyone wants to work with the virus.

91
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,472
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be trained before actually using the viruses or handling the viruses.

92
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:18,024
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's very important for the morphosyntheticals to make sure that we are following all the biosafety policies.

93
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:20,445
[SPEAKER_00]: So next please.

94
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:41,452
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual safety program policies and practices we have in lab, so the policy we have to follow is the full coverage of the foot, so full coverage of the lower leg.

95
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:56,179
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have lab coats, different types of lab coats in the lab, and also safety glasses and also goggles and shields for working with different types of viruses, cells, or materials.

96
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So additionally, we have different types of gloves and also tie-back hair.

97
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,703
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important in morphositicals.

98
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:14,314
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing like Morphine Cytical has, so we are not allowing our employee to use headphones or AirPods in actually the laboratory.

99
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:34,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, so if work needs to be actually conducted after hours, so the person has to inform the supervisor or the safety representative to make sure that he or she is going to follow all the safety and biosafety policies.

100
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:39,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, next please.

101
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:48,344
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, food, drink, and actually any ingestible medicines are not allowed inside the lab.

102
00:10:49,886 --> 00:11:00,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I said again previously, so the person inside the lab, they are not allowed to use personal electronic devices like phone or headphones.

103
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:03,620
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically with gloves on hands.

104
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:27,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have different stickers for inside and outside the labs that's showing like different conditions like biohazards areas or equipments and also where the employee has to wear the gloves or lab coats and where they have not and actually they have to remove them when they come out.

105
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's called gloves on or gloves off.

106
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:43,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to reduce as much as possible using the sharp things because we are working specifically when we are working with the human materials and viral vectors.

107
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:53,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And any BSL 2 materials, so it has to be in a leak-proof secondary container for actually shipment and handling.

108
00:11:54,108 --> 00:12:04,734
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have planned to have IBC meeting at least once a year to review and actually if we need to add any new amendment to that.

109
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:21,567
[SPEAKER_00]: So the IBC Committee of the Morphocytical contains four morphocytical representatives, one community representative, and a non-voting safety consultant mainly from Spotlight Safety Incorporation.

110
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:22,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, please.

111
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:35,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the waste management, we are completely following the IBC regarding all the biological waste and disposals.

112
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:43,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid and sharps bio-waste are completely sealed prior to removal by a company called STRECYCLE.

113
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:51,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid bio-waste will be treated with 10% concentration of the bleach and will be incubated for 20 to 30 minutes before disposal.

114
00:12:53,184 --> 00:13:04,769
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a higher organic load of liquid waste, we are actually mainly using 20% of the final concentration of actually bleach that is determined by the IBC reviewer.

115
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:12,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So all solid bio-waste and hazardous chemical waste is transported from the lab to the loading dock.

116
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:19,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And more specifically, I like to operate as a VSQG for chemical hazards and waste.

117
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:24,647
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we contracted with the Clean Air for chemical waste disposal.

118
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:34,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in the process of getting permit for RDNA and WEST water.

119
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:44,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Both applications I think submitted and already we actually acquired a flammable storage and we scheduled the registration.

120
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:48,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Next please.

121
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:55,968
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have contracts with different vendors for different tasks.

122
00:13:56,148 --> 00:14:01,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, for biological and sharp waste, we have a contract with Destrocycle, it's completed.

123
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,697
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for chemical, we have a contract with Clean Earth.

124
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Occupational health with Mount Auburn and lab.

125
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:13,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, as I said, plenty of different types of lab coats in lab.

126
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:21,337
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fume hood and biosafety cabinet got certificate just recently using the other scientific company.

127
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:26,420
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a contract with Walton pest control to control the pests.

128
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we have a contract with a safety consultant from the spotlight safety.

129
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:34,804
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

130
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:36,810
[SPEAKER_00]: So much.

131
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Any question?

132
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:39,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have one.

133
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:43,675
[SPEAKER_01]: You said the adenovirus cannot replicate?

134
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:46,417
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

135
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,620
[SPEAKER_00]: The adenoviruses cannot replicate when they infect the cells.

136
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,721
[SPEAKER_00]: They are incompetent.

137
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:55,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no chance of human-to-human transfer?

138
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:56,985
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

139
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,106
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

140
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:00,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

141
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:02,689
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

142
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:03,890
[SPEAKER_01]: That's helpful.

143
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:12,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm glad you have those contracts in place already with the Stericycle and the Hazardous Waste Disposal Company.

144
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:18,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I did ask for a couple more documents and I know they were already sent over by Spotlight.

145
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:23,245
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuel wood certification has been completed then as well.

146
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,066
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

147
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:33,153
[SPEAKER_00]: We did almost most of the things we need, I think.

148
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so I'm in the process of still reviewing the application.

149
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:45,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, there were a few missing pieces that have already been sent over as of this morning.

150
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:58,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll continue to go through that and be able to issue the permit as soon as the application is complete, if there's no other questions or concerns.

151
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:04,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And when do you expect to be fully operational?

152
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:06,892
[SPEAKER_03]: once the permit is approved?

153
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:17,735
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope to start by January to be fully operational because we almost received most of the equipments we need.

154
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:25,696
[SPEAKER_00]: And just need the permits to be able to start the work here at InfraCerticals.

155
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:29,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've been actually certified as a BSL2, right?

156
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:30,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

157
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:33,618
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a copy of that documentation as well.

158
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:35,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

159
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:40,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sorry, what documents do you need?

160
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:48,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's another... Because I couldn't get that, so maybe... I'll go through the list, and then we'll go through it in e-mail.

161
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:50,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be easiest.

162
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:52,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

163
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

164
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:55,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

165
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:56,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us.

166
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

167
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me, actually, and thanks for your time.

168
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

169
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

170
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:11,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

171
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:20,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Next on the agenda, I just wanted to let you know what's happening.

172
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:26,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Board of Health has received a grant from the Mass Gaming Commission.

173
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:32,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It's community impact money from the casino, so several

174
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:39,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Surrounding communities of the casino receive are able to apply for these grants through the mass gaming commission.

175
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:53,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were awarded 1 to do data collection and analysis to understand the impact of gambling on 18 to 20 foils in the community.

176
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with the, you know, the.

177
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,872
[SPEAKER_03]: asset presence of online gambling, as well as the casino presence.

178
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:09,758
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to gain some knowledge to inform what we need to do going forward, whether it be for educational campaigns, for some sort of initiatives or support programs.

179
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:22,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're doing right now is just a basic needs assessment using surveys and focus groups with young adults to really see what's impacting them through their gaming environment.

180
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:24,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's kind of exciting.

181
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:26,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really looking forward to it.

182
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:32,375
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of communities around us have already done some of this work, so we'll be learning from them as well.

183
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:36,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've contracted with an outside consulting firm.

184
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:45,327
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually going to help us with the creation of the surveys and the focus group questions, and then do a lot of the analysis and data collection for us.

185
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:46,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exciting.

186
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:47,693
[SPEAKER_03]: More to come on that.

187
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,773
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just getting going.

188
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:55,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're hopefully getting the contract in place as we speak, and we'll be moving forward within the next month.

189
00:18:55,556 --> 00:19:02,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So Catherine from the Office of Prevention and Outreach will also be helping to spearhead this program as well.

190
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:04,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So more to come on that.

191
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,702
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money are we talking about, roughly, per grant?

192
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:11,443
[SPEAKER_03]: We received $72,000.

193
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:19,409
[SPEAKER_02]: and for the next year to do the assessment of the following.

194
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully be wrapping up maybe by the fall, but we'll see.

195
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:23,929
[SPEAKER_03]: See how we do.

196
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:41,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what the hope is is that we can reapply for another grant from the Gaming Commission this year to help us then move forward with some of the initiatives that we learned may be effective once we do the needs assessment.

197
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:43,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully be a continuation.

198
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:45,392
[SPEAKER_02]: of funding.

199
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:53,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And that application for additional funds is due January 7th.

200
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:57,796
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have our work cut out for us between now and then, but I'm hoping to be able to do that.

201
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:04,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I know Jill was under the weather, but she's on the Board of Health meeting.

202
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,519
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to do a quick update on flu and COVID clinics.

203
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, Jill, if you want to join or if you just

204
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:21,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we've concluded most of our flu and COVID clinics for the year.

205
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:37,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done them at a variety of different locations, the senior center, the schools, city hall, the library, and then we're still doing a lot of homebound vaccines now because we still have a lot of high dose flu shots left.

206
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:41,957
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually just ordered some more COVID shots because we're still getting requests for that.

207
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:49,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So still giving out vaccines to people who still need it, but we did get a good number of people vaccinated earlier in the fall.

208
00:20:51,023 --> 00:20:53,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your last clinic was last week at the library.

209
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:54,645
[SPEAKER_03]: You did pretty well, right?

210
00:20:55,205 --> 00:21:02,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we gave out almost 70 vaccines just setting up in the lobby of the library with just walk-ins.

211
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,071
[SPEAKER_04]: So got a good amount of people.

212
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Still taking requests for a home bonus, as Jill mentioned.

213
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:20,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have high dose for the 65 plus population, if anybody's in need, still in need of flu and COVID.

214
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:27,262
[SPEAKER_04]: pediatric COVID vaccines this year, too.

215
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:29,403
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been the biggest demand I saw this year.

216
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:36,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I think because a lot of the pharmacies only, or most of the pharmacies only give COVID vaccines to kids three and older.

217
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:39,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's kind of a gap for the under three population.

218
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:42,228
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of pediatricians don't seem to be stocking it.

219
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:48,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So we gave out a lot of COVID vaccines to babies and little toddlers.

220
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:53,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Jill Zatupa.

221
00:21:56,406 --> 00:22:01,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of screaming.

222
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's all I have.

223
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:10,871
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have business tabled on the agenda.

224
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, anybody wishing to untable that can do so.

225
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:17,693
[SPEAKER_03]: We can continue the discussion or we can keep it on the table.

226
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:21,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's for the negative fee generation regulation.

227
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:28,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we decided to wait and see how things go.

228
00:22:29,843 --> 00:22:32,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is nothing to see how things went, right?

229
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:40,954
[SPEAKER_03]: But a few other communities that have moved forward with it, I believe Chelsea is one of the more recent ones that enacted as well.

230
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:45,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And also now there's Senator Lewis,

231
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:55,869
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, is proposing with the state, um, to take a look at state, uh, possibly enacting state legislation.

232
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,109
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how that goes.

233
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:57,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

234
00:22:57,449 --> 00:23:01,771
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

235
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,492
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have.

236
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:07,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, anybody want to do a motion to adjourn?

237
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:11,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to adjourn.

238
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:13,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get a second?

239
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:14,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

240
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:15,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

241
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:19,408
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll call on that.

242
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:20,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

243
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:21,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

244
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:23,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

245
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:24,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

246
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:26,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn.

247
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:27,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

248
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:28,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
