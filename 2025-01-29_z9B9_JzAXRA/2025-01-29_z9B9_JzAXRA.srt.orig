00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:04,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

22
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:06,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Topp?

23
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:07,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

24
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:08,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Olopade?

25
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,041
[SPEAKER_03]: He's joining me, but I'll put him as absent for now.

26
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:18,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Reinfeldt?

27
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:19,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

28
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:21,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Rousseau, present.

29
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:21,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor Leung, concurrent.

30
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:24,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Presently absent.

31
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:24,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

32
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:33,452
[SPEAKER_03]: So next up is the committee of windows.

33
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:33,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

34
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:39,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the discussion about the conflict of interest disclosure from the interim superintendent.

35
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:45,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we could hand that over to our interim superintendent, Dr. Glusi.

36
00:02:53,235 --> 00:03:06,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so I'm disclosed to members of the school committee that my spouse husband is a Medford High School physical education teacher.

37
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:17,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just disclosed the conflict of interest in terms of being participating in the teacher negotiation process.

38
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:21,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do believe that I have some

39
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to make this statement and have the school committee discuss the resolution in order for me to participate in the process, the negotiations.

40
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:43,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll jump in and say that I certainly, well, thank you for this.

41
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:51,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly think that we should vote to allow the interim superintendent to participate in negotiations.

42
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:59,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a challenge as an understatement to not have your voice in the negotiations with our largest labor union.

43
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:03,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all I have to say.

44
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:09,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if Member Graham can see the screen.

45
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly can.

46
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll just call on Member Ntapa.

47
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:14,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Member Russo.

48
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:24,802
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question, so I know I had to do the disclosure because of my own cousin-in-law, long lost union.

49
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:27,444
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, this seems like direct

50
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:37,183
[SPEAKER_01]: conflict of interest law, like the disclosure is only if you're not affected by conflict of interest.

51
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:43,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone may think that you, like, that's just my interpretation.

52
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:52,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I do think it would be, you know, beneficial, I don't understand how us voting goes around the law and what it's set forth by.

53
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:59,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure, Dr. Galusi, you've seeked, you know, legal counsel on this, but I just don't understand how

54
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:06,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the mayor has to recuse herself, member Brantley might have to both because they have siblings like that doesn't bring financial.

55
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:09,382
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't affect the finances of the household.

56
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:10,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And this does.

57
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:13,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

58
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:14,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Dapa, if I may.

59
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:26,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So the conflict of interest law includes this whole section that allows for, for instance, the very simple example is that the city council is the only group that can give themselves a raise.

60
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,669
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all in conflict.

61
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:35,210
[SPEAKER_03]: The conflict of interest law does in fact allow for when no other alternative exists.

62
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:42,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So if four members of the school committee, for instance, were to have conflicts during negotiations,

63
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:46,586
[SPEAKER_03]: would not have a quorum that could vote to approve a contract.

64
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:51,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that case, the conflict of interest law has sort of a safety valve.

65
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:56,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, there would be just an inability for government to function.

66
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:01,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in this case, that's how I interpret this situation, is that the

67
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:12,749
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent, if she recuses herself, leaves us with the most important and only valid voice, because she's the only one who works for us.

68
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,712
[SPEAKER_03]: We could not continue with negotiations.

69
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:20,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my interpretation of how that works.

70
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:42,570
[SPEAKER_04]: and i know member graham um has her hand raised i would also just kind of say that um i'm not a voting person the contract this the negotiation process it is a contract between the teachers union and the school committee so for me it's just the voice at the table in terms of

71
00:06:43,610 --> 00:07:07,423
[SPEAKER_04]: uh to member russo's part on behalf of the the schools and the functioning of the schools but i'm also not a voting member on the contract i'm just assisting and helping with the school committee facilitate the process i understand so thank you because that that i don't i don't want it to seem like i that you didn't that i thought you didn't do your homework or anything i was just confused because i've undergone

72
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:33,269
[SPEAKER_01]: this training for like four years now and I just never knew of the safety net because it's been something that's been a concern of mine as a city and state employee but I'm glad to hear that because that makes sense there had to be there'd have to be some form of safety net built in because again like if everyone had conflict on the committee we didn't have quorum what we do um so yeah I just had a question that that was that was a question is how what is the the statute and precedent set forth by this so that makes sense though so thank you.

73
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Grant.

74
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:39,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I was going to say the same thing.

75
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:47,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the key differentiator between Dr. Lucy and others who may have conflicts are that she is not a contract holder, right?

76
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:50,158
[SPEAKER_06]: So she doesn't have the voting authority to approve a contract.

77
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:55,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So she therefore is sort of in a different lane of conflict of interest than the rest of us are.

78
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:56,662
[SPEAKER_06]: members.

79
00:07:56,722 --> 00:08:01,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So I forwarded you an email from Attorney Greenspan, who was not able to be here today.

80
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:06,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a specific paragraph that I think would be useful to read out loud.

81
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,162
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the official

82
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:14,905
[SPEAKER_06]: to 68, a disclosure, whatever it's called, before we call a vote.

83
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:27,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the way attorney Greenspan explained it to both myself and Dr. Lucy, they, they will, she will also file paperwork with the clerk.

84
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:35,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and he also reminded me that there have been other superintendents here in Medford in this exact same situation, this is the process.

85
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So

86
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,624
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not unusual in the superintendent's ranks to come across.

87
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:42,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

88
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:46,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I will read that, but first I'll let member Brandly speak next.

89
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:50,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Hiya.

90
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I was going to say the same as I think that Dr. Glucy said.

91
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:57,236
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different when you're a voting member, which is why I do have to step away from the table.

92
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:02,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk to ethics the other day again, and the

93
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,279
[SPEAKER_00]: factor is the voting member.

94
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,562
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will step away from the table just like the mayor's doing.

95
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:21,527
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously when budget season comes, I can vote, but we just have to remove that section like we did last time to elementary.

96
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:29,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanna let you know my update and then say the same thing about having the difference being the voting member.

97
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,793
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my two cents.

98
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:33,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

99
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:36,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to read this language that we've received from our attorney.

100
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:41,568
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion, which if somebody can.

101
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really the chair so I can just make this motion and then somebody can second it and I don't have to keep reading it because it's a little long.

102
00:09:49,373 --> 00:10:12,848
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is, whereas the superintendent of schools has made a full disclosure that her spouse is a member of the Medford Teachers Association and has a financial interest in the contract between the Medford School Committee and the Medford Teachers Association, and whereas the school committee has determined that the superintendent's interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the school committee may expect from the superintendent,

103
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:23,671
[SPEAKER_03]: and whereas the school committee approves the superintendent's participation in collective bargaining with the Medford Teachers Association, pursuant to general law chapter 268A, section 19B.

104
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:24,671
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the motion.

105
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mr. Tapa.

106
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:30,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry.

107
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:38,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to also, so thank you to my colleagues for explaining the voting piece, because that wasn't explained when I spoke with the attorney the other day.

108
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:40,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So this makes complete sense.

109
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:42,035
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just

110
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:48,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I factored into every other conflict of interest saying we have to recuse ourselves, but that makes sense.

111
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:50,576
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, I can second the motion.

112
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other conversation?

113
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:08,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any members of the public that would like to speak?

114
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there are members of the public that are meeting.

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,584
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, and in light of the motion being made and seconded, I'll do a roll call.

116
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:22,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Brandley?

117
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:24,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

118
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:26,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

119
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:27,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

120
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:28,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ntapa?

121
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:29,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

122
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:31,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Olopade?

123
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:32,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

124
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Rheinfeld?

125
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:34,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

126
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:36,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Rousseau, yes.

127
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mayor Lungo-Kern is absent.

128
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:40,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

129
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,557
[SPEAKER_03]: That was lovely.

130
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:45,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I am really, really glad that there was language redrafted.

131
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would entertain a motion to adjourn.

132
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:53,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

133
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:54,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I second.

134
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:56,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was the first?

135
00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:58,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

136
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

137
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:02,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Brantley.

138
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:03,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

139
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:04,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

140
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:05,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

141
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:06,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ntapa.

142
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:07,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

143
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:08,696
