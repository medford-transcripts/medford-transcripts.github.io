The agenda is of a roll call.

15
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:45,052
And then we'll be discussing a conflict of interest disclosure with the interim superintendent of schools, followed by adjournment.

16
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:53,319
I could take the role once I find my seat.

17
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,579
There it is.

18
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:00,604
Member Branley?

19
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:01,445
Present.

20
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:02,565
Member Grant?

21
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:04,787
Here.

22
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:06,308
Member Topp?

23
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:07,329
Present.

24
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:08,690
Member Olopade?

25
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,041
He's joining me, but I'll put him as absent for now.

26
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:18,382
Member Reinfeldt?

27
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:19,103
Here.

28
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:21,184
Member Rousseau, present.

29
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:21,925
Mayor Leung, concurrent.

30
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:24,466
Presently absent.

31
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:24,987
Okay.

32
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:33,452
So next up is the committee of windows.

33
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:33,893
Sorry.

34
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:39,096
It's the discussion about the conflict of interest disclosure from the interim superintendent.

35
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:45,393
I guess we could hand that over to our interim superintendent, Dr. Glusi.

36
00:02:53,235 --> 00:03:06,400
Yes, so I'm disclosed to members of the school committee that my spouse husband is a Medford High School physical education teacher.

37
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:17,304
And so I just disclosed the conflict of interest in terms of being participating in the teacher negotiation process.

38
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:21,145
And I do believe that I have some

39
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:35,450
I had to make this statement and have the school committee discuss the resolution in order for me to participate in the process, the negotiations.

40
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:43,240
I'll jump in and say that I certainly, well, thank you for this.

41
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:51,668
I certainly think that we should vote to allow the interim superintendent to participate in negotiations.

42
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:59,936
It would be a challenge as an understatement to not have your voice in the negotiations with our largest labor union.

43
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:03,299
So that's all I have to say.

44
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:09,310
And I don't know if Member Graham can see the screen.

45
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,051
I certainly can.

46
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,692
So I'll just call on Member Ntapa.

47
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:14,815
Thank you, Member Russo.

48
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:24,802
So my question, so I know I had to do the disclosure because of my own cousin-in-law, long lost union.

49
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:27,444
But to me, this seems like direct

50
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:37,183
conflict of interest law, like the disclosure is only if you're not affected by conflict of interest.

51
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:43,765
And someone may think that you, like, that's just my interpretation.

52
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:52,528
So while I do think it would be, you know, beneficial, I don't understand how us voting goes around the law and what it's set forth by.

53
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:59,430
I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure, Dr. Galusi, you've seeked, you know, legal counsel on this, but I just don't understand how

54
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:06,917
Because if the mayor has to recuse herself, member Brantley might have to both because they have siblings like that doesn't bring financial.

55
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:09,382
It doesn't affect the finances of the household.

56
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:10,144
And this does.

57
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:13,246
Right?

58
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:14,846
Member Dapa, if I may.

59
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:26,729
So the conflict of interest law includes this whole section that allows for, for instance, the very simple example is that the city council is the only group that can give themselves a raise.

60
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,669
They're all in conflict.

61
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:35,210
The conflict of interest law does in fact allow for when no other alternative exists.

62
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:42,032
So if four members of the school committee, for instance, were to have conflicts during negotiations,

63
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:46,586
would not have a quorum that could vote to approve a contract.

64
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:51,911
So in that case, the conflict of interest law has sort of a safety valve.

65
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:56,275
Otherwise, there would be just an inability for government to function.

66
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:01,440
And so in this case, that's how I interpret this situation, is that the

67
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:12,749
The superintendent, if she recuses herself, leaves us with the most important and only valid voice, because she's the only one who works for us.

68
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,712
We could not continue with negotiations.

69
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:20,497
So that's my interpretation of how that works.

70
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:42,570
and i know member graham um has her hand raised i would also just kind of say that um i'm not a voting person the contract this the negotiation process it is a contract between the teachers union and the school committee so for me it's just the voice at the table in terms of

71
00:06:43,610 --> 00:07:07,423
uh to member russo's part on behalf of the the schools and the functioning of the schools but i'm also not a voting member on the contract i'm just assisting and helping with the school committee facilitate the process i understand so thank you because that that i don't i don't want it to seem like i that you didn't that i thought you didn't do your homework or anything i was just confused because i've undergone

72
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:33,269
this training for like four years now and I just never knew of the safety net because it's been something that's been a concern of mine as a city and state employee but I'm glad to hear that because that makes sense there had to be there'd have to be some form of safety net built in because again like if everyone had conflict on the committee we didn't have quorum what we do um so yeah I just had a question that that was that was a question is how what is the the statute and precedent set forth by this so that makes sense though so thank you.

73
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,610
Member Grant.

74
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:39,053
Yes, I was going to say the same thing.

75
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:47,337
I think the key differentiator between Dr. Lucy and others who may have conflicts are that she is not a contract holder, right?

76
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:50,158
So she doesn't have the voting authority to approve a contract.

77
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:55,220
So she therefore is sort of in a different lane of conflict of interest than the rest of us are.

78
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:56,662
members.

79
00:07:56,722 --> 00:08:01,148
So I forwarded you an email from Attorney Greenspan, who was not able to be here today.

80
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:06,276
And there's a specific paragraph that I think would be useful to read out loud.

81
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,162
That is the official

82
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:14,905
to 68, a disclosure, whatever it's called, before we call a vote.

83
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:27,534
And then the way attorney Greenspan explained it to both myself and Dr. Lucy, they, they will, she will also file paperwork with the clerk.

84
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:35,020
And, and he also reminded me that there have been other superintendents here in Medford in this exact same situation, this is the process.

85
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,160
So

86
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,624
it's not unusual in the superintendent's ranks to come across.

87
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:42,825
Thank you.

88
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:46,228
I will read that, but first I'll let member Brandly speak next.

89
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:50,791
Hiya.

90
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,854
So yes, I was going to say the same as I think that Dr. Glucy said.

91
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:57,236
It's different when you're a voting member, which is why I do have to step away from the table.

92
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:02,780
I did talk to ethics the other day again, and the

93
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,279
factor is the voting member.

94
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,562
So I will step away from the table just like the mayor's doing.

95
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:21,527
And then obviously when budget season comes, I can vote, but we just have to remove that section like we did last time to elementary.

96
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:29,752
And so I just wanna let you know my update and then say the same thing about having the difference being the voting member.

97
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,793
So that was my two cents.

98
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:33,257
Thank you.

99
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:36,782
I'm just going to read this language that we've received from our attorney.

100
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:41,568
The motion, which if somebody can.

101
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,298
I'm not really the chair so I can just make this motion and then somebody can second it and I don't have to keep reading it because it's a little long.

102
00:09:49,373 --> 00:10:12,848
The motion is, whereas the superintendent of schools has made a full disclosure that her spouse is a member of the Medford Teachers Association and has a financial interest in the contract between the Medford School Committee and the Medford Teachers Association, and whereas the school committee has determined that the superintendent's interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the school committee may expect from the superintendent,

103
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:23,671
and whereas the school committee approves the superintendent's participation in collective bargaining with the Medford Teachers Association, pursuant to general law chapter 268A, section 19B.

104
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:24,671
That is the motion.

105
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,672
And Mr. Tapa.

106
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:30,052
Yeah, sorry.

107
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:38,254
I just wanted to also, so thank you to my colleagues for explaining the voting piece, because that wasn't explained when I spoke with the attorney the other day.

108
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:40,835
So this makes complete sense.

109
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:42,035
So I just

110
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:48,815
Yeah, I factored into every other conflict of interest saying we have to recuse ourselves, but that makes sense.

111
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:50,576
So with that being said, I can second the motion.

112
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,580
Is there any other conversation?

113
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:08,502
Is there any members of the public that would like to speak?

114
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,643
I don't think there are members of the public that are meeting.

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,584
All right, well, and in light of the motion being made and seconded, I'll do a roll call.

116
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:22,985
Member Brandley?

117
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:24,806
Yes.

118
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:26,247
Member Graham?

119
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:27,347
Yes.

120
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:28,768
Member Ntapa?

121
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:29,648
Yes.

122
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:31,069
Member Olopade?

123
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:32,070
Yes.

124
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,610
Member Rheinfeld?

125
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:34,371
Yes.

126
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:36,132
Member Rousseau, yes.

127
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,313
And Mayor Lungo-Kern is absent.

128
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:40,736
Wonderful.

129
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,557
That was lovely.

130
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:45,820
I am really, really glad that there was language redrafted.

131
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,823
So I would entertain a motion to adjourn.

132
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:53,725
Motion to adjourn.

133
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:54,666
I second.

134
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:56,487
Who was the first?

135
00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:58,809
Member Graham.

136
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,030
Thank you.

137
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:02,351
Member Brantley.

138
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:03,172
Yes.

139
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:04,133
Member Graham.

140
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:05,374
Yes.

141
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:06,634
Member Ntapa.

142
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:07,435
Yes.

143
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:08,696
Member Olopade.

144
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:09,537
Yes.

145
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:11,159
Member Rideville.

146
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:11,920
Yes.

147
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,221
Member Russo.

148
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:13,741
Yes.

149
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,183
Mayor Lingo Kern is absent.

150
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,584
Thank you, everyone.

151
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:17,685
This meeting is adjourned.

152
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:18,306
Have a lovely day.

153
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:19,126
Thanks.
