1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:03,333
Thank you very much, Teresa, for all of your technical support.

2
00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:12,540
I am calling to order the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee on Tuesday, June 11, 2024 at 6.30 p.m.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,143
in room 201 of Medford City Hall and via Zoom.

4
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:18,824
We are meeting hybridly.

5
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:29,092
And the meeting will be recorded and be available for anyone who is not able to be here in person as soon as possible after the fact.

6
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:45,233
So I will start off with a, going by the agenda, a review of an off-cycle grant application for Medford Public Schools Bicycle Infrastructure Enhancements.

7
00:00:45,953 --> 00:00:51,355
So who is going to give us a presentation of this grant application?

8
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:53,676
Dr. Cushman, by the way.

9
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:56,156
Hello, how is everyone?

10
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:57,617
Doing well.

11
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:04,239
Awesome, so thank you very much for considering this off cycle grant application.

12
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,226
Our 1st, want to just say thank you to the CPC for all of the support you've given to the men for public schools over the past couple of years.

13
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:17,615
In particular, the McGlynn playground, which is turning out nicely and I think is on the agenda later on this evening.

14
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:25,360
Um, so this is really, um, a long time coming bicycle infrastructure upgrades.

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,522
We at the Met for public schools have some really old style.

16
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:29,582
Um.

17
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:42,443
We have some really old-style bike racks, and we have absolutely no bicycle repair kiosks, I'll call them, anywhere within the Medford Public Schools.

18
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:52,607
So I'm proposing that we will, first of all, install modern bicycle racks at the McGlynn and Medford High School.

19
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,948
We have recently done this with the help of a grant.

20
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:56,369
Oh, no.

21
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:58,189
It's frozen.

22
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,690
Sorry.

23
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,441
You're back now.

24
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,889
All right, sorry.

25
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:34,800
So we've installed bike racks, new updated bike racks at the Andrews Middle School, and this grant application is to make sure that these are installed at Medford High School, as well as installing bicycle pumps and repair stations at Medford High School, the Andrews Middle School, and the McGlynn Complex.

26
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:46,480
And with the Clippership Connector coming online, we really want to encourage cycling to school.

27
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:57,429
We want to try to reduce our reliance on students taking the buses as much as possible and thereby hopefully reduce the reliance on fossil fuels.

28
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:02,753
Thank you very much.

29
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:08,078
Are there questions, comments from committee members?

30
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,953
I have a question.

31
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:23,326
So normally we only accept the off-cycle applications for reasons that say that we need the funding now because of some other outward stressor.

32
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:31,588
So whether it's some other grant funding that we're getting with it, that you have to do it by X date or something like that.

33
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:39,811
So while I understand that you said you wanna encourage for the students to come to school on bikes,

34
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:45,790
I'm wondering what is the timeline on this installation and why is it off cycle?

35
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:54,673
So it is off cycle because the timeline would be to install them for the start of school next year.

36
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,314
Next year or next school year?

37
00:03:58,895 --> 00:03:59,975
Next school year.

38
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:01,716
So September of 2024.

39
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:06,697
Sorry, we in school talk when we say next year.

40
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:11,799
We always mean like, you know, it could be September, we might say, God, I hope next year is better.

41
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:24,484
So, you know, the, but the reality is we want to get them installed for August, September, so that they are there right at the start and in the good weather.

42
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:50,571
uh and then students hopefully will see uh the bicycle repair kiosks and they'll be more encouraged to be like oh if i have a problem i'll be able to address it if my tire is flat there'll be a pump there um those types of um considerations have been the other uh what is the timeline do you know what the timeline is for this i know you said by august so is it a two month is it a three month is it a

43
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:59,996
We expect about 8 weeks for product to be delivered and then installed at the schools at the McGlynn.

44
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:09,882
I'd hopefully get the product in in time so that the work construction would be able to install it while they're still on site with the McGlynn playground.

45
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:16,746
And then our own maintenance personnel would install the others across the district.

46
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:19,487
And while this is a cycle,

47
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:29,180
Why this is off cycle is we had really hoped to do this in-house with our metal fab shop, bike racks themselves.

48
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:40,663
But the reality is that we have another safety issue as far as students waiting for the buses up along the West courtyard of the high school.

49
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:50,425
So the resources of the metal fab shop have been diverted to build almost amusement park kiosks slash

50
00:05:52,046 --> 00:06:00,430
line barriers for students to be able to filter in because they tend to press up against the curbs as buses approach.

51
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:04,473
And when you have several hundred students out there, it's a safety concern.

52
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,534
So we've diverted our concerns there.

53
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:15,359
The other reason why I'm applying off-cycle, quite honestly, is our budget does not allow us to really do things like this.

54
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:26,847
If I'm going to be honest, we right now have several capital projects that really need our attention from HVAC repairs, a water boiler that recently went.

55
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:39,851
And these, I would say, investments in what we hope to do and what we hope to encourage are sometimes delayed by our aging facilities.

56
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:53,719
Reporter, I have a question.

57
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:05,151
So that you know, those of us who are in City Hall are having a difficult time because the wireless is stopping and starting.

58
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:09,576
So we're hearing about 80% of what everyone is saying.

59
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:14,800
Okay, because my video for Mr. Cushing did not go in and out.

60
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,900
It must be there.

61
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:20,303
Okay, well, we can just do our best.

62
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:24,105
If you need to repeat the text or the question, that's fine.

63
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:26,507
Look, obviously, this is a great idea.

64
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:30,129
I want as many students as possible to ride to school.

65
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:40,778
has the will and frankly the courage because it's still challenging to ride anywhere in a bike, even with the increased bike pass over the years.

66
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:47,765
My only question was really one of the planning that's gone into this because there's no diagrams that show exactly where these go on the site.

67
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:50,747
how many they are, the numbers there, the quantities.

68
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:57,752
But in terms of clearances, other things, it's always a concern when I don't even really know where they are.

69
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:03,997
They're obviously near the entrances of all these schools, but there's more than one entrance to a few of these schools, obviously.

70
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,499
It'd just be nice to have a diagram

71
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:20,704
It wouldn't prevent me from voting for this, but at least understand where they are so that we know the dildo and this has been done about ADA clearances, making sure that there's still a three-foot sidewalk on each side of it for passengers, for anyone in a wheelchair.

72
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:28,767
Those like ADA 101 accessibility things, which I know you're aware of Mr. Cushing, but it's just a question I have.

73
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:32,108
It's more of a follow-up than it is a requirement for this voting.

74
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:45,805
Well, and what I would do is I'd work with Francis Nwaje, who has been extraordinarily helpful with the revamping of parking that has gone on at Medford High School.

75
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:55,670
If you haven't been up to Medford High School in a while, over the April vacation, we replaced all of the loop parking, as we call it, at the main entrance.

76
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,832
So my parking space and other senior leadership spaces, we remove them.

77
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:06,560
And we made, we went from having two ADA accessible parking spaces to having seven.

78
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,585
And then we made the other, I think it was eight or nine spaces.

79
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:12,328
I think it was nine spaces.

80
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:14,811
We made them nine.

81
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:17,154
I'm sorry, we made them eight

82
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:40,987
um pull in as opposed to angle the angle when you're backing out there and people don't slow down coming down the hill from the cte side uh you take your life into your own hands um so we made those so they're more perpendicular parking as opposed to angle and made them all visitor we also just so everyone's aware made a reserve space for veteran parking as well there

83
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:52,256
Not germane to this, but basically to say, I'm happy to work with Todd Evans, Owen, and Francis Novalje to make sure that these are properly sited.

84
00:09:53,597 --> 00:10:00,303
We were going to simply replace them where the existing ones were and dispose of the existing structures.

85
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:04,046
Do you have a cut of what the design of this is?

86
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:07,769
There's obviously a wide variety of designs of these type of things.

87
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:11,479
Uh, if you give me 1 2nd, I can definitely pull it up.

88
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,664
Okay, thank you.

89
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:18,768
No, while he's doing that, Roberta, can you remind me again?

90
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:19,509
What are.

91
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,595
Regular funding cycle is like, when the applications are due and when we award.

92
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:32,781
Yes, actually, I'll defer to Teresa for what the specific deadlines are.

93
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:44,089
But typically, we're receiving applications, I think, in September, and deliberating from October through December.

94
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:54,517
And then we're sending those award, those recommendations to City Council typically in January and February.

95
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:55,956
That's correct.

96
00:10:56,136 --> 00:11:02,878
Yeah, our application round goes open July 9th this year for a seven-week application period.

97
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,239
Thank you.

98
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,159
Of course.

99
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:09,280
It's a good question.

100
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,001
Yes.

101
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:19,262
I was just wondering, Dr. Cushing, could you explain to me what a bicycle repair kiosk is?

102
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:21,203
Absolutely.

103
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:22,323
I can show you right now.

104
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:30,269
Well, the other part of my question is, who's going to maintain it?

105
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:35,392
So generally speaking, they should be maintenance free, save any vandalism.

106
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:44,760
And that would be our maintenance team and our school principals to be able to make sure that they are not being damaged.

107
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:52,526
We would also place them in an area where they would be on a camera so that vandalism would hopefully be deterred.

108
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:58,528
So, this is the bike repair station that I have submitted.

109
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,510
It's cost effective.

110
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:16,897
It comes with a stainless steel bicycle pump with a meter on it to know your pressure and then a number of bicycle tools on heavy duty.

111
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:24,090
Cables so that you can repair your bike and then you also.

112
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:34,639
Getting a sales pitch there and then these right here are stanchions that you can lift your bike up on and hang it up on the frame.

113
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:36,921
So you can work on it.

114
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:44,148
And then the bike racks just so let me get to them real quick.

115
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:51,538
These are the ones that we are looking to install.

116
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:57,446
And I think I selected the blue for school colors.

117
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,791
But yeah.

118
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:07,299
So these, any one of these gives you a good sense.

119
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,741
I believe the ones I selected were in the $198 range and they direct bolt to the ground.

120
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:18,263
You can direct bolt them to a frame, but it's really not necessary if you're direct bolting to the ground.

121
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:23,806
Uh, we were, we are installing at the McGlynn this bollard style.

122
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:23,866
Um,

123
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,621
but we've had some luck with the U as well.

124
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:36,022
And you can see how the cost can really skyrocket on some of these.

125
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:39,262
Yeah, some of the creative ones are very pricey.

126
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:41,743
I know you have a tight budget here, so I appreciate that.

127
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,143
The blue color makes sense to me.

128
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:47,604
Okay, that's all the questions I have.

129
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:47,944
Thank you.

130
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:49,185
Thank you.

131
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:56,787
What will be the capacity?

132
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,547
How many bicycles will be able to park?

133
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:00,965
I'm sorry, say that again.

134
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:02,846
What will be the capacity?

135
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:04,687
How many bicycles will be able to park?

136
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:11,550
Between 20 and 30 based on the number of racks I've submitted at each location.

137
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:18,733
Between 20 and 30, sorry.

138
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:29,157
Yes, between 20 and 30 at Medford High School up to 40, 45 actually, because I doubled the number in the request for Medford High School.

139
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:31,144
Thank you.

140
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:46,031
And can you remind us, or are you able, Teresa, to show the budget for this project and the amount of funding that is currently available?

141
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:47,251
Yes.

142
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:50,393
I can pull up the budget for this.

143
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:56,715
I apologize about the internet issues we're having here.

144
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,696
It's the first time it's happened.

145
00:14:59,156 --> 00:14:59,357
Yeah.

146
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:01,343
But, you know.

147
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:11,794
You're competing with a popular meeting next door, so.

148
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:19,343
I honestly think that is, we're a fair amount of people charging into here right now.

149
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:20,665
Why can't I rotate this?

150
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:37,702
While I'm wrestling with this, our available balance, actually, right now, this is not considering any fiscal 25 monies.

151
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:41,944
We have about $112,000 available to us.

152
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:46,827
Some of you may say, well, Teresa, didn't you say recently that we had about $100,000?

153
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:55,191
I've been able to claw some money back from projects that didn't go forward or finished under budget or what have you.

154
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,887
So we have $112,000 available to us right now.

155
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,831
I'm always happy to help spend anything you guys have extra.

156
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:07,397
Well, I think we can always count on you.

157
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:08,198
You're looking for $20,000, right?

158
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:21,339
I think with contingencies, I think I submitted it for $20,000, but the actual hard dollars came out in the $17,000 range.

159
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,600
I don't have it in front of me right now.

160
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:27,005
And the reason why I submitted the $20,000 overall was just

161
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:32,047
you know, factoring in for contingencies and whatever else I need to push back.

162
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:35,789
I also apologize for the handwriting on this.

163
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:45,012
It was, it was doing some funky stuff where whenever I typed in one thing, it replaced everything else with the thing I just typed in.

164
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:45,773
So I apologize.

165
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:47,213
I didn't mind.

166
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,314
Yeah, it was on the wrong screen.

167
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:59,752
He's saying as a budget problem on auto bill, everything from the first line to go do backpacks all the way down.

168
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:00,272
Okay.

169
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:00,953
So, yeah.

170
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:04,375
Shipping is, it's the bane of my existence.

171
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,597
I'm not going to lie.

172
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:15,984
In previous incantations as a school principal, I would sometimes drive to locations working for a poor district to pick things up because the shipping was insane.

173
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:17,385
I agree.

174
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,267
It's out of control.

175
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:23,063
What can you do?

176
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:24,685
Yep.

177
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:29,490
So you want to go on a road trip and pick these up in South Carolina or wherever they're from?

178
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:30,271
Right.

179
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:31,172
Yeah.

180
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:34,055
Teresa, when's the Clippership Connector going to be finished?

181
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:36,378
That's an excellent question.

182
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:40,002
I thought so.

183
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,365
I thought you know everything, Teresa.

184
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,071
I have heard that they are ahead of schedule.

185
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,572
I don't know what that means, though.

186
00:17:48,893 --> 00:18:01,424
I don't know what the end date was, but their progress has been switched.

187
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:04,827
Is there further discussion from the committee on this request?

188
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,434
Would anyone like to make a motion regarding this proposal?

189
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,136
Is there anyone from the public who wanted to speak on it?

190
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,078
Come on, Janine, you know you want to.

191
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:34,660
I move that we take the proposal and add $20,000 for public schools.

192
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:46,079
of the bike project.

193
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,545
So Reg moves to recommend funding $20,000 for this project.

194
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,566
Is there someone who'd like to second that motion?

195
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:58,087
Second.

196
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:00,488
All right.

197
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:02,910
Thank you.

198
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:11,556
And so I will call the roll for those who would like to recommend funding.

199
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:12,296
Doug?

200
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:13,397
Yes.

201
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:14,968
Joan?

202
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,249
Yes.

203
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:19,130
No.

204
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,091
Joan, you froze.

205
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,791
If you can hear us, we'll have to have you repeat it.

206
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:24,551
I said yes.

207
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:26,292
Thank you.

208
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:28,393
This is the most frustrating.

209
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:29,393
I heard her say yes.

210
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:30,293
Thank you.

211
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:30,654
Craig?

212
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:31,774
Yes.

213
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:33,294
Ari?

214
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:35,055
Yes.

215
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:37,996
I saw Kaylene.

216
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:39,397
Yes.

217
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,037
And myself, yes.

218
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:43,418
I think that was all of us.

219
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:46,504
I believe it was, yes.

220
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:48,385
I'll make that soon.

221
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,368
I really want to thank you again.

222
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:56,211
Your support is going to help.

223
00:19:56,331 --> 00:20:03,577
When you see the finished product at McGlynn, your support is going to transform the experience of our students' lives.

224
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:04,998
There's no doubt about it.

225
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:05,979
So thank you.

226
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,041
And if they use all of them up, come back for more.

227
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,605
I know you have room to put more than that for you.

228
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:28,667
So, so Teresa, just a reminder when the, when this is written up for the council, just make sure that the conditions in there about, uh, for record plan and not kind of the, the type, the, you know, all the pieces in there is just there for the record.

229
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,148
So the public will have access to that.

230
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,690
Certainly.

231
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,110
Yeah.

232
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:39,416
I'm just going to try to switch my wifi.

233
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:40,957
I think it might stay on, but

234
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:43,522
I apologize in advance.

235
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:48,063
If we get booted, folks can just go back into the link, because this is tough right now.

236
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,084
So hopefully it just doesn't boot us.

237
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:53,925
Peter's not on the phone, so maybe we won't get booted.

238
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:56,405
Yeah, I signed in on my phone, too, actually.

239
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:57,386
It's a good point.

240
00:20:57,446 --> 00:20:57,846
Thank you.

241
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:04,087
I would also love to know how you guys set up that four screen.

242
00:21:04,107 --> 00:21:07,988
It's going to cost you.

243
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,321
I'm going to move on to the next item on the agenda.

244
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:46,354
And that is a small grant applications.

245
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:56,158
We have two small grant applications for basketball hoop play elements at the Roberts School and for a gaga ball pit at McGlynn School.

246
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:59,900
So who would like to speak to us about this?

247
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,681
I'm Teresa by the way.

248
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,302
Nice to meet you.

249
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:14,843
So I mean, you're bringing in the professionals.

250
00:22:15,003 --> 00:22:16,304
What is this?

251
00:22:16,964 --> 00:22:25,891
This professional is here and is incredibly brave tonight because his partners in crime are all in the baseball championship tonight.

252
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:30,555
All three of the other kids could not skip their game tonight because it's the final.

253
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:32,517
So they're very sad to not be here.

254
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,839
I guess I actually have to look here to look at all of you.

255
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:35,819
But so I'm here.

256
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:45,110
as me and you all know me, but I'm also here as a member of the PTO with the Roberts.

257
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,271
But I'm going to actually let John, he's prepared some remarks.

258
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:51,352
So he's going to start.

259
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:55,613
And then you want to say your name too.

260
00:22:56,933 --> 00:23:02,075
Your first and last.

261
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:10,158
During class one day, some of my classmates and I decided we wanted to bring the idea of getting a basketball hoop to the principal.

262
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:11,808
When we brought it to Ms.

263
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:15,189
Bowles' attention, she was in favor of our request.

264
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:22,713
The Roberts Elementary School does not currently have any structured playground equipment for the older children in attendance.

265
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:27,276
A basketball hoop would fit in the existing playground area.

266
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:34,340
The basketball hoop would help with hand-eye coordination, as well as exercise and team building skills.

267
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,942
Currently, the older kids are playing unorganized games around the playground.

268
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,104
Most of our fourth grade classmates have an interest in having a basketball hoop as well.

269
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:51,647
It would be a cost-effective addition to the existing playground for older Robert's students.

270
00:23:52,928 --> 00:23:53,349
Nice.

271
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:54,309
Thank you.

272
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:56,110
Thank you very much.

273
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,251
That was very compelling.

274
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:01,074
Awesome.

275
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:15,618
So we did get a couple of different quotes and we need to, basically it looked like about 3,000 for the materials and about 2,000 for the installation.

276
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:23,860
I mentioned on the application that we do have an existing application in with the community funds through the mayor's office.

277
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,620
And we have not heard back on that.

278
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,441
That proposal included the basketball hoop and a gaga ball pit.

279
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:38,636
So we are happy to partner with those two organizations to get this project funded in whatever way best serves the needs of the community.

280
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:46,161
The Gaga football pit is about, is just under 5,000 as well, and will be the same inclusive model within the plan.

281
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:55,168
And we need to make final determination as a team, right, about whether or not it's going to be a double rim or a single rim.

282
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:59,076
is a single rim has better playing, but a double rim is more durable.

283
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,636
And so the kids and I have actually been going back and forth with students.

284
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:19,060
I have been going back and forth about kind of the trade-offs, the pros and cons of each of those models and what that would cost and whether or not safety padding outside is the best plan to make sure students are safe, but also is it durable outside?

285
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,301
So there's a couple of kind of final proposal questions we have.

286
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,252
that if awarded funding, we'll be able to answer pretty quickly with our current rep.

287
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:29,794
Thank you.

288
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:30,614
Thank you both.

289
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:37,138
Are there questions or comments from committee members?

290
00:25:37,178 --> 00:25:37,978
Yes, French.

291
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:42,681
I hate to say this, but I don't know what a gaga mom is.

292
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:43,941
Me neither.

293
00:25:44,302 --> 00:25:46,203
I think it has something to do with Lady Gaga.

294
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:46,603
No.

295
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:52,166
I think Mr. O'Brien might have the website pulled up for his presentation.

296
00:25:56,672 --> 00:26:00,954
I've just made you a co-host, Mr. O'Brien, if you were ready.

297
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:02,034
We're not putting you on the spot.

298
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:03,475
No, no.

299
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:05,356
Sorry.

300
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,876
I do have it on my phone.

301
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:08,097
Oh, OK.

302
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:08,477
OK.

303
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:09,437
Wait a minute.

304
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:12,599
It was also, I think I made sure I attached.

305
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:14,679
So in the attachments, there should be a picture.

306
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:18,121
But gonga ball is a more inclusive dodgeball game.

307
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:22,062
So it's played in a pit with like 30-inch high walls.

308
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:25,504
And the rules are that you have to hit it with an open hand.

309
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:29,290
and it has to hit players below the knee in order to count.

310
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:44,003
And the models that we have actually have an ADA gate, so the students who have mobility devices can get in and out easily, but otherwise you kind of, there's the 30 inch high wall, but then there's kind of a cutout so kids can hop in and out easily.

311
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:50,269
And it's a really fast moving game that keeps people moving more quickly in and out than

312
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:56,681
Standard dodge ball, it's often the two really good players end up last all the time while everybody sits out until they're done.

313
00:26:57,222 --> 00:27:01,444
And this actually keeps things moving more equally and quickly.

314
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,466
How big are they?

315
00:27:04,486 --> 00:27:09,248
Depending on the model, they're either, I think, let's see, 288 square feet.

316
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:10,809
So they're like, I know.

317
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:20,404
So it's like a hexagon with either eight foot walls or 10 foot walls, depending on, yeah.

318
00:27:20,504 --> 00:27:23,725
Is it in the application?

319
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,246
Yeah, it's in the application materials.

320
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:29,107
Everybody has the Dropbox open.

321
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:31,768
Or if somebody wants to pull up Coach Kiah's Gaga Balls.

322
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:35,730
Dr. Pushing, do you think you could pull that up really quickly?

323
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,690
I got it.

324
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,752
If you want to give it to me, I can share the application pictures.

325
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:42,852
Here we go.

326
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:44,313
All right, there we go.

327
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:47,516
Thank you, yeah.

328
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:52,100
Peter was sharing.

329
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,281
I do have it.

330
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:54,081
I have it.

331
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:57,824
This is what we've included in the application.

332
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:58,645
So there's the gate.

333
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:03,268
We've chosen models for both schools.

334
00:28:03,408 --> 00:28:06,690
So I guess this is getting a little into the McGlynn's proposal as well.

335
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:13,095
But with composite boards to make the maintenance very low, so we don't have to worry about splintering or refinishing or anything.

336
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:16,637
Yeah.

337
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:19,499
And it's a high-demand item.

338
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:29,206
Kevin has a portable one that he uses for certain events, but he gets requests for this a lot in the parks, and they're kind of popping up all over the public parks.

339
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:38,253
The ADA gate would also have a coded lock, so it could be used by people who needed it, but it won't become a hazard with swinging.

340
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:43,557
And we're working with the Disability Commission to figure out

341
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:52,594
how we get immunity access to that coded block in an efficient way without having that code be super public.

342
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,257
The teachers would, of course, all have it.

343
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:58,399
Or be something like 1, 2, 3, 4, right?

344
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:05,284
Maybe like the last four of the school's phone number or something like that.

345
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:11,169
It'll be written on a Sharpie on the side of it probably.

346
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,211
Along with all the other things the students write in Sharpie on things like this.

347
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:18,251
Go ahead.

348
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:23,773
So, Shane, you know, where is the debate coming for single versus double rims?

349
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:27,794
Is that your perception versus the kids?

350
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:36,396
So I spoke with Ugo and in the Parks Department and the Parks Department prefers double rims because they're more durable.

351
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:37,908
Do they?

352
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:39,129
Yes.

353
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:41,270
None of them play basketball.

354
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:47,494
The students are saying, so why do you say why you like single rims better?

355
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:52,737
Because they're easier to shoot on, because they're single rim.

356
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:57,539
It can roll around the rim.

357
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:01,762
But a double rim, it has to go right through most of the time.

358
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:02,722
All right.

359
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:05,944
Yeah, so there's less room for error on a double.

360
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:16,147
Is it more bouncy too?

361
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:18,129
I don't know.

362
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,312
I've never been an advocate for double rims.

363
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,876
We've had single rims in the city for

364
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:28,488
A few decades.

365
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,331
And you're an experienced player with them.

366
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,294
And I think that the kids deserve a single rim.

367
00:30:36,354 --> 00:30:43,720
I don't think that they bend or they deteriorate any faster than a double rim.

368
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:49,525
Are these rims being installed at the middle school?

369
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:51,967
So this is at the Roberts.

370
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,708
It would be a new post.

371
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,121
So we identified a space.

372
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:07,884
One of the landscape architects that lives in the neighborhood and is helping on Park Park, she came in and kind of helped us cite it and give us some specifications for one, which was wonderful.

373
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:16,908
And the, let's see, south side of the building where the kindergartners come out,

374
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:21,681
There's a big brick wall with no windows.

375
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:26,266
There are a couple of trees there, but there's room for the hoop to go between and kind of in front of them.

376
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:31,532
We've spoken with the fire department about preserving the fire lane, but it would be installed.

377
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:32,153
Oh, that's right.

378
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:32,994
John has a mask.

379
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:39,361
The reason I'm asking is because if this is going into a place where it'll be played by

380
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:47,348
littler people and the double rims are really because the big guys hang off of them when they dunk.

381
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:51,911
I don't expect that's going to be happening a lot at the middle school.

382
00:31:52,592 --> 00:31:54,293
I would say single rim it.

383
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,375
You know what I'm saying?

384
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,196
That's what they want.

385
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,638
Even smaller because it's the elementary school.

386
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,381
Now I'm doing this backwards.

387
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:14,895
So this is Park Street, this is Court Street, and here's the house going toward Salem.

388
00:32:16,276 --> 00:32:19,999
There's this little door here that comes out, and the playground is here.

389
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:25,684
So the hoop would be situated here, pointing toward just a big brick wall.

390
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:36,733
We do have to maintain the 20-foot fire lane here, but that's where the best siding was and the most cost-efficient because we didn't have to break up any concrete.

391
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:44,017
And I know that this committee values being able to have more permanent installations of both of these.

392
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:51,280
Eventually, when it comes time for the Robert schoolyard to be redone, we can reinstall this hoop and the gaga ball pit.

393
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:57,022
It's not easy to uninstall, so it won't walk away, but it can be reinstalled at the new playground.

394
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:02,004
Not that the gaga ball pit is the subject tonight, but of this particular.

395
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:03,524
Great.

396
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:04,825
Thank you.

397
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:10,077
Any other comments or questions from committee members?

398
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:21,682
No comment except to say I appreciate your coming tonight and making this application in person.

399
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,823
That means a lot because you're the folks that are going to use it.

400
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:28,564
And we'd like to hear from the people that are going to use it.

401
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:30,245
So thanks for coming.

402
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:30,885
Nice job.

403
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,292
I have a work dodgeball game next week.

404
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:40,755
Do you have any recommendations or advice for me?

405
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:41,656
Talking to you.

406
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:42,978
I'm a little older than you.

407
00:33:43,058 --> 00:33:46,242
Not as mature though.

408
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:48,004
Yeah, that's true.

409
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,225
No questions.

410
00:33:55,262 --> 00:33:55,622
All right.

411
00:33:56,102 --> 00:34:02,604
And then just to be specific, the money would be given to the PTO, and then the PTO is going to give the money to the schools.

412
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:05,004
And John McLaughlin and I will go manage the project.

413
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:05,985
OK.

414
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:16,847
My only question is, how hard are you finding that you need to push back on the single RIM versus double RIM?

415
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,288
I don't think hard.

416
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:19,768
OK.

417
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:26,603
I think that, you know, I called and said, do you have a preference as I was trying to get orders?

418
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:30,066
And then when the students and I were talking about, they were like, ah, double rim.

419
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:32,708
So it's under discussion.

420
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:34,429
So I don't think it's, I don't think it's a hard push.

421
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:43,297
And maybe if the single room is less expensive, maybe we, in anticipation of needing to replace it at some point, we buy two if we have the funding for it, so that it's already there and ready to replace.

422
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:53,181
Because my only question was whether it would be helpful if we specifically recommended funding for a single-room basketball hoop.

423
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:59,244
If that would aid the conversation.

424
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:03,887
Well, actually, why don't you do that so that it's not a question.

425
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:08,249
And then, do you want to, will you share the idea that we have for a sign?

426
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:13,052
Because we were, one of the first idea was to have a hoop that they could dunk on.

427
00:35:13,582 --> 00:35:17,824
But then we talked about that that would, on the weekends, become something that was not durable.

428
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:21,785
And so we've been discussing how high, how high are you thinking you want the hoop right now?

429
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:23,326
Like an eight and a half or nine.

430
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:24,426
Okay.

431
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,627
And then what about the sign that we've been talking about?

432
00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:32,629
Um, it would say like, please don't don't.

433
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,391
Love it.

434
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:41,553
Yeah, basically that like it would be the acknowledgement sign for the funding source for the CPC or CPA.

435
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:48,558
and also say like, this hoop was kid's idea, please don't donk on it and be careful with it.

436
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:49,919
I like that.

437
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,520
Is that your idea?

438
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,163
What happens when the little kids get to be big enough to donk?

439
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,124
They go to the other court.

440
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,005
They go to car park.

441
00:36:00,065 --> 00:36:00,525
Oh my goodness.

442
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,906
So we did talk about how if people, if older,

443
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:15,001
kids and grownups want to play a game, they're going to walk down the street to Hickey Park.

444
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:23,565
But this is kind of a quieter place where maybe if someone is overwhelmed by the big courts that they might like a quiet place to shoot around and also be highly used during the school week.

445
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:26,706
Nice.

446
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:28,787
All right.

447
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:32,989
Does somebody want to make a motion related to this request?

448
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:40,633
I'll make a motion to approve the purchase of basketball hoop for the Roberts.

449
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:42,735
sure.

450
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:44,938
All right.

451
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:50,506
And that's with a condition that the that the single.

452
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:50,586
Yep.

453
00:36:53,856 --> 00:37:00,279
And if I may, I might also recommend, you said that this application was being considered by the community fund as well.

454
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:03,840
So should they fund the application?

455
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:10,663
We might want to scale back our award or, because I'm not sure if you're going to fund it in full or partially.

456
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:11,824
Right, and we're not clear.

457
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:15,545
And so whatever, both groups, yeah, like the best uses of money.

458
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:18,827
So this, whichever needs to happen is fine.

459
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:19,367
Okay.

460
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:32,455
Yeah, I think, um, I don't know if we need to say anything special about having the community fund money spend first and then the CPA funds.

461
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:37,097
Um, that's the idea.

462
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:37,617
Okay.

463
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:41,880
But they haven't, they haven't heard anything back yet from them.

464
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,101
Actually, even as early as tomorrow.

465
00:37:44,421 --> 00:37:44,781
Yeah.

466
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:47,042
My understanding is a press release is on there.

467
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:47,242
Okay.

468
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:49,447
All right.

469
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:55,715
And it's a $5,000 grant that we're recommending for the Roberts.

470
00:37:55,955 --> 00:37:56,395
Okay.

471
00:37:57,336 --> 00:38:01,721
There was an $11,000 proposal to the community fund.

472
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:04,865
But I'm not sure we'll get it.

473
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:08,349
I mean, we did say on that that we would be willing to take partial because

474
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,566
wanted to make sure that this project got done.

475
00:38:11,586 --> 00:38:16,448
And then Gaga Valley is a bonus because reset that the Roberts is is quite something right now.

476
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:25,751
So they could really use additional options that that take the stress off of some of the kind of unstructured spaces.

477
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:27,852
Right?

478
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:28,752
Right.

479
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:30,013
Well, I need to call the roll.

480
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:32,774
We've already got a motion seconded.

481
00:38:33,414 --> 00:38:35,255
So Doug?

482
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:36,755
Yes.

483
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:37,916
Joe?

484
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:39,424
Yes.

485
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:40,705
Ari?

486
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:43,546
Yes.

487
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:45,227
Kaylene?

488
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:46,407
Yes.

489
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,329
And we've lost Craig, he had to leave early this evening.

490
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:52,429
And myself, yes.

491
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,571
And Fredge, yes.

492
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,091
Yes.

493
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:58,832
All right, motion passes.

494
00:38:58,852 --> 00:39:00,153
Congratulations.

495
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,283
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

496
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:07,784
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

497
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,005
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

498
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:12,367
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

499
00:39:12,387 --> 00:39:14,949
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

500
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:17,330
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

501
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,671
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

502
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:21,473
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

503
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,694
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

504
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:23,835
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

505
00:39:23,855 --> 00:39:25,656
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

506
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:27,277
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

507
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,798
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

508
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:30,259
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

509
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:31,460
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

510
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,821
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

511
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,582
You did a good job to convince me to spend the money.

512
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:34,782
You did a

513
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:37,088
So we did.

514
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:52,914
He wrote that paragraph by himself at home, like in preparation for this meeting.

515
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:57,936
It's not at school, it's at home, so I can't show you right now, but I've been working on it.

516
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,696
That is so on point.

517
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:03,998
The four of them prepared with me in the hallway today, like we couldn't get into our room, so we all

518
00:40:04,353 --> 00:40:12,899
We sat in the hallway at the Roberts and the other students told him what was really important to say tonight and kind of reviewed the proposal.

519
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,141
And we're going to go back and make sure we get the specs.

520
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:25,407
And I'd like maybe Igor and John to come down and talk with them about how we're going to order it and that kind of thing.

521
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:26,908
I'll call the rep while we're together.

522
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:29,530
But I'm not sure how much time we have since it's the end of the year.

523
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:31,959
I figure out the timing as well.

524
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:37,701
But I see another front page article on the globe in a couple of years, another valedictorian.

525
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:40,002
So, you know.

526
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:43,584
And those are Mr. O'Brien's former students, so.

527
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,565
Here you go.

528
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:45,565
All right.

529
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:50,287
On to the Gaga pit.

530
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:51,528
Yeah.

531
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:55,230
McLean School Gaga pit.

532
00:40:56,365 --> 00:41:00,668
Yes, thank you for having us tonight and for accepting our application.

533
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:11,735
Shanine pretty much has sold it already, but we're looking for funds to buy the equipment and the delivery for a gaga pit that is.

534
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:15,310
accessible for all students.

535
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:30,745
I think one of the most attractive parts to it is the door that's going to make it accessible for all of our students that are in wheelchairs and that need an opportunity to participate and play in a really enjoyable and fun game.

536
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:33,888
I just happen to be sitting in my office and I see this.

537
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:37,772
This is a ball that says second place Gaga pit.

538
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:44,434
for my dog, Olivia O'Brien, when she played at the Brooks in third grade.

539
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:46,894
And she's in eighth grade right now.

540
00:41:47,294 --> 00:41:52,916
So the fact that this ball hasn't been thrown away means that she really, really enjoyed it.

541
00:41:53,476 --> 00:42:01,978
And so I'm hoping that this guy gives joy to all the students at the McGlynn as much as my daughter enjoyed it.

542
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:10,219
So we are asking for funds, again, to buy the equipment and delivery, and we are going to install it.

543
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:11,820
It's going to be a community event.

544
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:25,885
We have a parent volunteer, Mr. Richard, who is in construction and is going to lead us as we construct a Gaga pit for the McGlynn Inclusive Playground.

545
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:36,244
We'll see what questions I have.

546
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:40,207
So where is it proposed to be installed exactly?

547
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:51,516
So unfortunately, I don't have a map of the inclusive playground, but there is a space that has been dedicated for it.

548
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:54,298
Dr. Cushing has it right there.

549
00:42:54,318 --> 00:43:00,884
All those little dots are supposed to be people, those random black dots walking in pairs.

550
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:06,978
permanently planted in the background.

551
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:08,079
Like Davis Square.

552
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:21,609
And some of the additional inclusive features of this are that, so we've got the, we've specced out the composite boards.

553
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:28,469
as well as wall top covers that are yellow, which adds to the visual accessibility of the playground.

554
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:36,554
And that's a consistent strategy throughout the playground of having yellow edges of things that you need to watch out for against a high contrast surface.

555
00:43:37,134 --> 00:43:40,997
So for kids with visual impairments, there are many students at the McGlynn that have visual impairments.

556
00:43:41,057 --> 00:43:46,180
They can see it and not run into it.

557
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,262
And then it also is color coordinated with the rest of the playground.

558
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:54,598
Thank you.

559
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:59,860
Are there any questions or comments from committee members about this request?

560
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:11,284
So it's only a partial request from CPA, and the difference is coming from someplace else?

561
00:44:13,344 --> 00:44:22,107
The difference is the in-kind contribution of the Motlin community to construct, because if we had Cork do it as part of the playground, it would cost us $3,000 additional.

562
00:44:22,147 --> 00:44:22,348
Gotcha.

563
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:24,728
Got it.

564
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,291
Okay.

565
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:29,893
I have a budget sheet up.

566
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:31,474
John, would that be helpful?

567
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:34,857
I'm looking at it now.

568
00:44:35,898 --> 00:44:41,262
I suggest it would probably be helpful to just round up to 5000.

569
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:41,603
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:57,131
Would anyone like to make a motion related to this proposal?

571
00:45:01,174 --> 00:45:07,498
I can make a motion to approve the Gaga ball pit application at McLean School.

572
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,180
Second.

573
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:12,222
Great.

574
00:45:13,403 --> 00:45:14,984
Then I will call the roll.

575
00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:18,106
Kaylene?

576
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:19,848
Yes.

577
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:21,249
Ari?

578
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:22,490
Yes.

579
00:45:23,912 --> 00:45:24,272
Doug?

580
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:24,912
Yes.

581
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:26,172
Joan?

582
00:45:26,913 --> 00:45:27,153
Yes.

583
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:28,713
Reg?

584
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:29,633
Yes.

585
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:31,053
And myself, yes.

586
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:31,993
Thank you.

587
00:45:32,794 --> 00:45:35,094
I love working with y'all.

588
00:45:35,114 --> 00:45:36,114
Do we get to play?

589
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:36,914
Do we get to play?

590
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:37,874
I just want to know.

591
00:45:38,214 --> 00:45:38,995
Absolutely.

592
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:39,715
Absolutely.

593
00:45:39,755 --> 00:45:41,295
I think we should mandate it.

594
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:42,415
I think so.

595
00:45:42,855 --> 00:45:48,056
There's going to be like a CTC night at the McGlynn Playground.

596
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:48,596
Oh, yeah.

597
00:45:48,616 --> 00:45:51,457
I think the winner gets a grant and the loser doesn't next time.

598
00:45:56,181 --> 00:46:02,224
And I'm coming in with balls branded Curtis Tufts High School, so you know what my next ask is.

599
00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:06,987
Yes, boy.

600
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:12,890
All right, well, thank you to all of you from the school.

601
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,271
Next was a brief update, Marcia.

602
00:46:16,632 --> 00:46:17,852
I have a Glenn School play.

603
00:46:17,872 --> 00:46:19,913
Wait, do you have to hang on here to do an update?

604
00:46:20,293 --> 00:46:23,115
No, no, I was waving to my daughter who just said, love you and good night.

605
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,991
I think it was caught on film, so I'm going to save that for when she's.

606
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:28,933
Timestamp at 718.

607
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:38,587
All right, if I could share my screen again, which I know I'm still able to too bad Andrew, Andy dropped off.

608
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:49,913
But if I can share my screen for the presentation that Shanine worked diligently on, and I simply modified to add a few minor details, but really want to give credit to Shanine.

609
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:51,374
So.

610
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:53,695
Am I okay to take it away?

611
00:46:56,667 --> 00:47:03,609
So they say a picture is worth a thousand words, but in reality the pictures do not do this project justice.

612
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:21,253
A few weeks ago while waiting to take someone on a tour of the playground, I was sitting in the outdoor classroom on one of the rough hewn logs and was really enamored by the sounds of the birds,

613
00:47:22,313 --> 00:47:50,602
uh, the-the light din of Interstate 93 light, um, and the sounds of the construction equipment, and was just really taken aback by the 66 trees, the innumerable, although we do have the number, shrubs and bushes, uh, that were installed, and just everything that has come together through a lot of hard work, uh, by Shanine, Amanda Centrella, um, your-your work in helping to fund this.

614
00:47:51,422 --> 00:48:01,106
many city departments, and I've said this on several tours that we've done as well as at the school committee last week.

615
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:16,533
I firmly believe that while this is a small $2.8 million playground, and I say small only in comparison to the work we're doing on the Massachusetts School Building Committee, Medford High School School Building Committee,

616
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:28,656
And what well-planned, well-designed, and with community input can deliver for the citizens and students of Medford can really be unmatched.

617
00:48:29,796 --> 00:48:35,217
And this project is, I would say, nothing short of amazing.

618
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:39,738
Someone had asked earlier about the bike racks.

619
00:48:40,078 --> 00:48:45,840
So I can point out that this right here will be one station of new bike racks.

620
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:56,588
And then I believe the other station is over this way, but I'm not clearly delineated, but so we'll move in.

621
00:48:57,669 --> 00:49:00,692
So, just as a reminder, here's why the McGlynn needed to be rebuilt.

622
00:49:01,593 --> 00:49:06,356
So, it was approaching 25 years old and that's about the lifespan.

623
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:20,860
So we were having significant flooding as the site used to be part of Mystic River and the French trains that were around the perimeter of the facility had failed.

624
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:31,726
Really grateful to the DPW because they came in and for the last year while we were designing, were able to rebuild those French trains.

625
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:35,728
Dr. Cushing, if I could just interrupt for one second.

626
00:49:35,808 --> 00:49:45,835
This is really superfluous, but the reason why we're seeing water in the middle of that picture is because this is the area that used to be known as Labor in Vain.

627
00:49:45,855 --> 00:49:46,596
Yes.

628
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:53,121
As part of the Mystic River, it had a name and it was Labor in Vain.

629
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:58,544
Actually, the next slide has a map that shows Labor in Vain.

630
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:05,471
Which, interestingly enough, is a street in the city that I live in as well.

631
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:09,692
So the McGlynn, it was built on land part of the Mystic River.

632
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:20,897
You can see here the old concrete walls, which have been removed, and the blue that basically represented the shape of the river.

633
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:25,358
And so the land is wet a lot of the time.

634
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,238
So what's going on behind the fence?

635
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,119
A lot of diligent work.

636
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:40,205
We had a snow breaking back in December, and they've really done a lot of work throughout the winter.

637
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:43,727
Shanine, the boulders came from?

638
00:50:43,747 --> 00:50:44,967
Our park.

639
00:50:45,488 --> 00:50:46,208
Yep, so.

640
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:47,029
Oh, right.

641
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:52,492
They're really artistically set throughout the whole thing as extra scenic and play value.

642
00:50:52,572 --> 00:50:53,212
It's fun.

643
00:50:53,793 --> 00:50:53,973
Yeah.

644
00:50:55,156 --> 00:51:09,968
So they demolished the old playground, removed it, did a lot of testing of the soil, drainage, land forming by building hills, digging rain gardens, which are really incredible to see, protecting the existing trees.

645
00:51:10,188 --> 00:51:20,677
We did have to remove a number of trees as well, but that's simply because they were no longer either living or were not going to be able to recover.

646
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:27,393
Um, we, a lot of them were in the flooded areas, so we have lost several trees just because they were completely.

647
00:51:27,413 --> 00:51:28,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:51:30,572 --> 00:51:42,583
We did electrical and data out to the pavilion as well as to the exterior wall near the outdoor classroom.

649
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:51,311
We put in plumbing, which was a little bit of a challenge in and of itself, for a water fountain slash bottle filling station.

650
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:54,774
We put in the fillings for basketball hoops and sports nets.

651
00:51:55,354 --> 00:51:57,636
Sports nets will go, I think, 16 feet high.

652
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:02,158
Shanine did a lot of consulting with the Perkins School for the Blind on colors.

653
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:14,667
Playground equipment was ordered, as well as other park features, finalized the play structure design and colors, and relocated the boulders, as Shanine said, from Carr Park.

654
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,869
Then I just want to give you this image, OK?

655
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,351
Because there was so much.

656
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:40,909
unused space here all right um and keep the tree as a point of reference i also want to point out that the old playground used to have this walkway that went completely around its perimeter uh and this walkway here which is also a fire lane

657
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,872
had completely unfettered access for the public during school hours.

658
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:55,878
We are putting up a barrier gate here that the fire department, DPW, and school personnel will have access to, and we are putting up another barrier gate here.

659
00:52:56,918 --> 00:52:59,700
That's designed to really push the public

660
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,642
out away from the school itself.

661
00:53:03,403 --> 00:53:06,726
And this walkway has largely been removed.

662
00:53:06,806 --> 00:53:09,268
I'd say about 75% of it has been removed.

663
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:23,961
And the new direction of the walkway will move this way and then shoot across the existing park space to connect with the walkway along the Mystic.

664
00:53:25,938 --> 00:53:30,904
So, really looked at that for safety here.

665
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:32,285
You see the pavilion.

666
00:53:33,426 --> 00:53:35,409
That has been built the.

667
00:53:36,753 --> 00:53:46,657
tar that you can see here is going to be covered and poured in place with a flock of birds approach to it.

668
00:53:48,277 --> 00:53:54,999
And Shanine, do you want to talk about the visual and other curbing that we're talking about for up here for safety?

669
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,160
Sure.

670
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,142
So along with the consultant from Perkins, we were talking about high contrast colors and alerting colors.

671
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:04,763
So a lot of folks with visual impairments can see red or yellow.

672
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:06,446
and those are alerting colors.

673
00:54:06,566 --> 00:54:12,149
So we took the approach throughout the playground whenever there's a hill of that inside edge of the hill being yellow.

674
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,932
And so that's consistent on this side as well as on the plate structure area.

675
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:29,359
Recently, we've been realizing just how steep that edge is and looking into solutions to keep kids who use mobility devices from rolling off.

676
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:31,120
So this is kind of our current

677
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:34,548
challenges to figure out how we're going to install it.

678
00:54:34,868 --> 00:54:40,350
But we're looking at this kind of four-inch rubber curving that would go on top of the concrete.

679
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:42,871
Let's see, my hand in here.

680
00:54:42,891 --> 00:54:49,774
So it would go on top of the concrete, and then the edge would have that yellow edge and go down toward the field.

681
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,816
And there are other schools that do have this big edge.

682
00:54:55,856 --> 00:54:58,017
The Healy School in Somerville has a big edge.

683
00:54:58,037 --> 00:54:59,718
So we're actually touching base with their

684
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:08,084
Their staff to see if they've had any any problems with the edge just with their typically developing students in addition to any students with physical disabilities.

685
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:15,067
So here's the pavilion with the turf that was not funded by CPC money, but it's clear.

686
00:55:15,087 --> 00:55:15,187
So.

687
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:34,656
The pavilion now has its roof on, but again, this now takes up a significant amount of space that was just unused, that had no play value.

688
00:55:35,858 --> 00:55:42,604
And so just this area alone will add significant play value to the square footage of the McGlynn.

689
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:52,973
The students were exceptionally clear in the listening sessions with Shanine about protecting this tree in the labor in vain point.

690
00:55:53,993 --> 00:56:03,300
And so the initial designs were to have the deck that you see in the lower right hand corner actually wrap around the tree.

691
00:56:04,101 --> 00:56:13,386
The construction company was concerned that the helical piers that were going to be used to support the deck would actually damage the root structure.

692
00:56:13,966 --> 00:56:19,869
So rather than destroy the tree, we came up with a pretty quick fix.

693
00:56:20,189 --> 00:56:24,071
This was the first element of the playground that was completed.

694
00:56:25,191 --> 00:56:29,536
The gravel that you see in the S shape in the top right hand corner.

695
00:56:30,196 --> 00:56:39,466
And wrapped around the tree will be covered in a permeable paving called flexi pave that we anticipate will be installed this Thursday or Friday.

696
00:56:41,247 --> 00:56:44,210
That's also the surfacing in the outdoor plaster.

697
00:56:44,691 --> 00:56:47,053
Yes, it's currently being used if you're curious about the.

698
00:56:48,698 --> 00:56:50,440
about the surface.

699
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,562
It's actually installed around a tree on Morrison Playground.

700
00:56:53,582 --> 00:57:03,050
So there's the rubber surface and then there's kind of a reddish brown surface that it allows some movement of the roots and protects the roots but also allows water to get straight through.

701
00:57:04,111 --> 00:57:08,515
There's a really good infographic sign at that tree in particular.

702
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:13,519
If you're walking through it, it explains how it won't choke the branch out of the roots or anything like that.

703
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:23,799
So, we have a number of rain gardens that go around the perimeter.

704
00:57:24,439 --> 00:57:35,125
66 new native trees have either been planted or are in the process of being planted that will create shade, absorb water, and provide a habitat for birds and pollinators.

705
00:57:36,805 --> 00:57:47,950
The rain gardens have drainage and plumbing in them to be able to collect the water and slow down the runoff into the drainage system for the city.

706
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:55,772
We also, you'll see here, have installed picnic areas, so prior to cement.

707
00:57:55,893 --> 00:58:01,615
And here you can see one of those rocks, one of the boulders from Carr Park.

708
00:58:02,655 --> 00:58:14,365
And then it's a little difficult to see here because it's a little small, but there's a nice little promontory rock for our students to be able to launch off of and challenge by choice.

709
00:58:15,546 --> 00:58:16,626
So there'll be two round.

710
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,252
And there'll be two round accessible picnic tables.

711
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:30,598
And so you can see they'll be here and then they'll also be up underneath the pavilion.

712
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:33,399
outdoor classroom.

713
00:58:33,439 --> 00:58:34,600
Shanine, you want to talk about this?

714
00:58:35,281 --> 00:58:35,561
Sure.

715
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:44,666
So on the left, you see, um, the log seating, uh, it is unfinished wood because if we actually stain it, then we will have to restain it every year.

716
00:58:44,706 --> 00:58:48,588
So it will actually last longer and be in better shape, um, left natural.

717
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:54,952
And there are two designated, uh, wheelchair seating spots, one up in the front.

718
00:58:55,372 --> 00:58:57,173
Um, Peter, yeah, there you go.

719
00:58:57,814 --> 00:58:58,134
And that,

720
00:58:59,004 --> 00:59:06,067
allow students who need to be up front to sit there without being in view, like without blocking the view of students who might be sitting behind.

721
00:59:06,187 --> 00:59:10,529
And then on the back left, there's another designated spot right there.

722
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:14,431
But there are other areas as well where wheelchair seating would be available.

723
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:19,894
And the two posts in the center there will have a whiteboard attached to it, an outdoor whiteboard.

724
00:59:20,994 --> 00:59:26,337
And then if you were to stand in that spot and do an about face, you would see these

725
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:37,109
Garden beds, one is lower height for kids to be able to stand at for our youngest students, as well as for students who use wheelchairs to be able to come up for side access.

726
00:59:37,129 --> 00:59:41,290
But then the other table has front access so that someone has knee clearance.

727
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:44,971
Or if we had an adult volunteer come who has a wheelchair, they can pull right up.

728
00:59:46,091 --> 00:59:55,473
I think one of the really neat features, and it's not done yet in this picture, but on the broad side of the accessible bed, there's a square about this big, maybe

729
00:59:56,089 --> 01:00:00,432
maybe 15 inches wide, that has, it's a root viewing window.

730
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:14,041
So it has plexiglass on the inside, and it'll have a movable door to block out the sunlight, because if you didn't put the door there, then the roots would go hide and they wouldn't come up against the surface, but the students will be able to see the whole root structure of what they're growing.

731
01:00:15,582 --> 01:00:20,645
And then the tops of that are the composite boards to help with durability and lack of splinter.

732
01:00:25,256 --> 01:00:38,547
So, coming up next, like I said, just recently, a significant amount of asphalt has gone in on the property for the binder, the lower portion of the asphalt.

733
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:40,909
That needs about 28 days to cure.

734
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:46,093
Then this week, the Flexi Pave will be put in in the various spots.

735
01:00:46,673 --> 01:00:51,137
Yesterday, they were working on the water fountain and bottle filling station.

736
01:00:52,317 --> 01:00:58,159
Which is adjacent to the second bike area that Dr. Christian pointed out.

737
01:00:59,499 --> 01:01:10,023
And so planting the trees, the shrubs, and then we'll be starting on the actual playground climber coming up here in a few, in about two weeks.

738
01:01:12,204 --> 01:01:16,405
Is this slated to be finished by the time, how did you say it, next year?

739
01:01:17,198 --> 01:01:41,841
We are on target for about August 28th and planning a, we have not started planning, but planning a ribbon cutting ceremony sometime on or about that time to make sure that we are really celebrating the work that has been done here and showcasing it for the community.

740
01:01:42,753 --> 01:01:48,798
So we're hoping for a dry summer, not too dry, but not a flooded summer where they can't work.

741
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:56,184
So barring unforeseen weather conditions, we're on target to be ready before the beginning of school.

742
01:01:56,284 --> 01:02:01,629
But should any random things come up, it might be like a week or two after.

743
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:04,211
And the school community is prepared for that if that happens.

744
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:09,509
So thank you.

745
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:10,670
This is, it's magical.

746
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:19,093
It really is being out there and Teresa got to come and then Roberta had to rain out, but it was, it was, you transformed the space that's over there.

747
01:02:19,113 --> 01:02:20,453
It doesn't even feel like the same place.

748
01:02:20,913 --> 01:02:28,036
Like even at one point we turned around and you point out, oh, we never even knew there was this mural on the side of the school, you know, like things like that.

749
01:02:28,116 --> 01:02:30,417
Like you're just seeing that whole space in a different way.

750
01:02:30,977 --> 01:02:31,217
Yeah.

751
01:02:31,337 --> 01:02:32,958
In terms of, you should be proud of the work you've done.

752
01:02:33,078 --> 01:02:33,458
Thank you.

753
01:02:34,408 --> 01:02:35,649
not possible without all of you.

754
01:02:36,729 --> 01:02:46,174
Yeah, we were on top of the hill the first time we were out there, and there is a relief in concrete on the building that neither Mr. O'Brien nor I had ever noticed.

755
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:48,656
The students of course were like, you know what's there.

756
01:02:49,316 --> 01:03:01,522
When I said that to the fourth graders last week, but it has, actually on the community update, was that the, oh, I guess it's on the committee update that we- Let me see if I can get that slide up.

757
01:03:02,022 --> 01:03:02,303
Hold on.

758
01:03:04,633 --> 01:03:08,395
It's a relief of there's like shipbuilding and something else.

759
01:03:08,495 --> 01:03:12,397
And there's kind of Medford leaders that are, their names are written as book titles.

760
01:03:13,338 --> 01:03:20,121
And then there's a quote that says the future belongs to those who believe in the power of their dreams or the beauty of their dreams or whichever that, whatever that quote is.

761
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:21,042
I got it.

762
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:22,142
Yeah.

763
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:23,863
Go on, give me a hot second.

764
01:03:24,703 --> 01:03:28,605
And so it actually is so much more visible and noticeable from the pavilion.

765
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,067
So it's nice to be able to highlight this piece that was already there.

766
01:03:31,998 --> 01:03:34,539
So we're gonna work on getting that power wash before the opening.

767
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:35,340
Nice.

768
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,180
Oh wow.

769
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:36,661
Isn't that great?

770
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:41,984
We just need to have our power washer fixed, so maybe that would be a second grant.

771
01:03:44,665 --> 01:03:45,826
We can't do maintenance.

772
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,127
I know.

773
01:03:48,828 --> 01:03:51,149
That's awesome.

774
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:57,052
And there is another one, just so you know, on the back of the Andrews School, if you ever want to take a look.

775
01:03:57,112 --> 01:04:01,615
I don't have a picture of it handy, but it's pretty cool as well.

776
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:11,685
I'd love to get DCR to request a grant or to actually find state funding to fix those bridges too.

777
01:04:11,705 --> 01:04:14,667
Yeah.

778
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:16,949
Well then, so we do have labor in vain right there.

779
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:18,029
You can kind of see it there.

780
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:18,450
Yeah.

781
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:29,116
And then also on the, there's a kiosk in the outdoor classroom that has, that will have weather measurement instruments and rulers and all sorts of things that go along with the curriculum.

782
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:31,098
But we also designed a,

783
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:43,424
a sign that will go there that has a map of the playground and kind of the eco-friendly features of the playground, including the rain gardens and native plantings, but also has a map of the original path of the river and has a note about that.

784
01:04:43,804 --> 01:04:48,766
And then it also has kind of a scavenger hunt of like, can you find these native trees on the playground in the shape of a leaf?

785
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,189
So we can't wait to show the community this.

786
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:58,529
It's just, it's really exciting.

787
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:00,710
Thank you.

788
01:05:01,787 --> 01:05:02,808
This is really exciting.

789
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:08,173
It's a good time for you now, my friend.

790
01:05:08,213 --> 01:05:09,674
Fourth grade mom's night.

791
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:12,096
We made it to the end of the school year.

792
01:05:12,857 --> 01:05:13,317
Yay.

793
01:05:13,437 --> 01:05:13,697
Yes.

794
01:05:14,738 --> 01:05:17,841
Thank you all, and thank you for your- Thanks for the update.

795
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:19,102
Yeah, and for your kindness with John.

796
01:05:19,142 --> 01:05:20,563
He was- Oh my gosh.

797
01:05:20,603 --> 01:05:23,406
Such a trooper coming without his compatriots.

798
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:24,487
He was a rock star.

799
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:24,987
Yeah, he was.

800
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:25,908
All right, thank you.

801
01:05:26,228 --> 01:05:26,849
Thank you.

802
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,290
And thank you, Dr. Coaching.

803
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:29,151
We appreciate you.

804
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:29,451
Thank you.

805
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:30,613
Have a great night.

806
01:05:30,913 --> 01:05:31,613
You too.

807
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:31,914
Thanks.

808
01:05:32,274 --> 01:05:32,694
Bye.

809
01:05:35,715 --> 01:05:36,035
All right.

810
01:05:36,155 --> 01:05:44,357
So next on the agenda, upcoming events and tabling outreach efforts, ribbon cuttings.

811
01:05:44,977 --> 01:05:46,258
All kinds of fun stuff happening.

812
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:47,298
Yeah.

813
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:56,973
One thing I did include in the Dropbox, a list of all events that happen here in the city that I think we can weasel our way into.

814
01:05:57,473 --> 01:05:59,453
Some of them are very obvious, large events.

815
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:03,155
And then some of them are perhaps a little bit more smaller or grassroots.

816
01:06:03,175 --> 01:06:08,256
They're not necessarily cached events or city of Medford events.

817
01:06:08,836 --> 01:06:13,578
So it's pretty comprehensive there that folks haven't had a chance to peek through it.

818
01:06:15,062 --> 01:06:19,424
First and foremost, what's coming up in four days is Circle the Square.

819
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:23,345
Roberta and I are both, you're gonna be there.

820
01:06:23,365 --> 01:06:24,606
I unfortunately cannot be there.

821
01:06:24,766 --> 01:06:25,726
Oh, all right, all right.

822
01:06:25,746 --> 01:06:29,748
So I will be there if anybody wants to come hang out with me, I welcome that.

823
01:06:31,248 --> 01:06:35,610
But we'll be having a table this Saturday here in Medford Square from three to seven.

824
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:42,112
I have no problem staffing it by myself, but it would be great if somebody wants to hang out.

825
01:06:44,573 --> 01:06:51,278
What this event is essentially going to be a table for those who are kind of newer to us.

826
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:58,364
It's just about engaging with the public and finding, you know, having conversations about what they like about our community, what they would like to see improved.

827
01:06:58,464 --> 01:07:01,006
So it's a pretty light lift.

828
01:07:01,066 --> 01:07:07,331
Everybody is very cool to talk to us about programs, projects that we're doing.

829
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:09,413
Nobody's really combative or anything like that.

830
01:07:09,773 --> 01:07:10,253
It's a good time.

831
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:14,651
So if anybody could join on site, that'd be great.

832
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:16,551
If not, I realize it's kind of last minute.

833
01:07:17,571 --> 01:07:19,732
I'm supposed to go to the circle, the square.

834
01:07:19,752 --> 01:07:24,913
I can run to the beer table for you if that would be helpful.

835
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:30,814
I promise if that is an option, I will take you up on it.

836
01:07:30,854 --> 01:07:40,177
But I do have, we're going to share a table with CBBG, which is another grant program, my colleague Laurel Siegel.

837
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:41,897
So I won't get involved.

838
01:07:45,457 --> 01:07:46,657
So that's this.

839
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:49,317
If anybody can, feel free to text me.

840
01:07:50,558 --> 01:07:53,478
The next big one after that would be the National Night Out.

841
01:07:54,038 --> 01:08:01,000
It's a national event hosted by the... What's that?

842
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,880
It'll be at Cornell.

843
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,100
This is, I believe... No, I mean on your list.

844
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,361
Where is it on your list?

845
01:08:07,761 --> 01:08:09,161
Maybe I forgot to put it on there.

846
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:10,702
I did.

847
01:08:10,722 --> 01:08:12,522
It's House Outdoor Movie Night.

848
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:15,671
Well, I didn't put it on there.

849
01:08:15,751 --> 01:08:16,392
I'll add it.

850
01:08:16,432 --> 01:08:18,974
Thank you for pointing that out.

851
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:19,595
When is that?

852
01:08:20,536 --> 01:08:22,317
It is Tuesday, August 6th.

853
01:08:23,318 --> 01:08:24,019
Oh, sorry.

854
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:24,740
I'll be in Alaska.

855
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,521
Okay, good to see you.

856
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:36,170
We still have a couple months on that one, so I'll circulate it again with everybody, but that is a heavily attended event.

857
01:08:36,671 --> 01:08:38,653
There's free food, free ice cream.

858
01:08:41,113 --> 01:08:43,155
FBI is going to be tabling there.

859
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:48,279
So it's a very unique, interesting event there.

860
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:51,042
So just putting that out there.

861
01:08:51,142 --> 01:08:54,905
August 6th is a Tuesday.

862
01:08:55,826 --> 01:08:57,167
I am available.

863
01:08:57,387 --> 01:08:59,289
So I'll probably be there.

864
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:07,055
And again, I'm not asking for anybody to hard commit right now, just planting some seeds.

865
01:09:08,462 --> 01:09:09,743
Upcoming ribbon cuttings.

866
01:09:10,544 --> 01:09:13,846
I don't have one for Car Park.

867
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:24,455
They're talking about potentially doing one for the phase one, but Gillis absolutely has a ribbon cutting scheduled for July 2nd.

868
01:09:26,116 --> 01:09:30,099
I believe that's a Wednesday or Tuesday.

869
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,901
It is a Tuesday.

870
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:33,682
Tuesday.

871
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:34,763
Tuesday.

872
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:41,727
So usually the ribbon cuttings have an announcement time, but they tend to be somewhere between two and four o'clock in the afternoon.

873
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:50,270
It might be earlier because of the schools being out earlier, I'm not sure, but we're all invited to July 2nd ribbon cutting at Gillis.

874
01:09:52,391 --> 01:09:53,871
And I'll circulate that with everybody.

875
01:09:56,813 --> 01:10:04,636
Just as an aside, what I would like to do, and that's why I've included it on this list, is to start going to the farmer's market.

876
01:10:05,183 --> 01:10:12,928
just walking around the clipboard and just talking with folks, not every week, but a couple of times a month.

877
01:10:12,948 --> 01:10:17,510
But that's my goal right now is to try and get us out there twice a month.

878
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:18,151
Yes.

879
01:10:18,491 --> 01:10:19,311
Have you been down there?

880
01:10:19,752 --> 01:10:23,794
I don't have a problem going down there, but have you been down there lately?

881
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:24,694
I have, yes.

882
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:29,897
There's been some emergency gas repairs done.

883
01:10:29,957 --> 01:10:33,459
So they had to unfortunately tear up the parking lot, which they did last year.

884
01:10:34,596 --> 01:10:37,198
That's it, since this was an emergency and unplanned for.

885
01:10:37,218 --> 01:10:39,300
So how long is that going to take?

886
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:44,745
I've been told that they hope to be cleared out of there within two weeks.

887
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:46,507
They're repaving today.

888
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:50,330
They got to do some moomin and hydroseeding.

889
01:10:51,111 --> 01:10:56,436
But just as a little tidbit on that, it wasn't planned because they are.

890
01:10:59,928 --> 01:11:09,595
So anybody, again, planting the seeds, anybody thinks that they could participate, it would be nice if at the farmer's market we had a little bit of a heavier presence this season.

891
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:18,101
I occasionally try to go, but I'm technically on the clock for the entire farmer's market every week.

892
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:18,622
Me too.

893
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:19,522
It goes till 7, right?

894
01:11:20,263 --> 01:11:20,703
Yeah, 3 to 7.

895
01:11:24,089 --> 01:11:29,773
And I'm happy to spend every single Thursday of my life from 3 to 4.30 at the farmer's market.

896
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:33,455
But again, I just wanted to open it up to everybody.

897
01:11:33,475 --> 01:11:40,080
And I just want to, that was pretty much all I had there.

898
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:40,740
Nothing major.

899
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,441
It was just, hey, these things are coming up.

900
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:44,323
If you can make it, that'd be great.

901
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:48,265
If you're in Alaska, take me with you.

902
01:11:48,546 --> 01:11:50,367
So here's my comment.

903
01:11:50,927 --> 01:11:52,528
I feel like we need a new,

904
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:56,613
a new shtick.

905
01:11:57,594 --> 01:12:00,575
We always go and we do the same thing.

906
01:12:01,456 --> 01:12:06,639
I wonder if it's time to turn the page to some other shtick.

907
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:10,201
What do you think we should spend money on?

908
01:12:10,361 --> 01:12:13,223
But either selling what we've already done.

909
01:12:13,243 --> 01:12:20,487
I love that presentation that Shaneen just did on the successes that we've had.

910
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:32,177
you know, whether it's, and I'm not really sure, you know, is there anybody that we can partner with, you know, to be able to utilize our funding more effectively?

911
01:12:32,197 --> 01:12:32,837
I don't know.

912
01:12:33,518 --> 01:12:42,982
You know, I feel like we need different questions or need a different approach just in terms of, you know, getting more interest.

913
01:12:43,923 --> 01:12:44,823
Sure, I hear you.

914
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:46,790
I hear you.

915
01:12:47,331 --> 01:12:49,634
I'll think of it while I'm on the boat.

916
01:12:49,714 --> 01:12:53,097
I'll try to think of some ideas in Alaska.

917
01:12:55,100 --> 01:13:00,285
That's the second time she said something about being in Alaska.

918
01:13:00,525 --> 01:13:03,188
I think because she's excited about going to Alaska.

919
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:04,009
Perhaps.

920
01:13:08,157 --> 01:13:13,138
One thing I'm going to be doing at Circle the Square is I have a battery backup.

921
01:13:13,258 --> 01:13:18,299
It's not quite a generator, but it's a battery backup that I can use to power and monitor.

922
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:26,460
So I've always wanted to make a slideshow or a video of recent CPA projects to keep that exciting.

923
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,241
We don't have a tower at our table, which is why I bring that battery backup.

924
01:13:32,981 --> 01:13:37,082
You know, Joan, you bring up a good point about us marketing ourselves.

925
01:13:38,426 --> 01:13:40,708
you know, to the public and so on and so forth.

926
01:13:41,509 --> 01:13:48,034
The problem that I see is we pretty much give away as much as money as we possibly can every year.

927
01:13:48,575 --> 01:13:54,500
And we pretty much close to maxing out just about every year.

928
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:01,505
If we start marketing ourselves and we don't get any additional funds,

929
01:14:04,491 --> 01:14:06,435
Somebody will be a little bit disappointed.

930
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:07,396
All right.

931
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:08,438
You're right.

932
01:14:08,498 --> 01:14:09,540
You know what I mean?

933
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:12,025
That's being a victim of your own success, I think.

934
01:14:12,105 --> 01:14:12,405
I agree.

935
01:14:12,465 --> 01:14:13,988
I understand what you're saying, Richard, but I...

936
01:14:14,892 --> 01:14:18,455
I like the competition.

937
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,358
The first few years were easy because we didn't have to make any hard choices.

938
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:23,200
Now we do.

939
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:34,310
I like the idea, both Joan and Teresa, about showing people what their money has been spent on the last five years.

940
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:38,013
Not everyone came to our fifth-year thing, but that

941
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:45,499
I think there are thousands of people who could walk around and say, oh my God, everywhere I look, I see something and see PCNF.

942
01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:54,265
If you look around at the map and the neighborhoods, there's very few areas you can't go four blocks in one direction without something that we funded.

943
01:14:54,285 --> 01:14:59,269
I think that's worth more to me than it is like, what do you want?

944
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:00,410
Because it's always the same.

945
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,972
It always is a third, a third, a third.

946
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:04,473
It's pretty much what we all want.

947
01:15:04,813 --> 01:15:11,176
It's like there's not going to be much new input at this point, unless they have a specific project they want.

948
01:15:11,216 --> 01:15:12,436
That's worth asking about.

949
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:16,458
If you have an idea for a project, well, then get involved.

950
01:15:16,758 --> 01:15:17,579
Here's the process.

951
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:20,160
Talk to Teresa, talk to our folks.

952
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,420
Let's try to make it happen.

953
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,802
That's a positive message, I think, and a new message.

954
01:15:33,245 --> 01:15:33,826
All good stuff.

955
01:15:33,906 --> 01:15:34,266
Thank you.

956
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:39,427
Social play.

957
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:41,929
You guys want to hang out sometime this summer?

958
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:45,771
I do.

959
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:49,512
So in your thing here, let me just get back to it.

960
01:15:49,532 --> 01:16:02,139
Yeah, I had put together, I can't remember what, I was only here for last year, but I did try to put past events that we've done,

961
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:06,789
some new venues to 2024 here.

962
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:10,850
I don't see anybody else putting suggestions in, but yeah.

963
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:12,491
I didn't think we could.

964
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:14,932
Can we add to that?

965
01:16:14,952 --> 01:16:17,693
The edit is not available for the file, it says.

966
01:16:18,093 --> 01:16:18,733
Oh, fine.

967
01:16:18,753 --> 01:16:29,998
But anyway, you had question marks about where we've been in the past, and I don't remember all of them, but I know we started at the Semilinas, I think.

968
01:16:30,797 --> 01:16:32,278
We did that once or twice.

969
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:37,822
We went to Rio Gusto, I believe.

970
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:40,945
We went to Fort Tavern one year.

971
01:16:42,066 --> 01:16:42,466
To where?

972
01:16:43,006 --> 01:16:43,967
Did we go to Fort Tavern?

973
01:16:44,627 --> 01:16:45,108
Yes, we did.

974
01:16:45,128 --> 01:16:48,490
We went to Fort Tavern one year.

975
01:16:49,131 --> 01:16:50,152
Then the Brooks Estate.

976
01:16:50,212 --> 01:16:51,933
We went to Fiorelli last year.

977
01:16:56,542 --> 01:17:01,925
I am more of a fan of an actual restaurant than a brewery deli.

978
01:17:01,945 --> 01:17:04,947
To be honest.

979
01:17:05,467 --> 01:17:06,828
Did we go to Long Cross before?

980
01:17:06,848 --> 01:17:08,329
Or was that another group?

981
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:11,110
Can I vote for a spot with outdoor dining?

982
01:17:15,023 --> 01:17:15,984
Yes.

983
01:17:16,485 --> 01:17:16,866
Thank you.

984
01:17:17,587 --> 01:17:21,192
We did porch before.

985
01:17:21,212 --> 01:17:22,994
That's right.

986
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:24,877
Oh, my God.

987
01:17:25,097 --> 01:17:26,859
Yeah, that wasn't great indoors.

988
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:27,901
Yeah.

989
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:29,623
Because it was too loud.

990
01:17:29,703 --> 01:17:30,745
We couldn't hear each other.

991
01:17:30,785 --> 01:17:31,786
Way too loud.

992
01:17:31,806 --> 01:17:31,946
Yeah.

993
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:34,935
It is a great venue for music.

994
01:17:34,975 --> 01:17:36,636
I think it was pouring rain that day.

995
01:17:36,656 --> 01:17:38,677
I think we had been indoors.

996
01:17:39,437 --> 01:17:42,339
We got rained out when we were at Real Gusto.

997
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:45,701
We were supposed to be having a picnic on the river.

998
01:17:45,721 --> 01:17:52,224
We were invited by, what's his name, to use his patio.

999
01:17:53,484 --> 01:17:58,027
Not Vinny.

1000
01:17:58,627 --> 01:17:59,948
We got rained out of that too.

1001
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:13,236
Sounds like long grass might be it, but they do have really good cocktails, gluten-free vegan menu, outdoor dining, pretty good menu.

1002
01:18:13,836 --> 01:18:17,719
So think about it, but I think that's ticking the boxes here.

1003
01:18:19,441 --> 01:18:19,961
I like that.

1004
01:18:19,981 --> 01:18:24,685
I like it.

1005
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:25,306
Yeah.

1006
01:18:26,146 --> 01:18:26,587
Ramona?

1007
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:27,917
You like it?

1008
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:28,517
Cool.

1009
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,377
We're going to long press.

1010
01:18:29,717 --> 01:18:35,719
I'll circulate some dates, like on a scheduling poll thing to see when folks might be not in Alaska.

1011
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:44,920
July 31st to August 10th.

1012
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:46,821
That's a good trip.

1013
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:47,781
All right.

1014
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:49,381
But I'll circulate a poll.

1015
01:18:50,881 --> 01:18:51,221
Awesome.

1016
01:18:51,881 --> 01:18:52,282
That was easy.

1017
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,662
I feel like that was a lot easier than last year.

1018
01:18:55,983 --> 01:18:58,164
that we've taken around a few times last year.

1019
01:18:58,225 --> 01:19:01,767
We were trying to go to Alta Cuba, but they were not opening in time.

1020
01:19:01,807 --> 01:19:03,428
So we ended up at theoretically.

1021
01:19:04,809 --> 01:19:10,893
Alta Cuba did apply for outdoor dining and they were approved.

1022
01:19:10,933 --> 01:19:11,233
Yeah.

1023
01:19:11,253 --> 01:19:12,314
They started building.

1024
01:19:13,535 --> 01:19:14,956
They walked by it the other day.

1025
01:19:15,396 --> 01:19:16,557
They built it out.

1026
01:19:16,577 --> 01:19:19,659
I think Alvaro's going to drop tables sometime this week.

1027
01:19:19,879 --> 01:19:20,099
Yeah.

1028
01:19:20,139 --> 01:19:23,061
So they took a couple of spaces.

1029
01:19:23,101 --> 01:19:24,743
Yeah, they carved out two parking spots.

1030
01:19:24,983 --> 01:19:25,223
Yeah.

1031
01:19:26,412 --> 01:19:29,613
Um, on Salem Street.

1032
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:30,733
Yeah.

1033
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,794
And right in front of El Tucuba, they've got two spots.

1034
01:19:36,255 --> 01:19:37,535
I still vote for Long Cross.

1035
01:19:38,296 --> 01:19:39,576
Okay.

1036
01:19:41,436 --> 01:19:41,977
All right.

1037
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:42,437
Okay.

1038
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:43,317
Long Cross it is.

1039
01:19:43,357 --> 01:19:43,777
Done.

1040
01:19:44,717 --> 01:19:44,997
Yay.

1041
01:19:45,017 --> 01:19:46,358
Long Cross it is and we'll find a date.

1042
01:19:46,598 --> 01:19:49,099
Yes.

1043
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:53,560
The next thing we have is minutes.

1044
01:20:02,138 --> 01:20:09,344
So we are just supposed to move approval for receipt of the minutes from May 14th?

1045
01:20:10,204 --> 01:20:10,685
Yes.

1046
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:15,268
I just moved approval.

1047
01:20:15,548 --> 01:20:16,869
You just moved, thank you.

1048
01:20:19,532 --> 01:20:21,133
Even though it says draft on it.

1049
01:20:22,386 --> 01:20:25,528
Well, they're draft until you approve them or receive them.

1050
01:20:27,509 --> 01:20:27,949
Okay.

1051
01:20:28,669 --> 01:20:31,131
I would consider that.

1052
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:32,831
Thank you.

1053
01:20:33,252 --> 01:20:34,772
Would anyone like to second that motion?

1054
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:37,914
I move that we approve the minutes.

1055
01:20:38,855 --> 01:20:39,255
All right.

1056
01:20:39,315 --> 01:20:40,255
Seconded by Reg.

1057
01:20:40,696 --> 01:20:42,456
And I will call the roll.

1058
01:20:42,957 --> 01:20:43,237
Doug?

1059
01:20:44,017 --> 01:20:44,277
Yes.

1060
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:45,498
Joan?

1061
01:20:46,018 --> 01:20:46,318
Yes.

1062
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:47,519
Ari?

1063
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:48,600
Yes.

1064
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:49,920
Kaylene?

1065
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:50,881
Yes.

1066
01:20:51,717 --> 01:20:52,718
And myself, yes.

1067
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,741
And it's our fruit.

1068
01:20:57,443 --> 01:20:58,304
And you, Reg.

1069
01:20:59,205 --> 01:21:00,727
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting to.

1070
01:21:00,847 --> 01:21:05,111
And I'm sitting close to you, I could... I know.

1071
01:21:05,131 --> 01:21:06,393
We're in the same air.

1072
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:17,524
I'm reading the list and you're not on the list.

1073
01:21:17,564 --> 01:21:18,305
That would be helpful.

1074
01:21:19,265 --> 01:21:19,646
Okay.

1075
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:27,333
Any other announcements business that we want to do we have any missing members or are we a full compliment.

1076
01:21:28,774 --> 01:21:29,835
So, right now.

1077
01:21:31,684 --> 01:21:39,209
Greg had to leave early today, but he also sent a letter earlier saying that he would like to step down from the committee.

1078
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:50,678
And it's he in his letter, he stated that he doesn't see how a member of the Conservation Commission adds value to the CPC.

1079
01:21:51,580 --> 01:22:00,503
And I can understand that concern, but it is in the legislation and we don't really have any say over the legislation.

1080
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:18,230
So I will reach out to the chair of the CPC, who is our former committee member, Heidi, and ask if she can help us to fulfill the role of a member from the Conservation Commission.

1081
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:43,570
So we have identified one potential person to take one of the two vacancies that we currently have of general public seats and submitted that for council approval and that's scheduled for June 25th.

1082
01:22:45,123 --> 01:22:50,567
So as of our July meeting, we should have one new member.

1083
01:22:51,748 --> 01:22:54,450
So that still leaves us down two.

1084
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:59,314
And we would love to recruit people.

1085
01:23:00,014 --> 01:23:03,817
Well, that's something we can talk about at the tabling event on Saturday.

1086
01:23:03,837 --> 01:23:03,917
Yeah.

1087
01:23:04,597 --> 01:23:05,998
Yes.

1088
01:23:07,099 --> 01:23:11,803
We've identified a new tactic to trying to recruit people.

1089
01:23:13,404 --> 01:23:14,705
So we can discuss that.

1090
01:23:15,627 --> 01:23:24,494
on Saturday, but yeah, if anybody has any suggestions for friends, this is the mayoral appointed position, so it's at large, so.

1091
01:23:26,596 --> 01:23:27,617
Reg, if you have anything.

1092
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:32,201
Do we have a geographic layout of the turret member setup?

1093
01:23:33,502 --> 01:23:34,843
No, but I can make one easily up.

1094
01:23:35,824 --> 01:23:40,287
Yeah, because it would be good if we could get somebody from an unrepresented area.

1095
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,829
I know where you live.

1096
01:23:42,069 --> 01:23:42,529
Oh, jeez.

1097
01:23:42,549 --> 01:23:43,950
I know where John is.

1098
01:23:45,624 --> 01:23:46,864
I think I remember where Ari lives.

1099
01:23:48,325 --> 01:23:53,066
But I can reach out and just, you know, I won't say like, do you want to meet up with Kayleen?

1100
01:23:53,126 --> 01:23:53,766
Here's her address.

1101
01:23:53,786 --> 01:23:55,686
You know, I won't do that.

1102
01:23:55,966 --> 01:23:58,887
Like a ward, almost like a ward representation type thing.

1103
01:23:58,967 --> 01:23:59,527
I can do that.

1104
01:23:59,547 --> 01:23:59,847
Yeah.

1105
01:24:00,187 --> 01:24:11,490
So I mean, it's helpful to have people, you know, a board that is socially, demographically, geographically,

1106
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:15,975
mixed representative of the community.

1107
01:24:17,356 --> 01:24:18,477
It's in our ordinance.

1108
01:24:19,838 --> 01:24:20,098
Yeah.

1109
01:24:20,198 --> 01:24:24,921
Honestly, off the top of my head, I think we're all pretty spread apart.

1110
01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:27,243
South Medford?

1111
01:24:27,383 --> 01:24:28,884
Do we have somebody from South Medford?

1112
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:32,266
That was always a hard place.

1113
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:33,227
Yeah.

1114
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:35,708
South Medford might be the only one that's not represented.

1115
01:24:35,888 --> 01:24:40,471
Why don't you ask Jim Silva what he thinks, if he has a recommendation.

1116
01:24:41,152 --> 01:24:42,453
That would be a great idea.

1117
01:24:42,936 --> 01:24:44,138
Thank you right now there.

1118
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:45,159
Welcome.

1119
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:47,803
So we should start it.

1120
01:24:47,903 --> 01:24:51,088
Our pitch by do you like to spend other people's money?

1121
01:24:54,098 --> 01:24:54,799
That's a good one.

1122
01:24:54,819 --> 01:24:57,802
That's a good way to pitch it.

1123
01:24:58,122 --> 01:25:03,006
Roberta, one quick question on the follow-up from the former representative from the Conservation Commission.

1124
01:25:03,046 --> 01:25:08,872
Did he feel his voice wasn't being heard or he brought no value?

1125
01:25:08,892 --> 01:25:14,256
Because I certainly don't think that was the case from all the recreation stuff we have.

1126
01:25:14,497 --> 01:25:18,901
I rely on landscape architects and people who know a lot about

1127
01:25:21,093 --> 01:25:25,136
environmental issues and wetlands, that to me is foundational to what we do.

1128
01:25:26,757 --> 01:25:27,278
I agree.

1129
01:25:27,298 --> 01:25:35,043
I haven't had a chance to speak with him about it myself nor Heidi.

1130
01:25:36,404 --> 01:25:40,086
I feel like there's a conversation to be had about that.

1131
01:25:41,567 --> 01:25:49,573
I certainly appreciated the questions and comments that he's raised in the time that he's been here, so I feel like he has been helpful.

1132
01:25:49,960 --> 01:26:10,651
But I can also understand if he doesn't see how what we're doing directly relates to his role and what he was expecting when he took the position on the Conservation Commission.

1133
01:26:10,711 --> 01:26:14,173
It is a very different mission than the Conservation Commission.

1134
01:26:17,932 --> 01:26:24,857
And do you happen to know if there are any vacancies on the conservation commission's form?

1135
01:26:24,877 --> 01:26:28,779
So there is an opportunity to recruit someone to serve on both.

1136
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:43,629
And it could be somebody who would be open to learning about conservation and spending funds, making investments in the community.

1137
01:26:45,473 --> 01:26:55,158
So, you know, I would love to talk with Heidi about how we can recruit somebody to specifically fulfill that role.

1138
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:04,082
So, that's my other business this evening.

1139
01:27:04,622 --> 01:27:07,824
I have just one update from M-Belts.

1140
01:27:08,864 --> 01:27:10,045
We have a new president now.

1141
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:14,473
Carly Nesson, who's from South Bedford.

1142
01:27:15,294 --> 01:27:17,035
We can't have her here though, she's partaken.

1143
01:27:19,897 --> 01:27:25,560
She's got big shoes to fill after Tom's 30 plus years.

1144
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:31,304
We had a special meeting on the 6th last Thursday where we introduced the membership and voted on her.

1145
01:27:32,585 --> 01:27:34,826
That's the bylaws of InBelt.

1146
01:27:35,627 --> 01:27:38,589
The torches of InBelt passed literally to the next generation.

1147
01:27:40,127 --> 01:27:40,387
Wow.

1148
01:27:41,147 --> 01:27:41,988
Congratulations.

1149
01:27:43,628 --> 01:27:44,809
It was tough to find someone.

1150
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:45,629
There weren't many.

1151
01:27:45,649 --> 01:27:47,590
There weren't 20 people knocking down my door.

1152
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:48,610
I'm going to be honest here.

1153
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:53,952
And we can meet Carly if we come to the July 13th picnic.

1154
01:27:54,052 --> 01:27:54,812
Is that right?

1155
01:27:55,705 --> 01:27:56,566
Yeah, she will be there.

1156
01:27:57,586 --> 01:27:58,727
Yep, she definitely be there.

1157
01:27:58,767 --> 01:28:04,531
Just thank you for the reminder on that, Teresa, because we've had, I think, at least 20 picnics at the Brooks Estate.

1158
01:28:04,551 --> 01:28:05,792
They're free and open to the public.

1159
01:28:06,513 --> 01:28:07,893
Usually have at least 100 people.

1160
01:28:08,134 --> 01:28:14,578
It's the second Saturday, the 13th in July, and it's free burgers and dogs.

1161
01:28:14,618 --> 01:28:18,161
We ask people just maybe bring a snack or dessert, but you pretty much show up and you'll get a

1162
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:28,848
a tour of the manor, a tour of the estate if you want to walk the trails, and then you can see where $600,000 of your CPC funds have gone over the last five years.

1163
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:38,075
So whatever happened with the arts community, they were coming to see that London phone booth at the Carriage House?

1164
01:28:38,496 --> 01:28:40,737
Yes, we got them into the Carriage House.

1165
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:44,100
The space they were planning on it for was like

1166
01:28:45,217 --> 01:28:50,159
eight-foot ceiling and this booth was seven foot, like 10 and a quarter.

1167
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:55,882
It was probably impossible given that it weighs a ton to actually get it in there physically.

1168
01:28:56,602 --> 01:28:58,223
It didn't seem like it worked out.

1169
01:28:58,803 --> 01:28:59,744
That was a few months ago.

1170
01:28:59,764 --> 01:29:01,205
I haven't heard of them since.

1171
01:29:02,145 --> 01:29:08,668
That's a longer-term project for wherever that London film booth that's been in the manor since the 80s is going to go.

1172
01:29:08,688 --> 01:29:14,071
Should ask Janine if there's a place for it at the McGlynn.

1173
01:29:16,932 --> 01:29:19,213
I don't think the kids know where the phone booth is anymore.

1174
01:29:19,233 --> 01:29:26,618
Yeah, but I can see her turning that into some sort of funky space inside of it, yeah.

1175
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:29,080
Yeah, it's definitely an art piece, not a function.

1176
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:30,120
Yeah, yeah.

1177
01:29:31,261 --> 01:29:31,742
That's it.

1178
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:32,882
Cool.

1179
01:29:34,283 --> 01:29:35,264
Any other updates?

1180
01:29:39,867 --> 01:29:40,247
All right.

1181
01:29:41,688 --> 01:29:42,749
Well, thank you, everyone.

1182
01:29:42,769 --> 01:29:46,431
Would someone like to make a motion to adjourn?

1183
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:48,954
I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1184
01:29:48,974 --> 01:29:52,277
Second.

1185
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,360
All right, then I will call the roll.

1186
01:29:56,081 --> 01:29:56,401
Ari?

1187
01:29:57,663 --> 01:29:57,943
Yes.

1188
01:29:59,244 --> 01:29:59,644
Joan?

1189
01:30:00,465 --> 01:30:00,926
Yes.

1190
01:30:01,686 --> 01:30:02,147
Doug?

1191
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:02,848
Yes.

1192
01:30:03,628 --> 01:30:04,089
Reg?

1193
01:30:04,889 --> 01:30:05,190
Yes.

1194
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:06,691
And myself, yes.

1195
01:30:08,233 --> 01:30:09,194
Have a good evening, everybody.

1196
01:30:09,214 --> 01:30:09,594
Thank you.
