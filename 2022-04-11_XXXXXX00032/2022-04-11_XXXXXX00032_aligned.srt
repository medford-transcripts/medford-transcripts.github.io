00:00:04,897 --> 00:00:08,619
Hey Medford Bites listeners, today we have a little bit of a different episode for you.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,424
Today's interview is of me, conducted by Chelly Kishaven, in recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.

3
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:20,267
This interview does contain discussion about rape and sexual violence and its impact.

4
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:24,050
We hope that this conversation prompts further thinking and discussion.

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,913
If it brings up more difficult feelings, I've also put resources in the show notes for support.

6
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,296
One point of clarification from the interview today.

7
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:43,924
We talk a little bit about the definition of sexual assault and I want to be clear here that many people go through a process of doubting if what was done to them counts or was bad enough.

8
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,668
And lots of people stay silent about sexual trauma for fear of not being believed.

9
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:54,573
I want to state explicitly for those people that you are seen, you are believed, and you are loved.

10
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:56,034
Thank you for listening.

11
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:03,430
Hi, everybody.

12
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,411
My name is Chelly Keshavan.

13
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:14,379
I am the chair of the Medford Human Rights Commission and board member at Medford Health Matters and VP of the West Medford Community Center.

14
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:18,042
I am super excited to be here today interviewing Danielle.

15
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:20,704
My pronouns are she, her, hers.

16
00:01:21,745 --> 00:01:26,369
I think today we are talking about Danielle's work with the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.

17
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,092
Yeah, so do you want to share an introduction?

18
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,132
Sure, thank you.

19
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:35,774
I'm a little nervous to be in this seat today, but my name is Danielle Belaca.

20
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:37,895
My pronouns are she and her.

21
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:47,139
I normally am the host of this podcast, but also I'm a mom of two kids in Medford, and we'll talk a little bit more about this, but I'm a social worker.

22
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,320
I work at the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.

23
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:51,919
That's so exciting.

24
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:58,768
Do you want to speak a little bit to your professional role and talk about the work that BARC does?

25
00:01:59,289 --> 00:01:59,549
Sure.

26
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:01,492
I was trained as a social worker.

27
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:05,537
I went to Salem State a long time ago now.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,821
for a master's in social work, which is a great program.

29
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:17,203
And as part of my final internship, I was an intern at the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.

30
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:20,084
And I almost never left.

31
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:24,426
I took like one year off working somewhere else, but basically been there ever since.

32
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:32,269
My role there right now, so I sort of started as a clinical intern, and now I manage that program, so I help train

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,653
Masters and doctoral level students who are pursuing some type of counseling degree.

34
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:42,236
So social work, mental health counseling, doctors and psychology.

35
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,520
And so alongside them I also do the counseling work.

36
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,285
So I work with survivors of sexual assault and sexual violence and also their loved ones.

37
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:55,707
So their friends, family, partners.

38
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:02,205
And we do individual counseling on kind of a short-term model.

39
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,228
We also provide group counseling.

40
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,950
We do also work with couples and families.

41
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:11,093
And that's a lot of the work that the counseling department does.

42
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:14,596
But BARC, as an organization, does a lot of other work.

43
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:17,879
So clients find their way to us.

44
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,721
Either they've heard of us or they've Googled us.

45
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:26,284
More commonly, they've called our hotline for some kind of support, and they're referred to counseling.

46
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:33,507
We also have a program called Medical Advocacy, which meets survivors in the emergency room.

47
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:40,249
So if they've gone to an emergency room to do an evidence collection kit around their sexual trauma,

48
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:56,784
hopefully they're at a hospital that has a sexual assault nurse examiner and also the hospital will reach out to Barks Medical Advocacy so someone will meet them there, talk to them about our services and also sit with them through as much or as little of their time in the emergency room as they choose.

49
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,566
So those are like kind of our main programs.

50
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,748
We also do have like a community

51
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:06,191
awareness, prevention, education, and outreach program.

52
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,452
So they do a lot of trainings.

53
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:18,318
We'll talk a little bit more about today about sort of prevention and some of the approaches around that, but they do a lot of that work with college campuses, businesses in Boston.

54
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:24,041
And yeah, we serve a majority of like the greater, sort of the like 95 sort of corridor.

55
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:26,843
Yeah, 95 Belt Highway.

56
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:27,303
Yeah.

57
00:04:27,863 --> 00:04:29,364
And our main office is in Central Square.

58
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,325
We just actually yesterday

59
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:55,047
which this will come out a little later, but we had like a ceremony, ribbon cutting for our new space in Central Square, which is the same building, but the city did something really cool where there's 11 non-profits in our building at 99 Bishop Allen Drive, and we were sort of at risk for losing that space, and the Redevelopment Association purchased it and totally renovated the building.

60
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,388
It's beautiful, so we had that yesterday.

61
00:04:58,168 --> 00:04:58,708
That's exciting.

62
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,930
Yeah, a pretty beautiful and welcoming space.

63
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,691
Yeah.

64
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:10,717
Maybe we can start with sort of an upstream question and maybe I can ask you, what does sexual violence mean?

65
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:13,119
What are we talking about when we use that term?

66
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,582
I think it means different things to a lot of people.

67
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:23,532
I think we're recording this because of sexual assault awareness month, so I think it's important.

68
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:33,845
We'll hopefully talk about lots of different ideas about sexual violence, but there is a very legal definition of rape, and that's not always very relevant.

69
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,008
I think it's pretty technical and involves

70
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:44,712
some pretty specific criteria, but we, like at Bark, when we were meeting with people and hearing their stories, sexual violence can mean a lot of different things.

71
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:57,376
I think there's this idea of rape being like the boogeyman who jumps out of the bushes and attacks you, some stranger that you're supposed to be sort of anticipating all the time.

72
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,758
you know, that's really a very rare kind of scenario.

73
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:16,123
I think a lot of people, I mean, it's in the name, but sexual violence, associate rape and sexual trauma with violence, and we know that a lot of sexual assault does not involve, like, physical violence.

74
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:27,827
So I like to talk about sexual trauma as really being about power and control, and sometimes that, you know, often that is in the context of a relationship, and the perpetrator is somebody that we trust.

75
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:39,039
I think we'll talk today a little bit about sort of the gendered aspect of sexual violence, but I do like to be explicit of like, you know, it's not like a women's issue.

76
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:48,709
There are a lot of survivors who identify as women, but we also know there's a lot of men who have been victims of sexual trauma.

77
00:06:52,313 --> 00:07:07,019
Can you speak to some, is there a mythology or are there sort of conceptions around sexual violence that we are possibly not naming or identifying or sort of bringing to the surface as far as discussion and understanding?

78
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,200
Totally.

79
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,920
Culturally maybe?

80
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:10,249
Totally.

81
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:20,020
I think that, you know, kind of like I was describing earlier, I think people, when we talk about sexual violence, there's like one picture that comes to mind and a lot that's excluded.

82
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:27,509
So, and maybe you can, if there's anything that you want to add to like, I think like people do usually exclude

83
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:41,759
you know at first glance like any sexual trauma that happens in a relationship or like crossing of boundaries and in a marriage or things like that that there's sometimes like this expectation of like Well, we're married.

84
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:51,786
So like, you know, everything's on the table, which you know, he knows yes and something also like Consent I think consent can be

85
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,088
like a tricky thing.

86
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:59,012
And you and I were talking a little bit before about this idea of like blanket consent.

87
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:04,617
So like consent should be like enthusiastic and sort of like an ongoing conversation.

88
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:15,606
So, you know, oftentimes I think we'll hear about like coerced consent where somebody is like asking and asking and asking until somebody just finally submits, right?

89
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:16,907
And that's really not consent.

90
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:19,649
And then other examples of like,

91
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:29,681
you know, if there is consent to a certain, like, engagement, like intimate engagement, that, you know, it doesn't count forever.

92
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:32,164
So, like, that communication around,

93
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,681
intimacy is really important.

94
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:51,876
I think when we were talking I think you might have used the term enthusiastic, yes, and I was so impressed and what came up for me was reflecting on times where

95
00:08:52,897 --> 00:09:10,690
I thought that I was communicating with a person who was an intimate partner properly or clearly rather and in hindsight now realizing that I was not sharing the messaging that I thought I was sharing and that the other person was taking steps based on a different

96
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:18,296
communication that I thought it was offering and then that there were hard feelings after the fact.

97
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:29,024
And so at that time in life I had never heard the term enthusiastic yes and I also maybe didn't know that it was okay to insist on that level of comfort communication.

98
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:36,790
Yeah, so how do we, I love it, how do we speak to that learning process, how do we offer people that

99
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,693
spaces that everybody deserves, all those things.

100
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,655
Thank you for sharing that.

101
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:52,344
And I think you bring up a really important point, which is that sometimes those dynamics are about things that maybe aren't actually in the room.

102
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:58,449
So like the conditioning of folks around maybe gender expectations, right?

103
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,980
We, in our volunteer training at Bark, we used to watch this video with a pretty explicit name.

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,782
It was called, like, Frank the Rapist, I think.

105
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:13,871
And what, so I think this was not an actual person, but it was like a composite of, like, actual stories or actual, like,

106
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:37,213
people so basically it's like in this it's like a talks about this like guy at a frat party and the expectation of at these parties is that these like you know men get guests at the party really drunk and then they have sex with them and there's like resistance to that from on the part of the women but the expectation is the men just like go for it and that's like and and

107
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:45,425
And I think you can sort of have some empathy for both sides there, where this is what these men have been told is their role, right?

108
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:51,254
This is what they should do no matter what, and there's not a lot of room for understanding.

109
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:54,654
that there needs to be consent, right?

110
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:55,355
Absolutely.

111
00:10:55,435 --> 00:11:01,885
And like I think also expectation of women, like what does society expect of us in these situations?

112
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:07,414
We had talked a little bit about like, I hear this a lot in my work too, of like,

113
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:11,536
when is there a choice to say no, right?

114
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:13,597
And that shouldn't be a line, right?

115
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:16,057
It shouldn't be like, well, this person didn't say no.

116
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:23,980
The line should be like, well, did they say yes, and did they really explicitly communicate that they wanted this, right?

117
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:33,763
And I think we hear, I hear a lot about that, those reactions in the moment on the part of the person who's being harmed, really creating a lot of,

118
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:37,384
shame and self-blame and guilt in the end, right?

119
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:46,388
And I think when we look at those, you know, we talk commonly about that like trauma response in the moment, you know, we hear about like fight or flight.

120
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:46,929
Yes.

121
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,610
And one that, and those I think are like more easy to understand, right?

122
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,092
Like if somebody's threatening me I either run away or try to fight them.

123
00:11:54,972 --> 00:12:02,158
One or two that are really common for sexual violence is to fawn or to freeze and sort of submit.

124
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:06,742
So maybe my brain is telling me in this moment, I don't have a choice to get out of this.

125
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:09,705
I just need to sort of get through it in whatever way I can.

126
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:16,731
And sometimes that is just getting through it and freezing and not being able to fight.

127
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:19,313
And I think our brain perceives in those moments

128
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:39,991
fighting or fleeing could put me in more danger, so I'm gonna do whatever I can to survive and sometimes like that is really confusing to people after the fact right and they And that's something that we hear about a lot is like that like I should have done this I could have done this why didn't I do this and that just real sense of like

129
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,271
How did I contribute to this?

130
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:55,873
And I think we talked about those expectations of if somebody is making a move on me, it's rude to say no, or it's rude to turn them down.

131
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,834
I'm supposed to be polite.

132
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:06,276
My favorite meme is this one that was like, I am woman, hear me apologize when I bump into an empty chair.

133
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,558
Absolutely.

134
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:20,010
I think those types of things definitely come up around consent and around that sort of dynamic with sexual trauma.

135
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:22,113
I've definitely had experiences where

136
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:51,849
I have perceived a hierarchy of other people's experience of the moment if acts have happened in public spaces and reflecting on a fear around disrupting the whole environment and holding that as more important than my physical comfort and kind of freezing and saying, I'll just, I'll find a coping mechanism, move through it, and feel upset later.

137
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:52,949
Yeah, for sure.

138
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:02,137
Yeah, and sometimes I don't know that that's always a conscious choice that we make and sometimes it's like our brain taking over, especially if we've had experiences like this in the past.

139
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:10,785
And that's something that I think people see after the fact too, is this like, sometimes I talk about it as like a miscalibrated alarm system.

140
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:18,352
Some of us have smoke detectors right near our stoves, and so they're always going off even though there's not a fire.

141
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,936
And that's kind of what trauma does to our brain, right?

142
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:25,839
Something that usually we could cope with pretty easily is now setting off that alarm.

143
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,782
And so that's a lot of the work that we do with clients at BARC is kind of

144
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:36,808
Helping them understand like my brain is responding to danger, and how do I assess that accurately right like am I in danger right now?

145
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:37,849
How do I ground myself?

146
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,872
How do I know that because that alarm is really important it keeps us safe right?

147
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:51,818
It's like we need to know when there is danger so that we can make it You know try to make whatever choice we can for ourselves But like I think you know I think with sexual trauma.

148
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:55,681
It's really it's not a logical thing right like so when we

149
00:14:57,142 --> 00:15:03,727
when people try to recover from trauma, they're applying these principles that work for normal circumstances.

150
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:10,232
So like, I'm going to try to find my fault in this situation so that next time I can make a different choice and I'll be safe.

151
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:15,056
And that just doesn't work with sexual violence because it's not your fault.

152
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:19,780
So you can't find that thing that will ultimately allow you to take responsibility for it.

153
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,063
We talk about this a lot with like alcohol consumption or like substance use so when there's which is a common story, right?

154
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:42,171
Like I went out I had too much to drink I woke up the next morning and you realize that this had happened right or this person had done something to me and And I think a lot of those cases we don't hear about because people say oh well that was the consequence that I that I got for like that's right drinking too much and

155
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:46,554
My response to that is like, that's not a normal consequence for drinking, right?

156
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,656
If you drink too much, you get a hangover, right?

157
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,018
Or you don't feel great the next day.

158
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:53,961
A natural consequence is not sexual assault.

159
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:58,285
And I think it's a really like, it's not a linear process, right?

160
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:05,872
There's a talk a lot about how you can know something rationally and understand it rationally, like to know that this was not your fault.

161
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:13,575
But it doesn't always translate to how you feel immediately, so there's a lot of work there in sort of, you know, helping people through that process.

162
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:14,035
Sure.

163
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:17,556
I'm sure you're familiar with the exhibit entitled What They Were Wearing.

164
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,436
I've heard of this, yeah.

165
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:26,298
Yeah, so for women who are willing, they were sharing the clothing that they wore when they were...

166
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:39,729
when an assault happened, to speak to maybe a similar thing where some folks are told, well, this happened because you were dressed provocatively, or you were asking for it, or whatever the commentary may be.

167
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:45,454
And the exhibit was trying to make the point that you shared, that this is so much about power and control.

168
00:16:50,082 --> 00:16:59,813
Maybe fear based power and control as well as opposed to any other factor yeah, no totally and we you know we talked about like

169
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:07,576
There's some language that I try to remind myself to use when we talk about sexual trauma.

170
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,937
It's not something that happens, it's something that is done.

171
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,459
Somebody makes a conscious choice to do this.

172
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:17,600
I think it's not like a, whoops, this just happened.

173
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,521
This is an intentional thing, an exercise of that power and control.

174
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:27,855
we talk about how you should be able to walk down the street naked and not be sexually assaulted, right?

175
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:32,718
That's not, the way that you dress is not an invitation for someone to do something to you.

176
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:48,266
And we talked, I think, a little bit about this, too, like, how that, like, it's not, like, being proud of how you look and, like, wanting to, like, feel comfortable and wear clothes that, like, you know, show that, that's something to be proud of.

177
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:50,047
It's not, like, a reason that

178
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,829
It's not like a way to attract harm, right?

179
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:54,749
Sure, sure.

180
00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:08,556
I think we also touched on, like, well, you know, men are invited to not wear shirts as soon as the temperature passed that of their bodies, and it's never been an option in my life or for others.

181
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,221
Yeah, totally.

182
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:21,487
I remember in high school, like, doing our, like, in the spring sports, like, running our warm-up mile or whatever, and one time, like, just wearing a sports bra and being, like, told that I could not do that.

183
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:21,667
Yeah.

184
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:24,649
I do think they maybe have a rule for the boys, too, but I probably came later.

185
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:25,369
Yeah.

186
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,150
Yeah, totally.

187
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,690
Yeah, dress codes, absolutely.

188
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:27,931
Yeah.

189
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:28,571
So...

190
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:40,771
I'm wondering about the concentric needs of a trauma survivor, sort of immediate needs, and then what do effective trajectory plans look like for support?

191
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:48,466
I think a lot more disruptive to people's lives than we might think, right?

192
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:50,068
Like I think of like a ripple effect.

193
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:55,693
So also some services at BART that I didn't mention are legal advocacy and case management, which are huge, right?

194
00:18:55,753 --> 00:19:03,560
And like I feel so lucky to have those programs at BART because there's like a lot of functional needs that I can't solve as a counselor, right?

195
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,182
So like lost wages.

196
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:08,505
So if somebody, we hear a lot about sexual assault that happens in the workplace.

197
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:18,668
Like, if I can't go to work because my perpetrator is there, or I can't go to work because I'm so scared to leave my house, things like that.

198
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,930
And just, you know, I think that there is...

199
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:28,924
a process for folks, or like a legal process that is available.

200
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:37,769
And I think when people think about what do people need immediately after sexual trauma, sometimes that comes to mind, like they need to tell the police.

201
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,670
That's an option.

202
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:53,454
It's not what they what people don't need is to be told that right like I think So what we try to do is like give them all the information like here all the choices that you can make Some some things around like evidence collection.

203
00:19:53,494 --> 00:20:00,976
There's like a timetable for that So we try to give them as much information about like here's what you could expect if you waited longer

204
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:11,874
But it's not a surprise that that system, the criminal legal system, is really not set up to serve those people, right?

205
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:15,515
So, you know, that's a system that's also dominated by power and control, right?

206
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:21,397
So we're talking about, like, oftentimes women who are, you know,

207
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:30,912
harmed, and it's a process in which you become the person that's sort of being investigated, right?

208
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,012
So all those questions that like, well, what were you wearing?

209
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:33,973
Like, what did you drink?

210
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:34,633
Where did you go?

211
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:35,633
Why did you do this, right?

212
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:45,275
And it's a process that is really long, like it's several years before you even usually get to a point where they decide if they're gonna take this up.

213
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:46,476
It's a pretty, like,

214
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:50,890
a disempowering process.

215
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,151
Invasive.

216
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,372
Yeah, totally.

217
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:57,835
And oftentimes there's no real form of justice.

218
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:04,601
So that is actually something that we talk with people a lot about is how can you sort of define closure for yourself?

219
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:09,646
How can you define a way of moving through this that maybe is detached from that system?

220
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,367
Because we don't have any control over that.

221
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:15,551
And that's a great point, like a great point too is like,

222
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,544
When people are sexually assaulted or they've experienced sexual violence, it's a point in time where all power and control is taken away from them.

223
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:38,656
So I think giving folks that experience of being able to have choice, being able to have some control, pointing out what are ways that you can do that is really valuable for survivors because so much of what happens after that is

224
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:51,392
can feel like, even like the internal experience of trauma, right, like the flashbacks, nightmares, like these intrusive thoughts, dissociation, things like that can make you feel like you're even out of control of your own body.

225
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:56,899
So being able to sort of help folks think about choice in that way.

226
00:21:57,795 --> 00:22:05,318
Sometimes I wonder about the ways in which, again, oftentimes women do not have space to be self-determining to the same effect that men do.

227
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:10,881
Just being pregnant is not having full control over your body in the way that not being pregnant is.

228
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,561
Breastfeeding is the same.

229
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:20,405
Perhaps answering to a partner or a male partner's life and goals and schedule and money and answering to children.

230
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:25,127
So I feel like in a lot of ways, women move in spaces that answer rather than

231
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:31,639
hold agency to begin with.

232
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:41,284
When people have identified an incident of sexual violence, it kind of throws into contrast the rest of their life.

233
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:50,748
Yeah, I really did not want this to happen, but it also makes me think about all these other things in my life where I didn't really want that, but I didn't think I had a choice.

234
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:56,030
Or it was just easier for me to do that than try to argue for something else.

235
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:06,816
I think people do oftentimes tie sexual violence and domestic violence together, and definitely there are relationships that include both.

236
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:18,163
Personally, I think if there is physical violence in a relationship or a level of control and coercion, there's probably likely some kind of sexual element to that.

237
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:21,525
I think it would be really hard to engage sexually with somebody who was treating you like that.

238
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:22,486
Absolutely.

239
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:24,587
Without any fear, right?

240
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:24,928
Right.

241
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:25,468
Yeah.

242
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:41,631
Something that comes to mind, I felt it in my young life to a certain extent, but certainly not to the same extent as young people now, how does the digital world

243
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:59,118
lend to this conversation as far as the plethora of ways that folks can share images and videos and to what extent do they understand the ramifications of that, specifically maybe young people.

244
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,700
What are your thoughts?

245
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:01,920
Yeah.

246
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,241
It's not something that I have a ton of knowledge about.

247
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:07,562
Quite honestly, I'm a terrible millennial in that way.

248
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:09,143
I don't have a lot of tech skills.

249
00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:15,525
But I think I remember in middle school when instant messenger was the big thing.

250
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:22,307
And I remember being teased in sort of a sexual way by peers at school.

251
00:24:22,347 --> 00:24:24,628
And it was really hurtful.

252
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:26,929
And we hear about cyberbullying and all those things.

253
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,030
I think that there is an importance

254
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:44,866
like teaching responsibility around some of those things so like what is the like if you know what are people asking for online what are people sharing I also think it's like another way to shame people right like I've overheard conversations about like judgment about

255
00:24:47,448 --> 00:24:50,611
Look what she posted, that picture of herself.

256
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:53,453
And I think it can be a powerful way of organizing.

257
00:24:53,473 --> 00:24:58,576
I think around Me Too and we've heard people calling out perpetrators online.

258
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:03,160
I think sometimes it can be a useful tool in that way.

259
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,362
I think I've had people talk to me about

260
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:10,724
Posting about their posting their story or writing a post about it.

261
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:11,584
I think too.

262
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,424
It's like it's always a calculation, right?

263
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:17,925
Like how much how is that gonna help you or what's it gonna feel like?

264
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:25,287
If you don't get the response that you want or if you do get the response you want But it's mixed with some inevitable trolls right on the internet, right?

265
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:27,008
But yeah, it's it's a tricky one.

266
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:36,850
Yeah, I think when we had talked we had said something to the effect of socially we often maybe this segues into another thought we

267
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:52,464
the discussion of what healthy sexuality can look like and offering toolkits around that in an effort to maybe mitigate spaces where assault or lesser than that can occur.

268
00:25:52,845 --> 00:26:00,692
Yeah, I think we had been talking about how do we talk to our kids about sexual violence and I think that like, you know,

269
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:08,837
I think there is a way to talk about boundaries and consent and sort of what you want shared and what you don't.

270
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:11,818
And I think that maybe applies to the digital space.

271
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:18,262
But also kids, I think kids aren't often told that their bodies are theirs.

272
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:23,945
There's so many times where parents have to say, we have control over everything about their lives.

273
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:28,647
And so I think being able to model boundaries, even in little ways,

274
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:32,249
Grandma wants to hug you.

275
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:34,030
It's okay not to hug her.

276
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,912
Yes, she's your grandmother, but if that's not something you want, give options, right?

277
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,093
You want to give her a high five?

278
00:26:39,113 --> 00:26:40,734
Do you want to wave to her when you leave?

279
00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:44,996
And letting them know that that's okay to have those boundaries.

280
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:46,837
But it's tricky, too.

281
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:57,582
our son, you have to bathe your kids, you have to make sure that they're clean, and being able to say, we do this to you, but also nobody else should.

282
00:26:58,142 --> 00:27:01,123
Somebody might change your diaper at daycare, but nobody else should be doing that.

283
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:11,068
And I think as they get older, talking with them about how would you know when you felt uncomfortable, what tells you that maybe somebody's kind of like,

284
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:35,942
Creeping in on some of those boundaries because like kids know that you know yes, but I think you had some great points though about That autonomy in more of like a sex positive way right of like you can explore Your own body, and you can do that like in your private time right like And there's spaces where that's okay to do and that's really important to do I have two boys, but I don't know if it

285
00:27:37,143 --> 00:27:41,509
I have one boy and one girl, I think mine might be a little bit older than yours, but

286
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:56,158
I know that there's space between what I think I'm saying to them and what they're hearing, but I'm hoping that I'm saying, to your point, there is a time and place for exploring your own body.

287
00:27:56,198 --> 00:28:08,941
There are reasons to do so that will help build your own understanding of self and confidence and also a healthy intuition about yourself and others.

288
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:13,662
And my hope for them is they take that into relationships with others when they get older.

289
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:15,022
Yeah.

290
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:16,943
Yeah.

291
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:21,844
I think that's also really good for reducing shame about sex, right?

292
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:32,768
It's not something that you do in the dark as a secret, but this is something that you can and should do and feel good about within those sort of private spaces, right?

293
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:34,128
Yeah, totally.

294
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:53,162
It makes me think of a different point, too, about childhood sexual abuse, where the way we talk with kids about privacy versus secrecy is important, so not asking your kids to keep a secret, being able to say that they can share things with you, and I think having those conversations about

295
00:28:55,583 --> 00:29:07,568
boundaries and consent and sexual violence in a proactive way is helpful, too, because the hope is that then if they can come to you, or if something happens, it's not the first time you're talking about these things, right?

296
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:10,589
There's sort of an open communication about these topics.

297
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:18,750
recognizing amongst peers if I imagine they will.

298
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:20,612
I think we touched on this, too.

299
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:31,079
Instead of the sort of stranger danger, dare approach, like watch out for the rapist, to kind of build a toolkit around this is likely something that you'll interact with at different points in life.

300
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:38,664
So let's try to build some strategies around how to respond and knowing who your couple people that you could reach out to.

301
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:43,267
I think something I'm hoping for my kids is that they will always have people they can call day or night.

302
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:48,189
that will show up like ride or die hardcore type of people.

303
00:29:48,809 --> 00:30:01,553
Yeah, well and I think that that's a big thing when I talk to like younger people, like teenagers about their sexual trauma and like what it feels like to talk to their parents is like there is a lot of like, am I gonna get in trouble for this?

304
00:30:02,373 --> 00:30:04,215
And I think that's similar for adults, right?

305
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:06,617
That sense of, is this my fault?

306
00:30:06,817 --> 00:30:08,638
Are they gonna be mad that this happened?

307
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:18,286
But I think it's also maybe a helpful segue into talking about prevention, too, because I think it needs to be said to kids that it's not their fault.

308
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:22,950
It's not their job to prevent childhood sexual abuse.

309
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:28,915
And the same thing, I think when we think about prevention, we have to think about those myths of sexual trauma, right?

310
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:34,799
it's not on vulnerable people to stop sexual trauma, right?

311
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,763
Sexual trauma is not gonna end by changing the way we dress, changing our alcohol consumption, right?

312
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:50,251
It's about, I think, also about those, what are we telling, what are those values of, like, misogyny, right?

313
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:55,314
Like, who has the right to what, and how do we sort of communicate

314
00:30:57,742 --> 00:30:59,991
those sort of values I think across the board.

315
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:00,513
Absolutely.

316
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:07,563
Yeah, it also makes me think about, you know, you had brought some good points actually in our conversation about in Medford how we can apply some of these things.

317
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,825
Right, we are both Medford moms.

318
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:10,726
Yeah.

319
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:19,773
Yeah, I'm absolutely, I know that pieces like the gender equity ordinance have come up on many occasions at the city council.

320
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:28,360
The noted until recently sort of discrepancy between having a largely male council and such a largely female school committee and what does all of that mean.

321
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:33,184
What does it mean to have a mayor who is a woman and mother?

322
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:37,347
And what does baton passing look like?

323
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:41,670
What are the services in Medford?

324
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,713
Where do folks go if there are services or not?

325
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:47,474
Are they strong?

326
00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:50,917
What does the model look like and do we all know?

327
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:52,953
do we all know?

328
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:53,533
I don't know.

329
00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:58,997
There are so many questions and I am both rooted and I also have no idea.

330
00:31:59,377 --> 00:31:59,618
Yeah.

331
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:00,859
So that's a problem.

332
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:02,540
And I could probably say the same.

333
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:02,980
I don't know.

334
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,263
I mean I know we have actually a really strong public health department that they do like a lot of really great work.

335
00:32:07,303 --> 00:32:09,265
I don't know about like sexual violence though.

336
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:18,523
But yeah, and also I think you had talked about some really pretty innovative ideas about what businesses and restaurants could do.

337
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:20,405
So this is where alcohol is being served.

338
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:24,950
What are maybe some safety mechanisms that we put in place?

339
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:25,851
Yeah.

340
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:38,520
I think those are all pieces that the city should be centering as we're evolving, for sure.

341
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:41,002
Also training of police, right?

342
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:52,932
I think like a common one is more commonly people are trained around or police are trained around domestic violence and I would probably say not well trained around domestic violence and the number of times I've like even heard of

343
00:32:53,713 --> 00:33:05,544
Survivors going to the police and really not like almost being discouraged to make a report is like baffling to me, but But yeah, it also kind of makes me like our other the other thing.

344
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:09,447
I think we wanted to talk about was the sort of intersection between

345
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:12,460
race and racial trauma and sexual trauma.

346
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:18,968
And it's something that at BARC we try really hard to hold, to acknowledge.

347
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:26,677
It's important that when folks come into our offices they can see just not a bunch of white faces.

348
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:41,362
And that even if we are white, that we are able to be pretty explicit about race, like racial difference or racial similarity and how that can play into the already, that power dynamic that already exists between a counselor and a client.

349
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:47,343
But I think the systems of oppression are pretty similar too, right?

350
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:56,446
Racial oppression and then the oppression around sexual violence and how we sort of think about changing that.

351
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:57,723
Sure.

352
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:05,738
We were making the point about workplace assault and my head immediately went to, well, what if your perpetrator is tethered to your check?

353
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:09,705
There are so many intersections that make it

354
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,693
did more difficult, tenfold if not more.

355
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:14,654
Totally.

356
00:34:14,714 --> 00:34:25,950
I do think that you brought up too some elements about sexual trauma that can be, like when we think about differences of power, right, where I think we hear common narratives about like

357
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:37,644
the sort of, like, exoticization of different ethnicities and how, you know, some, you know, maybe you want to share.

358
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:46,325
Yeah, no, and I can, like, take full responsibility for this just being, like, my thought process and not, you know, fact-checked anywhere.

359
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:57,267
But my sense is that there has always been a protection of the purity of a white woman to the point of

360
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:24,582
I think of it as like an incubator, like we have to hold this space for like a childlikeness, like there's like white tears comes to mind, a damsel narrative comes to mind, but I think about what it means to have like solidly white relationships and the sexual aspect of those led to like

361
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:49,372
reproduction like we have children with other white people we build families and intergenerational narrative with other white people and then wondering if sort of sexual vices are held for women of color where that like again like it conflates like healthy sexuality with like a dirtiness maybe and like

362
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:52,991
does the white man bring that to white women or no?

363
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,533
Because can she handle it?

364
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,175
Do I even ask her to handle it?

365
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:02,499
Do I acknowledge that she has her own sexual wants, desires, hopes, whatever?

366
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,420
Maybe not.

367
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,060
Probably not.

368
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:04,541
I don't know.

369
00:36:06,803 --> 00:36:14,749
There are sexual acts that are asked of women of color or perpetrated on women of color that

370
00:36:15,785 --> 00:36:20,090
I'm not sure if race plays a role.

371
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:34,445
Maybe like this sort of racial hierarchy, I see these folks as less of people so I'm okay with these sexual acts, or that's how I use those people.

372
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:44,181
like a final comment on an identity out in public.

373
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:59,153
Maybe the safety of a white sexual relationship and what it means for a public persona is different from, like I can have a, yeah, maybe it affords space for more of a double identity there.

374
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:01,215
It's complicated.

375
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,277
Yeah, it's hard to put into words.

376
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:04,698
It makes me think about like,

377
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:20,669
also in our history of white women claiming rape by black men in order to, whatever the situation may be, and that causing a lot of harm to those communities.

378
00:37:20,729 --> 00:37:27,835
And I think it's something that we hear a lot, too, of like, I don't want to report this black man because I know what will happen to him.

379
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:31,617
That might not happen to white men who are reported for these sorts of things.

380
00:37:31,677 --> 00:37:34,359
And that sort of disparity, like how

381
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,522
how these situations play out, too.

382
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:49,852
It's also something we haven't talked about is I think that what is maybe also another myth about sexual violence is the false reporting, that they could be not telling the truth.

383
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:54,595
And my question to that is, well, why?

384
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:58,498
Because we know these processes are not fun.

385
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,161
They often end up dragging the person who's making this claim through the mud.

386
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:07,628
they are the one who's remembered for making this claim and the outcome's not good.

387
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:23,778
I always think about Chanel Miller, she was the Stanford, this is named Brock Turner, they essentially found her unconscious behind a dumpster and he went to jail for six months.

388
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:31,002
She kept her name out of it until everything was done, but she wrote a beautiful book.

389
00:38:31,462 --> 00:38:39,167
She said two men found her, they knew exactly what had happened, they were able to prove everything, and he went to jail for six months.

390
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:40,568
That's not a penalty.

391
00:38:40,948 --> 00:38:45,391
And why would you put yourself through that process for what?

392
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:52,635
And this other claim that I hear often is, well, if you report this person, you're going to ruin their life.

393
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:54,877
Well haven't they already ruined my life?

394
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,498
Or what about the impact to me?

395
00:38:56,938 --> 00:39:01,762
And also you're probably not going to ruin their life because what's going to happen to them?

396
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:06,025
Yeah, totally.

397
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:13,751
I got onto my soapbox in a conversation with someone about six months ago and I was hearing the narrative.

398
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:19,484
sexual and domestic violence happens in low-income communities.

399
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:21,426
This person and I kind of lost it.

400
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:25,068
And I was like, well, or not.

401
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:37,817
But it brings to mind folks who know that they have resources, whether it be dollars or network, to kind of clean up a legal mess if and when it comes up.

402
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:44,023
how that plays in to choices or liberties that they assume.

403
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:47,486
One, like, think about all the eyes on people in low-income communities, right?

404
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:54,093
Like, there's, like, you know, maybe it's being seen in a different way or, like, because when these, like, people in mansions can hide everything, right?

405
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:59,779
Like, there's a lot of privilege in that way, sort of, to be able to, like, hide any of those things, right?

406
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:00,500
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:40:01,962 --> 00:40:02,102
Oof.

408
00:40:03,438 --> 00:40:03,898
big stuff.

409
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:04,718
Yeah.

410
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:25,223
Does BARC have, I feel like I ask everybody that I ever talk to questions like this, is there a sort of a design curriculum that folks can lean on if they're wanting to onboard, like I mean I can just highlight myself, like at the Human Rights Commission or at the Community Center are there

411
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:31,007
Yeah, are there spaces to lean on for help in getting this discussion started?

412
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:37,872
Yeah, so that's our COAPS, the acronym is for like Community Outreach Awareness Prevention Education Services.

413
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:47,220
So they do a lot of those sorts of trainings and like they can answer a lot of those questions and I think they do like a responding to disclosures training that's like pretty like structured.

414
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:53,605
I think they're working on kind of they over the last few years have been like kind of revamping the program so but they're a good

415
00:40:54,146 --> 00:40:57,612
resource for that kind of sort of awareness and education piece.

416
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:03,181
One thing we haven't talked about yet, I think we wanted to talk about was Me Too, the Me Too movement.

417
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:09,801
I think that also has an important racial component to it.

418
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:18,831
Who was it, the actress that was given a lot of credit for Me Too, but we know it was actually Tarana Burke who started the movement.

419
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:23,976
But I was hearing a lot from my clients, one, that it's

420
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:28,620
how hard it is to have sexual violence in the media all the time.

421
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,322
Like, there's no choice to ignore it, really.

422
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:42,892
But also that, like, they were hearing about all these rich and powerful people who are getting justice for, or, like, you know, calling out their perpetrators, whatever, where, and that wasn't working the same way for just, like, sort of normal, everyday people.

423
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:49,857
And it also, I think, like, brought up this point about calling out versus calling in, and sort of how

424
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,199
And I think that's something to think about, right?

425
00:41:52,239 --> 00:42:14,627
I think depending on the situation, I think this is more for when we have conversations about sexual violence, where we might be hearing people, and like race, like right when we're hearing people say problematic things, like how to engage with that, with those beliefs, and like explore them, and try to like create an openness for new ways of thinking, rather than like,

426
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:16,908
just shutting somebody out, right?

427
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:18,428
I think there's a lot of opportunity there.

428
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:23,190
I don't think it works the same when we're talking about actual people who have committed sexual violence.

429
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:34,495
I think there's like, that sometimes can be kind of a lot, you know, a lot to ask of somebody and wherever they are in their healing, but yeah, I think it's an interesting concept for sure.

430
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:39,978
I think also talking about what it's like to move through the world

431
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:43,508
with less power.

432
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:47,451
Again, I can just use myself.

433
00:42:47,512 --> 00:42:49,433
I'm physically smaller than other people.

434
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:50,655
I am female.

435
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:55,159
I have two children with me, so if something were to happen, now what?

436
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,542
My kids are just out the sidewalk.

437
00:42:57,582 --> 00:42:58,122
I don't know.

438
00:42:58,182 --> 00:43:00,524
There's a lot of spaces where I don't have

439
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:03,154
physical power.

440
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:10,921
And so I've sometimes said to people, what would it look like if you moved in the world knowing that other bodies could disarm you?

441
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:11,161
Yeah.

442
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:13,504
Sure.

443
00:43:13,964 --> 00:43:14,224
Yeah.

444
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:25,976
I think we'd also brought up like the fine line of like the power of saying me too publicly and just acknowledging numbers and also folks finding that triggering and outing and taking issue understandably.

445
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:35,836
Well, that's another thing that I forgot to mention sort of in the immediate needs of somebody who's been sexually assaulted is like that isolation, right?

446
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:40,600
So I think that maybe was one thing that, for better or worse, like did come from the Me Too movement.

447
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,763
It was like this understanding of how pervasive this is as a problem, right?

448
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:48,467
And I think that it's not something that people really talk about casually, right?

449
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:52,950
Whenever I bring up my work at a party, it pretty much kills the conversation.

450
00:43:53,711 --> 00:43:55,233
I think people feel isolated in that.

451
00:43:55,394 --> 00:44:00,181
I hear people say, I don't want to be around people because I just feel really lonely.

452
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,543
I don't feel like people understand me.

453
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:02,905
I don't want to burden my friends.

454
00:44:03,686 --> 00:44:08,132
I think it's an unfortunate thing because I think a lot of people do.

455
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:29,053
understand in some way that kind of pain and you know I think people react to it differently and so like you're not always going to find like oh like just because we've both experienced something like this that we're going to relate to it in exactly the same way but I think that feeling of isolation is real and it's one of the reasons that we do group therapy at Bark is like to sort of connect folks to each other.

456
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:40,115
And there is kind of a common way that people respond to sexual trauma, and even sometimes just hearing that, like, what you're experiencing is really normal for what you've been through.

457
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:51,565
Can really, like, put into context for folks and sort of, like, you know, that validation can go a long way, and it's actually always surprising to me that that's not something that people are hearing, like, most places.

458
00:44:52,227 --> 00:45:04,249
Yeah, I mean that reminds me, we also mentioned like wondering, circling back to what the city can be doing or education can be doing.

459
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:14,527
what does our sex ed curriculum look like in Medford, and to what extent are these themes included and encouraged?

460
00:45:15,907 --> 00:45:32,191
I am old enough that I remember when there was a Planned Parenthood office in Davis Square, and so distance-wise for Medford, that didn't feel like such an imposition, and then it was gone, and then ConMav feels a little farther away, and then, you know, I am not a person who,

461
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:39,674
by default believes that Planned Parenthood will just always be there, so if the time came that it wasn't, then what?

462
00:45:40,134 --> 00:45:40,714
Then how far?

463
00:45:41,234 --> 00:45:46,297
And if you're talking about young people or folks who have less money or resources or travel is a thing.

464
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:53,740
Yeah, I sometimes worry about... How to say this?

465
00:45:55,235 --> 00:46:05,003
Like knowing that you have to continually fight for services such as and not sort of believing that they'll just exist just because they're here now.

466
00:46:05,123 --> 00:46:05,503
Yeah.

467
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:06,604
Yeah.

468
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:12,889
And just like the curriculum stuff is, that's a great question that I would love to know more about.

469
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:16,651
I remember my own curriculum was like, I remember it was mostly about like,

470
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:37,900
here's what drugs will do to you and here's what a condom is and like which really didn't apply to me at all so like I was like okay and like like nothing about like different types of sex like different types of people having sex together there was nothing like and nothing about like consent or pleasure or anything like that and I think that's part of that like that thing about enthusiastic consent is like

471
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:50,436
I think having no personal experience with this, I think what happens a lot of cis heterosexual intimate situations is it's about one person's pleasure, right?

472
00:46:50,456 --> 00:47:03,261
And so that really doesn't, hopefully that's not true for everybody, but that really doesn't leave room for communicating and slowing down and making sure that everything is okay for everyone, right?

473
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:04,381
And yeah, I don't know.

474
00:47:04,761 --> 00:47:06,022
And hopefully that's something that can

475
00:47:07,122 --> 00:47:08,943
be worked into a curriculum for students.

476
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:10,204
Absolutely.

477
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,966
Also the piece of like, well, whose responsibility is birth control?

478
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,287
That's a great one.

479
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:17,588
Yeah.

480
00:47:17,888 --> 00:47:21,350
And even just the responsibility of knowing and understanding what the options are.

481
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,051
Yeah.

482
00:47:24,371 --> 00:47:27,753
Way before effectively using them.

483
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:28,914
Totally.

484
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,675
I heard a story once about like

485
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:39,495
So it was like a mother who like, you know, she trained her son to always carry like pads and tampons with him for his like, you know, female friends.

486
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:40,476
I thought that was so lovely.

487
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:44,139
Like, you know, like just sharing that like care and responsibility.

488
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:50,305
The fact that we are still hiding tampons in public feels like a disaster of the patriarchy.

489
00:47:50,385 --> 00:47:51,746
I am so over it.

490
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:52,467
Yeah.

491
00:47:52,687 --> 00:47:53,648
I'm not with any of that.

492
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:55,290
And we have to pay for them.

493
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,951
And then we have to pay for them, yes.

494
00:47:59,091 --> 00:48:02,172
And that birth control costs money, and Viagra costs different money.

495
00:48:02,472 --> 00:48:03,832
Yeah, oh my gosh.

496
00:48:04,192 --> 00:48:06,733
I feel like I've covered most of it.

497
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:07,813
I feel like we've covered a lot.

498
00:48:07,853 --> 00:48:10,154
We did forget about the food question at the beginning.

499
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:11,614
Oh, food question.

500
00:48:11,634 --> 00:48:13,675
Which happens, you know, when we get excited about a topic.

501
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:14,355
Of course, we get all excited.

502
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:16,675
The favorite place to eat.

503
00:48:16,815 --> 00:48:17,896
Oh, our favorite place is to eat.

504
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:21,076
Yeah, so after a heavy conversation, where is your favorite place to go?

505
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:22,997
This is a nice way to break the ice at the end.

506
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:26,838
Um, that's honestly harder than all these other questions for me.

507
00:48:26,878 --> 00:48:33,999
There's so many good places where my family, the vegetarian, well, pescatarians, we eat fish, but we like this place on Salem Street.

508
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:36,519
It's, I think it's called like Fiore Italy.

509
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:44,721
And they make this like mixed grill of seafood that is like, we got it for takeout once during COVID and it was like so delicious.

510
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:48,642
And they also have this pasta dish which had smoked provolone in it.

511
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:50,362
It was like, oh, so good.

512
00:48:50,782 --> 00:48:56,848
But we're also, you know, die-hard fans of donuts, so donuts with a difference is, like, pretty stable for us.

513
00:48:56,888 --> 00:48:57,188
Yes.

514
00:48:58,089 --> 00:48:59,370
Sounds like a good way to mix it up.

515
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,933
I like it.

516
00:49:02,313 --> 00:49:04,315
Depending on the day, my answer could definitely change.

517
00:49:04,395 --> 00:49:08,059
There's a lot of good spots in Medford, yeah.

518
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:08,699
Sure.

519
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:09,520
Yeah, we're getting there.

520
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,841
Looking forward to more.

521
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:11,562
Yeah.

522
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:12,803
Nice.

523
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:18,129
Well, thank you so much for sharing to the extent, to this extent.

524
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:19,831
I learned a lot.

525
00:49:19,911 --> 00:49:20,732
Yeah, thank you.

526
00:49:20,772 --> 00:49:27,480
And I think it's worth saying, like, if folks have reactions to this or questions, that they can feel free to get in touch with us.

527
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,221
Yeah, for sure.

528
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:28,882
Absolutely.

529
00:49:28,902 --> 00:49:30,103
I look forward to that.

530
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:30,984
Well, thank you.
