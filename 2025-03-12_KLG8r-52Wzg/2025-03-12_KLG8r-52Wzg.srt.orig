[SPEAKER_16]: Apologize for the late start this evening.

16
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:54,059
[SPEAKER_16]: We had the swearing in for Fire Chief Evans in the chamber immediately before this meeting, and folks were busy doing the good work of mingling after that event wrapped up.

17
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:54,940
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't want to rush them out.

18
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:08,296
[SPEAKER_16]: So the action and discussion item for tonight's meeting is, as it frequently is, paper 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innis Associates team.

19
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:13,518
[SPEAKER_16]: This is our 21st meeting on the zoning update project.

20
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:18,561
[SPEAKER_16]: We have with us Paola from Innis Associates, in addition to city planning staff,

21
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:23,606
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a couple topics for tonight.

22
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:34,857
[SPEAKER_16]: As folks who have been engaged in this process might be aware, we recently wrapped up the Green Score Zoning Proposal and the Salem Street Corridor District Zoning Proposal.

23
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:37,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Those have been ordained as of last night.

24
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:58,594
[SPEAKER_16]: The neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal was workshopped in this committee over the course of four meetings in January and February, and we are working to find a date for a public Q&A for that topic, after which it will be sent to the Community Development Board to begin the public hearing process.

25
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,271
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight we're going to cover two topics.

26
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:08,375
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to start with a really high level introduction to a commercial framework for all of the city.

27
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:18,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Paola is going to walk us through a really bird's eye view of a way of looking at the commercial districts of our city, squares and corridors, major hubs.

28
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:21,863
[SPEAKER_16]: We are not going to be voting on anything tonight.

29
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:25,845
[SPEAKER_16]: This is intended as an introduction to this topic and an opportunity for councillors

30
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:42,144
[SPEAKER_16]: city staff and members of the public to state their initial questions, initial preferences, initial concerns for what they'd like to see in which areas, in which quarters, on which squares, what they'd like to see, what not they'd like to see, what questions they have.

31
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:56,875
[SPEAKER_16]: then City Council leadership, City staff, and NS Associates will take all of that feedback and work together to combine it into the next iteration of a commercial frameworks proposal for our next meeting on this topic.

32
00:11:57,595 --> 00:12:12,125
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to go through that introduction with Paola, and then after that, Paola will give us updates to the ADU zoning ordinance to incorporate the new state law on ADUs, and we'll have a further discussion of other ADU zoning proposals.

33
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:21,936
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that, unless there are any initial comments by councillors, and seeing none, I will pass it over to Paula from Ines Associates.

34
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:22,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

35
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,781
[SPEAKER_17]: Good afternoon, Madam Chair, if I may.

36
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:39,425
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm Paula Ramos Martinez, senior planner at Ines Associates, and I will guide you through the presentation today.

37
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:42,547
[SPEAKER_17]: I will share my screen.

38
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:48,963
[SPEAKER_17]: And.

39
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,008
[SPEAKER_17]: So here we are today.

40
00:12:54,028 --> 00:13:03,294
[SPEAKER_17]: We will look at, as President Collins said, we are looking at the, Vice President Collins, sorry, commercial framework today.

41
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,335
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be very high level view.

42
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:11,239
[SPEAKER_17]: I will walk us through it, but this is the first time that we bring it.

43
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:18,203
[SPEAKER_17]: So any comment, we will look more in depth every parcel by parcel as we've done with the others.

44
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:19,303
[SPEAKER_17]: And

45
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:32,485
[SPEAKER_17]: change whatever we needed, but this is just like the bigger hierarchy of the districts that we have been applying to the other commercial corridors.

46
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:33,807
[SPEAKER_17]: So

47
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:42,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, well, we talked a little bit about this.

48
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:49,236
[SPEAKER_17]: We will bring we have different ways than so for public to give their comments.

49
00:13:49,956 --> 00:14:00,862
[SPEAKER_17]: This is one the planning and permitting committee meetings, but we also have the city boards whenever any topic is referred to the committee development board.

50
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:02,843
[SPEAKER_17]: community development board.

51
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:08,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Then there's another potential opportunity to comment from the public.

52
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,954
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we also are bringing some public Q&A for the different topics.

53
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:17,178
[SPEAKER_17]: We are proposing the 27th of March.

54
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:22,924
[SPEAKER_17]: This is still to confirm with everyone.

55
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:34,712
[SPEAKER_17]: but that is the potential public meeting that we will use to present the residential neighborhoods that we've been talking in the last four committee meetings.

56
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:43,603
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in March, we and then in April, we will talk about the squares during these continue planning.

57
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:51,068
[SPEAKER_17]: And permitting committee meetings, we will be talking about today the higher level of the framework of the commercial framework.

58
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:56,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we will start looking at the Medford Square, West Medford Square, and then other quarters.

59
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,913
[SPEAKER_17]: So that will be our schedule.

60
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:09,957
[SPEAKER_17]: We've talked a lot about this, so just to let you know that this month we will look at the commercial framework, the Medford Square.

61
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:27,022
[SPEAKER_17]: We will also bring the ADU some citywide topics like community solar, non-conforming, and then in April we will talk about West Medford and other corridors, and we will also talk about transport demand management, site plan review, and the neighborhood notes.

62
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:44,005
[SPEAKER_17]: And here's a little bit of the same this we will continue to update and whenever we have new dates for public meetings, or for the other moments where we can have public comments, we will bring the dates and publish them here.

63
00:15:45,946 --> 00:16:05,137
[SPEAKER_17]: As we've been talking every time that we come here in the planning committee meeting, we say that we are doing an overview of the zoning based on what it was published and identified in the METFOR comprehensive plan that was published in January 2023.

64
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:17,207
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have some of the different goals that we follow for this zoning update, and we are following the vision that was done in this plan.

65
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:27,997
[SPEAKER_17]: If anyone is interested, what are the principles that we are following, why we're doing this, why specifically these areas is in this Medford comprehensive plan.

66
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:46,810
[SPEAKER_17]: So we were looking at the residential districts, and we are now in all those non exclusive residential districts so all the different areas where we can have this mixed use where there is commercial at this point where we have in the current zoning.

67
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,111
[SPEAKER_17]: C one C two.

68
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:53,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Um and that we have divided in quarters squares.

69
00:16:53,872 --> 00:17:01,474
[SPEAKER_17]: We have the institutional where Medford tough says and then the special district that we will look also later for Wellington area.

70
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Um so this time we will look.

71
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,456
[SPEAKER_17]: We have already done Mystic Avenue.

72
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:16,479
[SPEAKER_17]: We just passed the Salem Street quarter and we will look into the other quarters and the squares in this next two months.

73
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:29,444
[SPEAKER_17]: So the current zoning, where we are looking in Medford Square in West Medford in Main Street, or other quarters, Boston Avenue.

74
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:40,128
[SPEAKER_17]: We are looking usually at the C one commercial one district apartment one district and apartment two district usually those are the ones that we are

75
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,892
[SPEAKER_17]: that we will be adapting.

76
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:59,631
[SPEAKER_17]: These we already saw but mainly apartment one maximum heights will be around four stories, well three stories for multifamily, four is just for assisted living, but mainly that's three, four levels.

77
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,432
[SPEAKER_17]: And then apartment two.

78
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:06,637
[SPEAKER_17]: It's six by right for multifamily and then other permitted principal structures.

79
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:08,058
[SPEAKER_17]: It's at 15.

80
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:14,804
[SPEAKER_17]: So that we will look into if it's correct, if that's what we need, if that needs to be changed.

81
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:23,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are things that we will look into as well as the areas, minimums that are required and if it's possible in the lot sizes that we currently have.

82
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:37,583
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the C1 as well is six by right for multiple dwelling and only hotel for some reason the height is 15 stories high.

83
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:39,905
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are the things that we will be looking at.

84
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,547
[SPEAKER_17]: if that makes sense, etc.

85
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:52,811
[SPEAKER_17]: So the uses that we are using or the districts or sub districts depending that we will be using are the same that we use for Mystic and for Salem.

86
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:56,592
[SPEAKER_17]: We are talking about mixed use one, mixed use two, and mixed use three.

87
00:18:57,393 --> 00:19:03,935
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we have, the differences are on that level of intensity.

88
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,237
[SPEAKER_17]: So the one being the lowest and the three being the highest.

89
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:13,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so I'm going to zoom in a little bit and then we talk obviously about commercial.

90
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:17,440
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have some commercial that is mainly on the Mystic.

91
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,020
[SPEAKER_17]: We will study if that is needed somewhere else.

92
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:33,464
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have the neighborhood residential three, urban residential one, and urban residential two that we've just explained in the previous neighborhood in the residential meetings.

93
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:37,385
[SPEAKER_17]: So if I can do a little bit more.

94
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:48,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so we are going to have a little bit more.

95
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:57,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's say that Medford Square is where we are going to have that intensity as well, where we will try to study if that is possible.

96
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:04,640
[SPEAKER_17]: But what we see is that on the east part of Medford Square, we will bring as well that mix use three.

97
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,423
[SPEAKER_17]: And let's see if it needs to be extended a little bit more.

98
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:16,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, on the outside will be we will try to have the mix use to this is also looking on what you have already and in the city.

99
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,051
[SPEAKER_17]: What is currently existing?

100
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:23,915
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the inside the really core of Medford Square and the lots are a little bit smaller.

101
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:36,905
[SPEAKER_17]: The footprint is little bit smaller, so we will look into that mixes one that is also connected to the one from Mystic that mistake Main Street area on the other side of the river.

102
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:43,910
[SPEAKER_17]: So we continue that scale in both sides of the river.

103
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:49,314
[SPEAKER_17]: If we go to West Medford, the lots are very small as well.

104
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:55,338
[SPEAKER_17]: So we try to keep it in that mixed-use one level.

105
00:20:56,018 --> 00:21:03,724
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there are some areas, very little in the center there, where we could go to mixed-use two.

106
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:05,824
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is very higher level.

107
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:11,506
[SPEAKER_17]: We will go into the parcels and see if those are possible.

108
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:24,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Main Street is really, it has a lot of commercial existing, but they are very much distributed all the way.

109
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:26,973
[SPEAKER_17]: And they form some clusters.

110
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:31,076
[SPEAKER_17]: So where we have those clusters of commercial we kept that mixed use one.

111
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:40,164
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we start to feel the residential wherever we have that very much urban fabric residential typologies.

112
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:47,210
[SPEAKER_17]: We kept it as the urban one and if those were bigger multifamily, we went to urban to.

113
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:56,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have that area south of Medford Tufts in Boston Avenue.

114
00:21:56,318 --> 00:22:01,082
[SPEAKER_17]: There is some industrial at this point in the existing zoning.

115
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,065
[SPEAKER_17]: We believe that this could be a nice mix too.

116
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:09,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we will need to study and listen to your opinions.

117
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:14,034
[SPEAKER_17]: on the north north side of Boston Avenue, almost in West Medford.

118
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:17,036
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some office at this moment.

119
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:21,100
[SPEAKER_17]: We would like to propose some mixed use too.

120
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:31,589
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in between from Medford Tufts to that office district, we have a lot of mixed from mixed use one, urban residential one.

121
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,433
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are some areas that are very, very small lots that are only

122
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:48,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, small houses existing, so we just left it as neighborhood three, and we have only those two areas, one above Medford Square for neighborhood three, that's the yellow one.

123
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,583
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and then this on Boston Avenue, that is towards the train tracks.

124
00:22:56,424 --> 00:23:06,450
[SPEAKER_17]: So what is the difference between mixed use one is three by right, one plus one story will be with incentive zoning.

125
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:11,434
[SPEAKER_17]: For now, this is very generic, this might be adjusted depending on where we are.

126
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:16,057
[SPEAKER_17]: As we have done for Salem Street and Mystic Avenue, they are different.

127
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:20,560
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will look in here what needs to be adjusted depending on the areas.

128
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:27,082
[SPEAKER_17]: But generally, let's say, is three stories by right, one more with incentive zoning.

129
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,203
[SPEAKER_17]: We want that small mid-scale.

130
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:36,605
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in Mixed Use 2, we go four by right plus two incentive zoning.

131
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,967
[SPEAKER_17]: And it will be that mid-scale.

132
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,807
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Mixed Use 3 is six stories by right.

133
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:44,488
[SPEAKER_17]: We have six of incentive zoning.

134
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:49,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we will look into the specific areas if that's what we need.

135
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,472
[SPEAKER_17]: and we talk about mid-high scale.

136
00:23:54,113 --> 00:24:05,103
[SPEAKER_17]: The uses at this point, we just will be using the ones that were defined for Mystic Avenue and Salem Street and look at the areas and look what we need.

137
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:17,334
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, this would be that general overlook of what we are thinking and how we are making that hierarchy for all these commercial areas.

138
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:28,924
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that I will give you now, yes, before we go to ADUs, if there are any comments, please.

139
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:33,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for the overview, Paola.

140
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:34,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Really helpful.

141
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:43,880
[SPEAKER_16]: So like we stated at the beginning, this is intended as kind of a bird's eye view introduction to this topic.

142
00:24:44,861 --> 00:24:53,507
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think the best use of our time in this meeting is kind of our first impressions, preferences, questions, and comments that counselors are coming into this discussion with.

143
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:59,931
[SPEAKER_16]: I know I've gotten some questions and preferences from community members already saying,

144
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:01,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not this there?

145
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:02,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not this there?

146
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:05,696
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll save public comment for the end of this topic.

147
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:15,984
[SPEAKER_16]: But I first want to recognize counselors who have some thoughts on this kind of initial jumping off point.

148
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:20,507
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll go first to President Behrs on Zoom.

149
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, I'll be brief.

150
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:26,272
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll just say that

151
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:38,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I think especially for Medford Square and West Medford Square, trying to look at a little bit more density, I think, is important.

152
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:41,097
[SPEAKER_11]: So just I'll leave it there for now.

153
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:43,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the framework discussion.

154
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a really helpful overview.

155
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:51,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have some questions about Harvard Street in South Medford as well.

156
00:25:53,613 --> 00:26:16,194
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe a little bit of other questions about the main street and medford street quarters but i'll leave that for future meetings thank you great thank you president bears go next to councilor lemming thank you uh first just uh

157
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:27,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So I understand that there are some issues with uploading the agenda to the portal, and that's being resolved.

158
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:37,869
[SPEAKER_08]: But we did get the current agenda circulated on March 10th, but I'm noticing, counselors did, not the public, unfortunately, but I'm noticing that

159
00:26:39,662 --> 00:26:56,834
[SPEAKER_08]: The copy that Inez is showing has the explanations of what mixed use 1, 2, and 3 are, so I'd appreciate it if you could circulate the presentation to us, although that could just be a more updated copy.

160
00:26:56,854 --> 00:27:06,801
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, going back to that, could you, I did screenshot it, but could you zoom out and just show the explanations of mixed use 1, 2, and 3?

161
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

162
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:24,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, so yeah, it makes, so it makes use three to be, to be clear that could be up to 12 stories with the right incentives.

163
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:27,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

164
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:33,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and sorry, can you just, can you just show that, show the whole thing, the whole whole page?

165
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:40,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

166
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:54,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would generally agree with the idea that West Medford and Medford Square do need to be more densified.

167
00:27:54,666 --> 00:28:01,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's actually a word, but yes, densified, you get what I mean.

168
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:07,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe upping that to mixed use two or even three.

169
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:11,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of curiosity, what was the original

170
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:26,605
[SPEAKER_08]: idea behind putting the very center of Medford Square at mixed-use 1, but the surrounding areas at 2 and 3, what was the, out of curiosity, what was kind of like the thinking behind that?

171
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:36,194
[SPEAKER_17]: So for Medford Square, especially in the center, the lots are very small.

172
00:28:37,854 --> 00:28:45,356
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need to do some fit studies to see if we can really go to that mixes two or mixes even the three.

173
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:53,078
[SPEAKER_17]: And also is the continuation from what we have in Mystic and Main at the end.

174
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:58,840
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a little bit of doing the mirror from the other side,

175
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:10,054
[SPEAKER_17]: of the river and to have that continuation from Main Street towards Medford Square to be kind of that lower scale.

176
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:21,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And then going to the other side is mainly what you have already, which are buildings that are four or even higher buildings and quite bigger on

177
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,183
[SPEAKER_17]: The west of Medford square.

178
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:31,673
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, yeah, it's a little bit replicating what it is already in the ground and see.

179
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:45,338
[SPEAKER_17]: as an idea to have towards the river, you can go a little bit higher, towards the 93, you can go higher, but just in the middle, it might be a little bit complex to do that.

180
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:52,162
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, if we think that this should be even a little bit more intense, we can absolutely study that.

181
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:55,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what would the nature of that study be?

182
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:02,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, what kind of study would you would you need to undertake to figure out if you can build higher there?

183
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:13,933
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to look at more of the parcels to do some sections, see if it's viable and feasible to do six stories or even higher.

184
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:20,496
[SPEAKER_17]: without giving shade to the areas that are around it.

185
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:37,646
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need to look at the street and see if that street profile, if we can go that higher without bothering the neighborhoods.

186
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:40,988
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will study if that is possible.

187
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the same situation with West Medford?

188
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:47,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

189
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:50,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we will need to do that everywhere.

190
00:30:50,812 --> 00:31:00,855
[SPEAKER_17]: We won't do per parcel, but we will take the representative, some of the type parcels.

191
00:31:01,636 --> 00:31:14,460
[SPEAKER_17]: And then from there, we will do some quick studies of what would it fit the typologies that we need for a mixed building and how high we could go

192
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,527
[SPEAKER_17]: without shading the neighborhood and see if that is viable.

193
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:27,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, I'd appreciate to see the results of those studies.

194
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:27,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

195
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:31,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

196
00:31:31,178 --> 00:31:35,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Next, I'll recognize Councillor Callahan and then Councillor Lozaro on Zoom.

197
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,420
[SPEAKER_15]: you.

198
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,443
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just a little curious about the part that's near Magoon Square.

199
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:51,167
[SPEAKER_15]: And mostly, I apologize, because I was looking for a previous map that you had that showed like the existing heights and structures.

200
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,628
[SPEAKER_15]: And I apologize, I can't find that right now.

201
00:31:53,968 --> 00:32:04,093
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm just curious for that urban residential to at the very bottom of the map is that one that's that's, you know, just just north of Bow Street,

202
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:12,067
[SPEAKER_15]: The furthest south wine red urban residential.

203
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:14,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

204
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the furthest south wine red one.

205
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:30,401
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just slightly curious, like whether that is like existing buildings, like similar to existing buildings, or if this is like where we're going to hope for growth because it is close to T-stops down there and Boone Square and everything.

206
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:35,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, that was a motion or a request that I made during the UR slash NR discussion.

207
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,986
[SPEAKER_16]: I offer that if that's helpful.

208
00:32:39,815 --> 00:32:49,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so in here also the idea was that in these corridors we will have a little bit more density than what we have in the neighborhoods to have a little bit of more transition.

209
00:32:50,641 --> 00:32:55,644
[SPEAKER_17]: In that area we have in the neighborhoods around it, the urban one.

210
00:32:56,824 --> 00:33:01,967
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why that's a residential or yeah, that is a residential area of the corridor.

211
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:06,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Some existing, maybe they have already multifamily and that was also why we did it.

212
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,273
[SPEAKER_17]: but we expect to have a little bit of more density on the corridors than on the neighbors.

213
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:23,098
[SPEAKER_17]: And so when we have a neighborhood three, we place the urban one in the corridor, and when we have an urban one, we try to do the urban two.

214
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:25,179
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I totally get that.

215
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:27,460
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually just asking about the existing buildings.

216
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:32,022
[SPEAKER_17]: I need to look into it.

217
00:33:32,462 --> 00:33:33,823
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll try and find that map, actually.

218
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:35,824
[SPEAKER_17]: I will look into it.

219
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:40,283
[SPEAKER_17]: We did look into the existing buildings.

220
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:46,204
[SPEAKER_17]: So sometimes it's the area that we think that it can go a little bit higher density.

221
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,265
[SPEAKER_17]: And sometimes there's already multifamily buildings.

222
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:55,026
[SPEAKER_17]: So then we just continue conforming what is already there.

223
00:33:55,426 --> 00:34:06,248
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think either way is great because it is close to some of these MTA stations that are not in Medford, but are clearly affecting, we should be building there.

224
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:07,568
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just a little bit curious, thanks.

225
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:12,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

226
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:14,786
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll go next to Councilor Latero.

227
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

228
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:22,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to thank you all for talking about this.

229
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:29,315
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've just put in a quick plug for what Councilor Lemming was mentioning about West Medford.

230
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:32,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, sorry, I know that I, you know,

231
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,141
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of this depends on the size of the lots.

232
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:41,162
[SPEAKER_14]: I recognize that you have to look into it more.

233
00:34:41,243 --> 00:35:01,713
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that West Medford Square in particular, because of the positioning of the station there and the proximity to North Station, I think we really have to emphasize the potential for greater density of that commercial area.

234
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,035
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would just really want to prioritize that.

235
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:04,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

236
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Lozano.

237
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:15,623
[SPEAKER_16]: In my comments, I'll be brief.

238
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:29,913
[SPEAKER_16]: I know I received a couple of comments from community members earlier this week, requesting specifically more density in Medford Square and West Medford Square, and I hear that reflected in the comments from some of my fellow councilors.

239
00:35:31,934 --> 00:35:53,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, we know that what exactly that means, what sub-district that means, how we're going to tailor it to specific squares and specific corridors will depend on where it's going and will depend on the research that Paula's already said she's going to do of lot size and what is feasible, kind of scaling down what we decide we want, the consensus we come to, to what is actually feasible on the lots in these specific locations.

240
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:54,820
[SPEAKER_16]: the city.

241
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:02,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Um but I do think in keeping with the goals, I think that here we have to in every part of the city that we look at that we rezone.

242
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:05,309
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to be focused on the goals of, um.

243
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:15,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Allowing for the type of development and density that we want to need in these specific places, and we also have to be keeping an eye on parity between all of the

244
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:33,981
[SPEAKER_16]: zoned much differently, given a different treatment than another, and that each area is able to enjoy the same potential for commercial and residential development and not left out of that potential.

245
00:36:35,102 --> 00:36:42,090
[SPEAKER_16]: I also wanted to note, and also I see that the section on the

246
00:36:44,942 --> 00:37:01,184
[SPEAKER_16]: The section to the west of 93, north of the river, that's currently penciled in as mixed-use 3, I just wanted to note, I think it's really interesting to be able to consider using mixed-use 3 zones along 93 where it's appropriate, and I think that there's a potential benefit there.

247
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:12,976
[SPEAKER_16]: where taller buildings could serve as sound insulation and kind of aesthetic insulation from the highway, from people who are living or just doing business or being around in those abutting areas.

248
00:37:13,036 --> 00:37:22,125
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm really eager for us to look at using those lots along the highway to concentrate more development, taller development,

249
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:24,545
[SPEAKER_16]: city.

250
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:28,827
[SPEAKER_16]: When we go when we go tall, near the highway to block it out.

251
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:44,972
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also the point was made to me recently, I forget by who, that when you are developing at those level of heights, that's when the economics really makes sense for the kind of air filtration and soundproofing that can make quality of life inside those buildings better.

252
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:53,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Lastly, I just wanted to note I forgot to mention this at the beginning of the meeting, but the map that counselors and community members are looking at tonight.

253
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:55,719
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of this is the proposal.

254
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:03,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of this reflects proposals that have already been made in the case of some of the neighborhood residential and urban residential.

255
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:07,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Parts on this map, that's part of the proposal that's going to the CD board next.

256
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:16,950
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I think we're probably all aware, the Mystic Avenue corridor and the Salem Street corridor reflects zoning that was done earlier in the citywide process.

257
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,390
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to make that clear for folks.

258
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,851
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of this is just our jumping off point that we will further workshop and change and tweak and become part of the proposal.

259
00:38:24,372 --> 00:38:30,473
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of it along Salem Street and Mystic Avenue in particular reflects rezoning that we've already done earlier in the year.

260
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:33,865
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll go back to President bears.

261
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:37,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you.

262
00:38:37,707 --> 00:38:38,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a couple things.

263
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:44,950
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one, when we talk about lot size I think we need to be also thinking about

264
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:56,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, for example, in West Medford, the lots that are basically small industrial buildings between Canal Street and the train tracks and High Street, right?

265
00:38:56,662 --> 00:39:03,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, those lots, as they exist today, maybe couldn't bear something that they could bear if one or two were combined.

266
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:09,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I don't want to limit the zoning based on assuming that lots are going to stay the way that they are.

267
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,353
[SPEAKER_11]: And just two other things.

268
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it might be valuable to put

269
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:32,928
[SPEAKER_11]: like a thick black line or some other demarcation to Vice President Collins's point around the zones that have already been approved versus the ones where we're discussing them going forward, just so that folks can see what has been done already and what needs to be done.

270
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:39,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just third, I think there's, as part of this,

271
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:47,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, and I've mentioned this before to folks, but I just want to bring it up here.

272
00:39:47,582 --> 00:40:10,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's some value to thinking about a UR3 district that would be a four-story by right, and I can't think of a better name for it than to say an MX2.5 district that's somewhere between the MX2 and the MX3 district in terms of intensity and density.

273
00:40:11,546 --> 00:40:35,083
[SPEAKER_11]: just because I think we're now getting into the place where there are parts of the city, especially in Medford Square and along Main Street, and in West Medford Square to an extent where we just need a tool that's a little bit more dense than the MX-2, but not quite the MX-3.

274
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:51,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that there's probably value to a residential only four story structure in some parts of these corridors where it wouldn't be applicable in a neighborhood.

275
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:53,225
[SPEAKER_11]: So just want to put that out there as well.

276
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:01,111
Great.

277
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:03,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Barras.

278
00:41:09,643 --> 00:41:12,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Looking for fellow comments from counselors.

279
00:41:14,248 --> 00:41:15,469
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a great jumping off point.

280
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:24,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that this gives us kind of enough to get out of the starting blocks on tweaking this initial proposal.

281
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:30,385
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe

282
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:46,523
[SPEAKER_16]: double check with Paula but I believe that our next meeting in two weeks we can probably expect to see a revised version of this map, including just some formatting changes to make it clear to counselors and residents, which parts of the map have already been updated which have not.

283
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:51,005
[SPEAKER_16]: And we might see some changes as well, perhaps in sub districts.

284
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:56,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Along the lines of President bears his comment or begin to see tweaks to the map.

285
00:41:56,928 --> 00:42:03,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Based on counselors and community members feedback for what they'd really like to see prioritized in each of these squares and corridors.

286
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:11,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

287
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:15,695
[SPEAKER_15]: I know no one ever likes whatever colors you choose.

288
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:33,130
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize, but I do wonder if it would be possible to make the like mixed use and commercial, you know, somehow make them like the neighborhood residential being like yellow, green and red, like all possible primary colors like

289
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:44,913
[SPEAKER_15]: is a little hard for me to tell where is residential versus where is, you know, there's possibility for commercial and I don't know if there's a way to make that slightly easier to grok.

290
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:46,333
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to keep going back and forth.

291
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:48,114
[SPEAKER_15]: It just doesn't make sense in my brain.

292
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,414
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's not too much work.

293
00:42:52,635 --> 00:42:52,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

294
00:42:55,986 --> 00:42:57,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you, Councilor Halihan.

295
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:05,009
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Councilor Lemming noted, we're having some trouble getting the agenda files published for this meeting.

296
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:05,690
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure why.

297
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:09,171
[SPEAKER_16]: I was inside Civic Clerk just at the beginning of the meeting.

298
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:11,772
[SPEAKER_16]: The agenda files are there.

299
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:14,013
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not on the public side of the portal.

300
00:43:14,053 --> 00:43:14,933
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize for that.

301
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:18,935
[SPEAKER_16]: We will make sure that is figured out ASAP, and I'm sure that these

302
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:24,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Files that we're looking at tonight will be viewable by everybody by tomorrow.

303
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:38,309
[SPEAKER_16]: And we will also make sure that the updated that the version of the of this map that counselors received on Monday didn't have the legend on it will make sure that the public portal is updated with the one that does have the ID for what each of the MX sub districts mean.

304
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,351
[SPEAKER_16]: So apologize for the technical difficulties.

305
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:49,189
[SPEAKER_16]: We will make sure that the publishing function on Civiclerk is fixed ASAP.

306
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:53,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

307
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:56,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing no further comments from counselors.

308
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:58,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your initial feedback.

309
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:10,388
[SPEAKER_16]: So far, I look forward to seeing this in its next iteration and I think it goes without saying to anybody who's engaged with this process enough to be a part of this meeting, but I do just want to reemphasize for folks.

310
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:16,690
[SPEAKER_16]: I think sometimes when we see these zoning proposals come out you know a piece here a piece there can sometimes be confusing.

311
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is this quarter colored in and this current quarter isn't why is.

312
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,475
[SPEAKER_16]: This is certain color and this is blank.

313
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:34,692
[SPEAKER_16]: It is because that we're, we're kind of breaking the city into its different, you know constituent parks, which are corridors which are squares which are squarely residential which are kind of none of the above.

314
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:38,219
[SPEAKER_16]: and we're taking a different approach to each of those.

315
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,903
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you happen to be looking at your street and you're saying, why are they talking about that?

316
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:44,264
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like they should be.

317
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:47,106
[SPEAKER_16]: It's likely a part of a different discussion.

318
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:58,235
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, if you ever have questions, if you have further feedback on this proposal, you can always feel free to reach out to city councilors in between these meetings and we're always happy to clarify.

319
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:03,187
[SPEAKER_16]: see no further comment from city counselors on this part of the presentation.

320
00:45:03,207 --> 00:45:07,412
[SPEAKER_16]: So before we move on, I want to take Oh, sorry, I didn't invite participation from city staff.

321
00:45:07,673 --> 00:45:12,659
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there any feedback or notes that you want to put on the record at this time?

322
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:15,282
[SPEAKER_16]: No pressure.

323
00:45:17,455 --> 00:45:28,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Chair, I'll just say that there are a couple of like little tweaks that are kind of technical that we're gonna send to the consultants and all and figure out before we bring them to the council.

324
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:32,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Just every time we look at these things, they're so detailed, we see something else.

325
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:37,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was literally just writing up one of these tweaks that I need to work out with them, so.

326
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:40,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you, Director Hunt.

327
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,646
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we will go next to public comment.

328
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:51,430
[SPEAKER_16]: We're eager to hear your thoughts on this very initial framework, which is due for a lot of tweaking and feedback.

329
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I will alternate between the podium and Zoom.

330
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Every speaker will have three minutes.

331
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:59,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I will endeavor to give you a 30 second warning.

332
00:46:02,016 --> 00:46:03,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

333
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:09,060
[SPEAKER_06]: William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment.

334
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:09,794
[SPEAKER_06]: 1B.

335
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:13,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a few points.

336
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:18,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Beers sort of alluded to this earlier, President Beers.

337
00:46:19,618 --> 00:46:26,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that four stories along corridors would be a good idea whenever it's like residential, the four stories.

338
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:31,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm mostly speaking of when you actually are fronting directly onto one of these corridor streets.

339
00:46:31,482 --> 00:46:32,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you could go up to four stories.

340
00:46:32,883 --> 00:46:33,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's good.

341
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:41,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree, we really need the extra density in the square, especially Medford Square and West Medford Square.

342
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:47,729
[SPEAKER_06]: West Medford Square is quite small and surrounded by relatively low density compared to say, Salem Street.

343
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:55,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the intensity there needs to be higher than what was done at Salem Street just to support those businesses, or else it's not going to work, I think.

344
00:46:57,718 --> 00:47:01,821
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been struggling, I think, to fill those spaces more than for example, on Salem Street.

345
00:47:02,682 --> 00:47:02,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh,

346
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:10,652
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing is I would not worry about matching Medford Square to the area to the south of Medford Square.

347
00:47:11,232 --> 00:47:21,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wouldn't, because I think by the time you've gone underneath the Mystic Valley Parkway, you want to forget that you were ever by the police station by the time you're over there.

348
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:23,059
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a totally different world.

349
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't fret about that.

350
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:28,102
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no need to.

351
00:47:30,283 --> 00:47:33,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's anybody who thinks those should be consistent at all.

352
00:47:36,126 --> 00:47:50,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Two floor, this is a crazy idea, but I thought I would ask if the consultants wanted to study, what would it take for us to have in some of these areas, particularly West Bedford Square and parts of Bedford Square, two floors of commercial rather than just one?

353
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,291
[SPEAKER_06]: How much housing would you have to allow above in order for that to pencil out?

354
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:59,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be really cool if we could have like dentist's office and lawyer's offices upstairs off of the ground floor.

355
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:06,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that means we have to have a whole ton of housing, well, we should still consider it anyhow, because it'd be pretty nice.

356
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:10,964
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are my suggestions.

357
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:11,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

358
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:16,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, William.

359
00:48:16,366 --> 00:48:19,967
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we will go next to Zoom.

360
00:48:20,507 --> 00:48:22,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Gaston, name and address for the record, please.

361
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:22,928
[SPEAKER_16]: And you have three minutes.

362
00:48:25,794 --> 00:48:26,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

363
00:48:26,595 --> 00:48:28,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaston Fury 61, Stigney Road.

364
00:48:28,857 --> 00:48:34,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to echo the comments that Councillor Lazaro mentioned.

365
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:46,312
[SPEAKER_10]: So West Medford Square, as I see it in comparison to the rest of what I'm seeing here, the corridors and Medford Square is heavily underdeveloped.

366
00:48:46,872 --> 00:48:52,257
[SPEAKER_10]: We really need to increase the density over there in particular, because the low wall line

367
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:59,332
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only one station away from North Station and it's 11 minutes in the train.

368
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:02,374
[SPEAKER_10]: So Medford Square does not have that.

369
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:03,575
[SPEAKER_10]: We only have buses.

370
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:07,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very congested during both rush hours.

371
00:49:08,438 --> 00:49:14,402
[SPEAKER_10]: West Medford Square, they're lucky to have rail that serves that square.

372
00:49:15,003 --> 00:49:16,684
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to exploit that.

373
00:49:16,724 --> 00:49:18,545
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to take advantage of that.

374
00:49:19,145 --> 00:49:21,767
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now what I'm seeing is that that is not the case at all.

375
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:35,440
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would encourage everyone to increase the density over there and take advantage of the fact that we are 11 minutes away from North Station that connects everywhere in Boston.

376
00:49:37,382 --> 00:49:42,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I think this looks good for now.

377
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:45,187
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank everyone for the work that they have put.

378
00:49:45,227 --> 00:49:45,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

379
00:49:49,591 --> 00:49:49,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

380
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:50,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Gaston.

381
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,692
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll go next to Cheryl.

382
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:56,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record.

383
00:49:56,773 --> 00:49:57,673
[SPEAKER_16]: You have three minutes.

384
00:49:59,855 --> 00:50:01,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 21 Park Street.

385
00:50:01,937 --> 00:50:06,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking at this map, and everyone's saying the lots in West Medford are super small.

386
00:50:07,122 --> 00:50:09,825
[SPEAKER_05]: They look substantially larger than Haines Square.

387
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:15,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I took a sampling from the accessibility database, and I'm not sure why it stopped so abruptly at the

388
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:20,192
[SPEAKER_05]: the last commercial buildings as they can go all the way down to the rotary if you want corridors.

389
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:24,774
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems like you may be treating some neighborhoods different than other neighborhoods.

390
00:50:25,175 --> 00:50:36,481
[SPEAKER_05]: If a busy corner of Park and Salem that can't stand any more traffic is supposed to sustain six story buildings, then I think West Metro can handle it with their commuter rail stop and buses.

391
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:37,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

392
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:39,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Cheryl.

393
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:49,048
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, seeing no one at the podium, we will go with Zoom.

394
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:52,371
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to ask you to unmute, JMN.

395
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:55,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

396
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:57,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.

397
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will actually be brief.

398
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:02,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Power Street.

399
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:05,927
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll iterate what I've iterated before at other meetings.

400
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:17,115
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to execute the necessary studies because while it's nice to have blue sky ideas for what needs to happen, these areas do have some vibrancy.

401
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:27,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you would bring in potential other businesses here, you will get rid of the mom and pop stores if you do not appropriately plan for that.

402
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:35,306
[SPEAKER_00]: In the age of information, willful ignorance really shouldn't be dismissed.

403
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:47,314
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of opportunity here, especially in proximity to the transit station that, as someone else has said, is in fair proximity to Boston.

404
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:53,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people use this rail, and the opportunity for many more makes sense.

405
00:51:54,113 --> 00:51:59,117
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need to be purposeful, unlike what we did to Salem Street.

406
00:51:59,477 --> 00:52:01,959
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be a little bit more careful elsewhere.

407
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:11,346
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely there is a discriminant and different handling of these neighborhoods.

408
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:18,732
[SPEAKER_00]: The tone and the tenor that's being discussed here is nothing like what was discussed on the other side of the city.

409
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:22,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find it unjust and reprehensible.

410
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:22,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

411
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:29,528
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you, Jean.

412
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:34,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's unjust and reprehensible.

413
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:41,762
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we will go to J.R.

414
00:52:41,863 --> 00:52:43,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Elliott on Zoom.

415
00:52:44,145 --> 00:52:45,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

416
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:46,428
[SPEAKER_16]: And you'll have three minutes.

417
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,441
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm asking you.

418
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:56,263
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

419
00:52:56,803 --> 00:52:57,944
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is John Elliott.

420
00:52:58,004 --> 00:53:01,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 34 Emery Street in West Medford.

421
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:12,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm concerned that this drawing that we've been looking at is incomplete or not yet finished.

422
00:53:13,638 --> 00:53:17,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because I spent a half an hour, half an hour, no, half the afternoon with it.

423
00:53:19,334 --> 00:53:32,041
[SPEAKER_01]: and found too many cases of buildings that I knew were there, but that weren't allowed by the zoning as it was depicted.

424
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:37,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, Boston Avenue 123, 5, 7, and 9, which is a real estate broker, a restaurant,

425
00:53:46,341 --> 00:53:48,662
[SPEAKER_01]: hair salon and an acupuncturist.

426
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:59,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are in a location that doesn't allow any mixed use or anything, but it looks like it doesn't allow anything but residential area.

427
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:04,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are four or five apartments above those businesses.

428
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,671
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's clearly a mixed use situation.

429
00:54:08,691 --> 00:54:15,634
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 Canal Street is a Medford Housing Authority building with

430
00:54:16,374 --> 00:54:17,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 17 units.

431
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:28,020
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in a location that doesn't allow such a thing, I don't think, according to the drawing that we're looking at.

432
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,982
[SPEAKER_01]: 29 Harvard Ave is the same situation.

433
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:45,969
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 40-unit building, and it's only four stories, but I don't think that's allowed in the coding that appears there.

434
00:54:46,961 --> 00:54:57,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there, there are other discrepancies that I'll, I'll put in writing and, um, and send to the, to the board.

435
00:54:57,905 --> 00:55:01,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but is, is this drawing fairly nearly complete?

436
00:55:06,109 --> 00:55:07,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, you have a little less than a minute left.

437
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:10,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, please feel to feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer them all at the end.

438
00:55:11,231 --> 00:55:11,731
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough.

439
00:55:14,385 --> 00:55:15,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great, thank you so much.

440
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Just didn't wanna cut you off on your time there.

441
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:20,389
[SPEAKER_16]: No, this map is absolutely not finished.

442
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:23,271
[SPEAKER_16]: This is our very first meeting on the commercial framework.

443
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:30,475
[SPEAKER_16]: And the intent of tonight, as I stated at the beginning of the meeting, is for this to serve as a jumping off point.

444
00:55:30,635 --> 00:55:34,738
[SPEAKER_16]: This is kind of our first crack at looking at the totality of the commercial framework.

445
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,859
[SPEAKER_16]: So your comments are extremely welcome.

446
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:42,283
[SPEAKER_16]: The point of tonight is to get this kind of initial feedback, impressions, questions, concerns,

447
00:55:43,384 --> 00:55:45,065
[SPEAKER_16]: with this draft of a commercial framework.

448
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:50,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Our goal is absolutely not to down zone any part of the city through any of these proposals.

449
00:55:51,450 --> 00:56:08,565
[SPEAKER_16]: So if there are aspects on this map where inadvertently a mixed use area is not included as a mixed use zone, that's something that we'll absolutely want to check and make sure that's not the case because any area that's already mixed use, certainly it's not the intent of the overhaul to decrease mixed use

450
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,947
[SPEAKER_16]: uses in the city, we want to increase them where they make sense.

451
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:15,309
[SPEAKER_16]: And another goal is to decrease non-conformities.

452
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:18,150
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you're noticing them on the map, please do put them in writing.

453
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:26,695
[SPEAKER_16]: You can send them to Director Hunt and myself and we'll make sure that we look at them and make sure that they fit in with this plan.

454
00:56:27,096 --> 00:56:30,618
[SPEAKER_16]: But to your overall point, this is by no means

455
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:42,302
[SPEAKER_16]: final version of this map, we're actually going to be going square by square, corridor by corridor, to make sure that the new subdistricts and the uses are tailored to each specific square and corridor.

456
00:56:42,742 --> 00:56:45,123
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is intended as kind of a 30,000-foot view.

457
00:56:45,423 --> 00:56:50,365
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll collect all these questions, concerns, and then we'll go granular on each area.

458
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:55,627
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for your comments, and don't worry, we'll be talking way more about this before we take any votes.

459
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:03,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there any additional public comment on Zoom or in the chambers before we move on to our second topic for the evening?

460
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:08,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, thank you for your comments.

461
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:18,436
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been taking copious notes, and I'm sure that we will have a very interesting updated version of the commercial framework map for our consideration.

462
00:57:19,438 --> 00:57:24,781
[SPEAKER_16]: or a portion thereof for consideration at our next planning and permitting committee meeting.

463
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:37,446
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also do just want to clarify, depending on what makes most sense for the council's workflow, we might see a updated version of this map in its totality, or we might kind of dilate the telescope onto a specific square or corridor like we were talking about.

464
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:41,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

465
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:42,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all so much for your comments.

466
00:57:43,549 --> 00:57:47,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Paola, I'll turn it back over to you and we can begin our discussion of the updates to the ADU ordinance.

467
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:54,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

468
00:57:56,311 --> 00:58:06,959
[SPEAKER_17]: So the accessory dwelling unit, so the state passed a new law for a protected use for the accessory dwelling unit, ADU.

469
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,942
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to just have the

470
00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:20,464
[SPEAKER_17]: the very summary of what needs to be done from the municipalities point of view.

471
00:58:20,604 --> 00:58:26,368
[SPEAKER_17]: And now that we are revising the zoning, we are going to also update the ADU ordinance.

472
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:37,417
[SPEAKER_17]: So municipalities cannot prohibit, impose a prohibited regulation or unreasonable regulation or accept as provided under the 760

473
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:41,920
[SPEAKER_17]: for the use of land or structures.

474
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:53,566
[SPEAKER_17]: CMR 71.035 required a special permit permit waiver variance or others only relief or discretionary zoning approval for the use of land or structures for a protected use 80, you.

475
00:58:54,006 --> 00:58:59,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Including the rental thereof in a single family residential zoning district provided that municipalities may

476
00:59:06,093 --> 00:59:06,834
[SPEAKER_17]: this set law.

477
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:14,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I'm going to now go through what regulations cannot be applied.

478
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:20,124
[SPEAKER_17]: And so for example, owner occupancy requirement cannot be applied.

479
00:59:20,645 --> 00:59:28,191
[SPEAKER_17]: There is the minimum parking requirement is only one parking per dwelling unit

480
00:59:29,036 --> 00:59:36,288
[SPEAKER_17]: per ADU if it's outside the zero half a mile of high frequent transit.

481
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:43,191
[SPEAKER_17]: and zero if it is within that half a mile of frequent transit.

482
00:59:44,591 --> 00:59:47,452
[SPEAKER_17]: There cannot be use and occupancy restriction.

483
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:56,116
[SPEAKER_17]: The units gap in density, so this is mainly to say that ADUs should not be counted in a density calculations.

484
00:59:57,197 --> 01:00:03,680
[SPEAKER_17]: So when we say this district cannot have more than, it's for one in three units, ADUs do not count to that.

485
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,443
[SPEAKER_17]: and the relationship we cannot establish the relationship between the principal dwelling and the ADU.

486
01:00:11,723 --> 01:00:18,125
[SPEAKER_17]: So it cannot be required to be attached or detached or new or already existing.

487
01:00:19,966 --> 01:00:30,590
[SPEAKER_17]: The dimensional standards cannot be more restrictive than it is required for any of the following, the principal dwelling, single family residential or accessory structure.

488
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:43,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And so this means that if the height of the principal dwelling is 2.5 per minute, the ADU can be 2.5.

489
01:00:44,793 --> 01:01:00,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, there is a restriction for the area, the square footage of that ADU, which is 900 square foot or half of the footprint, the gross floor area of the principal dwelling.

490
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Whichever more restrictive.

491
01:01:04,419 --> 01:01:10,783
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is for the protected 80 you the municipalities can do changes, and we will see them later.

492
01:01:12,204 --> 01:01:21,591
[SPEAKER_17]: In historic districts, the municipalities could establish design standards and dimensional standards for protected use 80 years that are located in such districts.

493
01:01:22,871 --> 01:01:34,415
[SPEAKER_17]: existing nonconforming structures, a municipality may not prohibit the development of a protected use ADU in an existing structure or principal dwelling or lot due to nonconformance.

494
01:01:34,975 --> 01:01:50,100
[SPEAKER_17]: So if there's a lot that is nonconforming and there is a residential, a single family, for example, that want to have an ADU, just because it's in a nonconforming, the municipality cannot prohibit that development of an ADU.

495
01:01:51,161 --> 01:01:53,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Special permits for multiple ADUs on the same lot.

496
01:01:54,023 --> 01:01:59,407
[SPEAKER_17]: If a municipality chooses to allow additional ADUs, this doesn't mean that you have to.

497
01:02:00,188 --> 01:02:01,869
[SPEAKER_17]: This is choice for the municipality.

498
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:09,215
[SPEAKER_17]: As protected use in a single family residential zoning district, the zoning shall require a special permit.

499
01:02:09,255 --> 01:02:15,000
[SPEAKER_17]: This means the protected use is for one ADU minimum.

500
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:21,562
[SPEAKER_17]: municipalities can decide if they want to add or give permission to have more than one.

501
01:02:22,102 --> 01:02:26,023
[SPEAKER_17]: In that case, they will need to be by special permit, not by right.

502
01:02:27,864 --> 01:02:31,044
[SPEAKER_17]: So what are the municipality decisions?

503
01:02:31,545 --> 01:02:35,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are the minimum requirements for the ADUs because it's a protected use now.

504
01:02:36,566 --> 01:02:50,412
[SPEAKER_17]: You can have your what they call in their regulations, the local 80 use and so municipalities may allow accessory dwelling units in any other residential district and those can be by right or by special permit.

505
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,313
[SPEAKER_17]: It is required to be

506
01:02:56,504 --> 01:03:05,191
[SPEAKER_17]: The minimum, the protected use has to be in a single family district by use or by special permit.

507
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:11,657
[SPEAKER_17]: So you could have in any other residential district, you could allow

508
01:03:12,237 --> 01:03:12,797
[SPEAKER_17]: and ADU.

509
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:18,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Municipality can allow bigger ADUs than that 900 square foot restriction.

510
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:23,184
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can allow 1,200 square foot ADUs.

511
01:03:24,244 --> 01:03:29,228
[SPEAKER_17]: And municipalities can allow additional ADUs on the same lot by special permit.

512
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:30,108
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what we said.

513
01:03:30,728 --> 01:03:37,653
[SPEAKER_17]: And the short term rentals, municipality can establish restrictions and prohibitions on that short term rental.

514
01:03:37,853 --> 01:03:40,955
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is completely up to the municipalities.

515
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:47,063
[SPEAKER_17]: if they want to have Shermton rentals for ADUs, but they can also prohibit.

516
01:03:49,086 --> 01:03:56,918
[SPEAKER_17]: And those are right now that summary of where we are now with the new law.

517
01:03:58,509 --> 01:03:59,930
[SPEAKER_17]: protected use.

518
01:04:00,071 --> 01:04:07,398
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now, just yesterday they presented the model zoning for accessory dwelling units.

519
01:04:07,438 --> 01:04:16,848
[SPEAKER_17]: So now we will review that model zoning and check how we will apply it and bring a draft with that new model zoning.

520
01:04:17,428 --> 01:04:26,934
[SPEAKER_17]: we got from the Councillor Lemming an updated version of what they were working with the city for a new ADU.

521
01:04:26,994 --> 01:04:31,097
[SPEAKER_17]: And a lot of the things that were proposed are right now mandatory.

522
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:35,079
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will bring that draft following this new law.

523
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:36,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Any comments?

524
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:37,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Any questions?

525
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Very happy to answer them.

526
01:04:43,002 --> 01:04:43,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Paola.

527
01:04:44,644 --> 01:04:57,998
[SPEAKER_16]: So just to repeat that back in simplified layman's terms, for those less familiar with this topic, the new state law places several new mandatory regulations on cities.

528
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:06,748
[SPEAKER_16]: around essentially that we are not allowed to prohibit ADUs in these new sets of circumstances.

529
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:13,594
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we are updating our ADU ordinance to be in compliance with the new state law.

530
01:05:14,514 --> 01:05:19,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Beyond that, there are several options that we can take for ways we might want to tailor.

531
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,261
[SPEAKER_16]: construction the use of ADUs further based on our specific zoning.

532
01:05:26,302 --> 01:05:42,887
[SPEAKER_16]: So it strikes me that the work before us is to essentially approve the amendments to our existing ADU ordinance, incorporating the mandatory updates from the state, and then to make those decisions on ways that we might want to further handle the treatment of ADUs based on the decisions that the state is leaving up to municipalities.

533
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:43,887
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

534
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,149
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that's correct.

535
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:50,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Um do I have a correct that a lot of the updates that were suggested in the new draft 80 ordinance from Councilor Lemming.

536
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:53,476
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like many of those have been covered by the new state regulations.

537
01:05:53,536 --> 01:05:54,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

538
01:05:56,739 --> 01:05:59,041
[SPEAKER_17]: If not all So, yes.

539
01:06:11,095 --> 01:06:21,520
[SPEAKER_08]: So a decision that we can make, and this is, sorry, there was a lot of text on those slides, and I'm also just trying to remember from the last time this was discussed.

540
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:34,986
[SPEAKER_08]: But one discussion that we can have is whether or not to allow ADUs by right in districts that do not have single family homes, correct?

541
01:06:36,347 --> 01:06:38,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would personally favor

542
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:44,571
[SPEAKER_08]: having ADUs by right in those districts.

543
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:49,513
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just me personally, though.

544
01:06:50,433 --> 01:06:54,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not a thing to allow a second ADU by right.

545
01:06:54,655 --> 01:07:00,296
[SPEAKER_08]: You always have to go through the special permitting process, which would be the CDB, the CD board here, correct?

546
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it have to be the CD board?

547
01:07:04,138 --> 01:07:05,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Or could it be some other body?

548
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:28,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're deciding who can be the special permit granting authority, we can put in any of this Community Development Board, the Zoning Board of Appeals, or the City Council.

549
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:35,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the City Board makes sense because it's a planning decision as to whether, where it should be.

550
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:41,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like anything that goes to City Council becomes political versus what makes good planning sense.

551
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:48,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the zoning board is really more of a legal aspect, and they don't think about sort of the context as much.

552
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:55,075
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, it is the decision as part of the zoning as to who to make the special permit granting authority.

553
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:59,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it should not be the city council like this should I would vote against this.

554
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,502
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to add something to that.

555
01:08:01,522 --> 01:08:01,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

556
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:22,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was at the information meeting that they shared the model ordinance to and there was a lot of questions and answers and it confirmed a lot of things that I wasn't sure was in the act or not.

557
01:08:25,077 --> 01:08:33,123
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think it would be good to be the CD board because this is the AD, the protected use AD use is part of the Dover amendment now.

558
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:45,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if it was, there would be opportunities where the board would have to make the call of whether a regulation was reasonable.

559
01:08:45,406 --> 01:08:49,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the examples I could think of is front yards.

560
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:56,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, we don't allow accessory structures like garages or sheds to be in the front yard.

561
01:08:56,613 --> 01:08:59,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually have an example where someone was looking to put an ADU

562
01:09:00,475 --> 01:09:02,776
[SPEAKER_03]: at their property, but it's unusual.

563
01:09:03,136 --> 01:09:16,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It has two, basically it fronts on two public ways, and it's set way back, but the front yard, technically it's, the front yard is

564
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:22,372
[SPEAKER_03]: The only place to put it basically would be in the front yard, which we wouldn't allow.

565
01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:35,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of going for variants, I think it would make more sense for the CD board to grant the relief that that isn't a reasonable regulation for that specific ADU.

566
01:09:35,978 --> 01:09:37,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that would make the most sense.

567
01:09:45,082 --> 01:09:46,022
[SPEAKER_08]: So CD board.

568
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:50,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

569
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:50,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

570
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

571
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:53,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, Councilor Lemming.

572
01:09:55,471 --> 01:10:12,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the other thing, and this is, I don't know if this was part of anything, but I do remember from the conversations over a year ago that there was some requirement that an ADU couldn't be more than some percentage of the overall property.

573
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that still in state law?

574
01:10:13,754 --> 01:10:18,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It couldn't be bigger than the square footage of, like, 50% of the square footage of the property?

575
01:10:19,907 --> 01:10:23,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I think that was in the old state law and I'm not sure if that continued over.

576
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:34,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so the maximum area for the ADU is the 900, or half the gross floor area of the principal building.

577
01:10:34,655 --> 01:10:41,518
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is counting all the square footage of that principal building.

578
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:50,180
[SPEAKER_17]: So all the floors, you do the sum, and half of that, or 900, whatever more restrictive.

579
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,942
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so that's still in state law, then?

580
01:10:54,122 --> 01:10:54,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

581
01:10:55,237 --> 01:10:59,078
[SPEAKER_17]: But municipalities can choose to increase that number.

582
01:11:00,318 --> 01:11:01,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, sorry.

583
01:11:01,718 --> 01:11:06,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Municipalities cannot be more restrictive than the law, but can be more permissive.

584
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:12,721
[SPEAKER_17]: So you could choose to have a bigger number if you want to.

585
01:11:13,661 --> 01:11:14,441
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so.

586
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:16,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Larger, yeah.

587
01:11:16,282 --> 01:11:18,102
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so we can we can choose to make

588
01:11:19,114 --> 01:11:21,475
[SPEAKER_08]: ADUs larger than with the stay law.

589
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:21,755
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

590
01:11:21,975 --> 01:11:22,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

591
01:11:22,235 --> 01:11:22,455
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

592
01:11:22,895 --> 01:11:23,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

593
01:11:23,435 --> 01:11:36,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because there's this weird issue that some people run into where you can have a basement ADU if it's a two-story place, but you can't have a basement ADU if it's a one-story house.

594
01:11:38,259 --> 01:11:42,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there are things like that where people were getting into, if I recall.

595
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:47,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So just anything to avoid cases like that would be good.

596
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, yeah, thank you.

597
01:11:54,693 --> 01:12:06,101
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry, in summary, would like it if we could allow ADUs by right in districts that only have multifamily housing or no single family housing.

598
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:07,814
[SPEAKER_16]: great.

599
01:12:07,874 --> 01:12:10,475
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do think that gets to one of the questions before us.

600
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:12,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but we're not bound by state law.

601
01:12:12,355 --> 01:12:14,016
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things that is up to the city of Medford.

602
01:12:14,836 --> 01:12:23,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, should we allow 80 years in any residential district, not just the districts where a single family housing is allowed by right?

603
01:12:23,859 --> 01:12:37,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so we hear recommendation from Councilor Lemming, um, to paraphrase you that we should Go next to a couple of our non voting members on zoom Councilor Lazaro, and then we'll go to Councilor saying

604
01:12:39,603 --> 01:12:39,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

605
01:12:40,523 --> 01:13:04,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering if somebody could potentially, if I could ask through the chair for some comments from Director Hunt about the CD board and the amount of like obligation we might be placing on them to, like if we're putting,

606
01:13:05,434 --> 01:13:31,619
[SPEAKER_14]: if we're obligating them to take on too many questions, is it prohibitive the amount of, the number of issues it may be under the purview of the city board to look at if we have special permits for a lot of these decisions?

607
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I'm curious about like,

608
01:13:35,596 --> 01:13:45,602
[SPEAKER_14]: when it becomes functionally not allowed that ADUs could be put on various spaces because they need a special permit.

609
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:50,965
[SPEAKER_14]: And then what ends up happening is nobody does it because it takes four months to get on the agenda.

610
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:53,706
[SPEAKER_14]: It takes too long to cover the thing.

611
01:13:53,726 --> 01:13:54,647
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets continued.

612
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:55,567
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not worth trying.

613
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:02,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council Liz Howard.

614
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:23,190
[SPEAKER_16]: So to paraphrase, and please let me know if I captured your concern correctly, I think I'm hearing a question about if allowing ADUs beyond what the state mandates, if we're making those by right, sorry, if we're making those by special permit as opposed to by right, if that is gonna be prohibitive to people actually following through on those projects.

615
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:28,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Planner Evans or Director Hunt, can you speak to a recommendation on that?

616
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:41,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking about the additional ADUs that we might want to allow by special permit?

617
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:44,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the other regular protected use ADUs we can't allow.

618
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,361
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't require a special permit.

619
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:49,181
[SPEAKER_03]: They're by right, so it doesn't go to any board.

620
01:14:49,642 --> 01:14:51,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a building permit.

621
01:14:51,502 --> 01:14:52,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't go to anyone.

622
01:14:52,503 --> 01:15:02,667
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there's maybe two questions here, because the ADUs in districts where single families are allowed by right, the ADUs are allowed by right.

623
01:15:02,687 --> 01:15:04,388
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the two questions before us are,

624
01:15:05,128 --> 01:15:15,236
[SPEAKER_16]: If we decide to allow ADUs in other residential districts where there were single families not allowed by right, do we want to allow ADUs there?

625
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:17,738
[SPEAKER_16]: And if so, should it be special permitted or by right?

626
01:15:18,338 --> 01:15:24,723
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in addition to that, if we're allowing a second ADU, are those by right or those have to be by special permit?

627
01:15:25,598 --> 01:15:25,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

628
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:31,241
[SPEAKER_14]: The question is really more like, how many ADUs would we want to permit by right?

629
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:33,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Or would they go to special?

630
01:15:33,622 --> 01:15:34,583
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't every single.

631
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:37,304
[SPEAKER_14]: I see what the issue is.

632
01:15:37,564 --> 01:15:42,627
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not that we're not adding on restrictions.

633
01:15:42,687 --> 01:15:50,952
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't add on restrictions because the state law is that ADUs are allowed on single family homes by right.

634
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:52,392
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can't take that away.

635
01:15:52,933 --> 01:15:52,993
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

636
01:15:53,911 --> 01:15:55,353
[SPEAKER_03]: That's single family districts.

637
01:15:55,473 --> 01:16:01,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So my district's multifamily home could have could have an ad you if single families are allowed in that district.

638
01:16:02,644 --> 01:16:03,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, great.

639
01:16:04,146 --> 01:16:04,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

640
01:16:06,402 --> 01:16:29,889
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we wanted to clarify, and honestly, I was gonna shoot it in a note to the consultants first, but it's our understanding that, so for example, in this district's neighborhood residential three, which happens to be on the map that we had with us this evening, where it lists single dwelling unit plus ADU, because single dwelling units are allowed in that district,

641
01:16:30,529 --> 01:16:39,351
[SPEAKER_02]: it is our understanding that also the two units, the three units, the townhouses, and the historic conversions all have to allow ADUs by right.

642
01:16:40,171 --> 01:16:56,615
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should redo how we're displaying it on these, because the way it's showing implies that only the single families would have an ADU, when actually maybe it should just be another bullet that ADUs are allowed on any principal dwelling

643
01:16:57,269 --> 01:16:58,470
[SPEAKER_02]: in the entire district.

644
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just using that one as an example.

645
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:13,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think then the question is, so because this map is in front of us, where it lists Urban Residential 1, which does not have single unit dwellings.

646
01:17:13,937 --> 01:17:18,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Urban Residential 1, the state is not requiring us to do ADUs by right.

647
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:24,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We could choose to allow ADUs by right, but it becomes a little complicated.

648
01:17:24,621 --> 01:17:37,904
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that because we're making the choice, we would have the ability to say that two units or three unit dwellings could have ADUs, but a multiplex or a townhouse would not have an ADU.

649
01:17:38,384 --> 01:17:41,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, you kind of look at a townhouse and say, wouldn't that be weird?

650
01:17:43,146 --> 01:17:48,067
[SPEAKER_02]: But a multiplex, four to six units plus an ADU seems odd.

651
01:17:50,092 --> 01:17:51,614
[SPEAKER_02]: but in some of the neighborhoods.

652
01:17:51,975 --> 01:17:53,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Do any of the neighborhoods go to?

653
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:55,440
[SPEAKER_02]: No, none of them have multiplex.

654
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:57,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't have all the lists.

655
01:17:57,563 --> 01:17:59,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I do up here.

656
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:03,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so the urban.

657
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:09,924
[SPEAKER_02]: one and two of multiplexes, but the neighborhood residentials do not have.

658
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:11,805
[SPEAKER_02]: They just go up to four units.

659
01:18:12,746 --> 01:18:14,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's only in the historic conversions.

660
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:25,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, a historic conversion is a place where you could imagine that you might convert the main big house into multiple units and then put an ADU and a carriage house outside.

661
01:18:27,918 --> 01:18:30,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be inside, but it could be outside.

662
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, we should probably be both speaking into the microphone.

663
01:18:39,634 --> 01:18:58,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so what she's pointing out is that if you had a historic conversion in a neighborhood residential three, so say you have a very large existing house and you actually want to cut it up into four units without adjusting the outside, that's what the historic conversion would be, you could in fact get a fifth unit by calling the fifth unit an ADU.

664
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,159
[SPEAKER_02]: under the state law.

665
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,803
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed, that's not Medford's way of doing it.

666
01:19:06,063 --> 01:19:07,784
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not telling you you could or you should.

667
01:19:07,824 --> 01:19:08,805
[SPEAKER_02]: We're saying that's state law.

668
01:19:09,646 --> 01:19:09,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

669
01:19:12,368 --> 01:19:14,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that kind of get at some of the details?

670
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I think then the question is special permits, right?

671
01:19:17,012 --> 01:19:21,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you said, well, let's allow them in urban residential one and two,

672
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:31,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Silver, PB – she-her-hers): You would have you could allow them by right or you could allow them by special permit, and I think what i'm kind of hearing from counselor Lazaro is.

673
01:19:31,681 --> 01:19:39,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Silver, PB – she-her-hers): Would that be putting so many special permits on the CD board that it would take a while to get on the agenda and.

674
01:19:40,596 --> 01:19:42,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if those are covered under 40A.

675
01:19:43,418 --> 01:19:46,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Most things, we can't delay them.

676
01:19:47,402 --> 01:19:57,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So like by the time the permit is, the application is complete, it starts what we call a shot clock that you have to open your hearing by a certain date.

677
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't put them off too long.

678
01:20:01,072 --> 01:20:02,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And we typically don't.

679
01:20:02,073 --> 01:20:07,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the CD board now meets twice a month because of the volume of work already coming to them.

680
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:10,948
[SPEAKER_02]: although we'd prefer not to have four hour meetings every two weeks.

681
01:20:12,865 --> 01:20:14,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Planner Evans.

682
01:20:14,786 --> 01:20:28,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would also add that if another SPJ also can't expedite it because 40A has notification requirements or would have to run the paper for two successive weeks for a special permit.

683
01:20:28,674 --> 01:20:38,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So if, say, city council was the special permit granting authority, you can't waive that two-week period of advertising.

684
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure if it would be quicker.

685
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:46,912
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't hold things back if people get on the agenda, if they've submitted their stuff on time.

686
01:20:49,313 --> 01:20:58,956
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a thing that could be looked at, but I feel like it is a planning kind of... Yeah, thank you.

687
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:01,877
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can zoom us... Oh, sorry.

688
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:03,898
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll go to you in just a second, Councillor Singh.

689
01:21:05,178 --> 01:21:09,740
[SPEAKER_16]: That's really helpful, and I do think, especially for people who are new to this topic, it can be a little bit confusing.

690
01:21:12,491 --> 01:21:15,194
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that there's kind of a flowchart of options before us.

691
01:21:15,295 --> 01:21:18,539
[SPEAKER_16]: There's the bulk of this, we don't have an option on because it's state law.

692
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:28,772
[SPEAKER_16]: In any sub-district that allows single-family homes by right, we must allow ADUs by right for all types of housing within that sub-district, not just the single-family homes.

693
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:36,720
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we kind of have a short flow chart of decisions before us that are under our jurisdiction as a city.

694
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:44,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Should we allow ADUs in any residential subdistrict, not just the ones that allow single family homes by right?

695
01:21:45,832 --> 01:22:03,938
[SPEAKER_16]: If so, should they be by right or special permitted and should be tried to tailor by on what lots, they may occur either by right or by special permit and I do agree with the comments from our PDF staff that there are some types of structures, especially in you are one and you are two or just wouldn't make any sense.

696
01:22:05,238 --> 01:22:10,840
[SPEAKER_16]: to have an ADU on one of our denser housing, on one of our most dense housing types.

697
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:23,705
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the next major decision bucket is should we allow a second ADU on lots that already have one, by special permit, and if yes, in what districts?

698
01:22:23,725 --> 01:22:24,545
[SPEAKER_16]: There's another question.

699
01:22:25,385 --> 01:22:29,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Who should be the special permit grant authority for ADUs that are specially permitted?

700
01:22:29,827 --> 01:22:32,268
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like the clear recommendation there is it should be the CDB.

701
01:22:32,568 --> 01:22:32,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I would agree.

702
01:22:35,028 --> 01:22:41,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we want to allow ADUs that are bigger than 900 square feet or more than half of the floor area of the principal area?

703
01:22:42,856 --> 01:22:45,579
[SPEAKER_16]: And if yes, by right or by special permit?

704
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,181
[SPEAKER_16]: And then finally, we haven't even touched on this yet.

705
01:22:49,522 --> 01:22:56,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we want to consider a short-term rental option for ADUs and what would the recommendations for regulations be there?

706
01:22:57,088 --> 01:23:10,599
[SPEAKER_16]: So far, our conversation has been mostly around those first three questions, but I did just want to orient us in the questions before us so that when we leave this meeting and as associates kind of has a better

707
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:19,867
[SPEAKER_16]: all of the feedback that they might need to start drafting the updates to the ordinance for us based on the stuff that is under our jurisdiction.

708
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:25,932
[SPEAKER_16]: So eager to hear more comments from councilors on kind of the three main questions.

709
01:23:26,633 --> 01:23:31,917
[SPEAKER_16]: In my mind, should we be allowing ADUs in any residential sub-district, not just the ones that allow single families by right?

710
01:23:32,658 --> 01:23:36,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Should we be allowing a second ADU and special permit and in what districts under what conditions?

711
01:23:38,183 --> 01:23:40,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Go next to Councilor Seng and then President Behrs.

712
01:23:41,845 --> 01:23:46,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, for making this a lot clearer.

713
01:23:46,586 --> 01:23:55,328
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you to Director Hans and the team for clarifying some stuff that was on the map.

714
01:23:56,088 --> 01:24:06,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a little bit confused about whether or I thought that the ADU wouldn't apply to the two-unit dwellings and three-unit dwellings and so on.

715
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:09,851
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is helpful to know that the ADU

716
01:24:11,891 --> 01:24:19,618
[SPEAKER_09]: does apply to all the different types in the NR123 neighborhoods and I certainly support that.

717
01:24:20,338 --> 01:24:31,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in general what I hear from residents is that they want to be, folks want to be able to do more with their property, especially in terms of creating more housing.

718
01:24:33,049 --> 01:24:36,512
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of folks who I, neighbors and residents I talk to who

719
01:24:38,113 --> 01:24:52,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Want to be able to turn, you know, something into an 80 you they want their kids have moved out and they want to be able to, you know, live in the house that they own, but also to do more with that property.

720
01:24:52,964 --> 01:24:56,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think 80 years are a great way to do that, which is why.

721
01:24:56,927 --> 01:25:08,596
[SPEAKER_09]: In general, my preference is to allow them would be to allow them in any residential neighborhood, even if there are not single family, single unit dwellings there.

722
01:25:08,616 --> 01:25:14,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in general, for example, if we're taking you are 1.

723
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:16,722
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're looking at the 2 unit dwellings.

724
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:27,769
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't make a lot of sense, in my opinion, to not allow that for a two-unit dwelling in UR1, but to allow that in our neighborhoods.

725
01:25:28,829 --> 01:25:32,851
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's just my perspective on it, on question one.

726
01:25:32,991 --> 01:25:37,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I also, in general, I understand.

727
01:25:37,434 --> 01:25:40,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how this works.

728
01:25:43,277 --> 01:25:59,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this is a question for the zoning team, but I wonder if there's a way to allow, for example, in UR1, to allow ADUs by right for certain types of dwellings and then to make it by special permit for the multiplex.

729
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:04,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if that's allowed or if we just have to decide it for the whole neighborhood.

730
01:26:07,482 --> 01:26:10,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll leave that up to the zoning team, but that's just a question that I had.

731
01:26:14,192 --> 01:26:21,997
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to questions two and three, I am a little bit curious.

732
01:26:22,077 --> 01:26:25,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I know 900 square feet is the number that we've chosen.

733
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:28,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's a number that the state has said.

734
01:26:28,341 --> 01:26:31,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious what the rationale behind 900 is.

735
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:38,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if there's a number that works better for Medford, or whether 900 is just the one that makes the most sense.

736
01:26:40,629 --> 01:27:03,765
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to additional ADUs on the same lot, I think my thought is that if it makes sense for that lot, the special permit process, in my opinion, I think this is what Councilor Zaro was getting to, is that oftentimes it can just be an additional barrier to people who would otherwise want to create an ADU.

737
01:27:05,363 --> 01:27:11,267
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of folks don't exactly know how to go through the special permit process.

738
01:27:12,668 --> 01:27:17,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the weeks slash months it takes is just

739
01:27:19,478 --> 01:27:23,161
[SPEAKER_09]: a hindrance to them, and I think that's something to consider as well.

740
01:27:24,622 --> 01:27:33,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I generally leave it to this committee to make a lot of the discretionary decisions, and I have a lot of faith in this committee and in the zoning team.

741
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:41,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to provide support for those things and to the sentiments from other councillors, from Councillor Zara and Leming.

742
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councillor Sheng.

743
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:49,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Go next to President Behrs.

744
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:54,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

745
01:27:54,371 --> 01:28:17,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think for me, certainly as to question one, by right for detached in any residential district and by right for attached or detached in the NR districts or for anything other than a multiplex, I think makes a lot of sense.

746
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:23,253
[SPEAKER_11]: For question two, I'd like to see that go up to 1,000 or 1,100.

747
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:30,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a more reasonable size of a single, relatively small apartment unit.

748
01:28:33,621 --> 01:28:44,570
[SPEAKER_11]: For three, personally, I would just only be interested in seeing two ADUs on the same lot if it was, if there was an attached ADU and then

749
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:53,174
[SPEAKER_11]: there was a detached ADU to preserve a historic structure or an accessory structure.

750
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:57,136
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really see the need for multiple ADUs on the same lot.

751
01:28:59,437 --> 01:29:05,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And then for four, I personally would not want to allow ADUs to be short-term rented.

752
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:10,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the short-term rental has been a really tough

753
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:19,744
[SPEAKER_11]: impact on the housing market and it's just not the way to to move on that.

754
01:29:20,024 --> 01:29:25,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we want to see people building a lot of these units for short-term rental purposes.

755
01:29:25,088 --> 01:29:29,311
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we want to see them building them to make sure that people can live here year-round.

756
01:29:29,871 --> 01:29:30,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

757
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:34,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you President Barras.

758
01:29:35,295 --> 01:29:36,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Go back to Councillor Singh.

759
01:29:39,483 --> 01:29:44,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I realized that neglected number four I think I generally agree with President bears.

760
01:29:44,969 --> 01:29:53,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we, I think the goal with zoning in general is to get more units on the market to lower housing costs that way.

761
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,321
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, um,

762
01:29:56,655 --> 01:30:05,004
[SPEAKER_09]: If we, you know if if we didn't have restrictions or prohibitions on short term rentals that that cuts against our goal.

763
01:30:06,246 --> 01:30:08,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I did actually have a question for the staff.

764
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:25,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Under this proposed zoning change, let's say you have a family with a non-conforming, let's take your one.

765
01:30:25,513 --> 01:30:29,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Your one is the easiest one to use as an example, I guess.

766
01:30:30,017 --> 01:30:35,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say you have a non-conforming single-family unit, but they do want to create an ADU.

767
01:30:35,901 --> 01:30:39,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, let's say that we allow it either by special permit or by right.

768
01:30:41,405 --> 01:30:54,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Would they be able to get an ADU or to build an ADU even if they don't turn the main dwelling into a two-unit or a sort of conversion or whatnot?

769
01:31:02,966 --> 01:31:13,101
[SPEAKER_17]: So according to the law, and if we propose this for the protected ADU, we will recommend to also propose for the local ADU.

770
01:31:14,643 --> 01:31:17,307
[SPEAKER_17]: We cannot, municipalities cannot prohibit

771
01:31:18,248 --> 01:31:22,210
[SPEAKER_17]: development of that ADU in a nonconforming structure.

772
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:43,760
[SPEAKER_17]: So they could build, if they live in a nonconforming single family in the UR, one or two, it doesn't matter, they will be able to build the protected use ADU if we allow by right or by special permit ADU in that district.

773
01:31:49,573 --> 01:31:51,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, sorry, we couldn't hear your last comment, Councillor Seng.

774
01:31:52,495 --> 01:31:54,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I just said thank you so much.

775
01:31:54,256 --> 01:31:56,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you for the question, Councillor Seng.

776
01:31:57,518 --> 01:31:58,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Go next to Councillor Lemming.

777
01:32:01,561 --> 01:32:02,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

778
01:32:02,882 --> 01:32:15,351
[SPEAKER_08]: What's progress been like on, or what do you think the ability would be to enforce any short-term rental bans in ADUs?

779
01:32:15,451 --> 01:32:18,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you think that, because I have heard it's been kind of difficult

780
01:32:19,995 --> 01:32:23,098
[SPEAKER_08]: past, so practically speaking.

781
01:32:26,701 --> 01:32:32,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Madam Chair, that's truly a question that we'd have to ask the building commissioner about enforcement.

782
01:32:33,067 --> 01:32:36,430
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I was just reflecting on is that ADU

783
01:32:38,975 --> 01:32:52,800
[SPEAKER_02]: short term rentals seem to do well better when the community enforces the rules strongly because that that encourages the owners to enforce the rules strongly right like if you've ever gone to rent a.

784
01:32:54,666 --> 01:33:14,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spent I just traveled and I rented several airbnbs and some of them, they were very clear like if the police gets called if your noise if there's a noise complaint, you have to leave and you lose the rest of your rental right and that's right up front from some owners, but you know that they're getting enforced by someone.

785
01:33:14,484 --> 01:33:16,845
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to be saying that so strictly in there.

786
01:33:17,685 --> 01:33:20,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we should ask our building commissioner about it.

787
01:33:20,986 --> 01:33:29,990
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we were thinking about was that, um, if we allowed sorry, I keep trying to use the brand names short term rentals.

788
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Only in owner occupied properties.

789
01:33:34,431 --> 01:33:41,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the owner lives in the 80 you and rents out the main house or lives in

790
01:33:42,298 --> 01:33:55,906
[SPEAKER_02]: the main house and rents out an ADU, that feels more enforceable by everybody because you know that you have somebody there who's also going to be, frankly, quite irritated if their renters are very badly behaved.

791
01:33:57,266 --> 01:33:57,667
[SPEAKER_02]: One hopes.

792
01:33:59,307 --> 01:34:00,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be easier to enforce.

793
01:34:00,848 --> 01:34:05,691
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, we should ask the building commissioner before making any decisions on the whole ADU topic.

794
01:34:08,172 --> 01:34:18,120
[SPEAKER_08]: So following up, would any ordinances that could potentially help the city with enforcement be outside the scope of zoning?

795
01:34:20,362 --> 01:34:27,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if we wanted to implement some kind of a fine structure like what you just said, would that have to be kind of its own separate thing?

796
01:34:27,989 --> 01:34:34,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm honestly not certain how.

797
01:34:34,194 --> 01:34:35,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So in zoning,

798
01:34:36,362 --> 01:34:42,887
[SPEAKER_02]: you wouldn't do a fine structure for like, if we found you, but, right?

799
01:34:45,369 --> 01:34:51,073
[SPEAKER_02]: If say somebody, if you thought, if they said, we're renting these out on Airbnb, right?

800
01:34:51,633 --> 01:34:55,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, and we're living here and we're renting out the other one.

801
01:34:56,897 --> 01:34:58,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you realize that they weren't.

802
01:34:59,559 --> 01:35:02,461
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're suggesting, like when would you institute a fine?

803
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:04,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause there would be the police would be called on noise.

804
01:35:05,593 --> 01:35:12,938
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kind of thinking, because a lot of people can just sort of shirk or ignore the laws.

805
01:35:13,038 --> 01:35:24,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once it gets enforced, then maybe after they've already had a short-term rental operating for like five years, they've still made a pretty hefty profit off of doing it.

806
01:35:24,605 --> 01:35:29,709
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I'm thinking is, is there any possible way to say, to like,

807
01:35:30,539 --> 01:35:34,440
[SPEAKER_08]: bring down the hammer in cases where people do that to disincentivize the behavior.

808
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:43,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, well, you've been renting this out for a year, so we're able to levy a larger fine against you because we can see that this has been on Airbnb this whole time.

809
01:35:43,523 --> 01:35:45,483
[SPEAKER_08]: You must have made this amount of money.

810
01:35:45,543 --> 01:35:47,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to think of ways to.

811
01:35:47,384 --> 01:35:48,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we look into it?

812
01:35:49,024 --> 01:35:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking that maybe that might be a good research topic for one of our interns, honestly.

813
01:35:54,826 --> 01:35:58,367
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the Airbnb, sorry, short-term rental

814
01:36:00,271 --> 01:36:01,291
[SPEAKER_02]: short term rentals.

815
01:36:01,571 --> 01:36:09,293
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other companies that policies and rules and ordinances in other communities.

816
01:36:09,934 --> 01:36:17,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might point them to communities that have lots of short term rentals because they're known as vacation places.

817
01:36:17,736 --> 01:36:23,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to look at what some of our other communities look like, look at, I feel like it's a good research topic for one of our interns.

818
01:36:25,178 --> 01:36:25,538
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I'm

819
01:36:27,099 --> 01:36:27,219
[SPEAKER_16]: that.

820
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:27,539
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may.

821
01:36:27,559 --> 01:36:29,500
[SPEAKER_16]: I do want to note and sorry.

822
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:37,762
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that we do have a lawyer engaged on this, and we will also ask him if he has guidelines about what we can and cannot do legally.

823
01:36:37,782 --> 01:36:39,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

824
01:36:39,942 --> 01:36:41,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the discussion on that.

825
01:36:41,682 --> 01:36:42,303
[SPEAKER_16]: I do want to note.

826
01:36:42,323 --> 01:36:44,663
[SPEAKER_16]: I think all counselors are certainly aware of this.

827
01:36:45,523 --> 01:36:45,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Um.

828
01:36:46,924 --> 01:36:50,805
[SPEAKER_16]: The current Medford short term rental ordinance gets

829
01:36:56,746 --> 01:37:00,410
[SPEAKER_16]: most closely on this ordinance, that the issue really has been enforcement.

830
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:09,898
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that that is our first major obstacle to clear, which is, I think we're all aware of the enforcement issues across many departments of the city.

831
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:19,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Outside of the scope of zoning, I think that the first question is, what is the, kind of, what utility would we want to get out of allowing

832
01:37:20,613 --> 01:37:31,799
[SPEAKER_16]: creating special regulations for short-term rental of Airbnbs, sorry, short-term rentals at all, maybe guided by the context of our enforcement problems so far.

833
01:37:36,222 --> 01:37:37,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Personally, as one counselor,

834
01:37:40,528 --> 01:37:48,599
[SPEAKER_16]: I am not interested in kind of tailoring our updated ADU ordinance to short-term rentals at all.

835
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:56,209
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the reasons why I'm excited about this ordinance is because studies of housing in Medford have shown that

836
01:37:56,922 --> 01:38:07,819
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we have a housing shortage, but we also have a shortage of very specific types of housing, in particular, including small apartments for people who live alone, students, people who are downsizing.

837
01:38:07,839 --> 01:38:11,846
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's one really important thing to come out of allowing more

838
01:38:12,752 --> 01:38:23,886
[SPEAKER_16]: ADUs, I would be, I'm kind of, I'm feeling very protective of if we are able to pass regulations that allow more ADUs to flourish where they're appropriate in our community.

839
01:38:23,926 --> 01:38:30,554
[SPEAKER_16]: I would really want those to be protected as a mechanism for adding more of those small types of housing to the community because we know

840
01:38:31,896 --> 01:38:45,709
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think this is in the housing production plan, that a particular shortage of housing type is people who would really like to live alone and they don't need a lot of space, but they have to live with roommates or with family when they prefer not to, because there just aren't studios and one bedrooms available.

841
01:38:48,491 --> 01:38:55,858
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be my preference, is to not consider regulations for a short-term rental for ADUs at this time.

842
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:02,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing no hands raised from councillors at this time, I'll just throw my two cents in.

843
01:39:03,917 --> 01:39:15,573
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make sure that we leave this meeting with at least kind of a draft of the consensus for where to go on these main questions for Innis Associates that we can hopefully look at draft amended language in a meeting or two.

844
01:39:17,314 --> 01:39:26,478
[SPEAKER_16]: For myself, I would like to see ADUs allowed in all of our residential districts, not just ones where single families are allowed by right.

845
01:39:26,598 --> 01:39:35,262
[SPEAKER_16]: I think especially since we have this kind of like staircase mechanism with our residential districts, a lot of housing types carry over from one to the next.

846
01:39:35,882 --> 01:39:37,703
[SPEAKER_16]: So to me, it would be arbitrary to say, well,

847
01:39:39,022 --> 01:39:55,330
[SPEAKER_16]: this historic conversion, or this two-unit dwelling unit can have an ADU because it's in this subdistrict, but this other housing type, which is exactly the same, but it's in a different subdistrict, cannot have an ADU under the same conditions just because the subdistrict that it's in.

848
01:39:56,251 --> 01:39:59,593
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to see ADUs allowed in all residential subdistricts.

849
01:40:00,773 --> 01:40:17,487
[SPEAKER_16]: But I agree with the idea thrown out by President Behrs that I think when we get into UR1 and UR2, it makes sense to be looking at by right for detached, like kind of where detached is spatially possible.

850
01:40:17,507 --> 01:40:19,188
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it makes sense for that to be by right.

851
01:40:21,190 --> 01:40:29,537
[SPEAKER_16]: And then by right for attached or detached in any neighborhood residential district for anything other than a multiplex.

852
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:33,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

853
01:40:35,803 --> 01:40:41,786
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of the question around, should we allow second ADUs by special permit?

854
01:40:42,707 --> 01:40:43,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I agree.

855
01:40:43,607 --> 01:40:44,768
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hard for me to picture.

856
01:40:45,348 --> 01:40:56,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, I'm always happy to consider recommendations from city staff or our consultants, but it's hard for me to picture a lot where it kind of makes sense to have two detached ADUs on the same property.

857
01:40:56,274 --> 01:41:04,999
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it could make sense to look at where would it make sense to allow a second ADU if detached, where there's already a detached one, or vice versa.

858
01:41:06,691 --> 01:41:13,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm happy to defer to the planner's recommendations on if we should allow ADUs bigger than 900 square feet.

859
01:41:13,878 --> 01:41:18,682
[SPEAKER_16]: 900 square feet is quite small, so I don't think that that square footage needs to be set in stone.

860
01:41:18,702 --> 01:41:20,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm happy to consider something a little bit larger.

861
01:41:23,266 --> 01:41:27,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Was there anything that I missed?

862
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:30,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure I don't think so.

863
01:41:38,615 --> 01:41:50,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other comments from counselors at this time on the treatment of ADUs in other sub districts than the ones where single family is allowed by right?

864
01:41:52,964 --> 01:41:55,165
[SPEAKER_16]: And how those ADUs should be treated, i.e.

865
01:41:55,685 --> 01:41:56,866
[SPEAKER_16]: by right or by special permit?

866
01:42:00,308 --> 01:42:01,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Or if it depends on what housing type.

867
01:42:07,566 --> 01:42:21,416
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, hearing none, we will go to, sorry, give me a second here, I'm rearranging my windows.

868
01:42:23,298 --> 01:42:25,379
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so I think we're kind of winding down for the night.

869
01:42:25,419 --> 01:42:27,741
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna make sure that, oh, Councilor Lemming, is that a hand raised?

870
01:42:30,023 --> 01:42:30,343
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

871
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:43,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to briefly mention that even with the previous work on short-term rentals, I still would be interested to see if there were

872
01:42:45,575 --> 01:43:01,364
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are any possible mechanisms that other communities have included in their zoning towards enforcement, we're just giving the ability of the building commissioner to better enforce that.

873
01:43:01,424 --> 01:43:04,806
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would still be interested in seeing some of that work.

874
01:43:04,826 --> 01:43:14,111
[SPEAKER_08]: But otherwise, I did want to hear about the review of upcoming zoning project topics until June.

875
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:24,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, was that you wanted a reiteration of the zoning timeline that we got at the beginning of the meeting?

876
01:43:24,902 --> 01:43:26,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's on the agenda.

877
01:43:27,623 --> 01:43:27,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

878
01:43:28,003 --> 01:43:30,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think I'm not sure if Paula covered that.

879
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:41,848
[SPEAKER_16]: We can... Yes, let's close out councilor comment and public comment on ADUs, and then we can start with a review of the... Then we can... Sorry, we can end with a review of the timeline.

880
01:43:43,902 --> 01:43:50,324
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's go to public comment, then I'll summarize our next steps on ADUs, and then we can review the timeline before we adjourn.

881
01:43:50,344 --> 01:43:55,706
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, public participation, seeing nobody at the podium, I will go to Gaston on Zoom.

882
01:43:55,746 --> 01:43:57,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

883
01:44:00,348 --> 01:44:01,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

884
01:44:01,309 --> 01:44:02,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaston Fierro, 61 Stignard.

885
01:44:03,209 --> 01:44:07,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to comment quickly about the 900 square foot restriction.

886
01:44:08,402 --> 01:44:28,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to see, I would like to read the analysis that I would hope that the state did in order to determine this 900 square foot area restriction before we try to modify the number and then pick something else.

887
01:44:29,508 --> 01:44:45,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I would like to hope that there was a thorough analysis conducted that led to this 900 square foot restriction and not that they just decided randomly or haphazardly that it's going to be 900.

888
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:54,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to consider that we're talking about auxiliary dwellings and I just don't want the ADU to be

889
01:44:54,837 --> 01:45:03,503
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of a method that we tweak to add an extra unit to an existing unit in a lot.

890
01:45:03,903 --> 01:45:09,347
[SPEAKER_10]: So it should be an accessory unit, and as such, it should have certain restrictions.

891
01:45:09,867 --> 01:45:18,593
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not opposed to tweaking that number, but before we do so, I would like to read the analysis that the state hopefully has already conducted.

892
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:25,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we need to conduct external analysis or review that, I'm all up for that.

893
01:45:25,995 --> 01:45:32,737
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think we shouldn't throw any other numbers at this point without having analyzed anything yet.

894
01:45:33,157 --> 01:45:33,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

895
01:45:35,338 --> 01:45:35,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

896
01:45:35,678 --> 01:45:36,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Gaston.

897
01:45:37,518 --> 01:45:41,440
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll go next to Matthew on Zoom.

898
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

899
01:45:44,948 --> 01:45:47,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Matthew page live in a 15 minute straight.

900
01:45:48,771 --> 01:45:52,233
[SPEAKER_12]: I was not able to attend most of this because there were simultaneously.

901
01:45:52,914 --> 01:45:59,038
[SPEAKER_12]: The open or resident engagement meeting for the affordable housing trust on.

902
01:46:00,179 --> 01:46:03,842
[SPEAKER_12]: But there, there were there, there was a person there who had

903
01:46:04,782 --> 01:46:08,724
[SPEAKER_12]: a few questions about what can be done to address affordability.

904
01:46:09,605 --> 01:46:13,767
[SPEAKER_12]: One of those questions the person asked was specifically about short-term rentals.

905
01:46:14,507 --> 01:46:25,673
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I had told them that they should, because of the work this council has previously done, I think going back a couple of years, that they would be, you know,

906
01:46:26,576 --> 01:46:33,781
[SPEAKER_12]: they, it would be good for them to reach out to Councillor Collins and Councillor Behrs to understand more about the work that's been done.

907
01:46:33,801 --> 01:46:39,044
[SPEAKER_12]: I see the work is continuing here and I'm just so very appreciative of this.

908
01:46:39,164 --> 01:46:47,130
[SPEAKER_12]: I think short-term rentals, they serve a role, however, it's applying them to AD, allowing them to fester in ADUs

909
01:46:47,964 --> 01:46:52,248
[SPEAKER_12]: would definitely be working against the affordable issues that we're concerned about.

910
01:46:53,049 --> 01:47:02,777
[SPEAKER_12]: And just kind of tangentially, I'm just really impressed with the amount of work after last night that everybody did to continue on this work.

911
01:47:03,117 --> 01:47:07,802
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the city is very blessed to have such committed people engaged in this work.

912
01:47:07,862 --> 01:47:09,103
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thank you all so very much.

913
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:13,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Matthew.

914
01:47:17,307 --> 01:47:18,728
[SPEAKER_16]: going next to Judith.

915
01:47:18,748 --> 01:47:19,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

916
01:47:20,048 --> 01:47:20,829
[SPEAKER_16]: And you'll have three minutes.

917
01:47:22,109 --> 01:47:23,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, it's Judith Weinstock.

918
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:25,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 144 Burgett Avenue.

919
01:47:26,051 --> 01:47:26,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, everybody.

920
01:47:27,032 --> 01:47:30,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm calling from out of town, so I hope everything sounds OK.

921
01:47:32,235 --> 01:47:35,916
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have a clarifying question, not an opinion, believe it or not.

922
01:47:37,437 --> 01:47:38,918
[SPEAKER_13]: So let me just clarify.

923
01:47:38,958 --> 01:47:40,659
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you live in a residential

924
01:47:42,021 --> 01:47:47,105
[SPEAKER_13]: nonconforming residential area, say your lot size is 4,500 square feet.

925
01:47:48,687 --> 01:47:58,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Under this provision, that person would be allowed to potentially build a 900 square foot unit if they could meet.

926
01:47:59,275 --> 01:48:03,378
[SPEAKER_13]: So are there no lot size considerations for the size of the unit?

927
01:48:03,438 --> 01:48:05,660
[SPEAKER_13]: And I bring it up in the context of considering

928
01:48:07,668 --> 01:48:10,669
[SPEAKER_13]: whether you enlarge the permissible square foot.

929
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:18,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I've lived in 1,000 square feet apartments, and they actually are lovely.

930
01:48:18,311 --> 01:48:19,292
[SPEAKER_13]: They're quite large.

931
01:48:19,752 --> 01:48:28,335
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm wondering, is there any lot size requirement to even permit a 900 square foot unit?

932
01:48:28,895 --> 01:48:31,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So if someone lives on a 4,500 lot size single family,

933
01:48:36,153 --> 01:48:41,695
[SPEAKER_13]: where exactly would 1,000 foot go on that piece of property?

934
01:48:41,935 --> 01:48:42,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Like how would that fit?

935
01:48:46,577 --> 01:48:47,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, thank you for the question.

936
01:48:47,618 --> 01:48:56,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Paola, are you able to speak to that, how lot size of the principal structure would factor in in areas where ABUs per state law should be allowed by rent?

937
01:48:57,141 --> 01:48:59,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I don't mean the square footage of the principal dwelling.

938
01:48:59,923 --> 01:49:01,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean the actual lot size.

939
01:49:02,023 --> 01:49:02,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you.

940
01:49:02,704 --> 01:49:03,384
[SPEAKER_13]: I got that wrong.

941
01:49:05,355 --> 01:49:07,978
[SPEAKER_17]: There are no minimum requirements.

942
01:49:07,998 --> 01:49:15,406
[SPEAKER_17]: So in fact, that is what they consider a don't that we cannot do.

943
01:49:15,426 --> 01:49:19,571
[SPEAKER_17]: So if it fits, maybe it doesn't fit in the 900, but it fits in 600.

944
01:49:21,413 --> 01:49:22,614
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't have to be detached.

945
01:49:22,674 --> 01:49:32,182
[SPEAKER_17]: It can be in the building, so you can have a dormer and you need a different access from the lot.

946
01:49:32,202 --> 01:49:35,485
[SPEAKER_17]: You cannot enter in the same one, so you need a separate access.

947
01:49:35,585 --> 01:49:40,369
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you can make that fit, then you can have the dwelling unit.

948
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:42,491
[SPEAKER_17]: There are no requirements more than

949
01:49:44,153 --> 01:49:52,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Then obviously you will have some requirements for accessory buildings, some setbacks, or the principal building, you need some setbacks.

950
01:49:53,461 --> 01:50:00,486
[SPEAKER_17]: And those will be taken into account, and you need to follow the most permissive one from

951
01:50:01,727 --> 01:50:13,479
[SPEAKER_17]: the residential, single family residential requirements, the district requirements, and the accessory dwelling requirements, accessory structure requirements.

952
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:25,070
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's say that for accessory structures, you need to have site setback of 10 feet and for your principal dwelling, 15.

953
01:50:26,872 --> 01:50:32,257
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to, you can use the accessory dwelling, because that's the most permissive.

954
01:50:33,799 --> 01:50:41,107
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are basically the requirements that they will ask, but then there are no minimum requirements, and it's very flexible.

955
01:50:41,247 --> 01:50:47,734
[SPEAKER_17]: I really recommend everyone to look into what Boston, the guidebook that Boston did on IDUs.

956
01:50:48,595 --> 01:51:08,708
[SPEAKER_17]: They have many, many examples on how can you do an ADU, how you can fit them inside the principal building, in the basement, in the upper roof, that half story, if it's detached or attached, if it's a small lot size or medium or big.

957
01:51:09,048 --> 01:51:11,510
[SPEAKER_17]: They have a very wide range of examples.

958
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:16,993
[SPEAKER_17]: So I recommend everyone that is interested to look at what Boston City did.

959
01:51:17,954 --> 01:51:18,014
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

960
01:51:18,568 --> 01:51:19,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

961
01:51:19,028 --> 01:51:38,712
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it helps just to hear that there are other setbacks and things like that that will be associated with that ADU that have to be met as a decision whether you can go or no go in the first place, whether it's 800 square feet, 600 square feet, or 1,100 square feet if that's permissible.

962
01:51:39,592 --> 01:51:41,712
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what I was trying to get to.

963
01:51:41,732 --> 01:51:44,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

964
01:51:44,953 --> 01:51:46,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for the clarifying question, Judith.

965
01:51:48,525 --> 01:51:50,868
[SPEAKER_16]: You have one minute left if you have any other questions for us tonight.

966
01:51:51,369 --> 01:51:51,989
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm good.

967
01:51:52,650 --> 01:51:52,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm good.

968
01:51:52,991 --> 01:51:53,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

969
01:51:53,451 --> 01:51:55,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

970
01:51:55,193 --> 01:51:56,295
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

971
01:51:56,475 --> 01:52:02,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you to all who gave public comment and asked questions about this topic.

972
01:52:03,424 --> 01:52:05,827
[SPEAKER_16]: So just to quickly recap.

973
01:52:07,259 --> 01:52:10,400
[SPEAKER_16]: We went over what is required of us per the new state law.

974
01:52:11,381 --> 01:52:19,904
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we have discussed potential answers to the questions that are before us as a city, things that we do get some leeway on from the state that are left unanswered.

975
01:52:21,005 --> 01:52:21,505
[SPEAKER_16]: What I heard

976
01:52:22,477 --> 01:52:29,265
[SPEAKER_16]: from the discussion on the question of should we allow ADUs in any residential sub-district and not just those that allow single-family homes by right?

977
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:34,771
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard from my fellow councilors that yes, we do want to see ADUs allowed in all residential sub-districts.

978
01:52:35,312 --> 01:52:37,254
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to have some level of parity.

979
01:52:38,095 --> 01:52:44,137
[SPEAKER_16]: in what's allowed for these different housing types, even across residential sub-district lines.

980
01:52:44,477 --> 01:52:46,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Oops, didn't turn my timer off.

981
01:52:47,597 --> 01:52:52,159
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do wanna see some tailoring and exceptions, especially when we get into the most dense housing types.

982
01:52:53,519 --> 01:53:05,202
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it makes sense for us to receive a recommendation from the zoning consultant along those lines, factoring that in, whether it's certain types of ADUs being allowed on certain housing types,

983
01:53:07,635 --> 01:53:14,921
[SPEAKER_16]: by special permit, depending on the district, along with the recommendations that were made by councilors earlier in the meeting.

984
01:53:16,382 --> 01:53:27,131
[SPEAKER_16]: So more allowance of ADUs across residential areas, but tailoring to make sure that it's appropriate and makes sense with housing stock, especially when you get into those denser housing types.

985
01:53:30,045 --> 01:53:37,708
[SPEAKER_16]: We discussed allowing a second ADU by in residential districts, which residential districts and should it be by special permit.

986
01:53:38,409 --> 01:53:44,411
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like there's an interest in seeing a special permit option and also seeing a little bit of tailoring, depending on that we're not seeing.

987
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:49,253
[SPEAKER_16]: two detached ADUs on one yard.

988
01:53:49,273 --> 01:53:55,419
[SPEAKER_16]: I think all of these should reflect that the CDB should be the special permit granting authority where there is a special permit involved.

989
01:53:56,120 --> 01:54:01,766
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're looking for a little bit of flexibility when it comes to that maximum square footage.

990
01:54:02,086 --> 01:54:03,588
[SPEAKER_16]: You could hear a recommendation there.

991
01:54:05,985 --> 01:54:21,477
[SPEAKER_16]: And it sounds like we would also like to see some information about possible mechanisms within zoning for enforcement of short term rentals of ADUs for if that becomes relevant now or in the future.

992
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:28,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Any additional comment from city councilors or city staff at this time?

993
01:54:31,632 --> 01:54:31,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

994
01:54:32,313 --> 01:54:37,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, thank you so much for kicking us off on these two topics tonight, Paola.

995
01:54:38,058 --> 01:54:38,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Really appreciate it.

996
01:54:38,859 --> 01:54:40,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this was a very substantive discussion.

997
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:45,846
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking forward to seeing an updated

998
01:54:47,328 --> 01:54:49,809
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking forward to our next step when it comes to the commercial framework.

999
01:54:49,849 --> 01:54:54,592
[SPEAKER_16]: And next, we will be dialing in on specific squares and corridors and giving those a granular tailored treatment.

1000
01:54:55,252 --> 01:55:05,938
[SPEAKER_16]: And also look forward to seeing updated draft amendment text for the ADU ordinance to incorporate the new state law and also the local ADU options.

1001
01:55:07,139 --> 01:55:11,101
[SPEAKER_16]: With that, can we quickly review the upcoming schedule before we adjourn?

1002
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:31,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, so it is our first planning and permitting meeting of March.

1003
01:55:32,944 --> 01:55:33,545
[SPEAKER_16]: We discussed

1004
01:55:36,402 --> 01:55:39,524
[SPEAKER_16]: We had our first look at a draft commercial framework earlier tonight.

1005
01:55:39,965 --> 01:55:48,110
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to be focusing next on Medford Square and then West Medford Square and then proceeding along to other corridors.

1006
01:55:48,130 --> 01:55:55,035
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to be taking a really specific look at each of these the same way that we did with Mystic Ave and with Salem Street.

1007
01:55:56,036 --> 01:56:01,119
[SPEAKER_16]: At the same time, we are going to continue talking about updates to the ADU, and we also plan to talk

1008
01:56:03,342 --> 01:56:03,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me start over.

1009
01:56:05,405 --> 01:56:12,255
[SPEAKER_16]: At the same time as we are talking about these geographies, we will also continue talking about these citywide topics, such as ADUs, which we just discussed.

1010
01:56:13,316 --> 01:56:16,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Also included is community solar, nonconforming uses and structures.

1011
01:56:17,322 --> 01:56:24,285
[SPEAKER_16]: By April, we hope to have progressed along to West Medford Square and our discussions of squares and corridors, part of the commercial street framework.

1012
01:56:25,245 --> 01:56:33,428
[SPEAKER_16]: And hopefully by then we'll be able to talk about transportation demand management, site plan review, and neighborhood nodes as another citywide topic.

1013
01:56:34,949 --> 01:56:41,891
[SPEAKER_16]: By May, we hope to be looking at the Wellington slash Glenwood geography and talking about parking.

1014
01:56:45,193 --> 01:56:46,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions on the timeline?

1015
01:56:47,452 --> 01:56:51,094
[SPEAKER_16]: continue to update this as we go along.

1016
01:56:55,577 --> 01:56:55,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1017
01:56:56,398 --> 01:56:57,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, I'll recognize Councilor Lemming.

1018
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:09,245
[SPEAKER_08]: This question, would some of these topics can end up sort of blend, some of the citywide topics can sort of end up blending in with each other.

1019
01:57:09,345 --> 01:57:16,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Would TDM and the parking requirements that kind of like, I feel like those are

1020
01:57:17,503 --> 01:57:18,724
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of end up being related.

1021
01:57:21,005 --> 01:57:36,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So would it be... I'd just like to plant the staff and consultants' opinion on potentially merging the two of those, or if they think it would be best to keep them as separate topics.

1022
01:57:40,698 --> 01:57:49,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we will be looking already into, when we are looking at the neighborhood and the mix, we will be looking already at parking requirements.

1023
01:57:52,009 --> 01:57:57,534
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is a continuous, but then in May is when we will bring the draft and make the suggestions.

1024
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:05,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I do agree that they can be together so we can have TDM and parking requirements in May.

1025
01:58:05,822 --> 01:58:13,347
[SPEAKER_17]: that will give us a little bit more time to, it doesn't mean that we don't explore them before, it's just when we bring the draft, will be that okay?

1026
01:58:14,969 --> 01:58:20,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Because bring in parking before, that would be a little bit too much with the other topics that we will be working on.

1027
01:58:21,293 --> 01:58:22,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1028
01:58:23,594 --> 01:58:34,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd also just like some, I'd also just like information about when one of the internal planning meetings about TDM is going to take place, whenever those are scheduled out in the next month or so.

1029
01:58:37,843 --> 01:58:38,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1030
01:58:39,364 --> 01:58:40,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1031
01:58:40,205 --> 01:58:43,568
[SPEAKER_16]: We will work to work that into the timeline.

1032
01:58:46,511 --> 01:58:46,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1033
01:58:46,771 --> 01:58:48,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all for a substantive discussion tonight.

1034
01:58:50,234 --> 01:58:50,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I hear a motion?

1035
01:58:55,659 --> 01:58:59,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1036
01:59:00,383 --> 01:59:01,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

1037
01:59:05,995 --> 01:59:12,417
[SPEAKER_16]: And while I'm waiting for the clerk, I will just note that we will, like we said, we'll figure out what's going on with civic clerk post haste.

1038
01:59:13,157 --> 01:59:22,640
[SPEAKER_16]: And we will also work to quickly get the zoning page of the website updated with these new topics in progress and all schedule updates will be posted there.

1039
01:59:28,881 --> 01:59:29,422
[SPEAKER_07]: President Behrs?

1040
01:59:30,382 --> 01:59:30,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1041
01:59:31,862 --> 01:59:32,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan?

1042
01:59:33,803 --> 01:59:34,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lemming?

1043
01:59:35,608 --> 01:59:36,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1044
01:59:37,594 --> 01:59:38,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins?

1045
01:59:38,817 --> 01:59:39,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1046
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Four in favor, none opposed.

1047
01:59:41,966 --> 01:59:42,889
[SPEAKER_16]: The meeting is adjourned.

1048
01:59:43,150 --> 01:59:43,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1049
02:00:06,524 --> 02:00:07,327
[SPEAKER_04]: That I want to trust.
