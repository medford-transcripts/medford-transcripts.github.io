13
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:31,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, has everybody had an opportunity to review the minutes for the December meeting?

14
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:41,010
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are no edits to the minute meetings for December 4th, I'd like to request a motion to approve the minutes.

15
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody second?

16
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:48,412

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: Approved.

22
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:57,266
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the January 8th meeting?

23
00:00:57,446 --> 00:01:00,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Did everybody have an opportunity to read January 8th?

24
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:06,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I had an edit, and I'm seeing it might actually have been in... Roberta's last name is spelled incorrectly.

25
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:07,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it might have been in the December I saw up there, but I didn't notice it in the January.

27
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it was there.

28
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back in time.

29
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just see.

30
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:15,951
[SPEAKER_05]: December seems to be right.

31
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:16,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jan...

32
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:22,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this oh, yeah, it's just yeah.

33
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:24,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though December seems to be wrong.

34
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's the typo.

35
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

36
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,141
[SPEAKER_05]: December as well.

37
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:35,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, December as well.

38
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:37,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's January.

39
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:40,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

40
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:41,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I apologize.

41
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:42,944
[SPEAKER_08]: I only got on the January.

42
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:43,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, December.

43
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,199
[SPEAKER_05]: because I copied from the same piece.

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:56,141
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and then, does anybody want to make a motion?

45
00:01:56,161 --> 00:02:02,083
[SPEAKER_05]: May I ask for a motion to request as edited for January 8th, 2025 minutes, meetings?

46
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:04,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do, ma'am.

47
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:06,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody second?

48
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:08,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I second.

49
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, Lisa?

50
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Lisa and minutes are approved as edited.

51
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:25,194
[SPEAKER_05]: The next item on the agenda is the community land trust study focus group session.

52
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:33,136
[SPEAKER_05]: The city is conducting a feasibility study and developing strategic plan for the community land trust in Medford.

53
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,777
[SPEAKER_05]: The study is led by the city's consultants

54
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:44,444
[SPEAKER_05]: J. M. Goldstein, LLC, and is expected to be completed in June, by the end of June, June 30th, 2025.

55
00:02:45,084 --> 00:03:00,357
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of this study, the consultants is facilitating a focus group session with stakeholders including community land trust experts, affordable housing developers, advocacy groups, municipal boards.

56
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Austin Smith from Community Plans from J.M.

57
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:12,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Goldstein-Bolson is here to facilitate a discussion on the Community Land Trust and Affordable Housing with the Board of Trustees.

58
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:15,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Austin, thank you for coming.

59
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for joining us.

60
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:19,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.

61
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:21,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is fun.

62
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:25,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I love working with an owl because you get to see some people sometimes.

63
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:37,990
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in the interest of keeping this casual and more conversational, I'll start off by just introducing myself a little bit.

64
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:46,258
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard a little bit about how this project and how we are meeting what the city was asking for in the RFP.

65
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give a little introduction myself, and then I'd appreciate if we could go around and just say hey to everyone.

66
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:57,935
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

67
00:03:57,955 --> 00:04:00,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, can you hear me?

68
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:01,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can, yep.

69
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:07,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I've been having some problems with my microphone, so stop me at any time if you lose me a bit.

70
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:10,802
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Austin Smith.

71
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:14,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a community planner for land use and long-range planning at JM Goldson.

72
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:21,553
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of a few projects that I'm working on, but it's kind of my secret favorite.

73
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell my other clients.

74
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:33,244
[SPEAKER_01]: But community land trusts and that kind of affordable housing development and community control have been one of my kind of

75
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:40,143
[SPEAKER_01]: personal motivating interests into going into planning in general.

76
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:46,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super excited to be working on this project and hopefully getting another community land trust started in Medford.

77
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:51,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could go around the room and I'll let whoever start.

78
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:58,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Give a brief intro and tell me a little bit about yourself and how you came to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

79
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:02,284
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start this way, I guess, and go around.

80
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:04,164
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, my name is Lisa Ann Davidson.

81
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the chair of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

82
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:10,345
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a new entity.

83
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're in nine months.

84
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:17,466
[SPEAKER_05]: August of 2024 was our first meeting.

85
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:26,808
[SPEAKER_05]: How did I come about on the trust is, I saw an advertisement, and I have been working in the housing industry.

86
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:36,094
[SPEAKER_05]: For quite some time, I've worked with the non-profits in housing the unhoused in the Somerville area.

87
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:49,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Then when I left the non-profit, I started working for the city of Somerville on their housing division, where I serve as the deputy director in working with creating housing.

88
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:52,144
[SPEAKER_05]: This interested me in Medfords.

89
00:05:54,493 --> 00:06:03,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I am Lisa Sun, and I joined also because I saw an advertisement, but I work as an architectural designer.

90
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:14,652
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of my projects are public housing, doing renovation work, decarbonization, so I am really passionate about this area and also

91
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:26,788
[SPEAKER_06]: thinking about how we can make environmental decisions that benefit these communities that typically get shafted in a lot of these projects.

92
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,251
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I'm here.

93
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:35,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Carrie Weaver, and I also saw the advertisement.

94
00:06:37,026 --> 00:07:03,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any background in real estate or anything to that fact, but I grew up in low-income housing, and I just was, I've always been interested in it and trying to bring it into Medford, where I currently live, and also trying to break that cycle with my own family, who seems to be continuing with that, just to see what it involves and things like that.

95
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:07,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Penny Taylor.

96
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the vice chair.

97
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:26,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess I started on housing work, doing community organizing in Union Square and Somerville and helped win the first community benefits agreement for Citywood Developers, which included housing elements.

98
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,753
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was really exciting and

99
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:48,168
[SPEAKER_08]: been involved in organizing in Somerville and Medford and I also work for the City of Somerville in the Office of Housing Stability and I run mostly anti-displacement programs so it's been exciting kind of seeing how the land trust there emerging works with other things we've set up and works really well.

100
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:52,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've also been meeting with your colleague Noah as part of that.

101
00:07:53,032 --> 00:08:01,899
[SPEAKER_08]: other groups, so I'm going to give others a lot of space because I think I've had a lot of opportunities to say what I think about Land Trust, but I'm very happy that we're at this point here in Medford.

102
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:05,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Kayla Lesson.

103
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:14,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I am an attorney with background, don't practice, although I did get to write the declaration this year, which was fun.

104
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:31,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've worked for a mixed income affordable housing developer for 14 years now, working with them on some new developments recently, but mostly before that compliance regulation and refinances.

105
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for that.

106
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:44,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my apologies for calling in remotely today.

107
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:49,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was not coordinated enough to get into City Hall at this time.

108
00:08:49,298 --> 00:09:01,325
[SPEAKER_02]: But Roberta Cameron, member of the Affordable Housing Trust, and I also am chair of the Community Preservation Committee in Medford.

109
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:06,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I helped to run the campaign that got us the Community Preservation Act back in 2015 and have been

110
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:13,710
[SPEAKER_02]: really passionately working in the area of Community Preservation Act ever since.

111
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:23,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I now am the staff person for CPA in Somerville, in addition to my work on the committee in Medford.

112
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:37,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what brought me to serve on the Affordable Housing Trust was wanting to have the opportunity to continue guiding funding on both sides of this program.

113
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,778
[SPEAKER_05]: All of us on the board, right?

114
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:46,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

115
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:47,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can.

116
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:50,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Aditi Mulder.

117
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I staff the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

118
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also the housing planner with the city.

119
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I manage and coordinate the Community Land Trust.

120
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:00,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence, we are here bringing two groups together.

121
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:03,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Austin, for facilitating the discussion.

122
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:13,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I see two folks that are online, maybe members of the general public.

123
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:14,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

124
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:23,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you want to introduce yourself as a member of the public, feel free to do so.

125
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:34,099
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to have a little kind of casual conversation about starting a community land trust in Medford, talk about what it would entail, what the kind of community needs are.

126
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:37,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to participate, that would be great.

127
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:40,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can speak.

128
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:43,597
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matthew and I'm part of the community land trust working group.

129
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:47,263
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to hear what everybody has to say.

130
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:50,148
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll be having report back on Monday at our meeting.

131
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:52,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Matthew.

132
00:10:59,502 --> 00:10:59,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

133
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:02,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we can start.

134
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:12,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what does everyone think their general level of familiarity with community land trust as a concept is?

135
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think there's a kind of a technical thing.

136
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:22,968
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I know there's some folks in the room that are more familiar with housing advocacy and housing policy.

137
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:28,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Where should I start if I were to start describing community land trust?

138
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I start at the beginning?

139
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Get everyone on the same page?

140
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:36,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I would suggest the beginning because this will be posted, right?

141
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:41,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And so members of the community may want to see it and they may not know what a land trust is.

142
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:53,397
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, a community land trust is a nonprofit organization that acquires and holds land for long-term community benefit.

143
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:58,461
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be done in a number of different forms or one of a number of different goals.

144
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:07,287
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some community land trusts that purchase and steward land for the purpose of providing farmland, affordable farmland for people.

145
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,907
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some that just focus on housing.

146
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:16,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some that kind of spread their goals out over a few different kinds of land stewardship.

147
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:24,030
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some CLTs that own parks and gardens and farms and housing and have small business space as well.

148
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:32,412
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a kind of general concept of a nonprofit that holds land for community-driven purposes.

149
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:42,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the CLTs are generally as a nonprofit, they have a board and the board structure is usually 3 parts.

150
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:51,605
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a 3rd or thereabouts that are members of the general community that the community land trust is aiming to be responsible to.

151
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:53,047
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a geographic area.

152
00:12:53,971 --> 00:13:00,537
[SPEAKER_01]: A third of them are usually people that live in the community land trust housing if it's a housing community land trust.

153
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,981
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 3rd are generally community leaders from around the area.

154
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,643
[SPEAKER_01]: These can be elected officials.

155
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:12,347
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be leaders of local nonprofits, local advocates and people like that.

156
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:13,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So it aims to be kind of a.

157
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:27,695
[SPEAKER_01]: A model that is able to pick up on people's interests in the community, both people that are living in the land trusts as it grows and people that are in the outside community or our local leaders.

158
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:47,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of how community land trusts aim to keep housing affordable perpetually, which is different than some other forms of affordable housing stewardship, is that they separate the cost of the land from the cost of the buildings on land.

159
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:56,610
[SPEAKER_01]: So the community land trust holds the land as the nonprofit, and then they're able to either rent out or sell the building on the land.

160
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:11,183
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about how unaffordable housing is, how unaffordable things are basically in this region and in the country, a lot of that is the land value because it's so expensive to buy land.

161
00:14:11,463 --> 00:14:21,972
[SPEAKER_01]: By divorcing the building in the land, the CLT is able to offer homes for purchase that are a fraction of the cost of what they would be on a private market.

162
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:34,027
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually also sold with resale contracts so that given a certain period of time, there's some calculation that limits the amount that a property's value can escalate.

163
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:51,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, a person could buy a home from a community land trust at a discounted rate and then live in it for 10, 15, 20 years and sell it after that and be able to make a certain amount of appreciation that is limited

164
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:54,799
[SPEAKER_01]: with the community land trust.

165
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:11,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the ways in which it aims to find a balance between giving people the ability to accrue that kind of generational wealth, but also limiting it so that they don't get that wealth at the expense of the people coming after them.

166
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:21,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really important piece, and it's one of the kind of very technical aspects that aims to keep a community land trust perpetually below market rate.

167
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense so far?

168
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:43,757
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one of the main maybe confusions or uncertainties people have about community land trusts is they often get confused with CDC.

169
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:54,027
[SPEAKER_01]: corporations, which are another nonprofit that's aimed around usually building affordable housing, sometimes owning it, stewarding it, renting it out.

170
00:15:54,988 --> 00:16:05,238
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, CDCs often function more as developers, and it really depends on what the mission and the bylaws of the

171
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:13,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they often have somewhat of a different, but overlapping purpose, but not necessarily the same.

172
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:22,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Strict purpose of stewarding affordable housing in a community directed way for perpetuity.

173
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:28,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some, some more specificity of a community land trust that they're aiming for that.

174
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:44,037
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also sometimes confusion with municipal affordable housing trusts, because they've both got trust in the name and they're both going for housing, but.

175
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:51,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And you all know that because you're part of the Affordable Housing Trust Board.

176
00:16:52,536 --> 00:17:00,397
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think sometimes in the general public, people think the Community Land Trust, okay, they hold housing or they hold funding or something.

177
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:11,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they're less connected with affordable housing policy, they might think that the Municipal Affordable Housing Trust holds the housing and rents out housing themselves.

178
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, that's not the case.

179
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,040
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an important way in which

180
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:37,919
[SPEAKER_01]: this project through the kind of materials that we'll be creating and the way in which we'll be trying to communicate with the community about the land trust is very specific about it is and what it does and partnerships will be required for the community land trust to get started and to continue flourishing.

181
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you know, getting things started is very expensive.

182
00:17:46,379 --> 00:18:09,855
[SPEAKER_01]: by particularly with changing political priorities and other things like that, having good local support through advocates, through donors, through other nonprofits that can be like a knowledge bank resource and also a funding resource for a community-led trust to get started.

183
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:13,377
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that all sound so far?

184
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone have any questions?

185
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:21,386
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone has questions, please feel free to just shout out.

186
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:23,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question.

187
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:30,069
[SPEAKER_05]: You said the Community Land Trust can hold land for several different reasons.

188
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:48,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it safe to say that what is being investigated here in Somerville is for the Medford Community Land Trust to hold the land for affordable housing, or are you looking at it more broadly and thinking about parks and the other

189
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:53,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

190
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:54,979
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a it's a good question.

191
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:15,678
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of what we What we were responding to in the city's request for proposals was specifically geared towards housing that is a From by design kind of specifically addressed to meet affordable housing needs in Medford and also part of our

192
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:30,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of our contract is to do some financial feasibility work to understand what the community land trust would need in the coming years to really make it a financially feasible venture and actually have some success.

193
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:36,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So, studying other existing that are built around housing that are either.

194
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:44,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, so we couldn't hear you for a few seconds.

195
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:49,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry, getting a new laptop is on my list but I.

196
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:56,453
[SPEAKER_01]: of those maybe next week things often.

197
00:19:57,133 --> 00:20:07,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah part of the focus is really on housing and the financial feasibility of and understanding really what the community land trust would need to be successful.

198
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:14,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it is a community land trust is a non-profit so it's

199
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:19,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I just missed what you said.

200
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:21,360
[SPEAKER_09]: We froze.

201
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Can anyone hear us?

202
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear you.

203
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:25,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

204
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:26,444
[SPEAKER_05]: We got them.

205
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:32,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like we all froze for a minute on our end.

206
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,513
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a couple of public meetings going on here at City Hall, so maybe the broad... Yeah, we're using Wi-Fi instead of LAN.

207
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:53,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And to add to what Austin said, we received a community planning grant from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, which required us to specifically focus on affordable housing.

208
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:56,765
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my educated guess.

209
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,988
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what they say, we want to get it right.

210
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

211
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

212
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:17,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you also said the feasibility, you're going to be looking at like the financial feasibility of what is needed for the affordable housing trust, excuse me, land trust to operate in the city of Medford, correct?

213
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:19,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

214
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:20,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

215
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:22,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.

216
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:42,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder whether the part of the community land trust model could be to hold long-term deed restrictions on properties in the city, however those are acquired.

217
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:53,570
[SPEAKER_02]: and focusing on acquiring land on properties.

218
00:21:56,492 --> 00:21:59,574
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I missed a little bit of the middle of what you said.

219
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you cut out a little bit.

220
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:06,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberta, do you mind if I ask what I think you may have asked?

221
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we freeze it?

222
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:08,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

223
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:21,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I heard Roberta asking whether or not there are going to be affordable housing deed restrictions placed on the properties.

224
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:22,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that it?

225
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:24,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no.

226
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:36,014
[SPEAKER_02]: What I wanted to ask was whether the community land trust could focus on acquiring long-term deed restrictions rather than acquiring land.

227
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:46,591
[SPEAKER_02]: The aim of the community land trust could be to acquire the deed restrictions to make sure that units are affordable.

228
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:49,577
[SPEAKER_02]: However, those deed restrictions are acquired.

229
00:22:52,798 --> 00:23:00,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So the short answer is yes, there is some flexibility in what the community land trust can do.

230
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:11,454
[SPEAKER_01]: The typical form is to hold the land, so there's more kind of community driven control over the entire use and stewardship of the land.

231
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:18,640
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, a CLT can hold just the deed restriction, but not the land.

232
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:38,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the flexibility to their earlier point about what the main focus of the CLT would be is that I think the focus of this study at this moment is geared toward housing.

233
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:46,988
[SPEAKER_01]: But once this project is kind of over, and if the CLT does get started and incorporated as a nonprofit,

234
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:55,035
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be separate from the city and they'll have the power to make their own make and revise their own bylaws and mission statement.

235
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:58,217
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they decide at some point in time, they want to expand to.

236
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:02,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Parks, open space, farming, gardens, playgrounds, et cetera.

237
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:04,523
[SPEAKER_01]: They can do so at that time.

238
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got a follow up question to Roberta's question.

239
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:24,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the community land trust owns land and they build on this land to offer affordable rental units and or affordable first time home buyer units,

240
00:24:25,468 --> 00:24:33,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go for homebuyers because it's easier when those when those units are are sold on the land.

241
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:37,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Those units are sold to the new owner and those that.

242
00:24:39,167 --> 00:25:03,186
[SPEAKER_05]: that unit has a deed restriction and or a deed rider that sort of explains that this is for the purpose of a household making whatever AMI designation it is and that the resale price calculation, there is one sort of what you were saying earlier where there has a calculation.

243
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:04,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't go,

244
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:16,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps the affordability of the unit based on CPI and or any other factors that go into calculating the resale price, right?

245
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:26,905
[SPEAKER_05]: So there would be a deed restriction on the unit that is sold and the owner owns the unit, but the land trust would own the land.

246
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct yeah, so the way it usually works.

247
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:39,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a 99 year lease of the land for some, some kind of nominal upkeep fee.

248
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:43,677
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the other rest of the cost is just the building itself.

249
00:25:44,057 --> 00:25:44,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

250
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:51,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my knowledge, different community land trusts do it in slightly different ways.

251
00:25:52,242 --> 00:26:01,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can be something that's catered to Medford's situation, like the specific resale value formula.

252
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:32,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question, as part of the feasibility study, will you be providing us with perhaps models or examples of the legal language, legal instruments that some different community land trusts are using?

253
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:39,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel as though that could be helpful to kind of understand how these sites might be structured.

254
00:26:41,953 --> 00:26:42,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

255
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:56,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been in conversations with several different existing community land trusts in the region, and it's a really great community because everybody is kind of coming from a policy and advocacy space, and they're very eager to share.

256
00:26:57,598 --> 00:27:03,480
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the conversations that we've had have been very fruitful and have been sharing their

257
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:12,885
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of their spreadsheets and their draft language and their bylaws and things like that.

258
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:19,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So that all, I mean, as their nonprofits, a lot of that is kind of very accessible on their websites.

259
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:30,477
[SPEAKER_01]: But the more detailed is something that we're looking into in the near future.

260
00:27:30,497 --> 00:27:30,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

261
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:36,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another follow-up question.

262
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:45,969
[SPEAKER_05]: The land trust, the Medford Land Trust, I know you're early on and you're just sort of kind of grabbing and investigating right now.

263
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:51,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Focused on home ownership or rental?

264
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:57,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you leaning towards one more so than the other or open for either?

265
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:05,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So and as far as I'm aware, the status now is that it's still kind of being narrowed down.

266
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're.

267
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Stage where they really want to say certainty with certainty that they only want to do 1 specific thing.

268
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:21,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of that self definition is still still ongoing.

269
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:24,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And could evolve, of course, too, if.

270
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:25,107
[SPEAKER_01]: If.

271
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:40,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of it depends on the support, the potential support that the community land trust would receive from important people and groups in town.

272
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:51,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's something that the affordable housing trust fund or the CBC, for example, is going to dedicate through their goals and their funding, then

273
00:28:54,229 --> 00:29:05,598
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the partnership that if it's if it's within the goals of the organizations that are looking to do some funding, then I think there's some congruence with what the CLT could be.

274
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:11,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be doing that specifically if there's like amounts of money that are for specific purposes.

275
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:17,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of that will come up when the time is right.

276
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:38,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if there's a specific parcel that the CPC or the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is looking to buy, and that comes up quickly, and the CLT doesn't have the money to purchase it themselves, they could be conveyed parcels at different points in time for different purposes.

277
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:45,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of it is the goal of the CLT would be to have some continuity.

278
00:29:47,911 --> 00:30:01,783
[SPEAKER_01]: If a building is purchased and it is like an ownership building, it's probably likely that it would be kept that way just as an anti-displacement and kind of just drama minimization effort.

279
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:04,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

280
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:30,960
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I want to kind of open it up to what you all think are the most urgent needs in Medford's affordable housing landscape.

281
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:39,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of it, we're in like the policy space, sometimes we get so focused on

282
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:43,628
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers and the AMIs and the census data.

283
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:59,336
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, I think, so much more that a community organization that's kind of directly responsible to people in Bedford can do than just target specific AMI groups or respond to specific needs that are visible in census data.

284
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:05,279
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm, my question is a little more broad about what you think are kind of the most targeted,

285
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,623
[SPEAKER_01]: needs in terms of affordable housing?

286
00:31:09,663 --> 00:31:14,910
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very broad question, but I do want to open it up to really get your feedback on this.

287
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody want to go before me?

288
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:19,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have thoughts.

289
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:19,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberta?

290
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:24,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll jump in.

291
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:24,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

292
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:52,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what what prompted the first question that I asked was that in looking at the data that we're preparing for the housing trust action plan, one of the populations that we've identified that has really like very stark needs for to address is low income

293
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:55,016
[SPEAKER_02]: elderly homeowners.

294
00:31:56,396 --> 00:32:02,800
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a population that is experiencing increasing housing cost burden.

295
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:12,945
[SPEAKER_02]: They bought houses in Medford when Medford was a relatively affordable community and their incomes have stayed the same while their homes have

296
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,865
[SPEAKER_02]: many, many times over increased in value.

297
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:30,054
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a large population in Medford, something like 30 percent of our homes are owned by low-income elderly homeowners.

298
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:36,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to go back and look at the data to get the number exactly, but it's a surprisingly large number.

299
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:42,363
[SPEAKER_02]: The two groups that jump out is that group and also

300
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:53,904
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who can't even move into Medford are the median income of renters is going up way faster than statewide.

301
00:32:54,344 --> 00:33:06,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is because it requires such a high income to enter Medford as a renter that anyone who doesn't make that income can't

302
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:09,919
[SPEAKER_02]: come into Medford or they're being displaced and pushed out.

303
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the two things that really jump out.

304
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:24,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, running into people all the time who work in Medford and can't figure out how to live in commutable distance to their jobs.

305
00:33:34,658 --> 00:33:39,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think my thoughts are on the record, but I'll just say a couple quick things.

306
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:47,602
[SPEAKER_08]: So I love a combination of organized tenant group and community land trust power combo.

307
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:51,343
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do know I've been super excited by organizing happening in Medford.

308
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:56,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there are buildings where tenants are coming together to push against rent.

309
00:33:56,764 --> 00:33:57,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Hikes and things like that.

310
00:33:58,406 --> 00:34:05,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I really do love land trust acquiring rental situations and then not displacing the tenants and everyone.

311
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:06,855
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like seems like such a win win.

312
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:08,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I also

313
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:18,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, I think preserving some of our, like, there's a lot of, or there's still some naturally occurring affordable housing in Medford.

314
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:32,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And so thinking about, I guess it kind of goes along with the tenant organizing, like, buildings that exist that haven't, the rent hasn't gone through the roof, like, how to keep it that way, or kind of keep it so the folks that live there can keep living there.

315
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:33,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just throw those in.

316
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:39,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I'll piggyback on both Roberta and Penny.

317
00:34:39,216 --> 00:35:01,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll add, it's hard for me not to think about AMI levels, knowing what the city of Medford's inclusionary starts at 50, 80% AMI, which is a high percent leaving out so many residents who are not making the 80% AMI.

318
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:06,456
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at other communities is starting at 50% AMI.

319
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:11,197
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking at, I look at, I'm sorry, I'm a numbers person.

320
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:26,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at it and I'm going into the affordable, when I'm thinking about affordable rents and how people, how residents or renters, the ideal is not to pay more than 30% of your income towards rent.

321
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:40,063
[SPEAKER_05]: You're living in the lap of luxury if you are paying 30% or less in rent if you're not living in subsidized housing.

322
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:43,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we need to get there.

323
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:46,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do think that we need to focus on that.

324
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:57,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the data as well as Roberta does, but families need to have family units that are safe

325
00:35:57,957 --> 00:36:23,478
[SPEAKER_05]: affordable family units and a new construction and making sure that they're thought of when we're building all of these new constructions or we're thinking about new buildings and developments and making sure that we get those households that are below 80 percent of AMI.

326
00:36:25,803 --> 00:36:28,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Roberta.

327
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:33,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you wanted not to stick with the AMIs and stuff like that, but it really is.

328
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:40,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the income levels that people are struggling with, and I would love to see more housing that way.

329
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:45,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you, Lisa and Penny.

330
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:57,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to echo the need for family housing, which is driven by the fact that right now our rental housing stock is priced per bedroom.

331
00:36:58,506 --> 00:37:07,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So the families cannot afford to occupy housing units when every bedroom is

332
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:17,477
[SPEAKER_02]: valued at what a middle income individual working person can afford.

333
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:30,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you're trying to house people who aren't middle income working adults, then you are at a disadvantage in the housing market.

334
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:39,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to give special attention to being able to house families.

335
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:53,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And just building more two and three bedroom units doesn't do it because more roommates are going to occupy two and three bedroom units without putting some kind of control on this.

336
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:02,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the audio cut off and I spoke over you a little bit.

337
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:11,535
[SPEAKER_06]: But on a different note, I don't know exactly how connected our community is.

338
00:38:11,595 --> 00:38:18,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't looked very closely at public transit bypass at all, but I think it's really important to make sure that

339
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:31,925
[SPEAKER_06]: A land trust is has property or is located in a place where the people who live there are well connected via multiple modes of transportation.

340
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:35,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like a lot of public housing or affordable housing.

341
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I see is.

342
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:50,999
[SPEAKER_06]: a little out of the ways and hard to connect with parts of the city and hard for them to be involved with the businesses when things are happening in the city.

343
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, that's something I personally think is important.

344
00:38:56,184 --> 00:39:00,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what priority that is to Medford itself.

345
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:18,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it is important, and I add on grocery shopping, because if somebody doesn't have a car and trying to get into getting their grocery shoppings can be difficult on a public transportation, so those two.

346
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:24,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can definitely understand.

347
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:26,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the points that were made.

348
00:39:26,953 --> 00:39:34,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I live with my partner and we made in a family size unit because we couldn't find a one bedroom that was affordable to us.

349
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:44,723
[SPEAKER_01]: see house and have a roommate to help balance it out, just because we couldn't find someplace that was more our size.

350
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:51,565
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem down where I live in Dorchester too, just as it is just nearly everywhere.

351
00:39:53,805 --> 00:40:01,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate the reference to the needs of elderly low-income homeowners.

352
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:02,948
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge issue.

353
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,811
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so difficult to deal with.

354
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:39,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a really powerful way that a community land trust could help support elderly and long-term homeowners just in terms of anti-displacement and being able to age where they are, if it's a unit that really is kind of meeting their needs in terms of accessibility and everything like that, is that they could sell their home to the CLT.

355
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:55,112
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it would kind of function as a leaseback program where they could then be given a reduced rent for the next 10, 15, 20 years or so, because that's something that the CLT would be able to offer.

356
00:40:55,753 --> 00:41:08,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that would require a heavy amount of subsidy, but would be one of those things that when the unit does turn over, that that affordability could be passed on, and it would be more

357
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:13,923
[SPEAKER_01]: than short-term assistance programs and things like that.

358
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:27,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those kind of targeted anti-displacement application programs that function as leasebacks are really a powerful way that a community land trust can operate in those kind of circumstances.

359
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,680
[SPEAKER_06]: question about what you just said.

360
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:38,902
[SPEAKER_06]: This might be implied, but you said that they could pay rent to the CLT after they sell their home to the CLT.

361
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:49,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Could they sell their home or sell the land but keep their home within that structure?

362
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:49,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

363
00:41:50,286 --> 00:41:50,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

364
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:56,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be a rental situation or it could be retaining ownership on the house itself.

365
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:10,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be like some two-step process where they technically sell the house and land, then purchase the house back at whatever discounted rate.

366
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:19,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly what technical steps in that process would be, but yeah, it could be rental, it could be ownership.

367
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:19,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

368
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:45,250
[SPEAKER_02]: My vision and the reason that I asked the question before is that I wondered whether they could just sell a long-term deed restriction and maintain ownership of the land and their property, but selling a long-term deed restriction would make it permanently affordable and give them cash.

369
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,974
[SPEAKER_02]: to live on to meet their cash needs in the short term.

370
00:42:51,994 --> 00:43:00,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would reduce their property tax bill because the house would be not valued as high as an affordable unit.

371
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:06,664
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would meet all of those objectives and maybe require less cash than actually acquiring the property.

372
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:11,847
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm also swayed by Penny's point that focusing on

373
00:43:12,768 --> 00:43:21,538
[SPEAKER_02]: apartment buildings might help a lot more people with per dollar invested in a unit.

374
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would be a lower dollar per unit investment to be able to help a lot more people.

375
00:43:30,822 --> 00:43:32,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I agree.

376
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:57,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think both of the situations that we're talking about with elderly low income homeowners and like tenants associations in a building are kind of like specific opportunities that would come about even suddenly and would require, I guess, to make that kind of action.

377
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:06,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I heard that with the proposed that we just was talking about acquiring the

378
00:44:26,191 --> 00:44:33,038
[SPEAKER_05]: trust or the CPC and maybe not the SCL or Medford Community Land Trust.

379
00:44:33,078 --> 00:44:33,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what I heard?

380
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:35,321
[SPEAKER_05]: You broke out a little bit.

381
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard trust and CPA, CPC.

382
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:41,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

383
00:44:41,456 --> 00:44:46,518
[SPEAKER_01]: The new laptop is moving right to the top of my list.

384
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:49,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having trouble earlier today, too, so I'm sorry about that.

385
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the point generally that I was trying to make is that I think those situations sometimes come up fairly suddenly.

386
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:08,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if an apartment building owner is looking to sell, like if my landlord was suddenly looking to sell the house, it might be a short-term thing, and I would be hoping that there would be

387
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:20,416
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of entity with the ability to marshal funding quickly, which is probably not a young community land trust.

388
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:37,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's perhaps not even an older established community land trust, but it's more like a community preservation committee or an affordable housing trust fund that has more funding built up more dependably and is able to

389
00:45:39,262 --> 00:45:46,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, marshal it a little more quickly and when those situations come up.

390
00:45:47,329 --> 00:46:07,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Just throwing out there as you're thinking about the planning process and implementation, very similar to another program that I know of is that the CDC was going to owners of properties and say, hey, here we are, if you're interested in buying.

391
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:11,966
[SPEAKER_05]: in selling and maintaining affordability.

392
00:46:12,366 --> 00:46:14,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you sell to us.

393
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:21,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way it's not coming up at the time in the market and trying to build a plane as it's flying.

394
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:28,172
[SPEAKER_05]: You can start the conversations with these larger rental or even smaller.

395
00:46:28,992 --> 00:46:46,802
[SPEAKER_05]: owners and selling to the community land trust who may be interested in affordable housing and have the luxury of time to be able to work out the details about how it would work selling the property to a community land trust.

396
00:46:50,082 --> 00:46:51,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's a very good point.

397
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:52,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Um.

398
00:46:53,163 --> 00:47:06,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think some people, I mean, especially, like, in the advocate space, when people that are advocates and also on their own, they're often very interested in making that kind of contribution.

399
00:47:06,307 --> 00:47:08,507
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that came up just the other day.

400
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:11,248
[SPEAKER_01]: We were conducting an interview with someone that.

401
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:25,973
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of works more in the advocate space in some of the moment for, um, and he said that his, that he's a part of gets those kind of, those kind of like emails sometimes like, Hey, we want to sell our house.

402
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:30,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there someone that is looking to buy it or some entity that's looking to buy it?

403
00:47:30,735 --> 00:47:35,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is there a community land trust we could sell it to kind of questions like that?

404
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:37,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, those situations definitely come up.

405
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:59,791
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question I have that I'd like to get some of your feedback on is what you think the biggest challenges would be for the community land trust getting started specifically?

406
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:01,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Money.

407
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:05,496
[SPEAKER_05]: The word right out of my mouth, Roberta.

408
00:48:10,323 --> 00:48:12,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think competition, right?

409
00:48:12,825 --> 00:48:25,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Competition, it's a very small, not small market, but it's relatively small pieces that you're going to be looking for and competing with people for those pieces will be very difficult.

410
00:48:25,593 --> 00:48:25,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

411
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:35,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, CLT comes before the Affordable Housing Trust, so CLT would be competing with other CDCs to solicit bids.

412
00:48:36,452 --> 00:48:42,525
[SPEAKER_05]: You're also competing against the market price and weigh in if somebody sells.

413
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:45,211
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to buy something in the market,

414
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:52,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if the real estate market is slowing down as much as people think it is slowing down, but let's say it is.

415
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:55,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say it's not.

416
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Like somebody puts their, you've got to be able to act quickly.

417
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:11,319
[SPEAKER_05]: So have it, and finding the funding, securing private funding in addition to what other public funding that may be available.

418
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:24,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Assisted because as far as I know in my experience working in the housing industry is usually you're not going to get all public funding to acquire a property.

419
00:49:24,285 --> 00:49:27,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So the ability to secure private funds as well.

420
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:32,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll add another.

421
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:34,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

422
00:49:35,566 --> 00:49:36,867
[SPEAKER_05]: No, go ahead, Roberta.

423
00:49:36,887 --> 00:50:00,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll add another challenge that is not about money or competition, but that is that Medford doesn't have the background, the population of nonprofits and advocates that some other communities have.

424
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:16,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being able to create something from scratch in a community that has been historically disengaged in this arena is going to be very challenging.

425
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:20,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I underestimate our potential.

426
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:24,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there are people who are waiting to burst out of the woodwork, but I

427
00:50:27,872 --> 00:50:34,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I have concerns about our ability to find people to carry this torch.

428
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:42,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.

429
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Volunteer capacity is 1 of those, like.

430
00:50:45,757 --> 00:50:49,518
[SPEAKER_01]: The toughest nuts to crack, especially when it's something.

431
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:59,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like volunteers to be on the board and to be canvassing, to be helping prepare engagement materials and things like that.

432
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:01,898
[SPEAKER_01]: All the pieces that have to come together.

433
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:04,621
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long, long-term thing.

434
00:51:06,002 --> 00:51:17,433
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's either that there needs to be some people that are in it for 20, 30 years that really carry it through, or there needs to be enough people

435
00:51:22,637 --> 00:51:24,799
[SPEAKER_01]: supported in the same amount of energy.

436
00:51:27,281 --> 00:51:44,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It's volunteer capacity, and it's also relationships between nonprofit organizations, you know, and relationships among advocacy groups that are lacking here.

437
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:57,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So Roberta, are you referring to like developers, the lack of the, like you might see the community land trust as not necessarily a developer.

438
00:51:57,506 --> 00:52:07,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they purchased a vacant land, then they would have to try to work with a developer in order to develop that land for affordable housing.

439
00:52:08,035 --> 00:52:09,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you're referring to?

440
00:52:10,028 --> 00:52:10,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

441
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:22,997
[SPEAKER_02]: That or maybe something that I don't even imagine, but we just don't have an ecosystem of non-profits that exists elsewhere to support each other in this work.

442
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:27,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Then this is a public meeting.

443
00:52:27,401 --> 00:52:34,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see somebody write something in the chat and there's different rules around chats in public meetings.

444
00:52:35,546 --> 00:52:38,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Matthew, would you like to share what you commented just now?

445
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:45,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess, Roberta, does that reflect what you were saying?

446
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:52,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my understanding was you were referring more to CDCs, institutional organizations that could do real advocacy work rather than just a lack of volunteers.

447
00:52:53,124 --> 00:53:01,869
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly have volunteers in the city, but it doesn't seem like we have a real big infrastructure, a non-governmental infrastructure to do a lot of this advocacy work.

448
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:04,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

449
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I really feel it's both, but I appreciate that.

450
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:13,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear us?

451
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:15,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear us?

452
00:53:15,555 --> 00:53:16,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

453
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:19,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Something just happened on our screen over here.

454
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:22,519
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like we got logged out, but we're good.

455
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:28,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Keeping up with the agenda and time, we have another two, three minutes to wrap up, if you don't mind.

456
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really appreciate this conversation with you all.

457
00:53:33,492 --> 00:53:36,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody, I won't take too much of the time.

458
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:45,421
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone has any last thoughts that they really want to get out to you all in the group or to let me know about something important, you all have the floor.

459
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:52,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Hands go up.

460
00:53:56,274 --> 00:54:06,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess I don't see any hands up, so I'm just going to say thank you for coming and talking to us about the Medford Community Land Trust.

461
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:12,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep getting, like you said, Affordable Housing Trust and Community Land Trust is way too much.

462
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:15,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you for coming and talking to us.

463
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:16,303
[SPEAKER_05]: We look forward to hearing more.

464
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you so much for all for making the time.

465
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:23,352
[SPEAKER_01]: So my email is austin.jmgolson.com.

466
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:27,013
[SPEAKER_01]: The project manager is noah.jmgolson.com.

467
00:54:27,393 --> 00:54:30,614
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can shoot either of us an email at any time.

468
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:36,255
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here, we're happy to chat, happy to listen, and really appreciate you all making the time tonight.

469
00:54:37,216 --> 00:54:40,056
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can share your contact with the Board of Trustees.

470
00:54:41,297 --> 00:54:41,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

471
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:42,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

472
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:43,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night, y'all.

473
00:54:44,278 --> 00:54:44,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

474
00:54:44,898 --> 00:54:45,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye bye.

475
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:57,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the next item on our agenda here is the working group updates, the trust action plan.

476
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:03,829
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the focus group session updates, and then we have a community meeting updates.

477
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:05,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you wanna?

478
00:55:07,031 --> 00:55:15,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm making sure that Roberta and members of the public have access to this.

479
00:55:17,372 --> 00:55:25,059
[SPEAKER_09]: So some key takeaways from the focus group session that was conducted on January 17th.

480
00:55:27,201 --> 00:55:33,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I think securing affordable housing funding on time was highlighted, making sure that.

481
00:55:34,408 --> 00:55:52,193
[SPEAKER_09]: The projects receive funding on time to apply for state funds and ensuring that the trust provides on rolling basis applications rather than having a stipulated application window for affordable housing developers to apply.

482
00:55:55,395 --> 00:56:10,252
[SPEAKER_09]: There were discussions about how to incentivize affordable housing developers to come to Medford, but I think clearly nobody discussed what those incentives would look like, but they said that's really important.

483
00:56:10,272 --> 00:56:10,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

484
00:56:14,016 --> 00:56:34,792
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of conversations about studying city-owned parcels, specifically doing the feasibility analysis and then issuing an RFP and also making sure that the community is engaged during the entire process so that the developers do not have to spend more time making sure that the project gets accepted on time.

485
00:56:36,174 --> 00:56:49,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Newton had an example of how – sorry, Newton did have an example, but Hudson was cited as an example, which is in the next point.

486
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:51,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I moving?

487
00:56:51,865 --> 00:56:52,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

488
00:56:54,328 --> 00:57:11,067
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fourth point that was discussed was what is the role of the Affordable Housing Trust because Somerville acts mainly as a municipal entity that's a municipal banking entity which provides funds, but Newton, I think, focuses on

489
00:57:12,508 --> 00:57:19,069
[SPEAKER_09]: feasibility of city-owned parcels and then issuing RFPs as well as providing funds.

490
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:28,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Would a trust also include advocacy policies as one of their primary roles or would it just be a financial provider?

491
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:33,912
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that our trust should also outline.

492
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:40,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the fifth point was cost of creating affordable housing units.

493
00:57:41,052 --> 00:58:01,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the participants mentioned that it's about $500,000 to $700,000 per unit, and there is a lack of awareness among the community as to what is the actual cost of developing affordable housing units, and if the trust could sort of educate the community around this issue was also discussed.

494
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,297
[SPEAKER_09]: The sixth point was funding strategies to support affordable housing.

495
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:11,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the focus was on how rental housing can apply for LIHTC.

496
00:58:12,203 --> 00:58:22,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the affordable housing funds could help support home ownership units because rental unit projects could apply for LIHTC.

497
00:58:22,873 --> 00:58:26,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is one of the strategies that the participants discussed.

498
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:33,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And the seventh one was exploring strategies for affordable housing development.

499
00:58:33,412 --> 00:58:40,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think the city-owned parcels being RFPed was discussed.

500
00:58:41,238 --> 00:58:44,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, looked like that was one of the main ideas.

501
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:51,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second one was partnering with local housing authorities to identify any projects that they would want to develop.

502
00:58:53,808 --> 00:58:53,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

503
00:58:55,093 --> 00:58:58,495
[SPEAKER_09]: These are some of the key highlights of the focus group's discussion.

504
00:58:58,895 --> 00:59:05,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I can just add an asterisk, LIHTC is low income, low, wait a minute.

505
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Low income housing tax credit.

506
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

507
00:59:11,742 --> 00:59:14,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in case anybody took over this.

508
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thanks.

509
00:59:19,128 --> 00:59:24,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to do a quick update on the community meeting updates, which is.

510
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:34,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Penny, myself, and Roberta, we met recently and we're talking about our next community meeting.

511
00:59:34,423 --> 00:59:35,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

512
00:59:36,665 --> 00:59:39,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Aditi, for doing this beautiful flyer.

513
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:46,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We are trying to do our community meeting on November, not November, March 5th.

514
00:59:52,214 --> 01:00:01,983
[SPEAKER_05]: At the D. P. W. Roberta any do you want to provide any more information on that, or I can kick it off and then can fill in some detail.

515
01:00:02,023 --> 01:00:06,126
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are holding it at the time of our next of our March meeting.

516
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:08,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So you might notice that you already have that time blocked off.

517
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:09,829
[SPEAKER_08]: That was intentional.

518
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:10,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

519
01:00:12,031 --> 01:00:34,690
[SPEAKER_08]: uh effectively this is the next step in our plan we did some stakeholder meetings and now we're in a community meeting and kind of both introducing ourselves and what we can do and getting presenting some of the information we've gathered so far and then really mostly asking for feedback um and so there's a couple different ways that um we're thinking folks can participate and contribute so um

520
01:00:36,691 --> 01:00:47,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't there for the drafting, but there is a really great survey that we put together that we're going to launch with promotion of this community meeting so people can start responding right away.

521
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:50,389
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's going to be a QR code there.

522
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:58,064
[SPEAKER_08]: encourage people to actually come to the meeting and participate in that as well.

523
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:09,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the meeting itself, we'll do a little short survey just to understand like who's in the room and participating that way to capture some capturing information in a bunch of different ways from the community.

524
01:01:09,768 --> 01:01:09,808
[SPEAKER_08]: So

525
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:22,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a very important thing is for all of us to invite our people and networks and share the good word to come to this meeting and to do the survey.

526
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:32,611
[SPEAKER_08]: So if someone can't attend, please contribute ideas through the survey, because that will really just be a huge bulk of information on what the community wants to see us do.

527
01:01:34,673 --> 01:01:37,214
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, at the meeting, we'll give the context of what we can actually do.

528
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:42,715
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, you know, some things could be pie in the sky that we can't take on, but it would be good to know.

529
01:01:42,735 --> 01:01:47,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I think just what's in the ether that people are wanting to see.

530
01:01:50,037 --> 01:01:52,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, we have really great support from the city.

531
01:01:52,577 --> 01:01:54,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just say from the planning process, both in terms of.

532
01:01:55,418 --> 01:02:00,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Translating the flyer and the survey and all the city languages and helping with promotion.

533
01:02:00,605 --> 01:02:09,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but again, I really, uh, promise to get us all the PDFs so you can share them out to our groups and post them up in the hallways and things like that.

534
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:10,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

535
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:26,139
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it'll be really great and I, you know, we're going to, we have all the stakeholder feedback but instead of sitting around down and be like these other people said this, it's going to be kind of the data overview that Roberta has prepared and then mostly getting feedback.

536
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited.

537
01:02:29,301 --> 01:02:31,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's about 40 person room.

538
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:39,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's try to fill it up and really get the survey in everybody's hands, regardless of if they can show up or not.

539
01:02:39,286 --> 01:02:41,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So next month instead of coming here.

540
01:02:41,787 --> 01:02:42,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

541
01:02:42,627 --> 01:02:43,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And we haven't.

542
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:53,722
[SPEAKER_09]: begun the promotion yet because I was just waiting for the short survey to be ready and just an hour ago, I received the translations.

543
01:02:54,142 --> 01:03:01,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So once that's ready, I'll generate a QR code and hopefully by end of this week, we'll begin the promotion and I'll share it with all of you.

544
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:02,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

545
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:05,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I guess just to remind everyone.

546
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:14,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So the timeline involves like another community meeting a couple months out from that once things are drafted and then we're kind of presenting like, can we listen to all of this and then here's what we heard.

547
01:03:14,372 --> 01:03:22,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this is kind of the big info gathering with like, also, their first like introducing ourselves to the community I think it's pretty exciting.

548
01:03:25,717 --> 01:03:36,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a lot happening at once, but I think we've set up a couple different converting the word streams of involvement for people to jump into and tell us what's on their mind.

549
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:39,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So outreach is key.

550
01:03:39,907 --> 01:03:44,030
[SPEAKER_08]: So please, please invite folks, everybody, neighbors.

551
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:51,935
[SPEAKER_09]: We have translations in four different languages, Haitian, Creole, Brazilian, Portuguese, Spanish, and then Arabic.

552
01:03:52,836 --> 01:04:00,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the CD board meeting is also on the same day at 6.30 PM, and I'm not sure they might be discussing Salem Street Corridor.

553
01:04:00,784 --> 01:04:05,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure yet, so we'll have to figure out how to.

554
01:04:07,324 --> 01:04:09,165
[SPEAKER_03]: make the promotions right.

555
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:14,867
[SPEAKER_09]: It's at 6.30, but the schedule is not ready yet, so I'm not sure what's on the agenda.

556
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:19,469
[SPEAKER_08]: The survey is evergreen or it will be open.

557
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:29,933
[SPEAKER_05]: All the more reason to get people to participate in our survey, so if they can't be there physically, at least their voices can be heard through the survey.

558
01:04:30,213 --> 01:04:32,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Or they could attend the first half of the community meeting.

559
01:04:32,714 --> 01:04:33,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Jan's had 30 minutes.

560
01:04:37,535 --> 01:04:51,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Roberta, we can also make sure that our meeting is broadcast on our cable media afterwards so that people can see the presentation, even if they aren't able to come to the meeting.

561
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:56,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Because taking the survey will be extremely helpful to get that input from people.

562
01:04:56,803 --> 01:05:05,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that the survey will also, I mean, the presentation will be informative and would love for people to get that message.

563
01:05:05,807 --> 01:05:14,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if there's any way that we can promote that and make extra sure that the presentation gets broadcast.

564
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:21,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that looks like both promoting that and keeping the survey open for like a week afterwards.

565
01:05:21,771 --> 01:05:25,212
[SPEAKER_08]: People can watch it and then take the survey or something like that and determine.

566
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Will the city have physical flyers with the grounds?

567
01:05:30,486 --> 01:05:31,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes, yes.

568
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:33,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully by end of this week.

569
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:34,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

570
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:41,354
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just wondering what's the best way to hand over the physical flyers to all of you?

571
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:45,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the next meeting is when the community meeting is going to be.

572
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:46,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us when to pick them up.

573
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:47,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

574
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay if you email it to me.

575
01:05:51,402 --> 01:05:51,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

576
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:55,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine with getting it printed and kind of putting it out that way.

577
01:05:56,466 --> 01:06:00,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to just send soft copies and then the physical copies will be here.

578
01:06:00,267 --> 01:06:02,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever you're free, you can come and collect it.

579
01:06:02,308 --> 01:06:03,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

580
01:06:03,548 --> 01:06:03,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

581
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:06,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberta, did you want to add anything?

582
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:07,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we miss anything?

583
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:15,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did a great job of describing the public engagement for this.

584
01:06:16,591 --> 01:06:21,013
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that I would go back to is our schedule for

585
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:33,203
[SPEAKER_02]: for the action plan and our entire board's work will be after this meeting next month.

586
01:06:33,784 --> 01:06:42,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll spend the next couple of months after that, however long it takes, going through what will be the meat of the action plan.

587
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:54,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we've been gathering input from the stakeholders, doing this data collection, learning from P. D. S. what they have been doing for housing policy in the last.

588
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:03,490
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years, and then we'll be getting all of this public input.

589
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:17,555
[SPEAKER_02]: In our April, May, possibly June meetings, we'll be working together as a whole group to develop the plan based on all of those inputs.

590
01:07:19,056 --> 01:07:25,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll come back and have a second public meeting after that to present the draft of what we come up with together.

591
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:29,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

592
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:29,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

593
01:07:30,016 --> 01:07:31,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have any questions?

594
01:07:33,558 --> 01:07:36,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to thank the DT again for all the coordinating work you've done.

595
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:41,244
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

596
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:45,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Lisa, Penny, and Roberta have been very helpful.

597
01:07:46,048 --> 01:07:51,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta sent us the survey and then it was just easy to transfer that survey to other languages.

598
01:07:55,206 --> 01:08:03,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And the next item, excuse me, the next item on our agenda is funding, I can't read your scribble, for affordable housing.

599
01:08:03,933 --> 01:08:05,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Aditi, you wanna?

600
01:08:05,394 --> 01:08:07,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's go.

601
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:12,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the city council approved 250,000 CPA funds.

602
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:18,865
[SPEAKER_09]: So yay, we're gonna open our trust fund account finally and have $250,000 soon.

603
01:08:23,244 --> 01:08:23,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

604
01:08:24,005 --> 01:08:26,288
[SPEAKER_05]: With that, refresh my memory.

605
01:08:26,308 --> 01:08:38,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I did remember seeing that when we got the announcement that we'll be signing an MOU with the CPC, correct?

606
01:08:38,425 --> 01:08:38,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

607
01:08:39,006 --> 01:08:39,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

608
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:39,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

609
01:08:41,563 --> 01:08:58,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the next item under funding for affordable housing is strategies to identify funds for the nexus study discussion on transfer and conveyance of the McCormick Avenue parcels.

610
01:08:58,654 --> 01:08:59,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Penny, do you want to?

611
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:06,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can kick off the, so at our last meeting, I believe it was the mayor presented the idea of

612
01:09:11,138 --> 01:09:13,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, thank you.

613
01:09:13,179 --> 01:09:24,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Transfer and authorizing a couple parcels of land the city owns that, as I understood, were kind of in difficult to develop places, basically selling the land and giving the money to the land trust.

614
01:09:25,722 --> 01:09:27,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the land trust, giving the money to us.

615
01:09:27,282 --> 01:09:31,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all trust confused now.

616
01:09:31,303 --> 01:09:37,585
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was this, it was the city council topic, and I guess

617
01:09:38,265 --> 01:09:44,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw like half the meeting and was curious about an update and where that's at.

618
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:46,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

619
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:49,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for providing this request.

620
01:09:49,678 --> 01:09:54,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is the request that went before the city council from the mayor's office.

621
01:09:55,985 --> 01:10:00,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the main topic of the discussion was the language that's included in the request.

622
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:07,636
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't clearly outline that the proceeds from this parcel will support affordable housing trust fund.

623
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:15,363
[SPEAKER_09]: It just says it supports affordable housing and also city property to

624
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:21,732
[SPEAKER_09]: for the benefit of city property to generate taxes.

625
01:10:22,032 --> 01:10:25,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what the other language is.

626
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:33,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Having these two separate languages in the document, the city council was not sure how exactly these funds would be appropriated.

627
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:37,961
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that the city council wanted to clarify.

628
01:10:38,381 --> 01:10:44,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Would this directly go to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund or would it be used for other purposes?

629
01:10:45,544 --> 01:10:52,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And another concern was that would the abetting property owners have the first right of refusal?

630
01:10:53,574 --> 01:11:00,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe Attorney Sharon mentioned that according to the 30B procurement procedures,

631
01:11:01,744 --> 01:11:05,886
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot provide certain preferences to abetting property owners.

632
01:11:06,146 --> 01:11:10,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody can bid through RFP process.

633
01:11:12,329 --> 01:11:15,270
[SPEAKER_09]: That discussion was clarified.

634
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:20,873
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was confusion between affordable housing trust and community land trust.

635
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:27,216
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the councilors suggested why not convey this property to a community land trust so they can

636
01:11:28,432 --> 01:11:40,337
[SPEAKER_09]: build affordable housing, but I think they had some confusion that the Affordable Housing Trust and Community Land Trust are the same or are working together.

637
01:11:40,357 --> 01:11:52,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And Councilor Lemming did clarify that Community Land Trust has not been established yet, and there's a study going on, and that's going to be a different entity from the Affordable Housing Trust.

638
01:11:57,272 --> 01:12:04,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody else raised a question, why not convey this to affordable housing trust so that they can build affordable housing in this land?

639
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:10,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that there's ledge in this property, so I'm not sure if it's feasible to build affordable housing.

640
01:12:11,085 --> 01:12:18,071
[SPEAKER_09]: If at all it was feasible, then one could build just one unit as per attorney Sherrin's comments.

641
01:12:18,892 --> 01:12:33,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that's the case, you know, we would rather go with the proceeds of funding the nexus study and adding affordable housing linkage rather than just supporting one affordable housing unit in that parcel.

642
01:12:38,856 --> 01:12:48,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Another issue or rather clarification that attorney Sherin provided is that once this gets approved, what would happen to those funds?

643
01:12:48,298 --> 01:12:58,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently it goes to sale of lots account, and then the city council would need to appropriate those funds once again.

644
01:12:58,581 --> 01:13:07,643
[SPEAKER_09]: So they would still have control over how these funds would be dedicated to different users, even after they give approval to convey or transfer

645
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,136
[SPEAKER_09]: the passives.

646
01:13:12,182 --> 01:13:12,684
[SPEAKER_09]: And then

647
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:31,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so these were the main discussion points, and I think in the end, the city council felt that this needs to be explored further, and they tabled this conversation for an upcoming committee of the whole meeting, but it wasn't decided when.

648
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:42,566
[SPEAKER_09]: They do want the Affordable Housing Trust members to be there at the discussion and, you know, provide our reasons why we would need

649
01:13:43,526 --> 01:13:45,628
[SPEAKER_09]: the funding and so on, yeah.

650
01:13:46,248 --> 01:13:49,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask a question and then I guess make a comment?

651
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:52,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we currently in the position to receive properties?

652
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:56,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we're talking about vulnerabilities, but are we at this very moment?

653
01:13:57,436 --> 01:14:03,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I have forwarded the declaration of trust to our legal counsel who said they would record it at the registry of deed.

654
01:14:04,521 --> 01:14:05,762
[SPEAKER_09]: So once it's recorded,

655
01:14:06,923 --> 01:14:10,410
[SPEAKER_09]: we would be able to acquire and transfer property.

656
01:14:11,532 --> 01:14:11,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

657
01:14:11,812 --> 01:14:13,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Roberta has a question, so I'll take my comment.

658
01:14:16,461 --> 01:14:18,104
[SPEAKER_02]: No, please finish your comment.

659
01:14:18,978 --> 01:14:30,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my comment was going to be kind of given that it seems a difficult property to develop and that we don't have any other money in the bank to develop properties.

660
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:36,234
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point, I feel like building up the funds that we have is a little more valuable.

661
01:14:36,275 --> 01:14:39,798
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes us more flexible when we are given, but that is just my personal opinion.

662
01:14:43,044 --> 01:14:44,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I second that.

663
01:14:46,007 --> 01:15:02,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense to get the proceeds, have the proceeds be able to be used to fund the nexus and then add linkage and then the trust has a more steady stream of funding coming in so we can finance more affordable housing.

664
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:05,441
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just selfish.

665
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:06,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

666
01:15:06,842 --> 01:15:16,824
[SPEAKER_08]: My probably forgotten calculations, but whatever this sold for, the nexus wouldn't be like the fall, wouldn't make up all the money.

667
01:15:17,784 --> 01:15:27,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this was valued at approximately $600,000 and a nexus study just to add affordable housing linkage is about $60,000 to $70,000.

668
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:32,448
[SPEAKER_09]: or $70,000 to $80,000.

669
01:15:32,888 --> 01:15:37,150
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just to add affordable housing linkage, not the other linkage buckets.

670
01:15:37,591 --> 01:15:37,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

671
01:15:38,631 --> 01:15:40,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta, do you want to start?

672
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

673
01:15:42,753 --> 01:15:46,816
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is really about order of operations.

674
01:15:47,216 --> 01:15:58,102
[SPEAKER_02]: If I understand correctly, and I don't really know anything about the law with respect to the city disposing of property,

675
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:15,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if the city council disposes of this property or votes to dispose of the property, the money then goes to a city account, and then the city council would have to appropriate that money to the Affordable Housing Trust.

676
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:29,852
[SPEAKER_02]: But could the city council dispose of the property, transfer the property to the Affordable Housing Trust first, and the Affordable Housing Trust sell the property?

677
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:38,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that provide a guarantee that the money goes for the purpose that's being discussed?

678
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:44,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, one more part to that question.

679
01:16:45,386 --> 01:16:49,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Would the Affordable Housing Trust be allowed to do the nexus study?

680
01:16:49,248 --> 01:16:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that beyond our powers?

681
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I can answer the second question first.

682
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:03,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Affordable Housing Trust Fund can do an exit study.

683
01:17:03,543 --> 01:17:07,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen Maldon's Affordable Housing Trust Fund doing an exit study.

684
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:09,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, I think, within our realm.

685
01:17:09,485 --> 01:17:10,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

686
01:17:10,365 --> 01:17:12,346
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it's not funded through CPA dollars.

687
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:12,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

688
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:16,668
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's funded through trust dollars, you can do that.

689
01:17:16,808 --> 01:17:16,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

690
01:17:18,429 --> 01:17:20,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And to answer, yeah.

691
01:17:20,269 --> 01:17:21,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I have thoughts.

692
01:17:22,667 --> 01:17:29,292
[SPEAKER_05]: concerns about whether or not transferring the parcels to the trust.

693
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:33,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just out there thinking about it.

694
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:42,760
[SPEAKER_05]: If the parcels were transferred to the trust, the trust would then have to issue the RFP.

695
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:53,228
[SPEAKER_05]: The trust would then have to evaluate the RFPs that come in and then make a decision on that piece of it.

696
01:17:59,315 --> 01:18:02,337
[SPEAKER_05]: if the city is gonna do it, right?

697
01:18:02,697 --> 01:18:05,298
[SPEAKER_05]: The city would be issuing the RFP.

698
01:18:05,318 --> 01:18:21,687
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing off of the trust to actually go put out the RFP, evaluate the RFPs and put it out where the city has the staff, dedicated staff that might be in a better position to do that.

699
01:18:21,707 --> 01:18:23,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's just my first thought.

700
01:18:25,755 --> 01:18:39,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I think the city would or the affordable housing trust would have to hire a consultant to draft an RFP and issue the RFP and that would require the trust to provide some fee to the consultant.

701
01:18:39,255 --> 01:18:39,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.

702
01:18:43,296 --> 01:18:46,839
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just my first thought, like not really taking it all in.

703
01:18:46,879 --> 01:18:55,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, Roberta, I was thinking about the same thing, having what would the parcels being transferred to the trust or the proceeds being transferred to the trust.

704
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:56,425
[SPEAKER_05]: But I, yeah.

705
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:57,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask a question?

706
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:06,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the trust subject to the, and maybe I didn't read their laws close enough, but is the trust subject to the same rules of disposition that the city is?

707
01:19:07,653 --> 01:19:08,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, I think it is.

708
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:09,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

709
01:19:09,655 --> 01:19:09,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

710
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:14,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask that as well.

711
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:20,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I think CPA is not subject to it, but maybe other trust funds or trust resources are.

712
01:19:20,988 --> 01:19:24,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

713
01:19:24,131 --> 01:19:24,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.

714
01:19:24,692 --> 01:19:26,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're too municipal to not.

715
01:19:27,174 --> 01:19:30,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we could we could ask.

716
01:19:30,258 --> 01:19:31,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I might not be a bad question, but.

717
01:19:34,056 --> 01:19:35,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess maybe also in terms of process.

718
01:19:35,978 --> 01:19:43,047
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and again, an eye on when this Council, the whole meeting will come up because they have expressed that they would like to have housing trust members.

719
01:19:43,647 --> 01:19:43,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

720
01:19:46,209 --> 01:19:57,431
[SPEAKER_08]: do we, I mean, yeah, I would also, it's a little, I guess we should talk about it now, just kind of like what we would want to go and share from our opinions.

721
01:19:57,491 --> 01:20:09,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, do we all need to agree now on kind of what our stance is on this so that when we speak, just thinking our next meeting in March is the community meeting, so we won't have an agenda to discuss it.

722
01:20:09,754 --> 01:20:13,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So just wondering if there's anything we kind of want to, like, do we,

723
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:19,658
[SPEAKER_08]: like straw poll, do we all kind of feel a certain way about this process or do we need more time to think about it?

724
01:20:19,798 --> 01:20:24,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, when do we make sure we have a similar page that we're showing up and presenting?

725
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:26,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's my question.

726
01:20:28,264 --> 01:20:31,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are great questions.

727
01:20:31,926 --> 01:20:35,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

728
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Great questions.

729
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:42,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer to try to have a little bit more time to think about it and kind of go in.

730
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:43,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the mayor's

731
01:20:45,447 --> 01:20:52,749
[SPEAKER_05]: if I were to be like, put my blinders on and just kind of go in, the mayor's already making a proposal that the city do this.

732
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:59,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And that when the city transfers the property, then the proceeds would be transferred to the trust.

733
01:21:02,253 --> 01:21:11,016
[SPEAKER_05]: My first inclination would be to kind of go along with what is being asked of the city council right now.

734
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:14,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Like instead of going in and saying, oh, no, let's do it this way.

735
01:21:16,078 --> 01:21:16,918
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would need that.

736
01:21:17,258 --> 01:21:20,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I would feel better with more time to think about it and having.

737
01:21:22,122 --> 01:21:23,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's fine.

738
01:21:23,783 --> 01:21:37,133
[SPEAKER_09]: We could propose a time and date when we would want to go before the committee of the whole and I can communicate that with the president of the city council, if that's okay, and whenever you decide you want to have this conversation.

739
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:43,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember the Declaration of Trust.

740
01:21:43,435 --> 01:21:45,497
[SPEAKER_05]: We could call a special meeting.

741
01:21:45,517 --> 01:21:49,240
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it's still public.

742
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:53,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm inclined to, just because otherwise it's two months until our next meeting with this.

743
01:21:53,364 --> 01:21:59,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like money in the bank soon or later or efforts towards that would be great.

744
01:22:00,051 --> 01:22:00,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder

745
01:22:01,769 --> 01:22:06,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to add layers to this, at least I feel like that's your approach sounds good, but just.

746
01:22:07,611 --> 01:22:22,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, I probably think about it more kind of sketch out, like, not an MOU, treat us in the city, but kind of what I would imagine, like, the details that aren't in this that we've kind of talked about and heard and understand, like, lay that out, wrap my head around it.

747
01:22:22,815 --> 01:22:28,417
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I don't know if we, I think a special meeting to talk about this between now and

748
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,420
[SPEAKER_08]: April makes sense because otherwise we don't have one.

749
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:39,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah is that's all right so I think we might need a vote.

750
01:22:39,906 --> 01:22:40,667
[SPEAKER_05]: We might need a vote.

751
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:43,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we might need a vote to do a special meeting.

752
01:22:52,515 --> 01:22:56,559
[SPEAKER_04]: special meetings may be called by the chair of the trust or by any two trustees.

753
01:22:56,619 --> 01:23:03,706
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can call a special meeting whenever you feel like it.

754
01:23:03,786 --> 01:23:10,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It has like a kind of a broad, like a special meeting have to be super specific topic or kind of be kind of the same agenda item that we had for this.

755
01:23:10,332 --> 01:23:14,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can discuss this and anything else that's come up in the interpreting.

756
01:23:14,236 --> 01:23:15,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll figure it out.

757
01:23:16,005 --> 01:23:23,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a special meeting along as long as the agenda is posted if we're doing a special meeting, whatever the agenda items are.

758
01:23:23,489 --> 01:23:23,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

759
01:23:25,069 --> 01:23:28,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's the meeting this special not the topic person.

760
01:23:28,411 --> 01:23:29,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

761
01:23:30,532 --> 01:23:35,894
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can drop the agenda and send it to Lisa who's and as a church, you can approve it.

762
01:23:36,314 --> 01:23:36,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

763
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:40,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all right.

764
01:23:40,378 --> 01:23:46,604
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Roberta, are you okay with the proposing of a special a special meeting?

765
01:23:46,624 --> 01:23:54,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and in terms of the timeline, are we going to decide later when would this special meeting be held?

766
01:23:54,773 --> 01:23:58,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at all our calendars and then I can send an email out.

767
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:11,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it make sense to try to nail down like the, especially, I'm just spitballing, I'm not even, I got my calendar open actually, let me see.

768
01:24:11,474 --> 01:24:14,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't access my calendar, no.

769
01:24:16,996 --> 01:24:21,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Would the second Wednesday of the month, Roberta, I think you have,

770
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:25,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

771
01:24:25,476 --> 01:24:29,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there was a conflict on a second Wednesday with the CPC.

772
01:24:29,879 --> 01:24:32,420
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the CPC is the second Tuesday.

773
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, perfect.

774
01:24:35,182 --> 01:24:39,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Would the second Wednesday of March work for everybody?

775
01:24:39,485 --> 01:24:42,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Presumably?

776
01:24:43,918 --> 01:24:50,208
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do a tentative date for the site that that means two Wednesdays away from our homes.

777
01:24:50,428 --> 01:24:52,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little reminder.

778
01:24:52,351 --> 01:24:53,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not.

779
01:25:01,505 --> 01:25:04,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if we're going to be able to keep that as tentative.

780
01:25:04,726 --> 01:25:09,428
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a tentative March 12th, 6 o'clock.

781
01:25:09,968 --> 01:25:17,090
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll confirm it through everything, but at least we can hold the time if that's okay with you.

782
01:25:26,878 --> 01:25:28,458
[SPEAKER_04]: There's chapter 30B.

783
01:25:29,358 --> 01:25:29,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

784
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:41,161
[SPEAKER_04]: We are exempt when we're dealing between ourselves and the city and other agencies and other boards, but when we're, I think, dealing with the outside public, we are.

785
01:25:41,781 --> 01:25:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

786
01:25:42,521 --> 01:25:42,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

787
01:25:44,821 --> 01:25:45,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I had it in here.

788
01:25:46,202 --> 01:25:46,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

789
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:47,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So efficient.

790
01:25:55,255 --> 01:25:56,716
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, um.

791
01:25:57,776 --> 01:26:03,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was 1 more item on this and it is yes.

792
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:14,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we have a nonprofit developer who's identified a privately owned parcel and interested to develop affordable housing units.

793
01:26:14,505 --> 01:26:14,485
100%.

794
01:26:14,585 --> 01:26:14,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And.

795
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:26,462
[SPEAKER_09]: The purchase and sale agreement, whatever they've decided to buy, is valid till July 15th.

796
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:33,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Between now and then, that is 90 days from the time of agreement, they are required to secure a return financial commitment.

797
01:26:35,305 --> 01:26:43,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So they are looking at local funding support and considering that we

798
01:26:44,168 --> 01:26:52,093
[SPEAKER_09]: haven't decided how our application process is going to be, and they're not sure if that's going to be ready within the next couple of weeks or months.

799
01:26:53,534 --> 01:26:56,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to put it out there and see, is there anything we can do?

800
01:26:57,557 --> 01:27:04,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And since we have to follow the RFP process, I don't think we can just... Hold on.

801
01:27:06,885 --> 01:27:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So this property is a privately owned property, it's not a city parcel.

802
01:27:12,468 --> 01:27:13,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a city parcel.

803
01:27:13,849 --> 01:27:19,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And the CDC or non-profit developer is looking to acquire this property.

804
01:27:19,352 --> 01:27:20,032
[SPEAKER_05]: They have.

805
01:27:20,132 --> 01:27:25,195
[SPEAKER_05]: To develop and what they're looking for is financing to help develop?

806
01:27:25,775 --> 01:27:26,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, funding.

807
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:27,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

808
01:27:27,156 --> 01:27:27,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

809
01:27:27,656 --> 01:27:31,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wouldn't need an RFP for that, right?

810
01:27:31,798 --> 01:27:33,359
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be like an application.

811
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes, that's true.

812
01:27:36,801 --> 01:27:42,266
[SPEAKER_09]: We would just need an application, but then how do we make sure that it's a fair ground?

813
01:27:44,027 --> 01:27:44,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

814
01:27:45,048 --> 01:27:46,789
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got money.

815
01:27:57,203 --> 01:28:00,747
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a timeline thing too.

816
01:28:00,787 --> 01:28:02,388
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a July 15th.

817
01:28:03,709 --> 01:28:07,133
[SPEAKER_05]: How many units are they?

818
01:28:07,153 --> 01:28:14,639
[SPEAKER_09]: 16 to 20 units and they're planning to go for a friendly 40B or a lower amendment.

819
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:24,992
[SPEAKER_09]: 16 affordable units.

820
01:28:25,432 --> 01:28:25,492
[SPEAKER_09]: 16 to 20.

821
01:28:25,572 --> 01:28:26,673
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they're looking at.

822
01:28:26,953 --> 01:28:27,233
[SPEAKER_09]: 16 to 20.

823
01:28:27,413 --> 01:28:32,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an idea of the range of funding that they're seeking?

824
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:33,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I did ask them.

825
01:28:33,636 --> 01:28:36,857
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they didn't have a specific number.

826
01:28:42,297 --> 01:28:44,659
[SPEAKER_05]: if it's okay, and thank you for planting the seed.

827
01:28:44,679 --> 01:28:50,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It is exciting, we might have an application to fill stuff.

828
01:28:50,905 --> 01:28:51,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

829
01:28:52,366 --> 01:29:04,858
[SPEAKER_05]: We have money, we just don't know when it's going to hit our bank account because there still needs to be some I's dotted and some T's crossed before it gets into, I assume we have a bank account.

830
01:29:05,598 --> 01:29:16,263
[SPEAKER_09]: We will have a general trust account, and then there are different sub-accounts for different trusts.

831
01:29:16,283 --> 01:29:17,524
[SPEAKER_09]: We just have to create a sub-account.

832
01:29:17,544 --> 01:29:18,504
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to create it.

833
01:29:18,684 --> 01:29:18,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

834
01:29:19,345 --> 01:29:21,906
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny that we, not funny.

835
01:29:22,746 --> 01:29:30,090
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exciting that we have this possible funding opportunity to come in, but we're still working on our action plan.

836
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:31,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

837
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:33,732
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have the application guidelines ready yet.

838
01:29:34,352 --> 01:29:40,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be have to sort of yeah, so I don't even think we even that's in our action.

839
01:29:41,555 --> 01:29:44,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Question about the application guidelines.

840
01:29:44,437 --> 01:29:49,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so I can understand is the thought behind that.

841
01:29:49,779 --> 01:30:02,485
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have an application guideline and we have applications coming in, some get rejected, some get accepted that the rejected ones and then you try to dispute it.

842
01:30:03,725 --> 01:30:11,169
[SPEAKER_06]: we like is it because of a legal protection that we have the guidelines in place?

843
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:18,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I can say based on my experience looking at funding applications you really want to make sure that the numbers work.

844
01:30:18,974 --> 01:30:20,735
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're looking at.

845
01:30:20,775 --> 01:30:22,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We're making sure that the

846
01:30:25,765 --> 01:30:36,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while since I've looked at a funding application, but it's the debt to income ratio sort of is 1.15 over a 10-year period.

847
01:30:36,894 --> 01:30:40,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So not so much that it's fair to applicants.

848
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:45,220
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of that, but more so to make sure the investment is being wisely.

849
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:46,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

850
01:30:46,734 --> 01:31:01,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And also based on based on my experience, it would be like, of course, my experience, first and foremost, is coming from an affordable housing trust fund that has been in operation since the 80s.

851
01:31:01,682 --> 01:31:06,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we didn't have to pump out saying, hey, we got money comes come

852
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:09,555
[SPEAKER_05]: come visit us, come apply for money.

853
01:31:09,675 --> 01:31:23,838
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that's the quandarum that we're here now, is that we're just getting our feet wet and we're already getting, somebody's already planting the seed to come and get money.

854
01:31:23,898 --> 01:31:33,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I know what developer this was because I think he was in one of our stakeholder meetings.

855
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:36,941
[SPEAKER_05]: We were very clear at the time,

856
01:31:36,981 --> 01:31:37,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We had no money.

857
01:31:37,882 --> 01:31:38,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It is exciting.

858
01:31:38,423 --> 01:31:43,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It is exciting to be actually having to be able to entertain an application coming in front of us and looking at, you know,

859
01:31:54,599 --> 01:32:20,286
[SPEAKER_05]: the number of units and based again solely based on my experience, I would be looking at the performer, I would be looking at how many the acquisition costs, the development costs, the developer's fee, etc., all the other fun stuff, and then looking at how many units, what are the rents that the proposed rents that are coming in and whether or not it's actually coming, going to

860
01:32:24,315 --> 01:32:27,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be a viable contract at the end.

861
01:32:28,857 --> 01:32:34,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberta, she had a question.

862
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:46,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just wanted to suggest that we might be able to make our timeline work to be able to have an actual application process if we arrange so that the period that are.

863
01:32:47,447 --> 01:32:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: That our board is going to work together to develop the plan and the application process is all of the months following March.

864
01:32:56,009 --> 01:33:05,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could begin in April to have a draft application prepared for us to discuss and maybe just.

865
01:33:06,491 --> 01:33:16,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn the order around so that in April we discuss our application process and and and.

866
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:23,660
[SPEAKER_02]: approve an application in April or May so that we can

867
01:33:25,382 --> 01:33:40,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, have a way for them to apply for funding and I don't know if the, yeah, I, I remember that when we, we, we faced something similar with the community preservation committee and early application came in before we were ready for it.

868
01:33:40,869 --> 01:33:45,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And we allowed them to apply as an off cycle application.

869
01:33:45,651 --> 01:33:48,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this case, we may not have a cycle.

870
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:48,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

871
01:33:49,613 --> 01:33:53,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be more of a first come, first serve situation.

872
01:33:53,936 --> 01:34:09,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can make it fair by advertising that this is available, although we haven't yet developed our priorities as a committee, but we can make the funding application available.

873
01:34:13,882 --> 01:34:32,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder, I first wondered if we have kind of models or like technical assistance or if any of us have in-house experience with things like this, Lisa, it sounds like you've certainly dabbled with them, but if we can spend some time at that special meeting talking about that so that at the April meeting we've got more, we're further along.

874
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:41,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of given it's like June 15th, okay, we say the rules are there and then open and advertising and reviewing and everything, I would love to make good use of that time.

875
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, especially.

876
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:51,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one suggestion, which was I think it sounded like Roberta was also trying to maybe work on that as well.

877
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:59,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wonder if that might be an opportunity for someone else to work on an application separately that would then still be reviewed by the whole.

878
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:05,590
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think you guys have your hands full, not to tell you that you have your hands full, but you have a lot of stuff going on.

879
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:13,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And that could be its own little project as opposed, and it could still incorporate the values and the priorities that we're talking about.

880
01:35:13,854 --> 01:35:18,117
[SPEAKER_04]: but it could also just be separate standalone document that we start.

881
01:35:18,337 --> 01:35:22,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least we're hit the ground running when you guys are ready to fill in some of those blanks.

882
01:35:23,401 --> 01:35:25,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me just rephrase what I think I heard.

883
01:35:30,206 --> 01:35:37,091
[SPEAKER_05]: The possibility of creating another subcommittee to create the application process.

884
01:35:37,888 --> 01:35:38,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

885
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that idea.

886
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:45,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that idea.

887
01:35:46,412 --> 01:35:52,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I do think, like, I don't know about, and Roberta is a godsend.

888
01:35:52,876 --> 01:35:53,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Roberta.

889
01:35:53,876 --> 01:35:55,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that you're OK with that.

890
01:35:55,337 --> 01:35:59,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she's done all this pulling up of data and really kind of doing a lot.

891
01:35:59,959 --> 01:36:01,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with Penny and everybody.

892
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

893
01:36:05,562 --> 01:36:06,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we can add another.

894
01:36:07,923 --> 01:36:13,665
[SPEAKER_05]: item on our plate to be able to because they're going to need funding by on or before July 15th.

895
01:36:14,866 --> 01:36:26,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only do we have to think about an application period and creating an application or reviewing period, I've got to assume as I scribble down to a DT loan documents

896
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:35,555
[SPEAKER_05]: A loan agreement, promissory notes, are we going to charge due interest and how long, like, what are our loan terms?

897
01:36:35,695 --> 01:36:39,737
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these fun things that we haven't even started to think about yet.

898
01:36:39,757 --> 01:36:40,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

899
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:51,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have volunteers to work on that committee?

900
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:52,122
[SPEAKER_05]: A working group?

901
01:36:52,582 --> 01:36:54,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think we have to be careful.

902
01:36:54,904 --> 01:36:56,405
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to be careful.

903
01:36:57,065 --> 01:36:58,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a working group.

904
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:01,629
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just doing it independently.

905
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the thing.

906
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:07,773
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's more than one person, I love the idea.

907
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:09,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for the reality check.

908
01:37:10,635 --> 01:37:12,496
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's more than one person, it becomes a,

909
01:37:14,257 --> 01:37:27,027
[SPEAKER_05]: public meeting and subject to the public meeting laws and we'll have to follow posting of agendas and notes taking and making the conversation available.

910
01:37:27,447 --> 01:37:29,529
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's just one person in a room.

911
01:37:29,989 --> 01:37:33,652
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one person in the room doing the research.

912
01:37:33,812 --> 01:37:34,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

913
01:37:36,059 --> 01:37:42,808
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to look for volunteers right now, we can put a pin in it, we can put it on the agenda for the special meeting.

914
01:37:49,404 --> 01:37:51,645
[SPEAKER_08]: with the decision tonight or do we not feel ready?

915
01:37:51,665 --> 01:37:53,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to, yeah.

916
01:37:53,605 --> 01:37:55,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to work on it.

917
01:37:55,485 --> 01:38:01,907
[SPEAKER_08]: If someone's meeting with a draft or some research done, I guess this may be what I'm curious about.

918
01:38:01,927 --> 01:38:03,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like that would get us one step ahead.

919
01:38:04,187 --> 01:38:08,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I just don't want to put anybody on the spot.

920
01:38:08,668 --> 01:38:11,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I suggested it with the idea that I would be back to do it.

921
01:38:12,769 --> 01:38:14,210
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

922
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:21,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to put you on the spot, but I was hoping that's why you're suggesting it, but I did not want to put anybody on the spot.

923
01:38:21,352 --> 01:38:28,254
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a volunteer to start doing some research on doing that.

924
01:38:29,015 --> 01:38:37,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I can share some tools with you if that's something that you're interested in, unless you already have your tools working with whatnot.

925
01:38:37,938 --> 01:38:40,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to share some of those.

926
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:41,479
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be perfect.

927
01:38:42,819 --> 01:38:44,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

928
01:38:47,322 --> 01:38:57,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I just am aware that we are putting together what is looking like a full meeting agenda for the 12th.

929
01:38:58,469 --> 01:39:05,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have this meeting, the public meeting scheduled on the 5th for which there's a major conflict.

930
01:39:06,754 --> 01:39:08,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder whether

931
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:16,423
[SPEAKER_02]: we might want to consider swapping the special meeting and the public workshop.

932
01:39:19,505 --> 01:39:27,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might be better, because the Salem Street corridor is going to be a big attendance.

933
01:39:28,272 --> 01:39:29,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

934
01:39:31,394 --> 01:39:33,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberta, can we get back to you on that?

935
01:39:37,215 --> 01:39:42,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I can send out an update on whether or not we should switch.

936
01:39:43,418 --> 01:39:46,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to put anybody on the spot right now.

937
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Location availability.

938
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:47,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

939
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:48,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

940
01:39:51,357 --> 01:39:53,379
[SPEAKER_08]: and make sure that schedule's really set.

941
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:56,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard that conversation was the fifth, but just, yeah, make sure or not.

942
01:39:56,962 --> 01:40:11,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, we don't want a big conflict because we do want to make sure that we are being as transparent and as welcoming for feedback as we possibly can.

943
01:40:11,334 --> 01:40:13,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We want as much people there as possible.

944
01:40:13,416 --> 01:40:13,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

945
01:40:14,957 --> 01:40:26,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So can we let a decision be made and DT can send out an email if not by the end of this week, early next week.

946
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:27,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that okay?

947
01:40:28,192 --> 01:40:28,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

948
01:40:28,793 --> 01:40:32,277
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just need to set that date before we put out the flyers.

949
01:40:33,018 --> 01:40:33,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

950
01:40:34,219 --> 01:40:34,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

951
01:40:35,828 --> 01:40:42,252
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, and Kayla, I was just going to say that I do have some application examples that I've got from other communities.

952
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:43,733
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can share that with you.

953
01:40:44,013 --> 01:40:44,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

954
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:45,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

955
01:40:45,914 --> 01:40:49,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to clarify, I think they're also seeking state funds.

956
01:40:49,556 --> 01:40:59,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure if they want to get local funds before they usually so that means probably sooner than later.

957
01:40:59,522 --> 01:40:59,703
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

958
01:41:00,649 --> 01:41:16,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, but does that mean that they already put their prelim application into EOLHC and have been invited back to do an application?

959
01:41:16,633 --> 01:41:18,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know yet.

960
01:41:18,293 --> 01:41:19,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you find that out?

961
01:41:19,333 --> 01:41:19,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

962
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:29,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe they have some support from cooperation for supportive housing, which is a New York-based nonprofit organization and CDAC.

963
01:41:30,484 --> 01:41:30,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

964
01:41:30,724 --> 01:41:37,169
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll probably need our commitment.

965
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:50,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they also have some support from Massachusetts Alliance for Supportive Housing, which comes under ARPA.

966
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:53,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if they've already received those grants or not.

967
01:41:55,773 --> 01:41:55,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

968
01:41:55,994 --> 01:41:56,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

969
01:41:56,234 --> 01:41:57,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I got curious.

970
01:41:57,136 --> 01:41:57,477
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

971
01:41:57,497 --> 01:42:01,285
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that case, in all reality, if they're going to be putting in F.

972
01:42:07,075 --> 01:42:12,499
[SPEAKER_05]: other funding opportunities, even though they'll need the money by July 15.

973
01:42:13,379 --> 01:42:19,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You're actually talking about a conditional commitment letter, most likely in June.

974
01:42:19,804 --> 01:42:21,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, March 15th.

975
01:42:21,605 --> 01:42:22,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

976
01:42:22,866 --> 01:42:25,468
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we'll speed up a little bit.

977
01:42:25,528 --> 01:42:25,728
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

978
01:42:27,707 --> 01:42:28,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Exciting.

979
01:42:28,988 --> 01:42:44,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thought, I know we've already decided to go for the NOFA, but another thought is could we or the developer approach CPC, apply for off funding cycle, but just a thought.

980
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:50,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I would welcome that, but you'd need to check with Teresa on funding availability.

981
01:42:51,386 --> 01:42:57,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the CPC may have committed all of its available funds until the end of the fiscal year.

982
01:42:57,655 --> 01:43:04,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but that just means we can spend the money that we just got and go ask for more.

983
01:43:06,902 --> 01:43:08,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how it works or first?

984
01:43:08,322 --> 01:43:12,624
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, this is exciting.

985
01:43:12,664 --> 01:43:13,524
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a fun way.

986
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:17,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet this is my thing to celebrate for today.

987
01:43:17,745 --> 01:43:22,747
[SPEAKER_05]: 2020 February 5th is we have a possibility of a funding application.

988
01:43:22,767 --> 01:43:23,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is exciting.

989
01:43:25,787 --> 01:43:26,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more business?

990
01:43:27,688 --> 01:43:28,288
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

991
01:43:28,908 --> 01:43:30,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to move to a joint.

992
01:43:31,973 --> 01:43:33,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll move to adjourn.

993
01:43:34,014 --> 01:43:35,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

994
01:43:36,054 --> 01:43:37,535
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't.

995
01:43:37,555 --> 01:43:39,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

996
01:43:40,295 --> 01:43:43,576
[SPEAKER_09]: This should have been discussed under the action plan agenda.

997
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:49,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I just missed one point that CHAPA has agreed to provide some sort of technical assistance.

998
01:43:50,038 --> 01:43:51,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do want to share something quick.

999
01:43:52,099 --> 01:43:54,960
[SPEAKER_09]: They have created a flyer.

1000
01:43:57,985 --> 01:44:04,267
[SPEAKER_09]: a one-page flyer, which would be part of the community meeting promotion.

1001
01:44:04,287 --> 01:44:13,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I can share this with the board of trustees, and if you want to provide any comments, then Chapa can again, you know, make those edits.

1002
01:44:14,209 --> 01:44:14,989
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exciting.

1003
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:19,230
[SPEAKER_02]: They should call us city and not town.

1004
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:19,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1005
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:23,011
[SPEAKER_08]: They should call us Medford instead of parenthetical.

1006
01:44:23,431 --> 01:44:24,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

1007
01:44:31,818 --> 01:44:33,440
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's page two.

1008
01:44:34,721 --> 01:44:35,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it's not done yet.

1009
01:44:36,002 --> 01:44:36,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1010
01:44:37,003 --> 01:44:38,084
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is really nice.

1011
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:47,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the fact that it showed in the page one, like a teacher, what a teacher makes and what they, because you can't live in your community that you're serving.

1012
01:44:47,212 --> 01:44:52,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of communities are like that, that, that, that they're, they're,

1013
01:44:54,615 --> 01:44:56,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a real mentor jobs.

1014
01:44:56,656 --> 01:45:00,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1015
01:45:01,618 --> 01:45:03,138
[SPEAKER_05]: This is perfect.

1016
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:04,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1017
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now we can move to adjourn.

1018
01:45:10,941 --> 01:45:12,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're burning you first.

1019
01:45:12,342 --> 01:45:13,722
[SPEAKER_05]: You made the motion to adjourn.

1020
01:45:13,742 --> 01:45:14,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I hear that right?

1021
01:45:23,058 --> 01:45:25,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And then roll call since we are here.

1022
01:45:25,222 --> 01:45:26,184
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Kayla.

1023
01:45:26,705 --> 01:45:26,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1024
01:45:27,006 --> 01:45:27,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberta.

1025
01:45:28,409 --> 01:45:28,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1026
01:45:29,231 --> 01:45:29,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Perry.

1027
01:45:30,213 --> 01:45:30,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1028
01:45:30,874 --> 01:45:31,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Penny.

1029
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:31,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1030
01:45:32,117 --> 01:45:33,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Lisa-san.

1031
01:45:33,058 --> 01:45:33,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:34,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And Lisa Ann Davidson.

1033
01:45:34,942 --> 01:45:35,203

01:45:35,423 --> 01:45:35,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys.
