1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:02,313
pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021.

2
00:00:02,393 --> 00:00:07,997
This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board will be conducted via remote means.

3
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:18,646
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

4
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:29,901
A reminder to all of you that the project materials for both of the projects in front of us this evening and others can be viewed at the city's website.

5
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:49,305
I know Amanda will put that link up for you, but it's at medfordma.org backslash boards backslash community hyphen development hyphen board, or simply go to the city website, click on boards and commissions and click through to community development board.

6
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:55,009
Let's start our meeting tonight with a quick roll call of the board members.

7
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,352
Checking for time.

8
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:02,135
Yeah.

9
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:03,316
Yeah.

10
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:05,197
Yeah.

11
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:06,418
Yeah.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,280
Yeah.

13
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:09,241
Yeah.

14
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:11,082
Yeah.

15
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:12,143
Yeah.

16
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:14,966
And I'm David Bloomberg welcome.

17
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:33,022
First note is that in light of the number of people we have in attendance this evening and two projects to consider, we're going to move the discussion of our board minutes to the end and wrap that up after we look at the projects.

18
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:45,559
We want to begin with a site plan review to the zoning Board of Appeals that is required of us in connection with a proposal at 595 Broadway.

19
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,823
So let me read the notice on that project for everyone to get a sense of what we're talking about.

20
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:19,084
Metro Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting tonight, August, 18 2022 via zoom to relative to an application for site plan review submitted by Fidelis bridge loan venture, our EO LLC to construct a multiple dwelling building, consisting of seven residential dwelling units in a commercial one zoning district at 595 Broadway.

21
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:34,944
Project is subject to a site plan review special permit for the city of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 section 94 dash 331 and requires approvals from the Board of Appeals.

22
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:36,184
Therefore,

23
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:51,492
Our board the Community Development Board will perform a site plan review and submit its recommendations to the zoning board will be in the special will be the special permit granting authority for the site plan review special permit.

24
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:59,276
If we can start this evening by opening up the floor to the 595 team.

25
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:08,965
I'm sure if Attorney Bernowski or Mr Quinn or someone else on the team would like to take the lead.

26
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:12,866
Thank you very much, Mr Chairman, members of the board.

27
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:17,308
For the record, my name is Adam Bernowski, 255 State Street, Boston.

28
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:22,530
I'm an attorney for Fidelis Investors, the property owner and the proposed developer.

29
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:31,974
With me tonight is the project architect Milton Yu of Peter Quinn Architects, the engineer Carlos Rivera, and Michael Barone, my co-counsel.

30
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:42,333
We're here relative to site plan review as the chair mentioned for construction of a seven unit multifamily residential building with below grade parking and bike storage at 595 Broadway.

31
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:50,156
I recognize that many on this board may already have working knowledge of this project, which was unanimously approved by the board in 2020.

32
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:55,038
Maybe get into a little bit of that history of this project in a few minutes.

33
00:03:55,398 --> 00:04:01,240
But first I'd like to provide you with some overview and then let the design team walk you through some of the plans.

34
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:12,737
The property consists of 7,000 square feet situated in a rectangular lot in the commercial one zoning district on the north side of Broadway between Albion Street and Altham Street.

35
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:14,358
This is a split lot.

36
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:25,060
The front portion is located off of Broadway, consists of approximately 40% of the lot, and that is located in Somerville with the

37
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:38,465
As I'll elaborate in a few minutes, due to the location in Somerville, this project is likewise subject to approvals in that community, and it has been fully approved by the ZBA there.

38
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:45,910
The premises is currently improved with an existing wood-framed single-family residence with minimal other improvements or landscaping.

39
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:58,678
The proposed development will raise the existing structures and construct a new four-story building measuring approximately 9,200 gross square feet with 7,600 net square feet.

40
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:07,263
There will be seven residential units on the first through fourth floors, 10 parking spaces below grade, bicycle storage facilities on site,

41
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:17,155
and significant landscaping and beautification on the site including paper walkways, solid tree wood board fencing, new trees, bushes and native landscaping throughout the site.

42
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:22,743
The residential portion of the building will include one bedroom unit and six two-bedroom units.

43
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,451
coordination with the neighbors.

44
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,514
Prior to the initial submission on this project, the original developer met with the neighbors, both in Medford and Somerville.

45
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:43,479
And to address the concerns of the neighbors, the project design at the rear of the building was adjusted to reduce shading impacts and add additional screening for privacy.

46
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,422
You may recall that, or some of you may recall that an identical proposal came before this board outside of March of 2020.

47
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:55,522
where we received unanimous approval and site plan review recommendations on March 27, 2020.

48
00:05:57,144 --> 00:06:06,653
The project was subsequently withdrawn from zoning without prejudice and did not seek or complete the approvals necessary to proceed with the development.

49
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:12,459
The premises is now owned by Fidelis, which took over the property and project from the prior owner in 2021.

50
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:22,913
And while the board already approved this project, when we revived it earlier this year, it was suggested by the city that we again come before this board.

51
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:38,897
While I recognize that there are some familiar faces and some overlap between the board then and the board now, we thought it would be a good opportunity to address any concerns of the board, let you know more about the project and see if we could answer any questions that you might have.

52
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:41,498
On the Somerville side of the property,

53
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:55,231
was approved by special permit in October of 2018, and the permits were recently extended unanimously by the Somerville CBA, and those permits will be good through February of 2023.

54
00:06:55,311 --> 00:07:02,017
Pending site approval, the applicant has a hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals on August 25th.

55
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:09,503
We require special permits and variances relative to dimensions with no relief needed relative to use.

56
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:14,735
Estimated time for completion here is six to 12 months after final approvals.

57
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:21,859
And I'll note that the applicant and the team has reviewed the site plan review recommendations from this board from 2020.

58
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:28,770
and we reviewed them against the majority of the comments that were received by the various boards here.

59
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,492
And note that there is significant overlap between the conditions and the comments.

60
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:41,195
And in an effort to expedite the process, if it helps at all, there is no objection to the conditions

61
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,024
And with that being said, we're happy to answer any questions the board may have.

62
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:53,869
If Milton Yu from Peter Quinn's office is online, I'd like to pass it over to him to walk through the plans.

63
00:07:58,973 --> 00:07:59,733
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

64
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:00,794
Okay.

65
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,158
You can hear?

66
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:06,659
Yes.

67
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,460
OK.

68
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,720
Good evening.

69
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,161
My name is Milton Yu with Peter Quinn Architects, Davis Square Somerville.

70
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:21,564
And thanks, Adam, for the introduction and the summary of the project so far.

71
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,565
Is there a way I can share the plans?

72
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,406
Yes, you should be able to.

73
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:31,167
Give it a try.

74
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:32,787
Oh, actually, I'm sorry.

75
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,568
Yeah, you have co-host permissions.

76
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:35,428
OK.

77
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,094
share screen ask a quick question.

78
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:42,575
Yes.

79
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:51,980
Would it be possible for you to highlight any changes to the plans, while you go through them between when we last approved them and now.

80
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:56,222
I'm sure I'll do that.

81
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:10,467
Okay, so you should be able to see soon.

82
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:14,430
Just pulled up a Google map of the area.

83
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,014
Just so maybe somebody needs to have a refresher where the site is.

84
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:26,859
We're between Tufts Park and Trump Field, Medford and some of the lines, and this is Broadway.

85
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,421
I'm sorry, Milton, are you sharing your screen?

86
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:30,962
Oh, I'm sorry, you can't see that.

87
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:33,324
How about now?

88
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:33,764
Yeah.

89
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:35,566
Looks like it's coming up.

90
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:37,127
Okay, give it a second.

91
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:38,645
Yeah, can see it.

92
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:39,366
Thank you.

93
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:40,606
Okay, so sorry about that.

94
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:46,849
So the site is between Tough Spark and Trump Field, Broadway and Somerville line.

95
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,332
So here's Broadway, and then our site is here, just to situate us.

96
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,254
And then let me share the PDFs with you.

97
00:09:59,956 --> 00:10:01,196
Are you able to see this PDF?

98
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:02,097
Yes.

99
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:03,186
Okay, great.

100
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:11,174
So, just to describe the general layout of the structure for those who haven't seen this.

101
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:24,768
We have seven unit building with parking below we have 10 parking spaces under the building, not fully enclosed.

102
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:31,210
But under the building, nonetheless, I'll get to the floor plan afterwards.

103
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:41,759
Ground floor, we have as much landscaping as we can put, essentially, that isn't where the driveway is in the parking and where the building is.

104
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:51,088
The ground floor is such that we have fully accessible ground floor units.

105
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,632
So here comes the ramp from the public way.

106
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:02,353
And then these two units are accessible.

107
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:19,099
We have one stair going up through the building for the upper units, two units on the first floor, two units on the second floor, and then three units spread out on the third and fourth floor.

108
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,400
The upper units are two levels.

109
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:37,803
So we don't have a final floor plan of the units, all of the units right now, but the general schema would be to place them such that they are spiraling around the stair, each with their own outdoor space.

110
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:45,849
And then each would have its own stairway up to the upper level with roof decks.

111
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:49,692
And as far as

112
00:11:51,251 --> 00:12:05,717
The elevation, the strategy in part responding to city comments was to have a variety of materials and break up the mass.

113
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:10,359
So that's not one continuous flat surface.

114
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:19,843
So we'll have a mixture of metal panel, two tones of metal panel, different exposure, thicknesses,

115
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,411
and cedar siding as well.

116
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:50,538
We also did receive comments from historical mentioning that, I mean, I'll let them speak for it, but the summary was that overall positive regard to the fenestration, but that the recommendation that was to widen the street side windows, we'll be glad to do that going forward.

117
00:12:51,832 --> 00:13:00,181
because the pattern was kept mostly with this width going around the building, as you can see.

118
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:15,156
Again, all these elevations have the same thought behind it, where it's a variety of different colors, placement of materials to try to break up the mass.

119
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:29,621
The upper floor steps back as an effort to give the appearance of a smaller bulk on all sides.

120
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:48,211
If you wanted to see materials, you have a particular sheet here where we have a mixture of different color metal panel for exterior materials and cedar siding.

121
00:13:51,465 --> 00:14:08,357
The overall approach to the windows was also, I mean, we don't have exact manufacturer specs yet, but the idea was to have them inset from the outer plane of the wall, so we can get a little shadow line occurring.

122
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:17,303
This would be the street view overall effect.

123
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:28,471
We did.

124
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,513
I did have a conversation with the fire chief.

125
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:34,095
Since we do have parking under the building.

126
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:36,937
The comment was to put.

127
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:52,928
I'll show you the ground floor first to put access to the basement not only through the driveway, but also to have a stair coming out like a stoop on this side of the building as well so they could have steps down here so if

128
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:59,379
If zoning or other regulations allows, then we will endeavor to do that.

129
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:03,482
So there'll be some more options for the fire department to get down here.

130
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:05,524
It will be a fully sprinkled building.

131
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:10,288
So it's more of an access, it's more a convenience of access.

132
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:16,174
You know, if they were saying that if a car was stopped here, then there would be another way down.

133
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,375
They will be fully sprinkled.

134
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:32,618
dry line down here, as well as a fire department access panel.

135
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:39,061
Here's some pictures that were asked of us for providing views from the neighbors.

136
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:40,862
So here's the site.

137
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:46,164
Medford is on this side, Summerville's on this side.

138
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:50,366
So this first image shows from the back terrace.

139
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,229
from 74 and 76 Albion looking at the building.

140
00:15:58,709 --> 00:15:59,409
That's this view.

141
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,690
Those trees would be on our property.

142
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:14,311
View two is also from the closer of the townhouses, 8284 Albion looking at the building.

143
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:16,212
That would be this view.

144
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,153
And we were asked also to provide

145
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:31,187
some images of the views of the trees, what types of foliage we can expect for screening.

146
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,689
And we would see views like this.

147
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,233
As it is now, I mean.

148
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:50,238
The shadow study would not have changed from the last time we showed it.

149
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:51,999
It's the same overall massing.

150
00:16:52,844 --> 00:17:01,126
So we have the shadows from the equinoxes, and the yellow indicates additional shadow from what the existing building has.

151
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:13,049
Summer, which is sort of the least impact, and then winter with the most.

152
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:26,698
That's about my part of the presentation.

153
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,358
If you had any questions for me or the rest of the team.

154
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,539
Mr. Yu, any other highlights, any other changes?

155
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,660
It looks very similar to what I recall us seeing last time it was before us.

156
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:40,841
Anything else to highlight on your end?

157
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:42,061
I don't, no.

158
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,122
OK, no problem.

159
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,363
Should I stop sharing?

160
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:54,551
Sure, Adam, I think the floor is still yours for your team.

161
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:55,851
Okay, thank you.

162
00:17:57,712 --> 00:18:01,674
I know Carlos is on the line, who is the engineer for the project.

163
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:14,339
Carlos, anything to add to Milton's presentation, or perhaps if not, we can just have you respond to any questions relative to the site plan itself.

164
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:17,920
Yes, can I share my screen?

165
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,603
I wanted to add like a little bit of information, explain how we plan for the drainage system.

166
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:26,226
I can too, if you want.

167
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,472
Is that, can you guys see my screen?

168
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:35,013
Yes.

169
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:36,915
Yes, all right.

170
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:44,221
So, I mean, it's a very simple, I mean, it's only like 7,000 square feet property.

171
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,583
We have like the garage ramp with a drainage, you know, a trench drain at the end of the ramp.

172
00:18:52,243 --> 00:19:08,830
And then we probably gonna have like four drains throughout the garage once we get like the, you know, the final designs for the building, but then all the drainage from the garage will be directed to an oil water separator from the oil water separator.

173
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,891
So like all the drain,

174
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:23,258
It's under the building, and I saw the opportunity for this small area behind the building to add an infiltration system.

175
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:38,287
So it would be like 15 contact chambers for the drainage that we have to pump, because this is at the floor of the garage, which would be at elevation 94, and the grades on the outside of the building at elevation 101.

176
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,991
I do have soil testing data that we did when we started the project.

177
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,112
This was like a testing boring that was done.

178
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:56,814
It was double purpose to find what type of soils we were going to encounter during construction.

179
00:19:57,774 --> 00:20:02,435
And so the exploration went to about 17 feet deep.

180
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:16,624
And then we found like dry, dense, very dense brown coarse fine sand, which is like, it's probably a determination of like glacial chill material.

181
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:20,327
There was no water encounter.

182
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:34,138
And I mean, just so I mean, this is a technology, but when you see like the blow counts, you see like that this is like a very dense material, like, you know, I mean, it's, it's perfect for construction for direct

183
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,680
um, footings on it.

184
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:45,185
Uh, but it's not like, uh, incredibly good for, for, for drainage because it has like a very slow permeation.

185
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:52,590
So on my drainage report, the idea was it to have, um, uh, the drainage system.

186
00:20:52,630 --> 00:21:01,116
And I mean, I included like a very minimal, uh, infiltration for like a one inch per hour, which is a very slow rate.

187
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:13,065
And then we have like, we are proposing like an overflow system for this drainage that is connected into the drain on the street.

188
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:16,748
And this concept was approved by some review.

189
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:25,093
So we are allowed to put like the excess of overflow for this system into the street.

190
00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:27,955
And on our report,

191
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:44,981
I mean, the details is it like we are containing, you know, per, I mean, the drainage system was done like more per the guidelines for like some of you, but we are containing the water and all 210, 2,500 year storms.

192
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:54,965
I mean, there was like some comments regarding the layout of the garage that it was not on purview of my design.

193
00:21:55,702 --> 00:21:58,965
in terms of like, you know, the parking spaces under the building.

194
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:10,576
And then there was like some additional questions regarding traffic that I guess we have like a traffic engineer that's gonna address those questions.

195
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,963
And that's basically my presentation for the site work.

196
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:19,605
Okay, thank you.

197
00:22:26,406 --> 00:22:27,026
Thank you, Carlos.

198
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:33,109
Yeah, I think that at this point that that concludes the initial presentation we're happy to answer any questions for us.

199
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:34,849
Okay, great.

200
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,832
Amanda do we have some participants from city staff for tonight's presentation or.

201
00:22:42,370 --> 00:23:06,726
I think just some folks from our office, and I can make a note to the board that I spoke with the fire chief Friedman earlier today, and he just wanted to convey that he did have a chance to speak with the project applicant in regards to the response to some of the comments that he made and submitted to you all, and he felt comfortable with all of the responses provided.

202
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:11,890
And those were given to the board as well, that memo.

203
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:16,787
know, we thank the applicant for that as well.

204
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:21,874
It's very helpful to get that back and forth so we don't have to spend as much time at the meeting talking about those items.

205
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:22,916
Appreciate that very much.

206
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:34,914
I think we should at this point, open things up to we have any public participation at this point, and anyone who'd like to speak on this one.

207
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:43,763
David, if the board members have questions I actually realized I should have asked Amanda this earlier, but we were a little rushed.

208
00:23:44,984 --> 00:24:03,471
I'm actually perplexed about the parking spots and how that's being handled and not the numbers, but I've both seen it say there'd be open air, but then they're requesting a second entrance in and they're not part of the building, but they appear to be covered.

209
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:08,753
And so it feels to me like the building is coming up to the edge of the property because

210
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:12,715
Are the parking spots covered or are they sticking half out?

211
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:22,920
Like if you're in the apartment looking down, are you looking down at the car sticking out from under the building or are you looking at a roof covering the parking area?

212
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:24,621
I wasn't clear.

213
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:28,384
Nelson, are you able to address that question?

214
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:31,345
I think it'd be best if I just pull up the drawing.

215
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:32,066
Would you like to?

216
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:32,126
OK.

217
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:49,337
Okay, so it's not this dash line when we're not seeing it.

218
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,639
Oh, sorry.

219
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,420
share button.

220
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,881
Sorry.

221
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:55,704
There you go.

222
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,767
Yeah, there we go.

223
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,067
Okay.

224
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:00,270
So this is the parking level.

225
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,674
The building above is shown in this dash line.

226
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:04,535
Mm hmm.

227
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:11,988
So there's no additional roof separating the view of the cars below.

228
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:22,636
So there are certain car spaces that you can't see, but I guess the back half of these and the tops of these will be visible.

229
00:25:23,596 --> 00:25:24,917
In terms of, you had a question?

230
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:27,840
So could you put sheet A1.1?

231
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:31,782
I think it's your next sheet.

232
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:32,403
Yep.

233
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:38,898
This sheet gave me the impression that that was building and that was roof that we were looking down on.

234
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,882
These are the, these are the spaces.

235
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:44,404
Those are the open air spaces.

236
00:25:45,665 --> 00:25:48,548
And that's just a retaining wall at the back there.

237
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:49,910
Right, right.

238
00:25:50,589 --> 00:26:02,815
So, because I was trying to also process the fire chiefs concern about access but I'm, I'm feeling like it's like a seven foot retaining wall, and obviously he can't get back there anyhow your landlocked.

239
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:05,616
But, um, okay.

240
00:26:06,256 --> 00:26:09,438
So, his concern when I was talking with him was just

241
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:34,107
just, you know, instead of taking instead of dropping over the wall, or if there was a car stopped here for any reason that they'd be able to just access stairs and go under, this is about, I think seven feet below from from here to here is about seven feet so they would rather take a step stairs down here if there was a car blocking this driveway.

242
00:26:34,904 --> 00:26:37,405
Right, okay, but he would be able to look in on this.

243
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:38,726
This is an open thing.

244
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:45,349
And so the reason for the drainage in the floor of the parking area is because that's open to the rain and it's gonna rain.

245
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:48,670
Like when it rains and snows, it will land in the parking area.

246
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,511
It will, yeah.

247
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:54,373
If we look at the verdant landscape architecture rendering.

248
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:55,414
Okay.

249
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:59,275
In our packet is page five of 26.

250
00:26:59,315 --> 00:26:59,655
Yep.

251
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:02,617
I think that helps to,

252
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:04,965
to clarify.

253
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:21,449
So we could see if somebody pulled in facing, you know, didn't back in, you could see like the hood of a car, theoretically.

254
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:24,710
Yeah, right where your mouse is, Milton.

255
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:26,770
Thank you.

256
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:33,952
That's just really helpful because I was, I thought I understood it on this image, but then the others, I thought I was looking at a roof.

257
00:27:34,012 --> 00:27:35,452
I was very confused by it.

258
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:40,573
And I just felt that we should understand what it was we were not permitting.

259
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:41,973
Sure.

260
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,053
I appreciate it.

261
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:54,636
Amanda, I don't know if we have members of the public or we just go right to the board discussion on this.

262
00:27:55,728 --> 00:28:15,722
So I have no submitted comments from members of the public, and I guess I would just ask if any members of the public do wanna participate tonight, if you could use the raise your hand function to either show us that you are interested in making a comment, or you can use the chat feature and I can call on you.

263
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:21,987
Maybe we'll just give it a beat to see if anybody would like to comment.

264
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,282
Okay, seeing none, so.

265
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,323
Let me go ahead and open up the floor to the board members who might have questions.

266
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:38,064
And Klyce, I see your hand up.

267
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:41,984
Hi.

268
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:45,345
Just a follow up on my question from before.

269
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:56,567
I'm having a real problem understanding how this current application is differing from what we previously approved.

270
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:10,991
That, you know, nothing in the stuff that was sent out illustrates that and sorry Milton but nothing.

271
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:13,453
You said really helped me understand that.

272
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:15,774
So I'm at a real loss.

273
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:26,302
A what we're being asked to look at and be what those changes are between then and now, it's, it's

274
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:39,628
I don't, you know, I could go back and have, go into the city records and try to find the old set and try to figure out the differences between the two, but I don't really feel like that's my job.

275
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:46,131
So I'm not sure what you're even asking us to do right now.

276
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:50,711
I can handle that question if you'd like, Mr. Chairman.

277
00:29:51,932 --> 00:30:00,718
So as far as I can understand, and Milton, correct me if I'm wrong, there are no material changes that have been made to the project.

278
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,840
There may have been no changes whatsoever to the project.

279
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:16,208
The issue here is simply the lapse in time between when this was approved in 2020 and currently standing before you today, two and a half years later, that there was

280
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:29,003
I don't know that there's any written policy, but I think the idea was that to have site plan, site plan approvals normally goes right before, in a project like this, before ZBA approval.

281
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:35,427
And the recommendations are made and there's personnel that have changed, the building departments changed, there's members of this board that have changed.

282
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:40,871
The thought process was to come back before this board and seek approval while there have been no changes to the project.

283
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:45,007
Okay, that's, that's very helpful.

284
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:51,931
So, what you're saying is that there are no architectural changes to this project from when we last approved it.

285
00:30:53,194 --> 00:31:07,722
The plans are the plan set is the same as that but we had more opportunities to gather some comments from like different departments, and then I think moving forward.

286
00:31:08,263 --> 00:31:20,470
We'll have an opportunity to, you know, explore that the steps down into the garage area that I mentioned that didn't make it into this set, but going forward we're going to.

287
00:31:21,635 --> 00:31:25,959
never done incorporate that into the set and also the comment about the wider windows in the front.

288
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,541
Right.

289
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:34,246
I might add, so they came back to us, the, the applicant never got ZBA approval.

290
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:46,376
So they got a new permit refusal letter from the building department, which says the permit path for this is site plan review and CBA, and part of the site plan review is

291
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:49,718
Fire Chief, he's new since this was done.

292
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:53,799
City Engineer is new since this was last approved.

293
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:58,521
And there's, I guess actually there's only one or two members of the board that are new since then.

294
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:12,225
So we basically said, we should come, it's two and a half years later, this is post pandemic, this should come back in front of the board before it goes to ZBA, rather than us sending a two and a half year old letter to the ZBA

295
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:16,738
with department head comments from multiple department heads that no longer work here.

296
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:18,179
That's the rationale.

297
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:21,742
Great.

298
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:22,543
Thank you.

299
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:41,678
And I apologize, I thought it was clear in some of the stuff that they had handed that we had sent out that it was the same project you had seen before that it was not coming before us because of changes but because of two and a half years and personnel changes.

300
00:32:42,667 --> 00:33:02,809
Can you, Alicia Do you maybe you remember, maybe not, it's been a while, but I know, or I think we had a conversation about number of parking spaces here, especially given the to the type of project that this is given that there's a new T station, but a half a block away.

301
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:07,127
That was actually extensive discussion.

302
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:16,094
And part of it, I think also at the time is that that T station was two and a half years out and no construction had really occurred yet.

303
00:33:16,214 --> 00:33:16,434
Right.

304
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:18,476
We were all like, we think it's coming.

305
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:21,398
Um, so yeah, we did pull up the minutes.

306
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:24,340
I would not trust my memory on this project at all.

307
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:32,607
Um, but we pulled up the minutes and there was a long discussion of the number of parking spots, which they'll have to take in front of ZBA.

308
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:40,181
And actually, now that this is a new application, we do have reduced requirements for parking.

309
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:52,127
Somerville, if I think I remember correctly, required zero spots, but Medford, the argument was that three and a half of the residential units are in the city of Medford.

310
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:55,829
Therefore, seven spots would be considered

311
00:33:56,379 --> 00:34:01,601
Medford required spots, and three of the parking spots were for Somerville.

312
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:16,548
So maybe Somerville required a little, I apologize, it's not actually in the minutes with the Somerville requirement was, but for three and a half units, the seven spots met our two spots per.

313
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:21,190
We all know that zoning has been updated, and so that requirement is reduced a little,

314
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:33,460
What this board actually put in its recommendation at that time was that the proponent consider converting two or three of the proposed parking spaces to landscaping.

315
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:41,246
And it was framed that way because this board is not the decision maker on it, but rather the ZBA.

316
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:48,692
And we wanted it on the record to the ZBA that we recommended fewer parking spots would be appropriate for this location.

317
00:34:50,084 --> 00:35:01,331
It's definitely what I remember, and I would, I guess I would say, I would ask that we re suggest that.

318
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:05,873
I mean you said there's 10 spaces Is that correct.

319
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:09,615
Yes.

320
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:19,161
Yeah, and seven units, I don't see any need for more than seven, frankly, but especially since Somerville's

321
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,141
requiring zero.

322
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:29,886
But I know the order and ordinances 1.1 right, Alicia, of the top of my head, my book out.

323
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,728
So I think that most.

324
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:39,933
But if you go by the three and a half unit thing then, and really just for.

325
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:42,755
So, I don't know.

326
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:46,624
We can certainly make that recommendation again.

327
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,589
I'm not sure if the applicant has a response to that.

328
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:58,858
I mean, that was obviously raised at the time and the design didn't change as a result, but of course, she also didn't get to the ZBA as we were just discussing.

329
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:08,186
Yeah, I'd have to talk with the developer to find out what their thoughts are.

330
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:13,867
And I think that generally speaking, I certainly agree with what the board is saying.

331
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:26,389
It does seem like an excessive amount of spots, especially with how many changes are coming or have really come to this neighborhood, particularly since the time this project was developed in 2017, which it does go back that far.

332
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:30,530
So I would have to speak with them to find out, but certainly,

333
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:35,228
I mean, I don't think there'd be an objection to that inclusion in the recommendation.

334
00:36:35,248 --> 00:36:43,674
I think we would have to find out what the zoning board's appetite is towards further relief that I think would be required.

335
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,442
I recall, this is Jackie Futado, Chair.

336
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:56,926
I recall there being some kind of discussion regarding condo versus apartment use also.

337
00:36:57,086 --> 00:37:01,748
I know that they would be adequate if it was apartment use versus condo use.

338
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:09,773
Is that a discussion that we want to resurrect at this point, Alicia?

339
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:12,259
I think that's up to you.

340
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:26,142
There was, I will, in here, there was a discussion and actually I read Todd's, the traffic engineer's report more recently.

341
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:30,283
I'm flipping through to see if it was documented in our minutes.

342
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:32,243
I don't see it in the minutes.

343
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:37,464
It's Todd's conversation in his document where he talks about how if they are,

344
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:48,024
If the spots are deeded and some of them are super small, that could be a mismatch between who owns it and where they park and how that works.

345
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:57,990
Whereas if it's an apartment and all the spots are a free-for-all and people just have their own habits because there are only seven units, then they can work it out.

346
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:06,575
He was concerned that they would spill out on the street if you had a condo and you owned a spot that was too small for your vehicle.

347
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:10,716
I don't, it's speculation.

348
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:12,858
Yeah.

349
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,743
Do we have the recommendation letter that we did last time?

350
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:21,187
I don't, I might've missed it in the material.

351
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:30,297
I was wondering if you could make sure that what we had recommended that we go through them and still would recommend the same.

352
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:52,118
That was, I've seen the letter because the applicant was kind enough to include it in its materials, and there was just the one item which is, I'm paraphrasing of course but to please consider reducing the number of parking spaces and substituted open space landscaping in exchange on that footprint.

353
00:38:52,158 --> 00:38:53,278
Recommendation.

354
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:54,199
Yeah.

355
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,300
Correct.

356
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:15,590
I'm actually, I'm okay with that same recommendation here without changes, considering other comments from board members or questions for the applicants team.

357
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:26,179
I had, I had a couple vehicle charging, if I if you haven't on the plans I missed it.

358
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:27,360
My apologies but.

359
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:37,901
electric vehicle charging infrastructure will it be present there is there a plan for that.

360
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,727
Milton Can you can you answer that question are there charging stations.

361
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:53,241
I wasn't privy to the client's reaction to that.

362
00:39:54,562 --> 00:40:05,011
We certainly could have the, you know, we do have the ability to put that in if that's something asked of us or required of us, but it's not shown.

363
00:40:06,297 --> 00:40:21,102
We might want to consider that as a, as a board of course, it is in our updated zoning now requirement that the infrastructure at least be there if not, if not more to accommodate charging.

364
00:40:22,842 --> 00:40:27,784
Now more than 10 years so that would be, that would be I think a nice plus.

365
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:45,345
The engineering item about the soil testing, I wasn't sure Mr. Ferreira, are you okay working with the engineering department as the project continues for whatever testing they might be looking for?

366
00:40:45,365 --> 00:40:55,328
Not an issue, I mean, I think we did preliminary soil testing to find out if we were gonna have any surprises.

367
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,969
And as the project continue, we can do additional testing.

368
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:01,074
Okay, okay, it didn't.

369
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:05,958
It sounded like they just wanted you to cooperate in that regard so if you're open minded to that that sounds good.

370
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:12,203
There were a couple of recommended conditions in the engineering report.

371
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:26,174
It just, I don't know whether we can really recommend these, because I think they both deal with the Somerville portion of the property but maybe you can just mention, or someone on the team could just give us a little bit of feedback on.

372
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:28,156
There was a question about signaling.

373
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:36,876
and then a question on wall heights and visibility or sight lines for drivers.

374
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:45,862
Right, I do remember the comments from public works about that.

375
00:41:47,363 --> 00:41:58,770
So the comment was, I believe, to have clear signaling at the bottom and the top of the driveway, indicating that it would be, you know, take turns on the driveway one way essentially.

376
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:03,098
So yeah, we will be doing that.

377
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,062
And then site lines are are clean and you'll make sure that that's the case I imagine.

378
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:16,004
Yeah, if we need to take in perhaps a panel, the fencing.

379
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:17,045
No problem.

380
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:18,405
Okay.

381
00:42:20,626 --> 00:42:20,787
Right.

382
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:21,247
Any other.

383
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:23,188
Yes, please.

384
00:42:23,828 --> 00:42:26,029
I got another question I'm looking at the parking plan.

385
00:42:28,203 --> 00:42:31,886
There's something more future handicapped space, can you explain that.

386
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:41,654
So we, the future handicapped space that's marked number space number 10.

387
00:42:42,635 --> 00:42:49,800
That's intentionally there because it has the room for the handicap, I'll direct to come up to the car.

388
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:59,826
So that would be if the tenants required the space that that space would be available.

389
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,070
And it's okay to have a door opening right into a handicapped.

390
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:09,091
I don't like that.

391
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:10,292
I'm sorry.

392
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:14,414
It's okay to have a door opening right into a handicapped aisle.

393
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:17,795
Oh yeah, yeah.

394
00:43:23,498 --> 00:43:27,861
like a car equivalent of like an auto turn on this garage?

395
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:34,805
I didn't show it, but I haven't in the, yeah, I have done one.

396
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:46,072
And also on a lot of the other projects we have, we have similar where the last space is held off of the wall a little bit to help with the turning out.

397
00:43:46,673 --> 00:43:52,557
So as we show it here, it's about, I think it's a foot or foot and a half away from the last,

398
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:54,241
space, the wall.

399
00:43:54,921 --> 00:44:01,203
So that helps with the car backing out and being able to turn a little bit before doing the three-point turn or two-point.

400
00:44:05,563 --> 00:44:07,044
This is like a garage in Paris.

401
00:44:07,704 --> 00:44:08,724
This is tight.

402
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,605
I just don't understand how anybody could park here.

403
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:19,626
We also show...

404
00:44:24,353 --> 00:44:26,234
Is this part of the variances that you're seeking?

405
00:44:26,654 --> 00:44:27,555
I know the ramp is.

406
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:32,037
I think that the 20 feet is as well, right?

407
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:37,040
Yeah, I believe the aisle width was one of the variances.

408
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:40,001
Somerville requires the 20.

409
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:50,567
Right, Somerville requires 12 foot, no wider than 12 foot.

410
00:44:52,477 --> 00:44:57,039
park driveways, and Medford requires no less than 24?

411
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,402
No, no.

412
00:45:01,422 --> 00:45:01,402
20.

413
00:45:01,602 --> 00:45:08,045
I believe the distinction is the ramp versus the back out space for the cars.

414
00:45:08,366 --> 00:45:09,026
Right, okay.

415
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:10,827
Oh, right, right.

416
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:19,652
I was actually just had our minimum aisle width for a 90 degree angle parking is 20 feet.

417
00:45:21,778 --> 00:45:23,579
in Medford.

418
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,279
For one way, right?

419
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:27,081
One way, yes.

420
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:31,844
And for two way, it's 24 feet.

421
00:45:37,186 --> 00:45:40,268
Marking up my new copy of the zoning code while we speak here.

422
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,051
David, I had a few questions.

423
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:46,933
Please Emily, go ahead.

424
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:51,917
And I hate that we're talking about parking so much, but it is such a challenge for new developments.

425
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:58,523
And just to say, I do love that we're replacing a vacant building with seven residential units.

426
00:45:59,744 --> 00:46:00,925
I'm really excited about that.

427
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:07,811
So this building is half in Somerville, half in Medford.

428
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:12,235
If somebody was to apply for a parking permit,

429
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:15,124
for Somerville or for Medford?

430
00:46:15,724 --> 00:46:23,707
Does that correspond with the exact unit that they're in and what side of the building that unit is on?

431
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:38,552
So to talk to like the root of my question, if we have, what is this?

432
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:41,653
10 parking spaces, three of which are compact,

433
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:50,112
Um, and, you know, just to be candid, thinking about the people that are going to live and afford this unit, um, may not have compact cars.

434
00:46:51,113 --> 00:47:00,376
Uh, does this mean that the residents of this building are then going to apply for parking permits in Somerville and pay $40 for the year to park on the street?

435
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:07,598
Or they're going to, you know, do Medford parking, which may or may not require a permit, depending on where you are.

436
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:10,676
and not need these spaces anyways?

437
00:47:11,216 --> 00:47:25,482
Are we creating a problem on our streets with this layout and how can we be creative about it and how it's going to be realistically applied for the people that are going to live here?

438
00:47:32,276 --> 00:48:00,941
So they will not, so an interesting fact is this building, the address is in Somerville, will not be eligible for parking in the entire region as of, so it doesn't go, so what you may not know is that Tuesday night, the traffic commission of which I am a member, so I speak with like very confidence, voted that all the streets within basically a quarter mile

439
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,908
of the T stops in Medford would have resident permit parking.

440
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:08,436
So unless they're private ways and that's a whole nother thing.

441
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:15,057
So actually they can't get a permit on a Medford street and all those streets permit parking.

442
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:24,079
So if you were to move into this apartment building and not be able to fit your car in there, you can't, you have nowhere you'd have to find somewhere to pay to keep your car.

443
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:24,499
Okay.

444
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:25,119
Okay.

445
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:25,960
That's really helpful.

446
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,780
Thank you, Alicia.

447
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,220
Right.

448
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:34,322
I do want to raise as we're doing this though, because maybe then we do want them to,

449
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:37,353
to look at reducing the parking hour.

450
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:41,794
So the, this, sorry, I'm gonna phrase this.

451
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:49,937
Their permit refusal letter was looked at under the old zoning code that said two spots per unit.

452
00:48:50,077 --> 00:48:51,458
Their letter is dated April 26.

453
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:58,220
That is right in that window where we were looking to have the new, and I don't know the date of their application.

454
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,822
That was just as the new zoning was passed, but before it was,

455
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:04,319
approved official.

456
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:16,323
Under the new zoning, within a half mile of the transit, we only require 0.8 spots per dwelling unit.

457
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:20,764
So this is a risk of the applicants though, they have to go to ZBA next week.

458
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:28,766
And under the zoning board, the zoning board might agree with that argument that actually

459
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:35,821
Technically it's a variance, but if they had applied a few weeks later with this exact same project, no variance would be needed.

460
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:45,986
Because we have in fact updated the zoning to reflect the desires of the community.

461
00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:57,212
Obviously this board is not actually approving or disapproving, we're making recommendations, conditions to the zoning board.

462
00:50:01,003 --> 00:50:05,345
So I actually, I tossed that back to the applicant, I guess.

463
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:13,229
With what, it just being a question of?

464
00:50:15,871 --> 00:50:19,973
We don't wanna, I don't wanna condition something that the new,

465
00:50:25,073 --> 00:50:30,781
sorry, that they then causes a problem with the Zoning Board of Appeals.

466
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:41,676
So actually, I'm getting legal advice, I can say that, that the new zoning actually does apply now for this building.

467
00:50:42,737 --> 00:51:07,492
Um, so we'd have to work out what that means with the zoning board of appeals and make sure that they understand what zoning applies to this application, because it sounds to me like the community development board would be probably more comfortable with usable parking spots that are truly usable that people will use under the building, but fewer of them, because there's room for them.

468
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,874
Um, with the understanding that

469
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:17,799
Any residents of this building, even though half the building is in Medford they cannot get Medford parking permits.

470
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:28,829
And I think we would write that into our conditions Amanda, that this is this thing you can't get residential parking permits, because there's no frontage in the city of Medford.

471
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:40,057
Yeah, and I think I recognize that really wasn't a question directed at me but if I could just jump in, I think that was likely be welcomed.

472
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:41,637
I also think that it would be.

473
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:54,305
I recognize you might you might have counsel that I don't see him or her on the on my screen but I would just say that if, if your recommendations are being made with that assumption that's new zone that's applicable.

474
00:51:54,665 --> 00:52:04,030
that I would hope that that is understood by the board next week too, so that there's no kind of back and forth as to what applies here.

475
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:21,420
But I think I agree that this would be a much more practical building if it was usable, and considering its proximity to public transport, that that is more consistent with really what the needs of folks who are going to inhabit these units once they're built.

476
00:52:23,745 --> 00:52:33,809
Well, certainly, Alicia, you can make sure the ZBA and your staff are in tune with that for next week's hearing, I'm sure, or meeting.

477
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:37,710
Right.

478
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:49,175
We didn't really prepare for the idea that there were these nuances of things that were in between when these... Jonathan, if you're willing to speak, I think that would be...

479
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:56,053
I realized we didn't ask you to be here for this case, but it was your firm that helped draft the new zoning.

480
00:52:58,935 --> 00:53:03,958
So Jonathan is a lawyer that we've asked actually to be on for the next hearing.

481
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:07,260
So Jonathan.

482
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,220
Jonathan, welcome.

483
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,301
Thanks for being with us today.

484
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:10,942
My pleasure.

485
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:11,422
Good evening.

486
00:53:12,643 --> 00:53:13,463
Everyone hear me okay?

487
00:53:14,964 --> 00:53:15,204
Yes.

488
00:53:15,284 --> 00:53:15,504
Great.

489
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:41,725
Yeah, what the Zoning Act says is that zoning amendments will apply except to a building permit or special permit that's been issued prior to the first publication of the advertisement for the CDB's ad, public hearing advertisement for the zoning amendment.

490
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:45,926
Now, generally, that's applied because applicants

491
00:53:46,695 --> 00:53:58,777
wants protection from new zoning amendments, which are often more stringent, the applicant always has the option of applying current zoning to the project.

492
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:12,720
So even if the first ad for the public hearing had not been issued before a billing permit had been issued,

493
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:19,112
from just from hearing the conversation doesn't seem like any building permit or special permit has been issued.

494
00:54:19,972 --> 00:54:26,177
So the new zoning would apply anyway, but it would always be the applicant's option to proceed under new zoning anyway.

495
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:47,276
So I feel like we could resolve this for this evening by making it a recommendation of the planning board and then the applicant can decide.

496
00:54:47,336 --> 00:54:51,338
I believe the applicant's planning to be in front of the ZBA next Thursday, is that correct?

497
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:54,500
Yeah.

498
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:00,364
Then you have time to make that decision.

499
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:06,167
I mean, it's not a lot of time because you would need to redraw the plan, I would think.

500
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:11,533
Um, I also what is the board comfortable with?

501
00:55:11,593 --> 00:55:14,094
I'm just trying to work out what's possible.

502
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:22,577
But do we have other let's maybe we put this sub issue aside and ask if there are any other.

503
00:55:24,198 --> 00:55:27,939
Emily, were you did you complete your you had a few things you wanted to talk about?

504
00:55:27,959 --> 00:55:30,100
I'm all set.

505
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,280
Thank you, David.

506
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:31,640
Okay.

507
00:55:32,721 --> 00:55:34,481
Any other board members or should we start?

508
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:42,274
narrowing down on whether we want to approve, and if so, what conditions we want to attach.

509
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:46,518
Okay.

510
00:55:47,779 --> 00:55:48,279
Any thoughts?

511
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,021
People feeling good about this?

512
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:57,826
I think if we're otherwise feeling good.

513
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:04,212
We've got the condition, I think, perhaps the step out, is there is a recommendation.

514
00:56:04,733 --> 00:56:12,982
Sounds like the applicants okay and looking into the feasibility of that Milton help me what's the right term for, for that.

515
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,863
additional step for the second exit.

516
00:56:18,563 --> 00:56:20,225
Second egress from the garage.

517
00:56:20,405 --> 00:56:21,045
A stoop, maybe.

518
00:56:21,806 --> 00:56:22,146
Okay.

519
00:56:22,707 --> 00:56:22,967
Okay.

520
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,068
So a stoop for egress.

521
00:56:28,491 --> 00:56:35,136
I think, to ensure that there's some electric charging infrastructure in the parking area.

522
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:36,777
That's on my list.

523
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:45,951
recommendation to reduce the number of parking spaces in accordance with current zoning?

524
00:56:47,272 --> 00:56:49,054
How do people feel about that?

525
00:56:49,094 --> 00:56:56,500
Sounds good.

526
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:06,208
I agree with that, but there's a question of what they were doing seven

527
00:57:08,936 --> 00:57:11,338
for three and a half units previously.

528
00:57:12,078 --> 00:57:24,487
So does that mean they're going to do like three now, or because that would be current zoning right point eight of 3.5.

529
00:57:25,248 --> 00:57:26,829
There was also a visitor spot included.

530
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:54,207
If I may, I also want to add just in thinking this through, and I apologize that I don't have the answer to it off the top of my head but I would also want to look back at the approvals that we received in Somerville, and make sure that while they don't require parking.

531
00:57:55,055 --> 00:58:03,857
that a modification to this plan set wouldn't then require some sort of a modification to what we have already received for a special permit in that community.

532
00:58:04,198 --> 00:58:15,321
So we can do some diligence on our end as far as that's concerned, but I don't wanna over promise if we can't deliver on that without then seeking a second round of modifications to the approvals.

533
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:23,963
It almost seems to me that the whole garage should be given a second look.

534
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:35,152
parking drive by also everything.

535
00:58:35,272 --> 00:58:43,617
Would, would you have time, if, if what we do here is phrased in terms of a recommendation to CPA.

536
00:58:45,032 --> 00:59:02,159
Will your team be able to talk about the substance of not only what they'd like to see, maybe rework the design a little bit, but also comment on whether that presents a problem, as you mentioned, in connection with your Somerville approvals.

537
00:59:02,379 --> 00:59:05,120
Is a week enough time for you to get comfortable with that?

538
00:59:05,901 --> 00:59:06,321
Absolutely.

539
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:22,212
Okay, so I think that we can still go forward on a recommendation basis since it's really the ZBA's decision, and they would have the information in front of them to make the decision, I think.

540
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:24,293
Does that make sense?

541
00:59:24,313 --> 00:59:27,554
Okay.

542
00:59:30,575 --> 00:59:33,937
Unless there's more discussion, would someone like to propose a motion?

543
00:59:39,187 --> 00:59:42,269
If I'm not, I was not taking full notes.

544
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:49,654
If I don't want to put this on you, Amanda, did anyone capture what the actual recommendation was so that we can provide a motion?

545
00:59:49,674 --> 00:59:56,418
I have a couple drafted, and you all can please feel free to comment and change.

546
00:59:56,538 --> 00:59:58,139
But basically,

547
01:00:01,243 --> 01:00:12,571
that the applicant explore feasibility of including a stoop for a second egress from the garage, that the applicant ensure that there is some electric charging infrastructure in the parking area.

548
01:00:13,511 --> 01:00:18,575
And this is the one where I'm sure I'd love some feedback.

549
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:28,542
So David had mentioned a recommendation to reduce the number of parking spaces to be in accordance with current zoning so long as

550
01:00:29,327 --> 01:00:34,932
the modification to the plan set does not trigger a second approval process in Somerville.

551
01:00:38,314 --> 01:00:39,375
That sounded good to me.

552
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:44,840
Yeah.

553
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,821
Would someone like to offer a motion on that?

554
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:56,990
I will offer that motion as well as in addition to the compliance and recommendation, the original recommendations by the department heads as stated.

555
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:03,409
to, and the actual recommendations that Amanda Central has already read out.

556
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:07,032
Anyone want a second motion.

557
01:01:08,053 --> 01:01:09,694
Do we have a second.

558
01:01:09,754 --> 01:01:11,095
This is Christy I'll second.

559
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:13,117
Excellent.

560
01:01:13,817 --> 01:01:16,099
Let's have a roll call vote.

561
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:16,820
Deanna Peabody.

562
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:17,681
Hi.

563
01:01:19,122 --> 01:01:19,762
Clyson dress.

564
01:01:20,863 --> 01:01:20,983
Hi.

565
01:01:22,064 --> 01:01:22,645
Christy doubt.

566
01:01:23,585 --> 01:01:25,207
I only had one.

567
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,120
Jackie Furtado.

568
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,000
Aye.

569
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,901
And I'm an aye as well.

570
01:01:34,741 --> 01:01:36,862
Thank you very much to the applicant team.

571
01:01:37,182 --> 01:01:40,962
Thanks for your participation and visiting with us a second time on this one.

572
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:42,022
Thank you.

573
01:01:42,182 --> 01:01:43,263
We appreciate all your comments.

574
01:01:43,823 --> 01:01:44,383
Have a good night.

575
01:01:45,403 --> 01:01:45,723
Thank you.

576
01:01:46,543 --> 01:01:47,103
Thank you.

577
01:01:53,064 --> 01:01:53,504
Okay, great.

578
01:01:53,764 --> 01:01:56,745
So we have our second project to consider at this point.

579
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:04,542
And this is similarly from a procedural point of view we have a site plan review with a recommendation to the zoning board.

580
01:02:05,603 --> 01:02:10,084
This in connection with a development proposed for 162 mystic app.

581
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:12,625
Let me read the notice on that one.

582
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:32,546
The community development board shall conduct a meeting tonight after 6pm on zoom relative to an application for site plan reviews submitted by theory wellness to operate a retail marijuana dispensary in an existing structure in a commercial to zoning district.

583
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:40,591
The project is subject to a site plan review special permit for the city of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 section 94 dash 332 three.

584
01:02:43,492 --> 01:02:45,755
and requires approvals from the Board of Appeals.

585
01:02:46,576 --> 01:02:58,891
Therefore, the Community Development Board will perform a site plan review and submit its recommendations to the Zoning Board, who will be the special permit granting authority for the site plan review special permit.

586
01:03:01,892 --> 01:03:18,566
Before we get into the substance we thought and we invited attorney Silverstein to address the board and the members of the public to just give us a little bit of background as I think we know because we were involved in some of the updates to zoning relative to this type of a use.

587
01:03:20,304 --> 01:03:34,253
There is a whole nother set of hurdles that this kind of a user has to go through or regulatory steps that they must pass before a proposal like this gets to this board.

588
01:03:34,954 --> 01:03:38,116
And among the issues is a host agreement that

589
01:03:39,657 --> 01:03:40,938
user has struck with the city.

590
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:52,885
So, to give us a bit of background on that, and we asked Attorney Silverstein to be here and I'd like to ask him to sort of take the floor and give us that introduction.

591
01:03:52,945 --> 01:03:56,087
We appreciate you being with us yet again, twice tonight.

592
01:03:58,169 --> 01:03:59,890
Certainly.

593
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:07,194
So yes, Mr. Chair, as you said, there are a number of different procedural and permitting requirements that

594
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:14,329
marijuana businesses have to satisfy in order to open for business.

595
01:04:14,529 --> 01:04:20,152
Obviously, they need licensure at the state level from the Cannabis Control Commission.

596
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:31,980
Before they can even apply to the Cannabis Control Commission, they have to enter into a host community agreement with the community in which they seek to open.

597
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:38,464
That requirement's very recently, within the past week, been relaxed.

598
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:45,084
to a certain extent, it's a whole new landscape with respect to host community agreements.

599
01:04:46,944 --> 01:04:52,226
But in any case, this applicant did enter into a host community agreement with the mayor.

600
01:04:53,286 --> 01:05:07,750
That host community agreement provides for a number of benefits to the city and contains a number of requirements for the applicant with respect to the design and operation of the facility.

601
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:17,694
I believe that host community agreement was submitted with the application materials, and it's certainly a public record.

602
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:38,830
And then, of course, under the relatively recent zoning that the council passed, that the CDB weighed in on, the applicant will also have to get a special permit from the ZBA, and because of the size of this facility, will require site plan approval.

603
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:44,121
So that's sort of a very high level overview of where things stand procedurally.

604
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:48,543
I'm happy to weigh in on any questions that members of the board might have.

605
01:05:50,264 --> 01:05:58,648
If I can take the first question for you, which is the host agreement, host community agreement.

606
01:05:59,557 --> 01:06:14,305
Is it possible that that might sort of bump up against some of the things that we typically comment on on a site plan review, lighting and landscaping?

607
01:06:14,385 --> 01:06:24,811
And I mean, are there places where an issue may have already been addressed in that agreement and we need to honor that?

608
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,712
Or what's the interplay between the two if we know?

609
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:29,113
Maybe it's such a new thing we're not sure.

610
01:06:30,718 --> 01:06:47,021
Sure, so the requirements in the host community agreement are contractual, and the HCA is very clear that it's not intended to replace or limit this board's authority or any permitting board's authority.

611
01:06:48,281 --> 01:06:58,403
Obviously, if the ZBA, say, were to impose a condition that were directly inconsistent with the provision of the HCA,

612
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:04,982
The applicant would be in a position of either having to violate a contract or violate a permit.

613
01:07:05,402 --> 01:07:07,664
That would be less than desirable.

614
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:12,006
But in all honesty, I haven't seen that happen.

615
01:07:14,347 --> 01:07:15,508
Usually that doesn't happen.

616
01:07:15,568 --> 01:07:21,231
And I'll say that the host community agreement doesn't have a lot in terms of specifics.

617
01:07:24,131 --> 01:07:29,893
You know, it says things like the applicant has to spend a certain amount on site beautification and landscaping.

618
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:31,994
Well, that's not going to be inconsistent.

619
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:41,098
It's probably going to be more specifically governed at the permitting level, but it was really sort of a minimum standard.

620
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:52,562
The only thing I could see with this particular application is that a permitting board had a problem with the art center that is

621
01:07:53,105 --> 01:08:00,627
you know, uniquely aspect of this project, then that could be problematic.

622
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:04,408
But again, I wouldn't imagine that's likely to be the case.

623
01:08:05,889 --> 01:08:11,870
And then I think there are minimum parking requirements in those community agreement, but again, those are minimums.

624
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:21,393
So other than that, I don't think there's a whole lot that should be bumping up against either this board's recommendations or the ZPA's conditions.

625
01:08:23,514 --> 01:08:24,775
Excellent, thank you for the info.

626
01:08:24,895 --> 01:08:27,138
Any other questions for Attorney Silverstein at this point?

627
01:08:31,262 --> 01:08:31,823
All right, thank you.

628
01:08:31,843 --> 01:08:36,427
Thank you again for educating us a bit on how that works.

629
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:43,835
At this point, could we ask the theory wellness team to begin the presentation?

630
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:46,989
Good evening, everybody.

631
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:48,151
My name is Matt von Basie.

632
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:49,192
I'm with Boulder Engineering.

633
01:08:49,232 --> 01:08:50,193
We're the civil engineers.

634
01:08:51,054 --> 01:08:57,521
On the call also is Brandon Pollack, who's the CEO of Theory Wellness, and Sean Kelley with Van Assen Associates, who's the traffic consultant.

635
01:08:58,983 --> 01:09:03,368
As many of you are likely aware, the project site is at 162 Mystic Ave on the east side of Mystic.

636
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:08,194
the old colonial Volkswagen dealer which I think moved down the road a little bit.

637
01:09:08,635 --> 01:09:16,085
Since then I think it's been used largely as vehicle storage and a few other various uses but the building's been abandoned.

638
01:09:17,106 --> 01:09:21,171
As you noted we're here for a special permit for under a marijuana retailer which we're doing with the ZBA.

639
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:24,473
and site plan review which this board will be giving their recommendation.

640
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:30,675
We're proposing reuse of the existing structure which will be rehabilitated quite a bit.

641
01:09:30,995 --> 01:09:36,417
It's a 19,000 square foot structure that back about two-thirds will be used for the theory wellness use.

642
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:38,818
The front of the building will be a two-story art center.

643
01:09:39,938 --> 01:09:44,239
Before I jump into the site plan and put everybody to sleep, I know Brandon's on the call.

644
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:47,320
I don't know if he wanted to just quickly introduce himself and discuss.

645
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,421
I know it's been a couple year process to get to here.

646
01:09:51,832 --> 01:09:52,533
Yeah, sure.

647
01:09:52,654 --> 01:09:55,399
Can everyone hear me and see me?

648
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:56,581
We sure can.

649
01:09:58,507 --> 01:09:59,187
Yeah, thank you.

650
01:09:59,527 --> 01:10:00,428
Thank you for having me.

651
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:01,808
Hope everyone's having a good evening.

652
01:10:03,169 --> 01:10:09,851
I'll try to keep it brief, but most importantly, I want to be here as a resource to answer any questions that the board might have.

653
01:10:09,911 --> 01:10:17,834
But essentially, we were one of the first cannabis companies that began operating in 2017 in medical cannabis here in the Commonwealth.

654
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:25,457
And we've been operating adult use, also known as recreational facilities.

655
01:10:26,557 --> 01:10:26,757
Since 2019.

656
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:36,825
We currently have two recreational facilities in Massachusetts one in Great Barrington, and one in the city of chickapee, and this would be our third and final location.

657
01:10:37,746 --> 01:10:46,913
We've been working on the process for a couple years here in Medford and are really pleased to be at the point where we can present our plans to both this board and then the CBA.

658
01:10:47,794 --> 01:10:57,398
Next week, we've, I think, done a good job of selecting a site which is conscious of having sufficient parking to reduce issues with traffic.

659
01:10:58,278 --> 01:11:14,104
We're also very, very pleased to be giving back to the community in a variety of ways, including during our construction process, constructing and then donating the front of the building to the arts collaborative here in Medford, which is a pretty unique part of the project.

660
01:11:15,124 --> 01:11:16,645
Like I said, we've been doing this for a long time.

661
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:23,627
Our operations run professionally and smoothly and we're here to be a resource we know it's a new use for the city.

662
01:11:24,928 --> 01:11:30,810
And we'll certainly do our job to make it a smooth compliant and discreet business in the city.

663
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:38,213
So I'll turn it maybe back over to Jonathan to kind of run through the overview of the site plans and so forth.

664
01:11:46,298 --> 01:11:47,159
Can everybody see my screen.

665
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:48,681
Yes.

666
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:49,702
Great.

667
01:11:49,982 --> 01:12:04,937
So this is the existing old colonial Volkswagen building which is being, as I said, pretty substantially renovated for a two story office use here in the front is this black lines kind of delineator, the space in the center here is largely storage space and then the back the retail part of the building.

668
01:12:05,858 --> 01:12:23,674
When we were laying out the building looking at this for a couple years, the first thing we identified is the site is pretty largely impervious as exists, just given the auto use these the double stack cars I think coming down this way so there wasn't really any use for us to keep that wide a pavement wasn't going to give us extra parking.

669
01:12:24,135 --> 01:12:31,281
So we've been designed laying out the parking basically laid out the minimum driveway with in the parking along, along that driveway and kept this.

670
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:35,764
this southern side as a landscape buffer, a little additional green space.

671
01:12:36,865 --> 01:12:39,646
Additionally, relative access is the existing access into the facility.

672
01:12:39,686 --> 01:12:45,490
There is an existing paved loop road that comes in front of the building, which I suspect was used to display cars.

673
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:49,532
When it was a car dealership, this project doesn't have a use for that.

674
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:56,617
So removing that and allowing there to be some landscaping and green space in front of the building felt like a worthy addition as well.

675
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:12,986
It's part of the project proposing a fully compliant parking lot with the zoning but also ADA regulations so ADA parking spaces for the yard use and then in a parking spaces for for the theory wellness use in the back.

676
01:13:14,922 --> 01:13:30,027
pedestrian connectivity there is no no sidewalks there today, just mostly vehicular loading bays and things along the side of the building so we proposing a sidewalk along the entire front of the building which will serve the entrance into into theory wellness and also into the, the our collaborative.

677
01:13:31,107 --> 01:13:36,871
Some of the conditions of the host agreement were that the project provide a blue bike station.

678
01:13:37,771 --> 01:13:49,279
So that's proposed here at the front we're going to work with Mr. Blake at the city just to make sure we have the details for that on our on our final plans and then also providing an EV charging station we're proposing here down at the at the front corner.

679
01:13:53,309 --> 01:14:03,035
The project, if you're driven by the site it has some existing lights there these gray little symbols here, as you come through the lights are a little, a little on the older side there.

680
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:17,563
They're not led they're not full cut off they're kind of a floodlight type later they're here on these poles and also along, along the front of the building so we're proposing removing all of those lights, I'm proposing new led fully downcast dark sky compliant lights along.

681
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:27,378
along the edge of the parking and then similarly some wall pack lakes along the basically all sides of the building for security reasons, Jane down concluded a lighting plan in our in our plans.

682
01:14:31,152 --> 01:14:42,540
stormwater when we did submit our original submission we had kind of taken the stance which which is often the case that the projects, pretty substantially reducing impervious area so inherently is going to reduce the amount of stormwater from the site.

683
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:52,106
That said, the, the city engineer did request that we meet a specific requirement that one inch per of runoff stored on site for the total impervious area which we've done.

684
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:54,308
We've done that through proposing some

685
01:14:55,168 --> 01:15:05,798
planted dry swales along this landscape buffer here and then an underground storage system to collect a roof runoff.

686
01:15:05,818 --> 01:15:07,800
The project does have one loading area.

687
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:08,301
It's here.

688
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:09,722
This is an existing loading bay.

689
01:15:09,762 --> 01:15:16,348
Many of the loading bays are getting closed off and either new window facades put in or having them bricked off.

690
01:15:16,388 --> 01:15:17,269
This one will remain.

691
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:17,610
This is a

692
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,761
I guess a delivery acceptance room and storage area.

693
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:32,888
Deliveries to the building will be just just via van, no large WB 67s or large trucks coming in just small van vans which you can come in here and load through this area right here.

694
01:15:42,633 --> 01:15:51,620
As I know that they're doing quite a bit of renovation on the building, we did submit some some elevations and some color perspectives of what the architect kind of rendered the final product would look like.

695
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,523
The interior building will have new sprinkler systems.

696
01:15:55,583 --> 01:16:01,664
Obviously, they're going to construct the entire heart center and all the different facilities associated with the theory wellness use.

697
01:16:01,985 --> 01:16:16,529
And so there'll be facade upgrades relative to repainting all the siding, some awnings and canopies, additional storefront features for some of the loading bays, and then some other architectural features relative to the different uses.

698
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:17,899
coming through.

699
01:16:17,999 --> 01:16:19,501
So this would be looking to the back.

700
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,963
This is the bend in the building kind of near the back half.

701
01:16:23,644 --> 01:16:25,185
This would be the theory wellness entrance.

702
01:16:27,467 --> 01:16:29,889
This is the back of the building looking back towards Mr. Gaff.

703
01:16:35,573 --> 01:16:40,917
We did get a chance to review some of the city department letters that came in over the past week or so.

704
01:16:42,651 --> 01:16:49,599
And I'll run through those before I do, I know Sean's on the call, the traffic consultant, if you wanna just quickly touch base on the traffic impact analysis.

705
01:16:51,681 --> 01:16:52,401
Sure, thanks, Matt.

706
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:57,767
I did put, if it's possible, I can share my screen as well and just run through a couple of the key points in the study.

707
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:05,095
Everyone see that okay?

708
01:17:05,745 --> 01:17:06,747
Yes, thank you.

709
01:17:07,648 --> 01:17:13,196
So first off, again, have the team, Mr chairman members of the board again Sean Kelly with the NASA associates.

710
01:17:13,697 --> 01:17:15,260
Thank you for having us before us tonight.

711
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,868
I think we'd like to just, you know, briefly walk through our study some of the key points and findings that'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

712
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:38,626
I think you know Matt did a good job of describing the project site again it's no one sees to mystic Avenue on the eastern side of the quarter mystic Avenue 38 is a state numbered road it's under the jurisdiction of nasty ot 25 mile an hour speed limit the quarter carries around 15,500 cars in a weekday and about 14,000 cars on a Saturday.

713
01:17:41,468 --> 01:17:46,453
The peak hour flows range anywhere from about 1300 am to about 1500 in the PM.

714
01:17:47,133 --> 01:17:50,216
The Saturday flows are a bit lower than the 1100 current hour range.

715
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,860
We did a study in accordance with industry guidelines.

716
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,442
We went out and looked at existing traffic volumes I just mentioned.

717
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,023
We looked at vehicle speeds.

718
01:17:58,584 --> 01:18:07,452
As I mentioned, the quarter is only posted for 25 miles an hour, but what we found were that people are typically traveling around 33 miles an hour in each direction, so they are exceeding the speed limit.

719
01:18:08,112 --> 01:18:09,993
And certainly some of those speeds are even higher.

720
01:18:10,934 --> 01:18:14,095
We looked at the crash history, there was no notable crash history in the area.

721
01:18:14,495 --> 01:18:19,137
All of the intersections that we evaluated came in below the state's average, there was no notable crash history.

722
01:18:20,638 --> 01:18:25,740
With respect to the project, we rely on what's known as Institute of Transportation Engineers, the ITE.

723
01:18:26,241 --> 01:18:32,784
So we ran some trip generation based on the size of the facility and really tried to compare that to what the prior automobile dealership would do if it was operational.

724
01:18:33,764 --> 01:18:39,469
In the morning peak hour, it's about 36 additional trips total, which is about a little less than 20 in and out.

725
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:44,393
Not all of these trips come in the same direction, so the impact to any particular segment will be less than that.

726
01:18:45,294 --> 01:18:47,736
Even peak hour, you're getting closer to about a trip a minute.

727
01:18:48,216 --> 01:18:51,719
Again, that's one every other minute entering, one every other minute exiting.

728
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:59,486
Then really the largest increase, as you can imagine, would be your Saturday midday, but that's the time period where traffic volumes out there are quite a bit lower than during the commuter peaks.

729
01:19:01,286 --> 01:19:09,212
The conclusions to our study you know we even with the higher speeds what we found was that you know there was no safety deficiencies in the sight lines that exist, you know, it's a straight tangent roadway.

730
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,834
Certainly meet all applicable design criteria.

731
01:19:12,655 --> 01:19:21,462
Again, we walked the trip generation increases it's about a car every minute to two minutes during the commuter hours and then you know the real higher volumes of the Saturday when volumes out there are lower.

732
01:19:22,422 --> 01:19:27,285
We did look at the parking based on ITE date of the parking, sufficient to meet the peak demands.

733
01:19:28,265 --> 01:19:39,771
Really our recommendations were focused primarily, we did our assessment on the site access, making sure it's done in appropriate MUTC design criteria, stop signs, pavement marking, signage, things of that nature.

734
01:19:40,571 --> 01:19:44,894
Making sure any landscaping and signage doesn't block site lines to ensure you have safe access and egress.

735
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:56,543
And then really what we always recommend whenever one of these new dispensaries open is that the applicant work with the local police department to work on an opening plan in terms of traffic and parking operations.

736
01:19:56,583 --> 01:20:00,146
You typically will see a little bit more of a rush when they first open.

737
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:02,127
It's a curiosity thing, people want to check it out.

738
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:09,153
We typically would just recommend that we have a police detail perhaps on the opening weekend just until things settle in.

739
01:20:09,173 --> 01:20:11,715
So those are really the recommendations of our assessment.

740
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:23,855
We did also, you know, receive a letter from the city's traffic engineer Todd Blake where he had outlined a number of other recommendations that he felt were appropriate to you know further mitigate the impacts of the projects.

741
01:20:27,216 --> 01:20:28,757
I think my screen lost my share.

742
01:20:29,117 --> 01:20:29,637
Are you seeing it.

743
01:20:33,557 --> 01:20:34,057
There we go.

744
01:20:34,097 --> 01:20:35,259
Sorry about that.

745
01:20:35,559 --> 01:20:39,342
So one of the recommendations was to install some solar powered radar feedback signage.

746
01:20:39,482 --> 01:20:42,885
So, as I mentioned, you know, it's it's 25 mile an hour posted out there.

747
01:20:42,905 --> 01:20:44,467
They're typically going around 33.

748
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:51,353
I think we're all familiar with these signs, they're solar powered, it gives you your speed feedback and if you're speeding, you know, the sign will flash.

749
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:52,874
until you reduce your speed.

750
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:59,459
Typically these can drop speeds by about five miles an hour in each direction if you have those installed.

751
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:07,645
So certainly it's a measure that we concur is warranted given the speeds that we've observed and the applicant is committed to work with the city to install these.

752
01:21:08,505 --> 01:21:10,647
Another recommendation dealt with the sidewalk.

753
01:21:10,687 --> 01:21:13,189
The sidewalk along our frontage is in pretty bad shape.

754
01:21:14,009 --> 01:21:15,731
Certainly probably wouldn't meet ADA compliance.

755
01:21:16,191 --> 01:21:18,373
There was a recommendation to repair that and bring it up to

756
01:21:19,013 --> 01:21:22,756
to current standards and certainly would be agreeing to do that as well.

757
01:21:24,097 --> 01:21:30,002
As Matt mentioned, there's a loop driveway that's in front of the site today that was utilized when the dealership was there.

758
01:21:30,022 --> 01:21:34,085
We're going to use the southern driveway as our access point.

759
01:21:34,245 --> 01:21:37,848
The northern curb cut really isn't needed because we're not going to have vehicular access there.

760
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:42,512
There's a recommendation to close that and install curbing and we have no issue with that as well.

761
01:21:44,387 --> 01:21:51,872
The city traffic engineer recommended we look at installing painted bump outs or ballers at a number of side street intersections to Mystic Avenue.

762
01:21:52,253 --> 01:21:53,453
These are traffic calming measures.

763
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:55,555
It slows traffic going around the corners.

764
01:21:56,555 --> 01:22:02,880
It provides a disincentive for using the local streets as cut through, and it also shortens the pedestrian crossing, which is always a benefit.

765
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,681
Again, we have no issue.

766
01:22:04,701 --> 01:22:07,343
We certainly are willing to work with the city to implement this measure as well.

767
01:22:08,163 --> 01:22:28,632
And then the last recommendation from the city was to develop a really conceptual improvement plan where we look at the entire corridor from Preston Street to Harvard Street, look at where the bus stops are today and look at what the pavement markings are today as far as bike lane accommodations, the center turn lane, crosswalks, things of that nature and develop a plan that more cohesively works with the corridor as a whole.

768
01:22:28,673 --> 01:22:33,375
And again, we've talked to that client and they're certainly willing to work with the city to implement that as well.

769
01:22:34,395 --> 01:22:49,410
The only caveat I would add is that, you know, these are, this is a mass dot quarter so what we can, you know, commit to working to develop this design and ultimately is going to be a state decision as to whether they want these measures implemented but provided the states on board, you know, we certainly have no issue and want to work with the city to improve the core to the extent we can.

770
01:22:50,491 --> 01:22:51,732
And that's really all I have for tonight.

771
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,135
Be happy to answer any questions anyone has on traffic.

772
01:23:01,456 --> 01:23:23,837
Are there others from the team who like to continue the presentation or, yeah, just, just a couple more more things I can run through the city department letters just to just kind of our thoughts on those so we received four letters one was from the board of health and outline some different programs and things they might want to implement it before construction pest management system.

773
01:23:25,024 --> 01:23:33,229
you know, solid waste permits for dumpsters, you know, porta potties permits for during construction, and we're amenable obviously to all of those.

774
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:45,376
We did receive fire department comments, and I had spoken to Chief Friedman prior to him issuing those, and those are largely technical relative to the sprinkler system and things like that, and we have no concern with those.

775
01:23:46,637 --> 01:23:50,239
The letter from the Historic District Commission, they had two comments.

776
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:54,482
One was regarding lighting, and I noticed on the rendering it does show the existing

777
01:23:55,002 --> 01:24:01,984
flood mounted lighting and they comment that might not be appropriate and, and our lane plan does does remove those although it doesn't reflect on the rendering.

778
01:24:02,264 --> 01:24:18,729
And they also suggest some color changes on the facade and it's something we're certainly willing to look at I know that the building elevations have been coordinated for for quite a while, as this project work through the city so we can't commit to change the colors but we're certainly willing to, to take a look at it as we, as we finalize it.

779
01:24:19,767 --> 01:24:32,052
And then, then engineering comments which is the bulk of them and again none of them we have have a concern with is the removing of the existing driveway and that we're, we're removing and the construction of the sidewalk along the road.

780
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:34,754
So we'll test information for the stormwater.

781
01:24:34,774 --> 01:24:43,818
The addition of a traditional bike racks we have the blue bike station but a traditional bike rack and we certainly have no issue incorporating that into the plans.

782
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:55,299
There was a question about the loading bay and loading maneuverability I know in our original plans that that space wasn't well noted so, but it is provided at the center of the building there.

783
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:09,731
And then the traffic impact assessment so it was a three recommendations that Sean went through that Todd Blake was nice enough to jump on the phone with, with me and Victor earlier today and we have a pretty good understanding of what he's looking for and we feel comfortable with those we can work with the city.

784
01:25:11,052 --> 01:25:25,049
You're, you and your team are doing such a nice job going, going down all of the open items are identified by the city I appreciate that there were two I didn't hear you mentioned and maybe it's just the old, but the domestic water service.

785
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:32,633
That notation, is that also in the noted that he's minus let you know we're fine with that.

786
01:25:33,053 --> 01:25:38,816
Okay, and then they wanted some some video work to kind of do some more inspections that's fine as well with your team.

787
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:43,939
Correct Yeah, we'd hope to use the existing sewer line but obviously it's crushed once we have to repair.

788
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:44,039
Okay.

789
01:25:49,103 --> 01:25:56,348
Well that's certainly agreeable we've gone down the list and guys have been a thumbs up on almost everything on there so appreciate the cooperation.

790
01:25:57,989 --> 01:26:04,093
Before I turn it to the board, let me just see if there are members of the public who wanted to comment, man, how are we looking on that.

791
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:13,240
Yeah, so actually, I believe we do have someone pull up my thing here yes so

792
01:26:14,055 --> 01:26:28,887
Uh, Laurel Siegel, who's the board president of the Medford Arts Collaborative, um, was hoping to, which is the entity that I think would be, um, within the, the, the arts center at the front of the building, um, is available.

793
01:26:29,247 --> 01:26:31,809
Uh, Laurel, did you want to make a comment tonight?

794
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:34,852
I don't have any immediate comments.

795
01:26:34,912 --> 01:26:42,438
I mostly wanted to be available to be able to answer any questions, um, that the board might have with respect to the plans for the arts center.

796
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:43,921
Great.

797
01:26:43,961 --> 01:26:44,541
Thank you, Laurel.

798
01:26:45,301 --> 01:26:46,822
Thanks for being here and participating.

799
01:26:47,382 --> 01:26:51,983
Any other members of the public out there, Amanda, from your vantage point?

800
01:26:53,263 --> 01:27:09,266
So if anybody wants to make a comment, if you could raise your hand, and I'm just going to check the city's email, which is ocd at medford-ma.gov in case of any last minute messages, but I am seeing none.

801
01:27:09,286 --> 01:27:10,866
Okay.

802
01:27:12,245 --> 01:27:18,009
In that case, let me open it up to our board members, any questions for the team here.

803
01:27:27,955 --> 01:27:32,638
No, there must be some questions out there, David I'm not leaving his hand.

804
01:27:33,778 --> 01:27:37,641
I'm not seeing you on my layout I'm sorry my apologies, please the floor is yours.

805
01:27:37,661 --> 01:27:38,761
All right.

806
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,091
Laurel, thanks for joining.

807
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:48,133
Can you tell us a little bit about the program that will be in the Arts Center?

808
01:27:49,654 --> 01:27:50,074
Absolutely.

809
01:27:50,154 --> 01:27:59,879
So it'll be a multi-use space with a variety of individual artist studio spaces, classrooms,

810
01:28:00,566 --> 01:28:02,488
on and a large open space.

811
01:28:02,908 --> 01:28:11,376
What was the showroom of the dealership on the first floor that we use for community events and performances and also serve as a passive gallery space.

812
01:28:13,097 --> 01:28:24,487
So is the is your organization in charge of this, let's call it the fit out of that space.

813
01:28:26,172 --> 01:28:27,353
The ultimate fit out, yes.

814
01:28:27,773 --> 01:28:32,456
We're working closely with theory that is doing quite a bit of renovation, as you know, to the space.

815
01:28:32,616 --> 01:28:37,098
But when it comes to the final interior fit out, that will be us.

816
01:28:38,899 --> 01:28:39,099
Great.

817
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:41,881
And that's not part of this project per se?

818
01:28:43,201 --> 01:28:44,382
Or will it be built together?

819
01:28:45,856 --> 01:28:57,601
You know, well, our anticipation is that once the certificate of occupancy has been issued, then we will come in and we'll be adding, you know, final light fixtures, security systems and the like to the space.

820
01:28:58,161 --> 01:28:58,581
Understood.

821
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:00,662
Great, thank you.

822
01:29:02,522 --> 01:29:14,287
So, I think I heard Matthew that you addressed the comment about a little more color and life.

823
01:29:15,733 --> 01:29:19,434
I certainly would second that opinion.

824
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:32,058
I think it came from the historic commission maybe I could be wrong, but in any case, I think, you know, given that this is going to be a really sounds like a really great place for the arts.

825
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:48,303
In Medford, I think the exterior exterior treatment of the building would really deserve a little more visual interest than what we're seeing in the, in the renderings that you've shown.

826
01:29:49,730 --> 01:30:00,633
Just, you know, the one of the reasons I asked Laurel specifically about the program, because I wasn't sure whether it was, you know, visual or performing arts or what but given the fact that it.

827
01:30:00,913 --> 01:30:11,776
These are actually going to be visual artists in this building I couldn't imagine a better, a better place for a public mural than on this building.

828
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:39,978
I think that would be, that would be just lovely especially given the sort of industrial nature of mystic app program that you have inside and it could be something that gets changed regularly or whatever and it would be a really easy way to sort of give that sort of that life to the building and could possibly have a tie into the retailers behind but I think there's a basically a missed opportunity with something like that.

829
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:49,463
to do something that really grounded the building and program in the city of Medford and that kind of thing.

830
01:30:49,543 --> 01:30:55,185
So I would really encourage you to think about that blank white wall and what you could do to it.

831
01:30:57,366 --> 01:31:09,510
And then my final comment is, and I appreciate that you will undertake some renovations to the sidewalk, but I think, well, I wonder, and maybe

832
01:31:13,571 --> 01:31:39,122
somebody from the city, it's not Victor, but maybe it's, and I'm blanking on his name right now, but the sidewalks along Mystic Ave, is there sort of a big idea about how those sidewalks evolve from the sort of half driveway, half sidewalk,

833
01:31:40,189 --> 01:32:00,560
asphalt, some places, concrete, some places, weird boards and fire equipment on the sidewalks to something that's a little more sort of like complete streets with plans for trees and things like that.

834
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:08,024
And I just wonder if, you know, we're also missing an opportunity here to sort of, you know,

835
01:32:08,918 --> 01:32:28,053
create a case study for for how mystic app could have really a better, you know, street edge in this project rather than just sort of repaving the, the, the sidewalks that are there that that are obviously you know almost nobody uses.

836
01:32:36,044 --> 01:32:37,305
I can speak anecdotally to that.

837
01:32:37,565 --> 01:32:39,587
I did speak to Todd Blake, as I mentioned earlier today.

838
01:32:39,647 --> 01:32:43,571
And obviously, you've got a lot on his plate.

839
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:50,356
And as we were discussing some of the recommendations here, he did give a lot of his thoughts on the court, or at least some of his initial ones.

840
01:32:50,396 --> 01:32:51,657
And a lot of them do revolve around

841
01:32:52,418 --> 01:33:08,441
pedestrian safety I know there was a just south of this site there was a pedestrian island and pedestrian signals put in and, and I think that's another thing that he's probably continuing to look at as he as he looks at this project, as far as the streetscape.

842
01:33:09,581 --> 01:33:16,843
I can't speak on that that's that's probably more of a talk question but I suspect his job is tough just given that it's a DLT highway to do that type of thing.

843
01:33:18,003 --> 01:33:26,486
We tried to limit as much pavement as we had along the frontage, removing that turnaround and landscaping just everything except for our driveway entrance.

844
01:33:26,546 --> 01:33:34,808
But again, I can't speak for Todd, but I suspect it's a hard job for him to try to do something like that just relative to the DOT highway.

845
01:33:37,036 --> 01:33:44,440
Do you want me to, as much as I can speak on behalf of Todd, which I can't, but we work closely on these things.

846
01:33:45,441 --> 01:33:52,765
We've been looking at some sort of designs and layouts for other portions of the road with other projects that have come in front of us.

847
01:33:53,385 --> 01:34:01,690
And I know there's a lot of desire, desire to push DOT to do sidewalks that are wide enough, bike lanes, et cetera.

848
01:34:02,912 --> 01:34:06,264
And I am correct that this is on the DOT portion of the road.

849
01:34:06,284 --> 01:34:07,127
Oh, absolutely.

850
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:18,102
So I think that we would like to see some nice complete streets, like the idea of wide sidewalks, trees, bike lanes.

851
01:34:18,162 --> 01:34:19,802
We're trying to figure out how to make that happen.

852
01:34:20,283 --> 01:34:25,164
You only have control of one short section here in front of your property.

853
01:34:26,324 --> 01:34:31,006
There's another property two doors up that's coming in front of the board.

854
01:34:31,246 --> 01:34:35,287
One would hope in the near future, they've done some public meetings.

855
01:34:35,787 --> 01:34:39,969
Some of you have seen the public meetings for the beer hall, that's actually on the other side of the liquor store.

856
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:49,615
So it's our hope that we can try and coordinate between these projects to some extent to improve the walkability of this area.

857
01:34:50,595 --> 01:35:02,562
The difficulty with this is that we don't have right now, here's the plan, this is exactly what we want it to look like, please do your section, but rather it's kind of evolving as we find

858
01:35:03,095 --> 01:35:06,898
that we can do more, that there's more opportunities here.

859
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:20,627
So I think what the city in general is looking for is some trees and shading, wide enough sidewalks that people can pass each other, that sort of thing in this area.

860
01:35:21,188 --> 01:35:29,674
And then the lovely green space where, you know, it's a bit of a refuge if you are walking down the street, so.

861
01:35:31,604 --> 01:35:39,331
And I can jump in, this is Victor, in terms of a specific treatment that Todd talked about on our call earlier today.

862
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:48,679
As Matthew mentioned, there's a pedestrian refuge that's further down the road that is something that he would like to implement.

863
01:35:48,799 --> 01:35:53,303
At some point, there's a crosswalk at Billings, which is about, I don't know,

864
01:35:54,561 --> 01:36:00,626
We don't really have blocks on that side of Mystic Ave, but I guess it would be about a half a block down the road.

865
01:36:03,102 --> 01:36:12,648
That's been well received and he would like to, he plans on working with TOD or DOT in the future to implement that at that location.

866
01:36:13,888 --> 01:36:24,655
And so that's a specific treatment that could happen down the road that I think goes along with your idea, Clay, of a friendlier street to pedestrians.

867
01:36:28,877 --> 01:36:30,578
Clay, do you have some more items for us?

868
01:36:34,618 --> 01:36:35,519
Other board members.

869
01:36:36,701 --> 01:36:37,021
Thank you.

870
01:36:43,308 --> 01:36:44,810
Quiet or am I missing somebody again.

871
01:36:49,655 --> 01:36:55,802
I had a few questions of my own if anyone else wants to jump in line in front of me.

872
01:36:58,235 --> 01:37:07,741
The trees, you are adding some trees along the southern edge, maybe one in the front corner.

873
01:37:08,321 --> 01:37:10,743
Is there a possibility that you could do a bit more with that?

874
01:37:13,596 --> 01:37:16,117
Um, yeah, yeah, I don't want to speak speak for the applicant.

875
01:37:16,137 --> 01:37:24,561
But um, when when Klaus was talking, the one thing I checked on the plan, because he mentioned a friendly streetscape is if we had a shade tree or two along the frontage, and I didn't see one.

876
01:37:24,601 --> 01:37:30,143
So I think of all the places that might be might be an appropriate location for that streetscape concern.

877
01:37:31,203 --> 01:37:32,304
Okay, I think that would be good.

878
01:37:33,124 --> 01:37:40,707
I noted as well, you've got a couple of in the sort of center of the parking lot, just hatched areas.

879
01:37:41,027 --> 01:37:41,568
Could those be

880
01:37:43,202 --> 01:37:48,307
green could those house a tree or two or their conditions there that would preclude that.

881
01:37:49,789 --> 01:38:07,166
No, I don't I don't think their conditions that are precluded precluded in particular there's one that's um that just out into the parking area a little bit where there's that turn around that that would certainly be inappropriate location and the green space along the building maybe something a little on the on the shorter shrub side just being close to the building but probably take a look at putting some plans there as well.

882
01:38:10,961 --> 01:38:28,449
I would just add, and Matt we can talk about this I mean first of all we're very happy to add more green space it's something that I think it's very well fits into the site and our desire to create a comfortable space for our customers but there are cams control relay regulations that prohibit any, you know, large

883
01:38:28,949 --> 01:38:40,454
trees or shrubs that would, you know, kind of get in the way of our cameras so we just would want to always double check that before committing to any, you know, larger living things like that.

884
01:38:40,554 --> 01:38:45,015
That's all, but we can certainly take that under advisement and do the best we can.

885
01:38:46,456 --> 01:38:50,497
Even if, even if it was brush, you know bushes or something or something low.

886
01:38:53,189 --> 01:38:58,251
And do you know what I mean by the areas in the parking lot itself that were hatched up like if those could be.

887
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,351
Yeah, I'll share screen just so we can confirm.

888
01:39:01,411 --> 01:39:02,712
Yeah, same place.

889
01:39:05,372 --> 01:39:07,353
I believe the area you're looking at probably here in here.

890
01:39:08,973 --> 01:39:17,556
I was I guess I was also looking at the little odd, the odd shaped hatched areas in that central

891
01:39:18,546 --> 01:39:19,267
Yeah, there you go.

892
01:39:19,968 --> 01:39:20,268
Oh, here.

893
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:22,270
Yeah, we can take a look at those.

894
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:26,795
The one thing I'd want to double check is the fire egress maneuver.

895
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:31,780
I suspect that part of those areas we need for the fire truck to circle around.

896
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,503
If that's the case, we'd want to keep them hatched.

897
01:39:34,923 --> 01:39:35,564
I'll take a look at it.

898
01:39:35,584 --> 01:39:37,907
If there's a chance for us to add a little landscape on there, we will.

899
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:57,730
If I might add, some of our projects have looked at rather than, because of the fire apparatus, rather than like a raised curb, just doing like a treatment that is more attractive and permeable or something that's, you know, maybe stones or something that's different.

900
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:58,390
It breaks it up.

901
01:39:58,451 --> 01:39:59,571
It's more interesting.

902
01:39:59,631 --> 01:40:06,235
It allows some permeable stuff that's not, that a fire truck can still drive over.

903
01:40:06,255 --> 01:40:09,737
So I'll just put that out there as an idea to look at.

904
01:40:10,716 --> 01:40:10,996
Okay.

905
01:40:14,699 --> 01:40:28,371
Is the, I guess this is a question for Brandon or for arts, but is it, is it that the community arts group is, is leasing the space or so there's actually going to be an organization that's in charge there.

906
01:40:28,431 --> 01:40:32,234
It's not like it's the city and I have to book a spot with the city to use the space.

907
01:40:32,955 --> 01:40:36,138
The association will actually have it more or less like a tenant.

908
01:40:36,849 --> 01:40:42,654
Yeah, it's a sublease, and it's provided free of charge to Laurel's organization.

909
01:40:43,535 --> 01:40:44,216
Okay, great.

910
01:40:44,676 --> 01:40:45,036
Thank you.

911
01:40:48,259 --> 01:40:55,886
Yeah, David, um, the, it's the Medford arts collaborative which has been a 501 c three in the city since I believe 2017.

912
01:40:59,256 --> 01:41:02,498
We've been a loose group of residents since 2017.

913
01:41:02,558 --> 01:41:07,382
We were officially formed as a 501c3 earlier this year.

914
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:10,864
So yeah, we're independent from the city, a private organization.

915
01:41:11,392 --> 01:41:20,180
And it's, can you actually just give us a little, cause there are a number of arts groups in the city, like places in that structure for us.

916
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:21,021
Absolutely.

917
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:35,274
So yeah, arts collaborative Medford is actually, um, the collaborative part is, uh, we have representation from several of the larger arts organizations in the city, which includes, um, the organization I was formerly president of cache.

918
01:41:35,952 --> 01:41:39,495
in Medford, which is the Coalition for Arts, Culture and a Healthy Economy.

919
01:41:39,515 --> 01:41:46,061
It's a coalition of 24 arts and culture organizations promoting the arts and visibility of the arts.

920
01:41:46,161 --> 01:41:47,763
And we run big festivals in the city.

921
01:41:48,424 --> 01:42:01,676
We also have representation from Arts Medford, which is a group that's more focused on individual artists, their members are individual artists in the city and supporting them and creating visibility for them.

922
01:42:02,183 --> 01:42:09,288
We've also had representation from the Medford Arts Council, which is the local agency with the city under the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

923
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:11,910
Thank you.

924
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:18,975
That's really helpful because a lot of the names are floating around, and I think we've all heard of Cachet because of Circle the Square.

925
01:42:18,995 --> 01:42:30,823
And it's helpful, I think, for us to understand that it's not one Medford arts group winning out over the others, but rather you're the pulling together multiple groups in the city.

926
01:42:30,903 --> 01:42:31,804
Absolutely, yes.

927
01:42:33,758 --> 01:42:33,958
Great.

928
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:36,741
Thanks for the info and for participating Laurel, appreciate that.

929
01:42:37,861 --> 01:42:38,242
Interesting.

930
01:42:38,282 --> 01:42:43,586
So there's 10,000 square feet of retail sort of a max that you can, that you can have for this sort of a use.

931
01:42:45,567 --> 01:42:56,376
It's, it's like the retail floor that counts toward that as opposed to some of the other uses, packaging, warehousing, employee break rooms, that sort of stuff.

932
01:42:56,416 --> 01:42:57,517
Is that how they look at it, Brandon?

933
01:42:58,565 --> 01:43:15,455
Yeah, that's my and Victor maybe weigh in as well my understanding of the zoning is that that would apply to what we call the front of the house which is customer accessible space, but it wouldn't preclude us from having you know extra storage areas break rooms employee offices things like that.

934
01:43:15,475 --> 01:43:17,336
Okay, thank you.

935
01:43:19,238 --> 01:43:26,062
Can you, can you explain about the beverage center I just didn't, it just caught my eye I didn't quite understand what that would be.

936
01:43:27,107 --> 01:43:34,890
Yeah, it's essentially proposed as a separate entrance, just where an area where customers can focus on cannabis infused beverages.

937
01:43:36,050 --> 01:43:39,331
It's a new product line that we started launching last year.

938
01:43:39,391 --> 01:43:43,393
It's been very popular with our customers and they're essentially alternatives to alcohol.

939
01:43:44,093 --> 01:43:55,657
So we will include a small amount of cannabis into a seltzer or a soda, something like that.

940
01:43:56,515 --> 01:43:59,497
and they're canned at our facility down in Bridgewater.

941
01:43:59,697 --> 01:44:03,620
So it's a more social cannabis experience.

942
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:11,426
It's a very light dose of cannabis for folks who are just looking to have an alternative to a glass of wine or a beer at the end of the day.

943
01:44:13,055 --> 01:44:18,777
So is the customer experience like going into a small package store or a convenience store with a beverage?

944
01:44:19,117 --> 01:44:20,077
Yeah, that's what we're thinking.

945
01:44:20,117 --> 01:44:31,301
Yeah, it hasn't been done yet, you know, an area focused on beverages, but we think especially being right next to a kind of a high volume liquor store is kind of an interesting element to include for customers.

946
01:44:31,321 --> 01:44:33,362
Interesting.

947
01:44:34,425 --> 01:44:48,246
And I also wanted to ask about the sign, and the approval for the sign has that is that something that is separately going to the building, Commissioner, because I guess I need to ask first before I say more.

948
01:44:49,555 --> 01:45:04,018
I think I think planning staff will correct me for wrong but I think provided the sign is zoning compliant, then they would be a sign permit requested and issued by the by the building department, and we provided the sign graphics just in case the board wanted to see it.

949
01:45:04,038 --> 01:45:09,499
Okay, that's what I read, and we do have a new ordinance so go ahead.

950
01:45:09,759 --> 01:45:09,979
Sorry.

951
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:10,759
Sorry.

952
01:45:10,859 --> 01:45:16,980
Yes, I just wanted to say I checked with some of our staff internally and can confirm that that's the procedure.

953
01:45:18,672 --> 01:45:20,053
Okay, all right, excellent.

954
01:45:21,554 --> 01:45:25,676
I think those are my questions.

955
01:45:25,896 --> 01:45:28,077
Anyone else have some follow-up questions?

956
01:45:30,618 --> 01:45:32,399
I actually do, David.

957
01:45:32,519 --> 01:45:34,481
It's actually a little bit more of a request.

958
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:44,046
Cles had started with the, I looked at this building as well and said, this canvas, how are we having this plain white building?

959
01:45:44,126 --> 01:45:46,327
And it's the art center and it really needs

960
01:45:47,412 --> 01:45:48,393
visual art.

961
01:45:49,153 --> 01:45:57,059
I know we've had visual art on building actually recently in front of this board, and then they came and got approval from the board for what it was.

962
01:45:57,619 --> 01:46:13,431
It seems to me that we should actually specifically ask that there should be some art, that this arts collaborative should approve it, should have artistic approval over it, but that Theory Wellness should

963
01:46:14,177 --> 01:46:29,122
pay for it, like maybe it's a mural or maybe it's different materials or whatever, mosaic or paint or whatever, but that can be between them, but that that should be part of what happens and what we'd like to see.

964
01:46:29,142 --> 01:46:35,684
It would be such a shame in my mind to have an art center sitting there on Mystic Ave in a plain white boring building.

965
01:46:39,806 --> 01:46:43,989
Any other board members would like to respond to that or offer some more thoughts?

966
01:46:48,431 --> 01:46:49,192
I agree with that.

967
01:46:49,372 --> 01:47:02,640
I'm curious what the regulations are in terms of what sort of designs or imaging can be on the outside of a recreational marijuana facility.

968
01:47:04,313 --> 01:47:06,155
Yeah, I can speak to that a little bit.

969
01:47:06,775 --> 01:47:24,206
Essentially, well first I do support that idea and a little context is, you know, our experience this this industry has changed a lot in the last five or six years and we've always done things from a lens of being conservative and discreet, but we would love to add more color to the building so we certainly think that's a great idea.

970
01:47:25,607 --> 01:47:28,468
It was just simply, you know, we usually take the path of least resistance.

971
01:47:28,548 --> 01:47:34,570
And previously we haven't had such support for a little more of a bold statement, but we think that's a great idea.

972
01:47:36,551 --> 01:47:40,372
And something like an art mural, it's pretty open-ended.

973
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:48,715
There just couldn't be depictions of people, you know, using cannabis or cannabis leaves or the words marijuana.

974
01:47:49,075 --> 01:47:54,577
You know, there'd be some little guardrails like that, but generally just having color and art is not precluded.

975
01:47:57,132 --> 01:47:59,774
And can you actually clarify for us legally?

976
01:47:59,894 --> 01:48:11,901
Cause it seems to me that the cannabis portion is the back portion and that the art center is in the same building, but is leased to the art center.

977
01:48:12,461 --> 01:48:19,726
So you may be helping them to pay for that, their maintenance or whatever, but, but that is not cannabis.

978
01:48:20,422 --> 01:48:21,462
Yeah, that's a good point.

979
01:48:22,563 --> 01:48:23,023
So you're right.

980
01:48:23,103 --> 01:48:31,005
Technically, the Arts Center would not have those regulations placed on them because it's not a licensed space by the state's Cannabis Control Commission.

981
01:48:31,045 --> 01:48:37,706
It's more, I would just say that's just a kind of, I don't think they'd like to see that if it was right next to our licensed space.

982
01:48:37,746 --> 01:48:40,427
But yeah, the Arts Center is not a licensed space.

983
01:48:40,527 --> 01:48:43,908
It's going to have completely its own access, its own security system.

984
01:48:44,448 --> 01:48:49,009
And there's no internal connection between the two suites, if you will.

985
01:48:50,601 --> 01:48:57,226
And that's also just helpful for us and for the public to understand that it's a separate legally a separate space.

986
01:48:57,688 --> 01:49:02,932
And obviously I could actually imagine the Cannabis Commission might feel that you were skirting the law.

987
01:49:03,292 --> 01:49:17,101
If you funded a cannabis mural on the other half of the building, that wasn't where I was at all, so much as if your organization has the money and these are the artists and artists deserve to be paid for their work.

988
01:49:17,701 --> 01:49:27,308
But then again, I would much rather see our local artists participating in this and not, you know, we're not bringing somebody in from another state.

989
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:30,007
where we're supporting our local artists.

990
01:49:32,869 --> 01:49:33,589
Yeah, that makes sense.

991
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:44,377
And I don't know, maybe Laurel could think of an idea or comment on how that might take place, but we would be happy to support the arts organization to do a project like that.

992
01:49:44,397 --> 01:49:46,079
Absolutely.

993
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:49,661
And we're enthusiastic about this concept.

994
01:49:49,962 --> 01:49:55,566
Certainly, as a group of arts-related people, when we looked at the building, our initial thought was,

995
01:49:56,127 --> 01:49:58,649
something should be on the front of this building that represents the art.

996
01:49:58,709 --> 01:49:59,889
So we're in agreement there.

997
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:06,133
And various members of our organization do have prior experience with public art.

998
01:50:06,454 --> 01:50:12,758
It happens, again, the organization that I ran, Cachet, was responsible for the new mural on the condom shell.

999
01:50:13,698 --> 01:50:25,926
So, you know, very familiar with the whole process of going through and vetting potential designs and working with authorities as needed for finalizing a product and having it executed.

1000
01:50:31,730 --> 01:50:32,871
That's, that sounds good.

1001
01:50:33,552 --> 01:50:42,321
Any more thoughts, otherwise maybe we can start thinking about where we want to go with a recommendation.

1002
01:50:42,341 --> 01:50:52,171
I feel like maybe we have a couple of conditions that we might want to consider in connection with the recommendation.

1003
01:50:54,375 --> 01:51:14,490
One, just as we're, we're talking about to emphasize, or to recommend that the arts collaborative had the opportunity to add some color by way of art or murals on the outside of the portion of the building that collaborative is subleasing.

1004
01:51:16,885 --> 01:51:45,855
And I would, again, this was my thing, guys, if you don't like it, it's okay, we don't have to vote for it, but to add as many trees, shrubs as we can on the site plan to the extent the applicant can become creative with that, and including adding either landscape islands or some pervious surface in the portions of the parking lot that

1005
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:50,853
are not sort of dedicated for parking space or a travel lane.

1006
01:51:52,494 --> 01:51:58,355
So those are the two that I had in mind, unless others, you have some other ones to add.

1007
01:51:59,136 --> 01:52:07,158
Can we adjust that language a little bit and have the permeable surfaces potentially also apply to parking spaces as well?

1008
01:52:10,059 --> 01:52:13,620
This investigation of, thank you.

1009
01:52:24,438 --> 01:52:33,881
Amanda, did you pick up any other conditions along the way that I might have missed as our, as our crack superstar scribe meetings ladder.

1010
01:52:35,221 --> 01:52:47,125
So, a couple, a couple of things, just general, generally, that the applicant is to comply with traffic mitigation comments and so far as do t agrees to those recommendations.

1011
01:52:48,665 --> 01:52:58,771
and we can finagle some of the wording of these for sure, but general compliance with the fire chief recommendations, compliance with engineering recommendations.

1012
01:52:58,791 --> 01:53:00,152
Board of Health.

1013
01:53:00,772 --> 01:53:01,493
And Board of Health.

1014
01:53:02,633 --> 01:53:17,242
There was, so I think the applicant had mentioned in the historical commission comments, there was some mention of, in addition to the exterior color of the building, which I think we've been talking about

1015
01:53:18,303 --> 01:53:22,212
and covered exterior lighting adjustments.

1016
01:53:22,313 --> 01:53:26,382
And I wasn't sure if that was something the board wanted to pick up on or leave.

1017
01:53:29,368 --> 01:53:31,108
Yeah, I can clarify that comment a little bit.

1018
01:53:31,488 --> 01:53:44,311
The confusion on that comment is actually the 3D perspective rendering that the architect had prepared showed some flood lighting that exists on the building, which is a little on the older and certainly wouldn't fly if we were proposing a new site today in front of the board.

1019
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:49,712
Our project does propose removal of those and installing new dark sky compliant LED lighting.

1020
01:53:50,032 --> 01:53:56,513
It just didn't quite reflect on the rendering, which is why they picked up on that, but that's already been incorporated into our plans.

1021
01:53:58,476 --> 01:54:00,357
Great, I am rendered moot then.

1022
01:54:02,657 --> 01:54:19,182
And other than that, I think, yeah, you all covered the piece about the mural and also the green space landscaping, and in addition to that, permeable surfacing for the parking spaces, investigation of.

1023
01:54:20,602 --> 01:54:25,524
We should officially sort of add in for the record, this project is subject to linkage.

1024
01:54:27,265 --> 01:54:28,546
I don't think that's a surprise.

1025
01:54:28,966 --> 01:54:34,728
And the solar ordinance, because it's a change in use over 10,000 square feet.

1026
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:43,210
And I believe that actually, I believe that solar is actually in the community agreement already, the community benefits agreement.

1027
01:54:43,751 --> 01:54:48,432
So that shouldn't be anything different from what you've already agreed to.

1028
01:54:48,452 --> 01:54:54,574
I hope I'm not speaking out of turn there, that was my understanding.

1029
01:54:57,879 --> 01:55:03,341
Yeah, I apologize, I'm not sure what linkage is, but in regards to solar, you're correct.

1030
01:55:03,401 --> 01:55:12,364
That is part of our community host agreement to the extent feasible to put solar panels on the roof, assuming structurally it's okay.

1031
01:55:13,705 --> 01:55:22,468
Right, I was checking the denial letter that, yeah, we gotta get these denial letters.

1032
01:55:23,365 --> 01:55:34,489
Um, linkage is the dollar amount per square footage that the city charges for, um, commercial development.

1033
01:55:34,909 --> 01:55:37,870
Um, it's not fees and taxes.

1034
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:39,830
It's like the community benefits.

1035
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:43,252
Amanda, you were using better words this afternoon when you were explaining it.

1036
01:55:44,152 --> 01:55:44,252
Um,

1037
01:55:44,758 --> 01:55:50,320
Yeah, it's for, so for like major projects, it's kind of like a development impact fee.

1038
01:55:51,581 --> 01:55:57,043
And it's calculated on a, usually unless it's residential, it's calculated on a square footage.

1039
01:55:58,483 --> 01:56:05,006
You multiply by square footage a certain amount depending on what the project is zoned as.

1040
01:56:05,386 --> 01:56:11,709
And I'm more than happy to send over the fee schedule to whomever's interested.

1041
01:56:14,191 --> 01:56:15,432
If that's if that's helpful.

1042
01:56:18,013 --> 01:56:29,480
This is the one that hasn't been updated for for a while just so Brandon doesn't fall fall on the floor it's the numbers are like from the 80s right 1989 is when the rates were set.

1043
01:56:31,041 --> 01:56:31,621
Well fair enough.

1044
01:56:31,841 --> 01:56:38,785
Yeah, I mean we'll certainly comply with all ordinances and relations that the city has in place for the development project.

1045
01:56:42,001 --> 01:56:44,162
So yeah, those are usually our letter, so.

1046
01:56:44,182 --> 01:56:49,944
Alicia, any more or otherwise I think we're ready to entertain a motion.

1047
01:57:01,028 --> 01:57:02,249
Friends, fellow board members.

1048
01:57:03,169 --> 01:57:11,052
I'll make the motion, all of what Amanda said as recommendations to the CBA.

1049
01:57:12,970 --> 01:57:13,490
I'll second.

1050
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:14,391
Oh.

1051
01:57:16,891 --> 01:57:19,592
Okay, so we'll do our roll call vote.

1052
01:57:21,053 --> 01:57:22,073
And Jackie Furtado.

1053
01:57:23,534 --> 01:57:23,694
Aye.

1054
01:57:24,854 --> 01:57:25,714
Clyce Andreessen.

1055
01:57:26,695 --> 01:57:26,835
Aye.

1056
01:57:27,715 --> 01:57:28,295
Christy Dow.

1057
01:57:29,336 --> 01:57:29,436
Aye.

1058
01:57:29,456 --> 01:57:30,796
Emily Hedeman.

1059
01:57:31,716 --> 01:57:31,836
Aye.

1060
01:57:32,977 --> 01:57:33,637
Deanna Peabody.

1061
01:57:34,497 --> 01:57:34,597
Aye.

1062
01:57:35,638 --> 01:57:36,818
And I'm an aye as well.

1063
01:57:39,739 --> 01:57:41,200
Thank you to the Theory Wellness Group.

1064
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:42,560
Thank you for your presentation today.

1065
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:44,270
Yeah.

1066
01:57:45,031 --> 01:57:47,332
Thank you to the board have a have a good evening, everybody.

1067
01:57:47,352 --> 01:57:48,653
Thank you.

1068
01:57:49,273 --> 01:57:49,833
Thank you.

1069
01:57:50,614 --> 01:57:51,835
Thank you.

1070
01:57:55,517 --> 01:58:03,041
So I just, I thought I would just take two seconds to mention that in going through this is the first time we're doing site plan review under the new ordinance.

1071
01:58:04,282 --> 01:58:11,946
And may recall from all the back and forth and discussion that there was about the ordinance that we now have these performance standards and 6.4.

1072
01:58:14,008 --> 01:58:20,214
And, and those are, I think are really good and reflect a lot of things that we were asking about even before they were added to the ordinance.

1073
01:58:21,154 --> 01:58:34,886
And then in another spot 11 710 there are seven specific written findings that we have to arrive at in terms of a brain connection with a decision approving a safe plan.

1074
01:58:36,808 --> 01:58:45,595
We'll kind of work through that I'm thinking there's probably a formatting piece maybe to our decisions that will that will work on and try to implement.

1075
01:58:46,216 --> 01:58:47,657
But if you.

1076
01:58:48,318 --> 01:59:03,430
It's like loading and unloading the bulk and location of the building there's you know there's a handful of things you can see in the ordinance yourself but just know that if it feels like something is new when this thing decision comes out it's because we're trying to match it up with the new ordinance that's all.

1077
01:59:09,055 --> 01:59:18,121
I think the next item on the list is now to discuss our minutes that were prepared for the July 14th meeting.

1078
01:59:19,522 --> 01:59:30,049
And I'll turn it over to the board or Emily, if you'd like to make mention of the minutes as our clerk, your inaugural appearance as clerk.

1079
01:59:30,930 --> 01:59:31,610
Yeah, big day.

1080
01:59:31,630 --> 01:59:36,133
So this is the discussion portion, is that correct?

1081
01:59:36,934 --> 01:59:37,094
Sure.

1082
01:59:37,343 --> 01:59:37,563
Yes.

1083
01:59:37,683 --> 01:59:39,644
Okay, great.

1084
01:59:40,165 --> 01:59:45,628
So I had two more form updates rather than content updates.

1085
01:59:47,669 --> 02:00:01,397
I propose that future meeting minutes reflect board members who are absent as well as present, as well as include a list of all documents and other exhibits used by the public body during the meeting.

1086
02:00:02,298 --> 02:00:04,839
These are per MGL chapter 30A, section 22A,

1087
02:00:09,023 --> 02:00:12,985
something that I did at other boards, so I didn't have any material comments.

1088
02:00:15,286 --> 02:00:16,726
So well done on those, Amanda.

1089
02:00:18,607 --> 02:00:24,430
Actually, the thanks goes to Wren, who has diligently put them together for us, so thank you.

1090
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:25,070
Well done, Wren.

1091
02:00:25,470 --> 02:00:25,850
Thank you.

1092
02:00:27,411 --> 02:00:27,851
Thank you, Wren.

1093
02:00:27,891 --> 02:00:28,672
We appreciate that.

1094
02:00:28,752 --> 02:00:31,693
Emily, I can't imagine there'd be any objection to your good suggestions.

1095
02:00:36,337 --> 02:00:38,339
Is, are there any other comments on the minutes?

1096
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:46,465
Otherwise we can entertain a motion to approve them subject to update to match Emily's good suggestions.

1097
02:00:47,426 --> 02:00:57,173
And I think I had a couple of, they were not, there's no substance involved, but just a few grammatical or typo kind of things to make in there as well.

1098
02:00:59,635 --> 02:01:03,398
Otherwise, do we have a motion for approval of the minutes subject to what I just said?

1099
02:01:04,114 --> 02:01:10,919
I'll make a motion to approve the minutes from the July 14 meeting.

1100
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:14,582
Thank you, Emily, do we have a second for that motion.

1101
02:01:15,662 --> 02:01:16,143
I'll second.

1102
02:01:17,564 --> 02:01:18,244
Thank you, Jackie.

1103
02:01:19,365 --> 02:01:21,867
And we'll take a roll call vote on approval of the minutes.

1104
02:01:23,468 --> 02:01:24,289
Deanna PB.

1105
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:26,530
I was actually absent.

1106
02:01:27,171 --> 02:01:27,631
Oh, you were.

1107
02:01:27,651 --> 02:01:30,053
Okay, thank you very much, Emily.

1108
02:01:31,998 --> 02:01:33,759
Hi, Jackie.

1109
02:01:34,539 --> 02:01:36,000
Hi, place.

1110
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:39,182
Hi, Christy.

1111
02:01:40,243 --> 02:01:40,503
Hi.

1112
02:01:42,204 --> 02:01:43,364
And I'm an eye as well.

1113
02:01:45,906 --> 02:01:51,809
I think now we're at the point in time where we have any other updates or anything that we need to share as a board.

1114
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:57,933
Amanda or Alicia Do you have anything for us or other fellow board members have any updates.

1115
02:01:59,736 --> 02:02:03,639
have a quick thing relating to the minutes, actually, just to piggyback off of that.

1116
02:02:04,279 --> 02:02:15,887
So as, as some of you may be aware, we have had a bit of a backlog of certain minutes, particularly from the time when we were doing the zoning of codification and had kind of a lot of back to back meetings.

1117
02:02:16,408 --> 02:02:25,554
And so there are a number of minutes that and I didn't feel that it was fair to include for this meeting, giving given everything on the agenda.

1118
02:02:26,371 --> 02:02:28,573
Um, that are ready for review.

1119
02:02:28,593 --> 02:02:33,176
Um, and that would be prior to Emily's time with us.

1120
02:02:33,296 --> 02:02:37,499
So, um, couldn't necessarily go to the clerk for, um, for review.

1121
02:02:37,979 --> 02:02:45,465
So I just wanted to propose maybe ahead of next meeting since the meeting since the minutes are already and there are

1122
02:02:46,366 --> 02:02:47,046
three of them.

1123
02:02:49,208 --> 02:03:02,856
We can do it different ways, but one thought I had was to provide them to members a long time in advance, a couple weeks in advance, just so it doesn't kind of compound upon other project materials for the next meeting.

1124
02:03:03,397 --> 02:03:11,401
Or we can kind of portion them out over the next few meetings and have maybe two minutes at a time for review.

1125
02:03:11,862 --> 02:03:15,544
But I defer to you all on that and what's going to be convenient

1126
02:03:19,212 --> 02:03:22,195
For me, I think it'd be awesome if you were to send them out a couple weeks in advance, but.

1127
02:03:23,697 --> 02:03:28,261
And I would say we should just do them all at the next meeting.

1128
02:03:31,384 --> 02:03:31,925
That would be great.

1129
02:03:31,965 --> 02:03:34,127
Thanks for doing that, Amanda and Ren.

1130
02:03:34,487 --> 02:03:34,788
Thank you.

1131
02:03:36,617 --> 02:03:37,858
Yes, big thanks to Ren.

1132
02:03:38,359 --> 02:03:39,119
Okay, big thanks.

1133
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:39,840
Yeah.

1134
02:03:41,742 --> 02:03:43,203
So, yes.

1135
02:03:43,544 --> 02:03:50,750
Otherwise, I don't have any major updates unless Alicia or Vic wanted to chime in.

1136
02:03:50,971 --> 02:04:00,880
We don't have anything formally submitted for any projects formally submitted to the board, although I am sure there are things on the horizon.

1137
02:04:02,695 --> 02:04:07,536
Is it worth trying to pick a date in September so it's on the calendar?

1138
02:04:08,297 --> 02:04:13,618
Is the department feeling confident enough that yeah, more than likely we will have something we need to look at?

1139
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:16,279
I don't know that.

1140
02:04:16,519 --> 02:04:19,180
I don't know if I'm, I'm not confident.

1141
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:31,844
Not that we're not expecting things, but sometimes with the regulatory timelines that we need to circulate materials ahead of time for, so that like 35 days to department heads can kind of

1142
02:04:33,048 --> 02:04:43,951
know, change up where meetings need to land, but of course if everyone were interested in getting something on the calendar, even if it had to change, I'm happy to entertain that.

1143
02:04:49,353 --> 02:04:49,933
How do people feel?

1144
02:04:49,953 --> 02:04:51,614
Would they rather have it on the calendar or

1145
02:04:53,263 --> 02:04:54,003
take it as it comes.

1146
02:04:54,984 --> 02:05:01,066
And then we'll figure it out.

1147
02:05:01,106 --> 02:05:03,827
We have to give department heads 35 days, right?

1148
02:05:04,908 --> 02:05:12,891
So that means the board will always have a month's warning, 35 days warning that we've received something.

1149
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:15,092
Victor is waving his hand.

1150
02:05:15,659 --> 02:05:23,206
We may be seeing some plan development district applications come in, and those would not require the 35 days.

1151
02:05:23,326 --> 02:05:31,473
So there's the possibility that in September, we'll be receiving our first PDD application.

1152
02:05:31,613 --> 02:05:37,499
There's a community meeting for a project proposed at 100 Winchester Street at the end of this month.

1153
02:05:37,539 --> 02:05:39,500
It's on the 29th of August.

1154
02:05:40,361 --> 02:05:42,023
And I think they'd like to come in

1155
02:05:43,715 --> 02:05:46,136
September, maybe October.

1156
02:05:46,876 --> 02:05:48,296
We'll know more soon.

1157
02:05:48,436 --> 02:05:56,079
So I think it is appropriate to wait and reach out to schedule once we hone in on that date a little bit more.

1158
02:05:57,499 --> 02:06:06,302
Just on that topic, Amanda, Alicia, and I, and David met briefly just to talk about the plan development district process.

1159
02:06:06,502 --> 02:06:10,383
And we've put together a flow chart and a checklist for applications.

1160
02:06:11,203 --> 02:06:20,790
And we'll share that with you all soon so you can get an idea of how, how that those projects will be reviewed and they're a little bit different than the norm.

1161
02:06:22,712 --> 02:06:23,572
Hopefully that's helpful.

1162
02:06:25,134 --> 02:06:26,314
Thank you, Victor appreciate that.

1163
02:06:27,455 --> 02:06:29,677
And then, not on scheduling.

1164
02:06:30,517 --> 02:06:33,039
We moving on from scheduling I just realized we're past schedule.

1165
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:33,460
Yep.

1166
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:33,760
Great.

1167
02:06:37,109 --> 02:06:40,976
Com plan community development, but comprehensive plan.

1168
02:06:41,076 --> 02:06:42,900
Sorry, it's it's been a long week.

1169
02:06:43,721 --> 02:06:49,311
Um, third night in a row I'm here past eight for for meetings and stuff.

1170
02:06:51,492 --> 02:06:53,994
Comprehensive plan, the draft is out there.

1171
02:06:54,534 --> 02:06:56,916
I really encourage people to read it, to look through it.

1172
02:06:57,016 --> 02:07:06,482
We have been sending, RIN's been helping me by sending pieces to or pointers to various departments, asking them to look at specific parts that are relevant to them.

1173
02:07:07,843 --> 02:07:09,724
I'm making comments throughout it.

1174
02:07:11,405 --> 02:07:12,526
There are various ways.

1175
02:07:12,566 --> 02:07:18,810
We actually put out like a form where you could say whether or not you've read it and you could just submit comments to us.

1176
02:07:19,190 --> 02:07:25,453
But if you actually want to comment on the PDF, we could arrange that.

1177
02:07:25,513 --> 02:07:29,235
You can send us actual specifics if you want.

1178
02:07:30,535 --> 02:07:35,057
David, if you're going to copy edit it, I'm going to tell you one section to not look at.

1179
02:07:35,077 --> 02:07:37,398
I just copy edited the hell out of it.

1180
02:07:37,799 --> 02:07:39,119
I think they're going to have to rewrite.

1181
02:07:39,179 --> 02:07:43,261
There's like one tiny little like one objective.

1182
02:07:43,601 --> 02:07:44,382
Something went wrong.

1183
02:07:45,082 --> 02:07:47,063
I don't know what you're talking about.

1184
02:07:49,735 --> 02:08:00,281
But that said, if there are particularly substantive comments, my preference is we get substantive comments sooner rather than later to give the consultants more time.

1185
02:08:01,622 --> 02:08:03,182
So it's out there.

1186
02:08:03,202 --> 02:08:06,624
Okay, so it is out there and available for us.

1187
02:08:06,864 --> 02:08:12,267
For you guys in the chat, I know we've emailed it, right?

1188
02:08:12,368 --> 02:08:13,468
Or emailed a link to it.

1189
02:08:13,828 --> 02:08:16,730
It's 20 megs, so we tend not to just email the file around.

1190
02:08:19,523 --> 02:08:21,164
And it's on our webpage.

1191
02:08:22,385 --> 02:08:23,646
If it's not, we'll fix that.

1192
02:08:23,666 --> 02:08:25,527
I'm sure it is.

1193
02:08:30,291 --> 02:08:35,254
Would it be good to send the link again, just so it's sort of- Yeah, we can put it in email to you guys.

1194
02:08:35,354 --> 02:08:40,738
I can hit reply all to something Amanda has sent and send it out to you.

1195
02:08:41,438 --> 02:08:41,919
That'd be great.

1196
02:08:42,259 --> 02:08:42,739
In the chat.

1197
02:08:44,788 --> 02:08:49,130
Yeah, I was actually just looking to make sure it was on our office's website.

1198
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:51,251
Sometimes people watch these meetings.

1199
02:08:51,732 --> 02:08:59,075
It has come to my attention by people coming up to me and saying, Alicia, I saw you on TV last night, that people watch some of these meetings.

1200
02:08:59,676 --> 02:09:06,439
So if anybody else is watching, I'll make sure it's on the planning, development and sustainability website.

1201
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:09,281
Comprehensive plan.

1202
02:09:09,301 --> 02:09:11,522
There's a link.

1203
02:09:14,856 --> 02:09:19,638
There was a link included in the press release that's on the city's homepage.

1204
02:09:19,838 --> 02:09:22,139
So you can at least find it there.

1205
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:23,600
Yes.

1206
02:09:24,521 --> 02:09:27,862
Well, I had to click like six times from our page to get there.

1207
02:09:29,963 --> 02:09:37,046
Any other updates for us or can we entertain a motion to adjourn?

1208
02:09:39,067 --> 02:09:39,848
I'll make that motion.

1209
02:09:41,629 --> 02:09:42,489
Second out there.

1210
02:09:45,148 --> 02:09:47,649
Thank you very much.

1211
02:09:49,570 --> 02:09:52,010
All right, we'll call to adjourn that place.

1212
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:54,851
Hi, Jackie.

1213
02:09:54,991 --> 02:09:57,132
Hi, Christie.

1214
02:09:57,692 --> 02:09:59,033
Hi, Emily.

1215
02:09:59,813 --> 02:10:02,174
Hi, Deanna.

1216
02:10:02,974 --> 02:10:03,814
Hi, me I'm an eye.

1217
02:10:04,795 --> 02:10:05,755
Thank you all very much.

1218
02:10:07,756 --> 02:10:08,797
All right, great job, David.

1219
02:10:08,817 --> 02:10:12,140
You're an actual meeting.

1220
02:10:12,161 --> 02:10:13,362
You're hired.

1221
02:10:13,382 --> 02:10:15,644
I don't know how great it was, but it was a job.

1222
02:10:18,907 --> 02:10:19,528
Good job.

1223
02:10:19,568 --> 02:10:20,329
This was excellent.

1224
02:10:20,369 --> 02:10:20,789
Thank you.

1225
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:22,811
Thanks for your help, everyone.

1226
02:10:22,871 --> 02:10:23,652
I appreciate it.

1227
02:10:24,133 --> 02:10:24,853
Good night.

1228
02:10:24,934 --> 02:10:25,855
Thank you, everyone.

1229
02:10:25,915 --> 02:10:26,295
See you later.
