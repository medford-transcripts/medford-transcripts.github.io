4
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:31,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you to the both of you for coming this evening.

5
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:32,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Rousseau?

6
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:33,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

7
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:39,744
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there was a project at the high school on this as well, at least before the pandemic.

8
01:05:41,265 --> 01:05:45,447
[SPEAKER_21]: I was wondering, who takes the compost bins out?

9
01:05:45,728 --> 01:05:47,689
[SPEAKER_21]: In my own house, that sometimes is an issue.

10
01:05:48,915 --> 01:05:51,497
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a company called Black Earth Composting.

11
01:05:52,017 --> 01:05:54,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have them pick it up.

12
01:05:55,739 --> 01:06:00,342
[SPEAKER_21]: But I mean, like, from the building inside to the, I assume it goes.

13
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:01,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Zizzo has his hand up.

14
01:06:07,626 --> 01:06:08,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Need to be in the microphone.

15
01:06:08,486 --> 01:06:08,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

16
01:06:08,867 --> 01:06:09,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

17
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:17,357
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had a contact with Black Earth and the custodian would bring the bin out for me.

18
01:06:17,777 --> 01:06:18,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Once a week, they'd come pick it up.

19
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:20,278
[SPEAKER_17]: They'd put it out Thursday.

20
01:06:20,298 --> 01:06:24,000
[SPEAKER_17]: They would usually pick it up Friday, anywhere between morning and before lunch.

21
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:27,522
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be put back at lunchtime, and then we'd start the week over again.

22
01:06:27,642 --> 01:06:30,143
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was a weekly collection.

23
01:06:30,564 --> 01:06:30,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

24
01:06:31,104 --> 01:06:31,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

25
01:06:32,104 --> 01:06:32,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

26
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:34,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

27
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:36,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Great job, Mayor, Member Graham.

28
01:06:39,116 --> 01:06:45,406
[SPEAKER_09]: You all worked with Mr Zizzo to figure out what the cost for an entire year would be and that was $720 Is that correct.

29
01:06:45,426 --> 01:06:45,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

30
01:06:51,092 --> 01:06:55,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is a really reasonable expense for us to consider.

31
01:06:56,234 --> 01:06:59,575
[SPEAKER_09]: And tonight we are going to talk about the budget.

32
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:06,397
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would like to ask the administration to think about finding a way for us to fund this.

33
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:12,100
[SPEAKER_09]: But Violet is my daughter, full disclosure, so I didn't want to be the person to make that motion.

34
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,280
[SPEAKER_09]: If any of my colleagues would like to help me out.

35
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:16,801
[SPEAKER_15]: I can motion.

36
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:17,642
[SPEAKER_15]: I motion to

37
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:26,114
[SPEAKER_15]: look into the budget for the cost of the $720 for the school year coming up for the compost buckets.

38
01:07:26,354 --> 01:07:26,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

39

[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to look into the budget and that cost by member Kretz, seconded by member McLaughlin.

40
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McStone, would you like to?

41
01:07:34,881 --> 01:07:40,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a question that I know that a different compost company has the city of Medford contract.

42
01:07:40,465 --> 01:07:41,125
[SPEAKER_08]: We can check with them.

43
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:43,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if they would give us a discount because they have the whole city.

44
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,389
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could look into that, I'm happy to call.

45
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, we definitely can.

46
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:48,491

88
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:45,489

122
01:13:50,574 --> 01:14:11,060

[SPEAKER_04]: So please, if you're interested, please go to the city website and our school blog to have an accurate accounting of all the events that are taking place.

148
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:42,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did have our students speak last week.

149
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:52,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to thank member Hayes and all of the other elected officials who were able to come and participate in the flag raising ceremony.

150
01:17:53,723 --> 01:17:59,007
[SPEAKER_04]: In closing, I want to just share a few remarks about safety.

151
01:17:59,527 --> 01:18:09,234
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been several emails coming in, in light of all of the violent events that have been taking place across the country.

152
01:18:11,015 --> 01:18:21,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And members of the community in some of the emails are asking for specifics regarding safety and what is Metro Public Schools doing.

153
01:18:22,273 --> 01:18:28,376
[SPEAKER_04]: There are things that Metro Public Schools does do in order to maintain the safety.

154
01:18:28,876 --> 01:18:35,299
[SPEAKER_04]: We do maintain doing fire drills, we're working closely and collaboratively with our fire department.

155
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,002
[SPEAKER_04]: We do do at selected times, shelter in place.

156
01:18:41,323 --> 01:18:58,045
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are other pieces of our security protocols that we don't publicly or formally announced, so I did not have it listed this week as an official report, but at next Monday's meeting as well.

157
01:18:58,766 --> 01:19:04,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be providing more guided information, follow up information.

158
01:19:04,591 --> 01:19:19,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want the community to know that I work very closely with Chief Buckley and working with our administrative team and following the safety protocols that should be in place.

159
01:19:19,343 --> 01:19:25,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want people to know that we prioritize the safety of the entire community.

160
01:19:27,066 --> 01:19:31,607
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is our goal to keep our community safe, as safe as possible.

161
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:55,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I did want to say that there was also a district-wide safety team that administrators, special ed administrators, it's a collaborative group that does meet and discuss safety protocols, including building and grounds, and select administrators.

162
01:19:57,839 --> 01:19:59,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, point of information.

163
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

164
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just regarding the Universal Safety Committee.

165
01:20:02,921 --> 01:20:05,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for mentioning that, Superintendent Edward-Vincent.

166
01:20:05,862 --> 01:20:06,602
[SPEAKER_10]: It meets monthly.

167
01:20:06,642 --> 01:20:08,463
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been happening for the past several years.

168
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:20,107
[SPEAKER_10]: The mission is to address safety issues specific to students with disabilities, especially during lockdowns and other items, and lots of things have come out of that committee, and they also meet quarterly with the principals.

169
01:20:20,728 --> 01:20:21,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

170
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:21,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

171
01:20:22,588 --> 01:20:23,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

172
01:20:23,729 --> 01:20:24,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr.

173
01:20:25,035 --> 01:20:25,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion?

174
01:20:25,956 --> 01:20:27,216
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not on the agenda.

175
01:20:27,836 --> 01:20:28,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Derek, are you Derek?

176
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:30,678
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so Derek and I haven't met in person.

177
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:35,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So Derek is a dad who has some words he'd like to share if there could be a suspension to hear from him.

178
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:42,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to suspend the rules by member McLaughlin, seconded by Stone, seconded by member McLaughlin.

179
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:43,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by member McLaughlin.

180
01:20:43,503 --> 01:20:44,203
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

181
01:20:44,223 --> 01:20:44,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

182
01:20:44,984 --> 01:20:45,704
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

183
01:20:46,684 --> 01:20:47,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

184
01:20:49,066 --> 01:20:51,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Derek Anderson, 16 Myrtle Street here in Medford.

185
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:57,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the time, just wanted to comment, and thank you, Superintendent, for your comments.

186
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:58,174
[SPEAKER_12]: I do appreciate it.

187
01:20:58,595 --> 01:21:03,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to moderate the words I was gonna use here due to the age of some of the folks in the audience.

188
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:08,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize if there's any vagueness or unclearness.

189
01:21:08,484 --> 01:21:09,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I did send you all an email.

190
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:11,987
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's any unclearness, please do read that.

191
01:21:13,495 --> 01:21:27,368
[SPEAKER_12]: So while I do expect that you're all taking the threat of violence very seriously, and I know that you can't share all the details of that, as a parent of two young children in our school system, I just felt it was my obligation to let you know what I feel is very important to me.

192
01:21:27,668 --> 01:21:33,053
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just going to talk about the four most important things that I think are evidence-based for safety.

193
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:44,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one is the American School Councilor Association says that we need one adjustment counselor for every 250 students.

194
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:48,222
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can provide our children.

195
01:21:55,876 --> 01:22:02,578
[SPEAKER_12]: the emotional support networks and mental health services that they need to implement evidence-based anti-bullying programs.

196
01:22:02,899 --> 01:22:15,023
[SPEAKER_12]: So why Safe Schools Initiative reports that 87% of perpetrators left evidence that they were victims of severe and long-term bullying, 87%.

197
01:22:15,383 --> 01:22:18,184
[SPEAKER_12]: 98% experienced a personal loss that they were unable to cope with.

198
01:22:20,052 --> 01:22:25,034
[SPEAKER_12]: And the American Counseling Association also reports 78% had a history of suicidal ideations.

199
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:30,115
[SPEAKER_12]: These are red flags that we can act on, but only if we have the right counselors to do that.

200
01:22:31,316 --> 01:22:40,899
[SPEAKER_12]: By providing counselors to address emotional health and bullying, we will also be tackling what the American Counseling Association has identified as far and away the leading cause of this kind of violence.

201
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:43,200
[SPEAKER_12]: While providing and

202
01:22:45,953 --> 01:22:53,895
[SPEAKER_12]: while providing support networks that will allow our children to thrive academically, socially, and personally, and make our entire community safer and more vibrant.

203
01:22:54,955 --> 01:23:00,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Two out of three of my neighbors with school-aged children are now sending their kids to charters because of this.

204
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,137
[SPEAKER_12]: That's unacceptable.

205
01:23:05,058 --> 01:23:14,560
[SPEAKER_12]: If we don't have the money for the counselors we need, then I ask you, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, to put up to vote a Proposition 2 1⁄2 Override so we can have the money we need for this.

206
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:28,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Second point, and the last couple of go a little quicker here.

207
01:23:28,831 --> 01:23:46,318
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to give our adjustment counselors the authority for them to lead the creation of threat assessment teams, to create and enact evidence-based threat assessment program, to identify who might be in crisis, assess that risk and intervene, particularly focusing on providing access to support networks and mental health services.

208
01:23:46,858 --> 01:23:55,562
[SPEAKER_12]: This program should create systems to collect information about threats, including anonymous tip lines, and should include educational programs to help staff and students know the signs

209
01:23:56,363 --> 01:24:01,364
[SPEAKER_12]: and be aware of tools available such as the extreme risk protection laws and section 12 mental health laws.

210
01:24:01,624 --> 01:24:07,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Why FBI has reported that the far most valuable prevention strategy was the threat assessment and management team.

211
01:24:09,126 --> 01:24:16,648
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Department of Homeland Security reports that detecting and addressing behavioral red flags are far more effective than any physical security measures.

212
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:32,983
[SPEAKER_12]: And third, as recommended by FEMA and universally agreed by security experts, we need a single comprehensive emergency plan to coordinate the efforts and lines of communication as it's decision-making amongst all emergency responders and staff, specifically for these kinds of situations.

213
01:24:33,363 --> 01:24:40,764
[SPEAKER_12]: This should include mock training exercises by emergency responders and staff, but I will note that I am not supportive of including our students in these exercises.

214
01:24:41,804 --> 01:24:46,485
[SPEAKER_12]: And then fourth, we also do need basic physical prevention systems, including internal door locks,

215
01:24:47,492 --> 01:24:52,917
[SPEAKER_12]: ensuring external doors are locked, minimizing entry points, and monitoring and controlling access to the school.

216
01:24:53,758 --> 01:24:55,279
[SPEAKER_12]: So, thank you very much for your time.

217
01:25:09,753 --> 01:25:10,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Anderson.

218
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:15,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, we have report.

219
01:25:15,685 --> 01:25:17,226
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we don't need to.

220
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:23,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Report on results of the equity audit for human resources phase one conducted by the equity process.

221
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:25,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

222
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:32,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

223
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:40,400
[SPEAKER_04]: This evening, I'm going to be sharing a very brief, well, I don't think it's that brief, but

224
01:25:41,914 --> 01:25:50,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to share a somewhat brief slide deck with you on the results of equity audit of human resources.

225
01:26:05,117 --> 01:26:17,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's jump into the human resources audit I just want to recognize our students at the Curtis Tufts, who had a graduation ceremony last Wednesday, June 1 as well.

226
01:26:18,267 --> 01:26:27,795
[SPEAKER_04]: And to acknowledge anyone who may be here any staff from the Curtis Tufts as well, and Mr drowsky for leading the school and.

227
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:35,066
[SPEAKER_04]: hosting that celebration that took place last week at the Irish American.

228
01:26:35,486 --> 01:26:38,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So congratulations to our students at the Curtis Tufts as well.

229
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:39,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

230
01:26:48,632 --> 01:26:48,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

231
01:26:50,791 --> 01:27:01,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm going to share with you are key recommendations and results of our equity audit of human resources.

232
01:27:05,837 --> 01:27:11,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of framing, I was starting off saying, why is diversity important?

233
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It is important for us to consider perspective taking

234
01:27:19,645 --> 01:27:27,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Developing a sense of belonging is incredibly important for all of our learners, our students, our scholars.

235
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:33,353
[SPEAKER_04]: A strong sense of belonging leads to higher levels of student achievement.

236
01:27:35,614 --> 01:27:36,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So our why.

237
01:27:39,737 --> 01:27:46,881
[SPEAKER_04]: The equity audit of human resources was the first phase of a greater body of work that will continue in Medford.

238
01:27:48,376 --> 01:27:57,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Please keep in mind that in light of the pandemic, it wasn't prudent for us to begin the equity work of the district starting in classrooms.

239
01:27:59,604 --> 01:28:08,570
[SPEAKER_04]: However, with our focus on students first, we began this journey by looking at our policies and procedures that bring talent to NPS.

240
01:28:10,031 --> 01:28:16,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Our goal is to improve and build an inclusive culture within Medford Public Schools hiring system.

241
01:28:18,379 --> 01:28:25,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about a sense of belonging, sense of belonging is one of the greatest predictors of success.

242
01:28:27,006 --> 01:28:34,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Educational research tells us that one of the greatest predictors of academic achievement for students is a sense of belonging.

243
01:28:36,013 --> 01:28:43,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Increasing the diversity of our faculty is a measure to increase the sense of belonging for our students.

244
01:28:45,401 --> 01:28:46,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna share some data with you.

245
01:28:48,993 --> 01:28:53,256
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Medford Public Schools student enrollment data from the DESE portal.

246
01:28:55,557 --> 01:28:58,219
[SPEAKER_04]: We have slightly over 4,000 students.

247
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:06,524
[SPEAKER_04]: The first section of the blue bars is identifying student race and ethnicity.

248
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:10,866
[SPEAKER_04]: African American students within the district represent 11.1%.

249
01:29:10,926 --> 01:29:11,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Asian students, 9.4%.

250
01:29:17,901 --> 01:29:19,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Hispanic Latino students, 14.4%.

251
01:29:19,743 --> 01:29:20,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Native American, 0.4%.

252
01:29:21,044 --> 01:29:21,884
[SPEAKER_04]: White students, 59.2%.

253
01:29:23,085 --> 01:29:25,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander, 0.1%.

254
01:29:25,628 --> 01:29:29,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Multirace non-Hispanic, 5.3%.

255
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:53,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So in essence, we are almost a 60-40% split within Medford Public Schools.

256
01:29:55,087 --> 01:30:11,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Under selected populations, we have 26.8% of our students, nearly 1,000 students in the Medford Public Schools, their first language is not English.

257
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,341
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,000 of our 4,000 students, significant.

258
01:30:17,717 --> 01:30:27,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not English, meaning that they can be bilingual, speak other languages, and are equally conversant in English.

259
01:30:28,285 --> 01:30:30,466
[SPEAKER_04]: However, our English learner population is 10.4%.

260
01:30:31,987 --> 01:30:40,253
[SPEAKER_04]: These are students that are receiving intensive ESL supports.

261
01:30:42,193 --> 01:30:43,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Our students with disabilities, 20.2%.

262
01:30:44,895 --> 01:31:02,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if we're thinking about 4,000, we are nearing the 1,000, 800 to 900 of our students within Medford Public Schools are receiving special education services in some way, shape, or form.

263
01:31:03,446 --> 01:31:04,847
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a significant number.

264
01:31:06,107 --> 01:31:08,128
[SPEAKER_04]: This number was a little staggering to me.

265
01:31:08,929 --> 01:31:21,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Our students with high needs, 53.9%, more than 2,000 students in the Medford Public Schools are classified as students with high needs.

266
01:31:22,976 --> 01:31:23,316
[SPEAKER_04]: More than 2,000.

267
01:31:23,356 --> 01:31:27,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

268
01:31:27,699 --> 01:31:28,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

269
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:33,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent, would you mind defining high needs for us so that we know what's disaggregated in that data, please?

270
01:31:35,143 --> 01:32:02,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So within high needs, it's taking into account also not only socioeconomic and learning needs, it's inclusive, I would say, akin to saying most vulnerable, that these are students within our community that face greater challenges

271
01:32:04,742 --> 01:32:13,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And Desi identifies them according for us, that nearly over 2000 students fall into that category.

272
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:29,766
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those specifically classified as low income students, it's 40.5% that are classified as low income, which was also another staggering data point.

273
01:32:36,087 --> 01:32:42,593
[SPEAKER_04]: This slide here shows our staffing in Medford Public Schools.

274
01:32:45,656 --> 01:32:53,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have over 600 staff that classify as or identify as white staff.

275
01:32:55,120 --> 01:33:17,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And for Hispanic, Asian, and African American staff, and this is including more than the teachers as well, it's including other departments, we have very, very significantly smaller numbers than what was previously shown.

276
01:33:18,486 --> 01:33:24,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted us to be able to keep this data in mind as I continue to share some of the findings.

277
01:33:29,028 --> 01:33:31,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to talk a little bit about perception.

278
01:33:31,429 --> 01:33:39,893
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the image, depending which way you look at this image, it can be confusing.

279
01:33:47,277 --> 01:33:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna show you another image.

280
01:33:57,681 --> 01:33:58,442
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you see?

281
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:04,437
[SPEAKER_04]: What we know to be real is real.

282
01:34:06,859 --> 01:34:11,421
[SPEAKER_04]: As you look at this image, hopefully you're seeing something.

283
01:34:13,082 --> 01:34:20,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I able to ask one of the members of the committee to possibly just say what they think they're seeing in that particular image?

284
01:34:20,507 --> 01:34:22,288
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no right answer.

285
01:34:23,068 --> 01:34:23,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say it again?

286
01:34:23,709 --> 01:34:25,370
[SPEAKER_04]: A woman with a hat.

287
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:25,950
[SPEAKER_04]: A woman with a hat.

288
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:26,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else?

289
01:34:28,271 --> 01:34:29,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Corral de Vil.

290
01:34:29,692 --> 01:34:30,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

291
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:30,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Young lady.

292
01:34:31,266 --> 01:34:32,967
[SPEAKER_04]: A young lady, thank you.

293
01:34:34,968 --> 01:34:40,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing, there is no right or wrong answer.

294
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:51,318
[SPEAKER_04]: What I love about that image is within the image, there are two pictures depending which way you see it.

295
01:34:52,419 --> 01:34:55,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people see the young lady.

296
01:34:57,542 --> 01:35:00,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people see the,

297
01:35:01,576 --> 01:35:02,297
[SPEAKER_04]: elderly lady.

298
01:35:05,559 --> 01:35:08,922
[SPEAKER_04]: They both are, they both are there.

299
01:35:10,203 --> 01:35:12,485
[SPEAKER_04]: They both exist at the same exact time.

300
01:35:16,229 --> 01:35:21,533
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the perspective in which you're looking at the image.

301
01:35:22,974 --> 01:35:27,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But both images exist, and both images are there.

302
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:32,926
[SPEAKER_04]: We touch a little bit upon implicit bias.

303
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:46,516
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about ageism, because ageism can be a form of discrimination against a person based on age.

304
01:35:50,939 --> 01:35:57,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want you to see, again, these two images existing at the same exact time.

305
01:36:02,694 --> 01:36:03,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing.

306
01:36:06,276 --> 01:36:14,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I am curious if the audience would indulge me, how many people think they saw the young women?

307
01:36:17,121 --> 01:36:19,862
[SPEAKER_04]: How many saw the elderly women?

308
01:36:19,882 --> 01:36:23,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

309
01:36:25,765 --> 01:36:27,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So here is some key vocabulary, thank you.

310
01:36:30,501 --> 01:36:36,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Some key vocabulary that was used as part of this audit.

311
01:36:37,064 --> 01:36:54,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Throughout the audit, members of the school committee were interviewed, administrative members were interviewed, members of human resources, a specific office, business office at central office, they were interviewed.

312
01:36:55,814 --> 01:36:59,877
[SPEAKER_04]: The Race Equity Task Force were part of a conversation.

313
01:36:59,917 --> 01:37:09,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were select conversations and surveys that took place to kind of gather and give us this information that I'm getting ready to share with you.

314
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:12,285
[SPEAKER_04]: But here are some key terms.

315
01:37:12,365 --> 01:37:13,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Diverse learning communities.

316
01:37:17,529 --> 01:37:19,430
[SPEAKER_04]: The definition of diversity.

317
01:37:23,253 --> 01:37:23,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Equity.

318
01:37:26,477 --> 01:37:29,798
[SPEAKER_04]: equality, inclusion.

319
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:45,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Diverse learning communities are learning communities that support collaborative partnerships between students and staff and attempt to restructure the curriculum to address structural barriers to educational excellence.

320
01:37:46,122 --> 01:37:54,484
[SPEAKER_04]: They are inclusive of all races, ethnicities, genders, creeds, sexual orientations, and abilities.

321
01:37:59,642 --> 01:38:05,767
[SPEAKER_04]: The next slide shows diversity hiring.

322
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:34,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Diversity hiring is hiring based on merit, with exceptional care taken to ensure procedures have reduced biases related to a candidate's age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other personal characteristics that are unrelated to their job performance.

323
01:38:36,061 --> 01:38:41,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Diversity hiring is what we are going to be aspiring for here in Medford.

324
01:38:49,893 --> 01:38:58,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanna be in our endeavor to improve our policies and procedures.

325
01:39:00,262 --> 01:39:03,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to know that this audit was not about myself.

326
01:39:04,755 --> 01:39:08,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Maurice-Edouard Vincent, or my professional values.

327
01:39:09,739 --> 01:39:28,894
[SPEAKER_04]: What we are aspiring to do is align to the 2030 goals that are outlined here for the city of Medford, that are outlined at BSE, and that are outlined in the national 2030 global education goals that are both national and international.

328
01:39:29,775 --> 01:39:32,077
[SPEAKER_04]: What we are aspiring to do here in Medford

329
01:39:33,433 --> 01:39:35,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not on an island unto ourselves.

330
01:39:42,558 --> 01:39:46,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were some key recommendations that were based on the survey data.

331
01:39:50,843 --> 01:39:53,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just read a few of them.

332
01:39:57,555 --> 01:40:08,641
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them under survey data was developing a hiring process that includes questions grounded in equity that meets the needs of our diverse populations.

333
01:40:11,942 --> 01:40:20,507
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to work with supporting our building-based leaders by allowing them to lead and focus on instructional leadership.

334
01:40:23,626 --> 01:40:39,615
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be able to host informative community events that keeps all of our stakeholders up to date and explain to them the difference between diverse hiring and hiring for diversity.

335
01:40:41,976 --> 01:40:43,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing, next slide please.

336
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:51,802
[SPEAKER_04]: These were some recommendations based on facilitated discussions.

337
01:40:54,707 --> 01:41:04,053
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about creating inclusive standards that include accountability and confidentiality for all staff who work in the HR department.

338
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:14,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Creating a structure that fosters a sense of belonging for all staff while centering those from minority groups.

339
01:41:18,943 --> 01:41:19,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing.

340
01:41:23,803 --> 01:41:35,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Creating a system for training building base leaders on equitable hiring practices and procedures, including but not limited to diversity hiring practices and processes.

341
01:41:40,008 --> 01:41:43,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Creating a process that allows for competitive hiring.

342
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:50,892
[SPEAKER_04]: The hiring timeline, to have it begin as early as February or before.

343
01:41:52,972 --> 01:42:08,265
[SPEAKER_04]: and to be able to end in June and seeking approval from the school committee to see if that's something that we could continue to do and do it in a more formalized way.

344
01:42:08,285 --> 01:42:17,192
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna be able to also create exit interview processes that tracks and records all exit interview data.

345
01:42:19,834 --> 01:42:20,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing.

346
01:42:24,266 --> 01:42:29,768
[SPEAKER_04]: We identified some inconsistencies that currently exist right now.

347
01:42:30,668 --> 01:42:46,513
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that we do not have yet but we will be working on is creating an HR human resources handbook to consist of policies and procedures and expected practices that include but aren't limited to.

348
01:42:47,642 --> 01:42:51,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do not have a handbook that houses everything all in one place.

349
01:42:52,405 --> 01:42:54,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that we will be working on.

350
01:42:55,267 --> 01:43:06,193
[SPEAKER_04]: We would love to have a diversity statement that speaks to the environment that Metro Public Schools will create to support, empower, and celebrate members of our community.

351
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:15,598
[SPEAKER_04]: We also want to include statements and processes on our values, performance management, talent development, confidentiality,

352
01:43:16,559 --> 01:43:31,682
[SPEAKER_04]: constructive and cooperative discipline, dress code, the evaluation process at all levels, clear and transparent expectations of reciprocal communication between human resources and staff.

353
01:43:34,403 --> 01:43:35,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Christian.

354
01:43:41,885 --> 01:43:43,585
[SPEAKER_04]: For school committee recommendations,

355
01:43:45,626 --> 01:43:48,728
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be able to set the smarty goals.

356
01:43:49,068 --> 01:43:52,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is from Desi, that is Jedi driven.

357
01:43:52,750 --> 01:44:00,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put at the bottom Jedi, that is one of the key vocabulary words, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

358
01:44:03,175 --> 01:44:11,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Reminding us that we have over 4,000 students within the district and always putting our students first.

359
01:44:14,568 --> 01:44:20,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Centering policies practices procedures around their needs and expected outcomes.

360
01:44:29,338 --> 01:44:49,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Recommendations based on our current district vision and mission statement to co-create a simple, simplified district vision and a simplified district mission statement that is aligned to the 2030 global education standards.

361
01:44:54,291 --> 01:44:54,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing.

362
01:44:56,877 --> 01:44:58,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is a continuum.

363
01:44:59,201 --> 01:45:02,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I have participated in significant professional development this year.

364
01:45:04,355 --> 01:45:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: This particular slide is from the professional development that I was part of that was based out of Desi, and it worked with 25 superintendents and equity directors across the Commonwealth.

365
01:45:19,963 --> 01:45:26,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Half of those superintendents were BIPOC individuals of color, and half of them were white superintendents.

366
01:45:27,227 --> 01:45:29,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And we engaged in this learning together.

367
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:33,651
[SPEAKER_04]: They would separate us, and they would bring us back together to share our learning.

368
01:45:35,655 --> 01:45:39,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Diversity, belonging, inclusion, and equity.

369
01:45:42,938 --> 01:45:51,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at those four buckets, I want to preface it to say that this takes about eight to 10 years to achieve.

370
01:45:54,763 --> 01:45:59,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Under diversity, it says you've been asked to the party.

371
01:46:02,506 --> 01:46:03,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Under belonging,

372
01:46:04,656 --> 01:46:08,558
[SPEAKER_04]: you feel welcomed and comfortable going to the party.

373
01:46:11,479 --> 01:46:16,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Under inclusion, you've been asked to help plan the party.

374
01:46:19,423 --> 01:46:30,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And under equity, it redefines what the party entails, who has the power to plan the party, and if there should even be a party.

375
01:46:33,157 --> 01:46:38,179
[SPEAKER_04]: We are just embarking, I see Medford in the diversity bucket.

376
01:46:38,999 --> 01:46:40,100
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just starting there.

377
01:46:43,561 --> 01:46:44,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing.

378
01:46:49,443 --> 01:46:53,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bigger picture for us here in Medford, our North Star.

379
01:46:53,065 --> 01:46:58,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you might see the Little Dipper or Big Dipper there.

380
01:47:01,946 --> 01:47:03,127
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we need to do next?

381
01:47:03,347 --> 01:47:08,109
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to set our intended priorities based on the audits recommendations.

382
01:47:09,389 --> 01:47:10,650
[SPEAKER_04]: This was only phase one.

383
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:21,115
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to create and continue to foster an HR department that embraces diversity hiring in the 2030 goals.

384
01:47:23,496 --> 01:47:27,578
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna be ensuring that our students are centered in a part of our creation.

385
01:47:30,066 --> 01:47:39,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to work closely with our internal and external stakeholders to ensure that we are inclusive and objective during our processes.

386
01:47:41,733 --> 01:47:46,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want to be building stronger partnerships with our community organizations.

387
01:47:51,179 --> 01:47:58,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Christian, this work takes time and thoughtful planning.

388
01:48:00,396 --> 01:48:01,677
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get there together.

389
01:48:01,697 --> 01:48:09,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say a special thank you to the race equity task force.

390
01:48:10,782 --> 01:48:14,063
[SPEAKER_04]: for their support and feedback throughout the year.

391
01:48:14,363 --> 01:48:26,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to thank the Medford School Committee for your support, for commissioning this audit, this first phase, and allowing us to start looking at our own policies, practices, and procedures.

392
01:48:27,906 --> 01:48:32,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to thank the equity process for working with us this school year.

393
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:33,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

394
01:48:42,008 --> 01:48:44,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson, any questions?

395
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

396
01:48:46,431 --> 01:48:48,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the consultant's engagement complete?

397
01:48:49,794 --> 01:48:51,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say it again, please?

398
01:48:51,475 --> 01:48:56,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the equity process organization's engagement with us complete?

399
01:48:56,879 --> 01:49:06,286
[SPEAKER_04]: For phase one, there's a few things that we're working on throughout this month, but we are finishing phase one by the end of June.

400
01:49:06,326 --> 01:49:08,788
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be done with them for this first phase.

401
01:49:09,308 --> 01:49:09,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

402
01:49:11,775 --> 01:49:23,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to start by saying I'm completely supportive of this work, but this is not what I expected to receive at the end of a paid engagement from a consultant who is an expert in this.

403
01:49:24,155 --> 01:49:26,657
[SPEAKER_04]: have a document that will be coming next week.

404
01:49:26,677 --> 01:49:32,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to present the findings because I had said that I would get it out the first week of June.

405
01:49:34,082 --> 01:49:37,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to be clear that we asked for a couple of really important things.

406
01:49:38,325 --> 01:49:46,971
[SPEAKER_09]: One is a roadmap of how we would go about implementing all of these recommendations in some sort of sequential order that makes sense for our district.

407
01:49:48,504 --> 01:49:49,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see that here.

408
01:49:50,827 --> 01:49:56,615
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't do this with just a list of things like it's, we are not going to be able to do that.

409
01:49:57,736 --> 01:50:04,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So my expectation was that there would be a clear roadmap that reflected our priorities and our realities.

410
01:50:05,646 --> 01:50:06,686
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's missing.

411
01:50:07,306 --> 01:50:23,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we also specifically asked the consultant for commentary around our wage scales and whether they were supportive or not supportive of our goals around hiring and retention by POC staff.

412
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:28,911
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some of that in the report that I, the version that I was looking at, the last version.

413
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:34,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I would like to see the full report before we continue to engage this consultant further because

414
01:50:34,672 --> 01:50:38,433
[SPEAKER_09]: this isn't enough for us to act on, as far as I can tell.

415
01:50:39,754 --> 01:50:40,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

416
01:50:40,714 --> 01:50:41,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Graham.

417
01:50:58,021 --> 01:51:01,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Petrella, you did request to be on the agenda.

418
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:09,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

419
01:51:13,191 --> 01:51:14,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Oka Street, Method Mass.

420
01:51:15,532 --> 01:51:18,094
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have to agree with you, by the way.

421
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:27,780
[SPEAKER_18]: The equity audit, the company that did this audit, can I ask how much that cost us?

422
01:51:29,901 --> 01:51:31,582
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just curious, what was the cost?

423
01:51:35,624 --> 01:51:36,104
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone know?

424
01:51:37,697 --> 01:51:42,741
[SPEAKER_18]: had an audit done, but we don't know how much it costs.

425
01:51:42,921 --> 01:51:43,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 17, 18,000.

426
01:51:45,262 --> 01:51:45,943
[SPEAKER_11]: In the $17,000 range.

427
01:51:46,083 --> 01:51:46,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

428
01:51:46,683 --> 01:51:53,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not an equity audit of the district, it was an equity audit of human resources.

429
01:51:53,888 --> 01:51:54,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, okay.

430
01:51:55,510 --> 01:52:02,775
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know you questioned the school committee, they questioned human resources, did they question the people that matter?

431
01:52:03,315 --> 01:52:04,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information.

432
01:52:04,821 --> 01:52:06,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, member Graham.

433
01:52:06,663 --> 01:52:10,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we just clarify when we have speakers how long they have to speak?

434
01:52:10,666 --> 01:52:12,748
[SPEAKER_18]: I know my time's limited.

435
01:52:13,228 --> 01:52:16,331
[SPEAKER_18]: That's another problem we have with the school committee.

436
01:52:16,471 --> 01:52:17,392
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very limited.

437
01:52:19,173 --> 01:52:28,381
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a meeting at four o'clock in the afternoon back in March to verify the new rules and you guys all voted on them.

438
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:32,198
[SPEAKER_18]: which did nothing but cut people like me out from speaking.

439
01:52:32,699 --> 01:52:35,421
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been trying to speak up here for about seven, eight weeks.

440
01:52:35,961 --> 01:52:39,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Not angry at anybody, not mad at anybody.

441
01:52:39,524 --> 01:52:40,805
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really not, okay?

442
01:52:40,865 --> 01:52:42,827
[SPEAKER_18]: But we just did an equity audit.

443
01:52:45,289 --> 01:52:47,050
[SPEAKER_18]: The company is equity processed.

444
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:48,871
[SPEAKER_18]: We know who the company is, right?

445
01:52:48,931 --> 01:52:49,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Is everyone aware?

446
01:52:49,772 --> 01:52:50,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we vet them?

447
01:52:50,833 --> 01:52:51,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we look at them?

448
01:52:53,135 --> 01:52:53,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we?

449
01:52:56,567 --> 01:52:59,668
[SPEAKER_18]: And you looked at all four people that are the offices on this company?

450
01:52:59,688 --> 01:53:03,369
[SPEAKER_13]: We had the CEO before us.

451
01:53:03,669 --> 01:53:05,889
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other three that are listed on it?

452
01:53:05,969 --> 01:53:10,731
[SPEAKER_18]: Because one of them leaves a lot... I can't even repeat some of the things he said.

453
01:53:10,751 --> 01:53:12,991
[SPEAKER_18]: But yet...

454
01:53:16,946 --> 01:53:17,606
[SPEAKER_18]: we went with this.

455
01:53:17,686 --> 01:53:22,869
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the other thing, I understand we needed, I guess you guys think we need the equity audit.

456
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:24,730
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what it's all about.

457
01:53:25,571 --> 01:53:28,132
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to figure out what it has to do with education.

458
01:53:28,732 --> 01:53:34,916
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't hear a word about education, which is what we all care about.

459
01:53:37,079 --> 01:53:38,840
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, my kids went to school.

460
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:40,401
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't care about any of this stuff.

461
01:53:40,682 --> 01:53:47,967
[SPEAKER_10]: In the presentation, there was information on the DESE standard for the equity audit and other educational institutions.

462
01:53:48,007 --> 01:53:51,029
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but we didn't discuss anything about education.

463
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:53,051
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all, we just, we didn't.

464
01:53:53,811 --> 01:53:56,293
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you guys, you know.

465
01:53:58,374 --> 01:54:00,636
[SPEAKER_11]: This is more about diversity within education.

466
01:54:00,776 --> 01:54:02,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, diversity equity.

467
01:54:02,077 --> 01:54:03,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this diversity?

468
01:54:04,219 --> 01:54:05,940
[SPEAKER_18]: What sex are you assigned at birth?

469
01:54:07,605 --> 01:54:09,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, is that equity, diversity?

470
01:54:09,647 --> 01:54:11,948
[SPEAKER_18]: What does that got to do with education?

471
01:54:12,609 --> 01:54:14,130
[SPEAKER_18]: It has a lot to do with diversity.

472
01:54:15,431 --> 01:54:16,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Diversity, how?

473
01:54:18,653 --> 01:54:20,695
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm asking you a serious question.

474
01:54:20,735 --> 01:54:21,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Diversity, how?

475
01:54:22,356 --> 01:54:24,637
[SPEAKER_18]: What sex were you assigned at birth?

476
01:54:25,798 --> 01:54:28,580
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a survey that went out to kids in Medford.

477
01:54:29,161 --> 01:54:30,642
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, this is bothersome.

478
01:54:31,903 --> 01:54:33,204
[SPEAKER_18]: You have one more minute, Mr. Petrella.

479
01:54:33,464 --> 01:54:34,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know, I know.

480
01:54:34,885 --> 01:54:35,706
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the other thing.

481
01:54:36,086 --> 01:54:38,728
[SPEAKER_18]: That's very bothersome.

482
01:54:39,008 --> 01:54:43,471
[SPEAKER_18]: The people in the city can't come up, we can't speak, we're shut out of everything.

483
01:54:44,231 --> 01:54:46,793
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a fact, it's a fact.

484
01:54:46,873 --> 01:54:49,995
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very frustrating, very, very frustrating.

485
01:54:51,416 --> 01:54:56,980
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's like, you're not gonna listen, you're not gonna pay attention.

486
01:54:58,681 --> 01:54:59,982
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't matter anymore.

487
01:55:02,123 --> 01:55:09,085
[SPEAKER_18]: We have something we want to discuss about the kids and to me, this equity audit didn't accomplish anything.

488
01:55:10,105 --> 01:55:15,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't we do an audit on education and what's going on with the education of these kids?

489
01:55:15,527 --> 01:55:19,728
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't we talk to the teachers and get their opinion on what's happening?

490
01:55:19,828 --> 01:55:23,149
[SPEAKER_04]: In light of the pandemic, we were not going into classrooms.

491
01:55:24,649 --> 01:55:27,090
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no pandemic anymore.

492
01:55:33,103 --> 01:55:33,383
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

493
01:55:33,483 --> 01:55:37,164
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no pandemic, so we weren't going into classrooms a while ago.

494
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:38,344
[SPEAKER_18]: That's over.

495
01:55:38,464 --> 01:55:41,365
[SPEAKER_18]: We could have went in and asked teachers what's going on in the schools.

496
01:55:42,065 --> 01:55:43,105
[SPEAKER_11]: This was an HR audit.

497
01:55:44,366 --> 01:55:44,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

498
01:55:44,666 --> 01:55:48,907
[SPEAKER_18]: There's so many things that are going on that just aren't right.

499
01:55:49,167 --> 01:55:51,587
[SPEAKER_18]: What happened last week?

500
01:55:52,228 --> 01:55:54,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we're hearing about school security.

501
01:55:54,848 --> 01:55:56,849
[SPEAKER_18]: That should have been like priority one.

502
01:55:58,369 --> 01:56:01,610
[SPEAKER_18]: The security of the teachers, the kids, nothing.

503
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:06,151
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I'm sitting home and I'm like, oh, this is horrible.

504
01:56:06,191 --> 01:56:12,074
[SPEAKER_18]: You watch it, your heart breaks for everybody and everything, the teachers, everyone that lost their lives.

505
01:56:12,154 --> 01:56:13,095
[SPEAKER_18]: What did Medford do?

506
01:56:14,876 --> 01:56:15,536
[SPEAKER_18]: What do we do?

507
01:56:16,237 --> 01:56:17,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Pichella.

508
01:56:17,137 --> 01:56:19,158
[SPEAKER_11]: We're discussing it now, that's what we're doing.

509
01:56:19,498 --> 01:56:20,779
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we have a safety plan.

510
01:56:25,461 --> 01:56:32,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three, we have fiscal year 23, Medford Public School operating budget update, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. David Murphy.

511
01:56:47,517 --> 01:56:50,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening Mayor, there's a school commits pleasure to be with you as always.

512
01:56:52,419 --> 01:56:54,220
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a short deck.

513
01:56:54,260 --> 01:57:01,703
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the fifth or sixth time over the course of the last three or four weeks that we have briefed you on the developing f y 23.

514
01:57:03,084 --> 01:57:03,785
[SPEAKER_16]: operating budget.

515
01:57:04,586 --> 01:57:17,377
[SPEAKER_16]: There are some well the deck is short tonight there are some significant substantive updates with respect to the fiscal forecast and so I'll be happy to share that with you and answer your questions as best as possible so

516
01:57:18,358 --> 01:57:26,361
[SPEAKER_16]: If we go to the first slide you see that on May 25, the school committee approved the budget request.

517
01:57:26,841 --> 01:57:30,143
[SPEAKER_16]: And as we've said throughout the course of the budget development process.

518
01:57:30,643 --> 01:57:33,964
[SPEAKER_16]: The first step is the school committee making that request based on the identified

519
01:57:34,504 --> 01:57:48,340
[SPEAKER_16]: needs of the district and strategic priorities, as presented by the administration, the price tag for that package that the school can be approved which you'll recall included strategic priorities and categories, a, b,

520
01:57:49,141 --> 01:57:58,548
[SPEAKER_16]: B and D, and I'll offer a brief refresher as to the implications of each of the categories momentarily, but that came out to approximately $71.8 million.

521
01:57:59,468 --> 01:58:11,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember that the initial price tag to that was $72.4 million, but as we continue to examine the fixed cost increases and a few other components of the budget, we were able to ultimately identify that

522
01:58:12,217 --> 01:58:21,506
[SPEAKER_16]: as an operating budget that would be inclusive of all of the strategic priorities identified in categories A, B, and D would be $71.8 million.

523
01:58:22,247 --> 01:58:32,017
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll notice in that table on the right, in the top row, that that includes a budgeted cost of living adjustment of 2% across the board for all employees.

524
01:58:32,377 --> 01:58:34,719
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is, as I said, also inclusive of the

525
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:50,466
[SPEAKER_16]: of the fixed cost increases those are the contractual obligations steps lanes, transportation and a few other vendors to for which the district is obligated to, to, to see increases based on existing agreements.

526
01:58:53,919 --> 01:59:03,285
[SPEAKER_16]: This weekend, we did receive from the city administration the anticipated recommendation for the school department's financial authorization.

527
01:59:04,066 --> 01:59:16,213
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see that there is a significant discrepancy between those two numbers, the $71.8 million that the committee voted on and the anticipated 68, essentially, we're gonna call it $69 million.

528
01:59:16,313 --> 01:59:19,175
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a few thousand dollars below $69 million appropriation.

529
01:59:22,057 --> 01:59:26,739
[SPEAKER_16]: That has a delta of $2.8 million, or thereabouts.

530
01:59:26,779 --> 01:59:28,580
[SPEAKER_16]: That's on the table on the left.

531
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:29,201
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see that.

532
01:59:29,701 --> 01:59:44,848
[SPEAKER_16]: And so you heard me say several times, we had several, I think, thoughtful discussions about the school administration's responsibility to plan for a variety of contingencies throughout the course of the budget process.

533
01:59:45,388 --> 01:59:50,531
[SPEAKER_16]: It is not a surprise that the budget request that this committee made exceeded

534
01:59:51,031 --> 01:59:55,195
[SPEAKER_16]: that which the city could the mayor's office can recommend to the city council.

535
01:59:55,855 --> 02:00:09,786
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's why we have to go through that contingency planning process and it's also why, as was the case last year, there's a budget reconciliation process that we now need to engage in, in order to align those numbers and to prepare to implement the FY 23 operating budget.

536
02:00:10,635 --> 02:00:34,327
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first step of that contingency reconciliation process was, I hope, communicated very clearly throughout the budget development process, which is that for category B priorities, of which there are only a handful, but they are priorities for which there's an urgent need to address the newcomer strand being one of them.

537
02:00:34,347 --> 02:00:38,549
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I didn't bring the list of priorities with me, but I think you're pretty familiar with them at this point.

538
02:00:39,311 --> 02:00:41,534
[SPEAKER_16]: It amounts to approximately $600,000.

539
02:00:42,054 --> 02:00:45,358
[SPEAKER_16]: And due to the nexus between those spending priorities and the pandemic.

540
02:00:46,199 --> 02:00:54,988
[SPEAKER_16]: We've determined that they are so appropriate, and also that they are, we think, time limited, and that as we move further away from the pandemic.

541
02:00:55,648 --> 02:00:58,111
[SPEAKER_16]: the likelihood that those costs should subside.

542
02:00:58,491 --> 02:01:07,280
[SPEAKER_16]: It is possible, as we've said throughout last year's budgeting process and throughout this year's, that they will be identified as continuing needs that extend beyond the life of the ESSER program.

543
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:14,586
[SPEAKER_16]: And if that's the case, it will be incumbent upon the school district and the city to determine how it is that we can absorb those costs within our operating budget.

544
02:01:14,626 --> 02:01:19,911
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have some time to do that due to the availability of that temporary funding through ESSER.

545
02:01:20,552 --> 02:01:39,598
[SPEAKER_16]: The category D priorities, our priorities are things that we identified that would be important and that all of which we think will advance the district's goals and strategic plan, but they are not of a as much of an urgent caliber as the category A and therefore on that hierarchy they were they were considered lower.

546
02:01:40,058 --> 02:01:58,880
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, the first step in in record reconciling this budget consistent with the recommendations we've made from the beginning of the process would be for category B to move to answer in category, D, either to be deferred to subsequent fiscal years, or to be charged through other sources of revenue or one time.

547
02:01:59,821 --> 02:02:00,642
[SPEAKER_16]: or one-time funding.

548
02:02:01,242 --> 02:02:21,493
[SPEAKER_16]: So over the course of the next week, as we publish the draft budget book, you'll see that there'll be a reconciliation memo that will essentially identify which are ones that we've been able to, which priorities of category D we'll be able to identify other sources of funding for, and then which are ones that it would be our recommendation that they be deferred to subsequent fiscal years.

549
02:02:22,094 --> 02:02:23,495
[SPEAKER_16]: With respect to category A,

550
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:33,117
[SPEAKER_16]: those are the priorities amounting to about a little under $500,000 that it would be our hope to pursue in fiscal year 23.

551
02:02:33,877 --> 02:02:44,586
[SPEAKER_16]: But in light of the magnitude of this discrepancy, there's a likelihood that we will need to potentially resort to other external funding sources if we are in fact to pursue those strategic priorities.

552
02:02:45,066 --> 02:02:47,148
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I'll just, I'll finish on this slide.

553
02:02:48,838 --> 02:02:49,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Did I already finish it?

554
02:02:49,519 --> 02:03:16,997
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I will finish on this slide just by saying that again, this is an operating budget that while we strive to close that $1.4 million gap, we are retaining as a fixed priority the as yet to be negotiated cost of living increases, which we'll talk a little bit about in a minute with respect to reiterate the sort of primary drivers behind our operating budget and the nexus between those and the collective bargaining process that is underway.

555
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:26,931
[SPEAKER_16]: when we get to that $1.4 million reconciliation, it will include still a budgeted 2% increase across the board.

556
02:03:28,279 --> 02:03:29,940
[SPEAKER_16]: There's only two more slides that we need to go over.

557
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:36,825
[SPEAKER_16]: The next one, this is again, how will we bridge that $1.4 million gap prior to next week's budget hearing?

558
02:03:37,905 --> 02:03:52,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it is possible that there'll be some fluctuation with respect to the $69 billion number, but at this point we have enough information basically that it's a responsibility on our office's part to prepare essentially a $69 million budget.

559
02:03:53,395 --> 02:03:55,717
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll be sharing with you how we're going to align

560
02:03:56,597 --> 02:04:04,700
[SPEAKER_16]: try to advance at least the goals, if not the specific priorities of category A, as well as the existing obligations that we have.

561
02:04:05,681 --> 02:04:21,347
[SPEAKER_16]: And to go to the point that you've heard me say many times over the course of the past several months, that our strategic objective of ensuring competitive and sustainable wage increases, and for that reason, that 2% increase will continue to be incorporated into that operating budget.

562
02:04:21,807 --> 02:04:26,230
[SPEAKER_16]: That being said, there will be things that, if it's $69 million, will not be incorporated into that budget.

563
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:28,451
[SPEAKER_16]: So there will be priorities that we've shared.

564
02:04:28,871 --> 02:04:36,996
[SPEAKER_16]: There will be things that I think both in the administration and in the committee, and I'm sure in many parts of the community, that we would like to be included in this budget.

565
02:04:37,036 --> 02:04:41,779
[SPEAKER_16]: But at $69 million, there is going to be a significant reconciliation process.

566
02:04:41,819 --> 02:04:46,662
[SPEAKER_16]: So just in the last slide, and then I'll be happy to, next to the last slide, actually, I'm going to ask to go to one more.

567
02:04:47,502 --> 02:04:48,083
[SPEAKER_16]: momentarily.

568
02:04:48,103 --> 02:04:49,944
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the next steps.

569
02:04:50,245 --> 02:04:52,507
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the timeline that we would anticipate over the several weeks.

570
02:04:52,787 --> 02:04:59,753
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have a specific timeline from the municipal council yet, but I know that that, or I assume at least that that invitation will be forthcoming.

571
02:05:00,513 --> 02:05:07,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I would anticipate doing our statutory budget hearing next week, and then we will go on from there.

572
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:12,424
[SPEAKER_16]: The remaining slides, Dr. Cushing, if we want to go maybe two more,

573
02:05:13,204 --> 02:05:16,487
[SPEAKER_16]: These are all slides that you've seen in our budget process and our timeline that we've gone through.

574
02:05:16,507 --> 02:05:17,567
[SPEAKER_16]: That's good right there, thank you.

575
02:05:18,348 --> 02:05:28,875
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a slide that you've seen before that I presented to you on May 2nd in a conversation that we've had both before, during, and we will have for a long time after this particular budget process.

576
02:05:29,656 --> 02:05:34,959
[SPEAKER_16]: When, like every other school district, we are primarily a personnel-driven organization.

577
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:37,441
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we're at $67.4 million this year, approximately $55 billion goes

578
02:05:40,923 --> 02:05:41,924
[SPEAKER_16]: to personnel costs.

579
02:05:42,304 --> 02:05:56,053
[SPEAKER_16]: The vast majority of our employees are in bargaining units, and the vast majority of our employees are dedicated public servants that help, as we've said in other forums, turn our school buildings into school communities.

580
02:05:56,133 --> 02:06:08,301
[SPEAKER_16]: And for that reason, and because we have a responsibility to try to maintain our competitiveness, it is our responsibility to do whatever we can to maintain both competitive and sustainable wage increases.

581
02:06:09,142 --> 02:06:09,762
[SPEAKER_16]: That being said,

582
02:06:12,005 --> 02:06:16,870
[SPEAKER_16]: wage increases that are not sustainable will have an impact on our ability to staff schools appropriately.

583
02:06:17,411 --> 02:06:24,258
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is because of how schools are organized, it is a, it is a fact of life, essentially, that if we are unable to.

584
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:33,622
[SPEAKER_16]: land in a place with sustainable wage increases, we will not have the staffing structures that we need to support students.

585
02:06:33,662 --> 02:06:38,764
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's particularly true amongst student populations that are considered most vulnerable or high need.

586
02:06:39,644 --> 02:06:43,366
[SPEAKER_16]: That is what has driven our priorities throughout the collective bargaining process.

587
02:06:43,686 --> 02:06:48,307
[SPEAKER_16]: It is what will continue to drive our priorities throughout the collective bargaining process.

588
02:06:49,067 --> 02:06:53,429
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would say, I'm happy to take your questions and I'll answer them as carefully as I can.

589
02:06:54,029 --> 02:07:14,557
[SPEAKER_16]: because in light of the budgetary context that we find ourselves in, I think there's a responsibility on all stakeholders' part to communicate information that is accurate, that is based in fact, and that is not contradicted by the clear guidance that we've received from a variety of legal authorities.

590
02:07:15,057 --> 02:07:16,337
[SPEAKER_16]: And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

591
02:07:17,278 --> 02:07:17,518
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor?

592
02:07:20,119 --> 02:07:20,759
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Rousseau?

593
02:07:21,619 --> 02:07:22,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

594
02:07:24,062 --> 02:07:35,635
[SPEAKER_21]: In the May 25 presentation, the level funding, meaning we do not one nickel of more anything, was $71.1 million.

595
02:07:37,237 --> 02:07:39,760
[SPEAKER_21]: So how is the number we're looking at?

596
02:07:42,943 --> 02:07:45,406
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand that figuring out how we can add those

597
02:07:46,345 --> 02:07:50,049
[SPEAKER_21]: those category A items is obviously critically important.

598
02:07:51,651 --> 02:07:56,817
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to have enough EL teachers for the number of EL students, et cetera.

599
02:07:58,899 --> 02:08:05,127
[SPEAKER_21]: But if we ignored that we have to add those, where are we cutting?

600
02:08:09,772 --> 02:08:10,952
[SPEAKER_21]: $2.2 million.

601
02:08:11,273 --> 02:08:35,211
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's 2.2, but I think when you see the book and the reconciliation memo, you'll see that some of what was initially determined to be a $2.5 million fixed cost, maybe $2.6 million cost increase, that number is lower on the basis of identifying existing capacity within the FY22 budget that can essentially absorb some of those fixed cost increases.

602
02:08:36,753 --> 02:08:41,717
[SPEAKER_16]: I can think of two examples of the top my head and the transportation line and in the math department.

603
02:08:43,098 --> 02:08:53,187
[SPEAKER_16]: There were some unrealized expenditures that positioned us to be able to absorb the cost of investigations three more easily than we had initially anticipated.

604
02:08:53,567 --> 02:08:55,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And so there's some there's some fluctuation there.

605
02:08:55,790 --> 02:09:10,770
[SPEAKER_16]: The second part of the answer is that over the course of the past several days, and it's only been in the last several days in which this processes has unfolded the magnitude of that discrepancy is significantly greater than anyone in the school or city administration.

606
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:11,810
[SPEAKER_16]: anticipated.

607
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:28,097
[SPEAKER_16]: And so in light of that, there has been, you've heard me use the term scrubbing before, there's been a more intense scrubbing of the budget to identify what expenses can be moved to other appropriate sources of revenue.

608
02:09:28,757 --> 02:09:30,918
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are personnel associated with

609
02:09:31,578 --> 02:09:39,260
[SPEAKER_16]: revolving accounts that we've, for purposes of stability, tried to incorporate into the operating budget as just a matter of more sound fiscal practice.

610
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:54,584
[SPEAKER_16]: And unfortunately, to get to the number we're going to, at this moment, believe we'll need to get to, to implement an operating budget, some of that, some of those decisions have been made, which is resulting in some of that fluctuation.

611
02:09:56,141 --> 02:10:05,026
[SPEAKER_21]: So in 2020, the schools, we laid off dozens of people and the rest of the city laid off zero people.

612
02:10:06,787 --> 02:10:19,015
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm trying to understand how we're not in the same boat because getting a level number, if you have 10 open spots, don't hire your 10 open spots and everybody gets to come to work tomorrow.

613
02:10:19,475 --> 02:10:25,479
[SPEAKER_21]: When you have no open spots or just a couple and you need to shave off millions of dollars,

614
02:10:26,144 --> 02:10:29,807
[SPEAKER_21]: you're giving people notice that they're not gonna have a job.

615
02:10:30,307 --> 02:10:41,855
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess I'm trying to figure out how, I mean, do you, and I know it's only been a few days, but in 2020, my understanding is we scrubbed to the bone.

616
02:10:42,936 --> 02:10:46,759
[SPEAKER_21]: We got rid of people that we didn't want to get rid of.

617
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:51,402
[SPEAKER_21]: We asked like people who wants to volunteer to retire early, you know,

618
02:10:52,856 --> 02:10:56,797
[SPEAKER_21]: We did things that nobody wanted to do.

619
02:10:57,557 --> 02:11:01,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And last year, we didn't go on a spending spree.

620
02:11:02,559 --> 02:11:05,760
[SPEAKER_21]: So who else is there we're going to be able to get rid of?

621
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:15,263
[SPEAKER_21]: That sounds really crass, but if we're short millions of dollars, running a single dollar deficit is illegal, am I correct?

622
02:11:17,597 --> 02:11:18,478
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't run a deficit.

623
02:11:18,498 --> 02:11:19,198
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a true statement.

624
02:11:19,338 --> 02:11:20,519
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't finish the fiscal year.

625
02:11:20,979 --> 02:11:37,332
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's part of why when we build the budget, you know, generally speaking, you can't on approximately $70 million plan to land right at zero because to your point, landing just beyond zero is really problematic.

626
02:11:37,552 --> 02:11:39,574
[SPEAKER_16]: That's also why I update you on a quarterly basis.

627
02:11:39,634 --> 02:11:43,737
[SPEAKER_16]: It's why we try to, you know, try to keep you as informed as possible with regard to our financial position.

628
02:11:44,418 --> 02:11:49,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, I wasn't here, as you know, during that particular period of time.

629
02:11:49,301 --> 02:11:55,305
[SPEAKER_16]: I think my answer would be sort of multi-part.

630
02:11:55,525 --> 02:12:03,750
[SPEAKER_16]: One, I think it's absolutely true that there's not a lot of fat in this budget, okay?

631
02:12:05,571 --> 02:12:06,552
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also true that

632
02:12:07,776 --> 02:12:13,397
[SPEAKER_16]: When the entire budget and the entire organization is made up primarily of personnel.

633
02:12:14,138 --> 02:12:26,161
[SPEAKER_16]: If you need to reduce, it's inevitable that they're going to be personnel implications to that you just think there's not enough money being spent on things other than personnel to bridge the type of gap that we're talking about.

634
02:12:27,583 --> 02:12:50,470
[SPEAKER_16]: we did implement a quasi hiring freeze earlier in the year, not frankly because we were anticipating a $1.4 million funding deficit, as much as we were just being cautious with respect to closing the fiscal year in the black and knowing that with nine open collective bargaining agreements, there were potentially significant expenses that had not yet been realized.

635
02:12:51,731 --> 02:12:51,971
[SPEAKER_16]: That

636
02:12:52,651 --> 02:13:07,677
[SPEAKER_16]: puts up to some degree I think insulates us from the type of massive personnel sort of catastrophe that I think it's not you sounds like you've lived through in this district and as many districts are very familiar with.

637
02:13:10,216 --> 02:13:12,938
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not to say there aren't going to be personnel implications to this.

638
02:13:12,979 --> 02:13:13,739
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there will be.

639
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:35,399
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that to sort of as a forecast as to where that pain is expected to be felt, I would go back to the overarching budgetary priorities that we've articulated here several times, which the really short version is we want the pain to be as far removed from the classroom as possible so that it can have the least possible impact on students.

640
02:13:35,959 --> 02:13:36,680
[SPEAKER_16]: At the same time,

641
02:13:37,273 --> 02:13:39,855
[SPEAKER_16]: As you know, and as has been discussed in a variety of ways.

642
02:13:40,796 --> 02:13:47,462
[SPEAKER_16]: When we have operational deficiencies, there is a ripple effect that eventually has a negative impact on classrooms and on teaching and learning.

643
02:13:48,243 --> 02:13:51,485
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that to your point about having already sort of trimmed to the bone.

644
02:13:53,737 --> 02:14:06,449
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where I think it's going to be problematic because there are not an infinite number of places that are away from students that we can look to cut.

645
02:14:06,989 --> 02:14:13,055
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that will be clear as you start to see the ways in which we've looked to reconcile these numbers.

646
02:14:14,677 --> 02:14:17,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Last point, I promise, and then I'm happy to take more questions.

647
02:14:19,005 --> 02:14:29,269
[SPEAKER_16]: The goal is not necessarily to just slash and burn the budget down to that number, particularly given the timeline that we're on.

648
02:14:29,449 --> 02:14:31,630
[SPEAKER_16]: This is obviously a very condensed timeline.

649
02:14:31,670 --> 02:14:39,353
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that pressure and that frustration is shared by our colleagues in the city administration as well.

650
02:14:40,354 --> 02:14:45,816
[SPEAKER_16]: And so a lot of the sort of strategic work will be around identifying other funding sources

651
02:14:46,696 --> 02:15:09,964
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think what that means is there will need to be significant scrutiny and analysis over the course of FY23 so that we can make some prudent decision making over the long term and hopefully not be in a place that is more problematic than it needs to be a year from now as we prepare for FY24.

652
02:15:10,044 --> 02:15:13,326
[SPEAKER_21]: I have just one more question before.

653
02:15:15,989 --> 02:15:25,633
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we have a meeting next week, and hopefully, if you don't sleep, the next week you'll have more clarity for us on where adjustments might have to happen.

654
02:15:25,653 --> 02:15:28,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I anticipate that clarity before Monday, just to be clear.

655
02:15:28,614 --> 02:15:28,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

656
02:15:29,074 --> 02:15:38,498
[SPEAKER_21]: I just hope that the school committee can be a participant in that guidance, because our parents are adjustment counselors are nurses.

657
02:15:39,850 --> 02:15:51,917
[SPEAKER_21]: all of our support staff, while not at the front of the classroom, while the paras sometimes are, they are as close to the students as the teachers are.

658
02:15:52,037 --> 02:16:04,404
[SPEAKER_21]: Not all of the students all the time necessarily, but the notion that they're not, I mean, there's plenty of, and I'm sure there's plenty of classrooms where the teacher without a para would be pulling their hair out.

659
02:16:04,584 --> 02:16:06,325
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's,

660
02:16:09,401 --> 02:16:27,574
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm deeply concerned that we, and as you said, you know, the way this stuff rolls, it has to be the non-educators, whatever the technical terms are first that go, except they're not actually far from the classroom either.

661
02:16:28,315 --> 02:16:34,419
[SPEAKER_21]: So, and I know you know all this, I just hope that if we have to choose between paras or

662
02:16:35,792 --> 02:16:46,920
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to get into that exactly, but between different categories of people that we actually have an open conversation about it, because one para, you know, because para pay is a problem.

663
02:16:48,601 --> 02:16:57,687
[SPEAKER_21]: One para, one, you know, person making, you know, a PhD level person or something, making a good salary might be five paras.

664
02:16:59,448 --> 02:17:04,011
[SPEAKER_21]: I would have a hard time saying, keep the person over there.

665
02:17:04,291 --> 02:17:05,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Five paras is,

666
02:17:06,545 --> 02:17:08,606
[SPEAKER_21]: significant impact on a lot of kids.

667
02:17:08,646 --> 02:17:13,969
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to put it really bluntly, we're not going to bridge a $1.4 million gap by cutting Paris.

668
02:17:14,589 --> 02:17:15,310
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not going to happen.

669
02:17:15,330 --> 02:17:16,590
[SPEAKER_21]: That too.

670
02:17:17,291 --> 02:17:20,752
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I'm giving away any secrets there.

671
02:17:23,654 --> 02:17:24,454
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not going to happen.

672
02:17:28,997 --> 02:17:29,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions?

673
02:17:30,277 --> 02:17:30,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

674
02:17:35,667 --> 02:17:43,849
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple things, I'm shocked and disappointed that it's June 6th and we're just learning about this today.

675
02:17:43,869 --> 02:17:47,529
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first time I've seen this number in writing.

676
02:17:58,352 --> 02:17:59,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Murphy, that is,

677
02:18:01,650 --> 02:18:03,331
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee has done its work.

678
02:18:03,871 --> 02:18:05,012
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been proactive.

679
02:18:05,472 --> 02:18:16,678
[SPEAKER_09]: We have outlined and articulated very thoughtfully for the city about what we need to help our kids recover from this pandemic and to run a school district that we all deserve.

680
02:18:17,178 --> 02:18:19,219
[SPEAKER_09]: We have done our work here in the school committee.

681
02:18:19,719 --> 02:18:26,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I am extraordinarily disappointed that our city couldn't come to the table sooner than this to make this happen.

682
02:18:27,023 --> 02:18:33,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Two years ago, I voted no on a budget, which feels a little bit like deja vu at this moment.

683
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:40,075
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my comments, I said Medford needs to step in and say that our kids deserve better.

684
02:18:40,776 --> 02:18:45,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard from folks for weeks about the things they see as critical and the truth is it's all critical.

685
02:18:48,683 --> 02:19:00,952
[SPEAKER_09]: The how have more money is not the purview of this committee, but I am proud of the work that we've done and continue to do for the last three years to shine a light on our needs as a district in this in this joint memo which we issued a couple years ago.

686
02:19:01,913 --> 02:19:05,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Our needs are now well documented and clear and they have been for three years.

687
02:19:06,116 --> 02:19:11,978
[SPEAKER_09]: As a resident, I will support any and all actions by our mayor to prioritize schools and raise revenue.

688
02:19:12,418 --> 02:19:18,520
[SPEAKER_09]: She has my full support should she and the council determine that a proposition two and a half override is required.

689
02:19:19,001 --> 02:19:30,665
[SPEAKER_09]: It is my hope that every person who has voiced a concern or will voice a concern about this budget or any other budget cut that we have to make will stand with our mayor on this as well when she's ready to raise revenue.

690
02:19:31,645 --> 02:19:41,089
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't continue to say that this is just going to be a lean year and maybe next year is going to be a lean year like we have to prioritize the students of Medford.

691
02:19:41,629 --> 02:19:47,012
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the city is ready to do that and I would ask the mayor to step up to that plate and do better.

692
02:20:04,962 --> 02:20:05,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions?

693
02:20:18,805 --> 02:20:24,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Cushing, was that for the, was that, has that been up for a while or I haven't seen it?

694
02:20:24,687 --> 02:20:26,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, oh.

695
02:20:27,668 --> 02:20:27,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

696
02:20:28,908 --> 02:20:29,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Tringali.

697
02:20:31,418 --> 02:20:34,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, yes, this is Melanie Tringali, 1116 Forest Street.

698
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:38,422
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually have my hand up during the diversity, equity, and inclusion presentation.

699
02:20:40,323 --> 02:20:44,626
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know if I can ask a question now or not, but that's when I have my hand up.

700
02:20:47,347 --> 02:20:49,048
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about budget right now.

701
02:20:50,249 --> 02:20:51,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they didn't talk to me at the end of the thing.

702
02:20:51,930 --> 02:20:52,951
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have any comments on the budget.

703
02:20:52,971 --> 02:20:55,732
[SPEAKER_19]: I had questions on the diversity, equity, inclusion, and that's when my hand went up.

704
02:20:58,314 --> 02:20:59,494
[SPEAKER_11]: We've moved from that topic.

705
02:20:59,615 --> 02:21:00,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Our apologies.

706
02:21:01,328 --> 02:21:02,908
[SPEAKER_19]: So then how do I get my question answered?

707
02:21:04,169 --> 02:21:08,109
[SPEAKER_11]: If you wanna make a comment, you can, the committee's.

708
02:21:12,730 --> 02:21:29,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, well, my comment was in the presentation, she talked about the diversity of the student body and it was an HR presentation, but there was no diversity or reporting out on the actual people that worked in the administration of the school.

709
02:21:31,169 --> 02:21:33,691
[SPEAKER_19]: So it would be helpful to have that as a comparison.

710
02:21:34,292 --> 02:21:44,100
[SPEAKER_19]: When you're talking about diversity in HR, and what, what that makeup is of the host of the whole administration of the school, school, school body and administration.

711
02:21:45,341 --> 02:21:47,703
[SPEAKER_19]: Be helpful as a comparison.

712
02:21:47,723 --> 02:21:53,888
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a slide that showed the diversity of the staff for the entire mid for public schools district.

713
02:21:54,468 --> 02:21:59,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I didn't see that so I apologize I didn't, I don't remember seeing that so if it was there I didn't see it I apologize.

714
02:22:01,041 --> 02:22:03,363
[SPEAKER_11]: We can make sure the slides are up on the website.

715
02:22:03,383 --> 02:22:08,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure the slides are up on the website so you can take a look.

716
02:22:08,767 --> 02:22:09,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

717
02:22:11,689 --> 02:22:12,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything else on the budget?

718
02:22:13,888 --> 02:22:15,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Just just for my end.

719
02:22:15,409 --> 02:22:24,773
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the first time we've ever went through a pandemic ever had a revenue dump of $48 million into city coffers.

720
02:22:25,393 --> 02:22:31,116
[SPEAKER_11]: The first time we're dealing with revenue replacement so and to explain like I did to the committee a bit earlier.

721
02:22:31,876 --> 02:22:37,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year we were very lucky we were a revenue replacement figure came out to about $12 million.

722
02:22:37,479 --> 02:22:42,461
[SPEAKER_11]: It gave us the ability to do we did with the school budget which is

723
02:22:43,491 --> 02:22:50,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, my priority, it's how we were able to get through the tough times of the economy.

724
02:22:50,294 --> 02:23:02,900
[SPEAKER_11]: This year, our revenue replacement number would be $7.669 million, which would be much better than what we are experiencing, running numbers and continuing to do the work.

725
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:08,402
[SPEAKER_11]: But for a large donation that came in for the library of $3.4 million, which cannot be

726
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:15,022
[SPEAKER_11]: which is being calculated as revenue and there's no way around it.

727
02:23:15,142 --> 02:23:23,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Our revenue replacement number is down to $4 million, giving us a budget gap of 8 million, which we learned of very recently.

728
02:23:24,087 --> 02:23:33,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been spending my days cutting and level funding and or cutting some of the most of the, or all of the city departments.

729
02:23:33,653 --> 02:23:38,476
[SPEAKER_11]: It hasn't been a fun week, but I committed to giving the schools as much as we can.

730
02:23:38,536 --> 02:23:39,397
[SPEAKER_11]: We just are,

731
02:23:40,086 --> 02:23:46,531
[SPEAKER_11]: appropriations and are outweighing our revenue that we take in year by year.

732
02:23:46,591 --> 02:24:01,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to plan for the next year where we maybe can use anywhere from zero to 4 million in revenue replacement, and we're in the same position having to cut, but there is, that's hard decisions to make and a hard thing to do.

733
02:24:02,162 --> 02:24:06,165
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to let you know that our CFO, we do have a CFO came on,

734
02:24:06,741 --> 02:24:18,083
[SPEAKER_11]: a month and a half ago and has been working tirelessly to get us this number, along with consultants that we've had for months and months, but we we just learned of this recently, so I'm just wanted to point that out.

735
02:24:18,513 --> 02:24:38,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mary, I just add on from the school side that, you know, we have a continuing dialogue with with the city administration and, as the mayor said, it's been a difficult three or four days in trying to position us to get to a place in which we will be able to implement a

736
02:24:38,684 --> 02:24:42,245
[SPEAKER_16]: a budget that's consistent with the priorities that we've discussed here and to advance the goals.

737
02:24:43,605 --> 02:25:00,070
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's frankly it's not the school administration's place to be talking to discuss like overall capacity but what I, I can say is you've heard me say several times before, we will implement the budget that we have to the best of our ability to advance the interests of students and I think that

738
02:25:01,894 --> 02:25:12,102
[SPEAKER_16]: while this is a more significant shortfall than any of us anticipated, and it puts us in a difficult position, we have sort of a twofold responsibility.

739
02:25:12,382 --> 02:25:19,507
[SPEAKER_16]: One, make sure that we don't lose sight of the impact that this budget is having in classrooms and in learning environments.

740
02:25:20,768 --> 02:25:29,695
[SPEAKER_16]: And two, we have a responsibility to understand to the point the mayor is making with regard to the ARPA money and the revenue replacement component of that,

741
02:25:30,216 --> 02:25:37,694
[SPEAKER_16]: that investing one time resources in reoccurring expenses creates

742
02:25:39,343 --> 02:25:40,984
[SPEAKER_16]: greater pain down the road.

743
02:25:41,484 --> 02:25:44,745
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's not to say we don't make that sacrifice.

744
02:25:44,825 --> 02:25:48,607
[SPEAKER_16]: As you know, category B is made up of things that we would prefer to be in the operating budget.

745
02:25:49,087 --> 02:25:56,270
[SPEAKER_16]: But we understand that the direct impact on kids requires it to happen, you know, by essentially by any means necessary.

746
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:59,451
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's why we'll use the ESSER funding for it.

747
02:25:59,831 --> 02:26:04,833
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is what will guide the reconciliation recommendations that you receive.

748
02:26:04,893 --> 02:26:08,295
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is not a good situation.

749
02:26:09,778 --> 02:26:13,061
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not going to be a good next few weeks.

750
02:26:14,582 --> 02:26:28,854
[SPEAKER_16]: And my hope would be that both administrations and this school committee and all other stakeholders will approach the set of challenges that we now have before us in as thoughtful and collaborative way as possible.

751
02:26:28,894 --> 02:26:36,420
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that is the best, that will increase the chances of thoughtful decision-making occurring.

752
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:37,461
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you again.

753
02:26:39,244 --> 02:26:39,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor.

754
02:26:40,125 --> 02:26:41,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau.

755
02:26:42,587 --> 02:26:52,895
[SPEAKER_21]: I just can't let pass the absurdness that a billionaire giving us three and a half million dollars for a library means we have to cut school funding.

756
02:26:53,596 --> 02:26:56,138
[SPEAKER_21]: It's absolutely beyond comprehension.

757
02:27:07,045 --> 02:27:08,065
[SPEAKER_21]: The building is built.

758
02:27:08,666 --> 02:27:12,967
[SPEAKER_21]: I doubt Mr Bloomberg will come and physically remove it send the check back.

759
02:27:14,328 --> 02:27:15,248
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not even kidding.

760
02:27:15,449 --> 02:27:26,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it legally possible to send the check back because somebody in the finance department that didn't know this until a week ago, didn't do their job, I just want to say, I think this is a city finance questions.

761
02:27:26,273 --> 02:27:26,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it is.

762
02:27:26,653 --> 02:27:27,173
[SPEAKER_16]: You can go sit down.

763
02:27:31,499 --> 02:27:36,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly, I mean, and I get it, we needed three and a half million because Medford refuses to pay for anything of ourselves.

764
02:27:36,980 --> 02:27:47,103
[SPEAKER_21]: So we had to look for other people to pay for it and now we're being screwed, okay, by a donation of three and a half million dollars.

765
02:27:47,283 --> 02:27:49,784
[SPEAKER_21]: It is beyond comprehension.

766
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:58,926
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's also beyond comprehension that it was a failure to know that this would happen before we even requested the funds from him.

767
02:28:01,606 --> 02:28:16,590
[SPEAKER_21]: I just cannot even believe that we're just going to roll with it that it's we took three and a half million for the library now we have to cut, whether it's 2.2 or 2.8 or 1.4, it doesn't matter what the number is we have to cut from the school, and the kids.

768
02:28:17,310 --> 02:28:28,813
[SPEAKER_21]: After two years of a pandemic where the second and third graders who are now fourth and fifth graders, a huge number of them really can't do math because I've sat with parents whose kids sat

769
02:28:29,298 --> 02:28:35,462
[SPEAKER_21]: The teachers did their best, but the kid was one of 20 tiles being taught math.

770
02:28:35,782 --> 02:28:40,505
[SPEAKER_21]: And every time their name came up, they thought they were being yelled at and they were just being talked to.

771
02:28:41,646 --> 02:28:45,208
[SPEAKER_21]: These kids, a lot of these kids didn't actually learn any math for two years.

772
02:28:45,328 --> 02:28:46,188
[SPEAKER_21]: And when are we gonna do it?

773
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:47,910
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gonna cut the math interventionists.

774
02:28:48,370 --> 02:28:49,170
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not gonna do that.

775
02:28:49,551 --> 02:28:56,175
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gonna not worry about whether they're fed so they can come to school fully capable of engaging in the education they are getting.

776
02:28:56,795 --> 02:29:08,201
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just beyond comprehension that we would even hear that a $3.5 million donation means we have to cut school funding, send it back.

777
02:29:09,062 --> 02:29:11,984
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to see somebody come and try to physically remove the library.

778
02:29:13,144 --> 02:29:15,886
[SPEAKER_21]: He can have his name on the building, I don't care.

779
02:29:17,267 --> 02:29:20,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it legally not possible to send it back and why has that been investigated?

780
02:29:21,869 --> 02:29:23,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor, that's a question for you.

781
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:25,785
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we can't send it back.

782
02:29:26,705 --> 02:29:27,826
[SPEAKER_21]: Who said we can't send it back.

783
02:29:28,226 --> 02:29:46,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't we defer the payment till July is use free cash up to that to that number is the plan, the 7.669, we're going to use free cash but then we're going to plan for next year when we have to continue to decrease the revenue replacement number, so that we are not using one time funds, we only have

784
02:29:46,977 --> 02:29:50,498
[SPEAKER_11]: three more years to not have to use one-time funds.

785
02:29:50,678 --> 02:29:57,681
[SPEAKER_21]: But if we delayed it till July 1st, and you could use the free cash and the revenue replacement, you wouldn't be cutting this budget.

786
02:29:58,101 --> 02:30:03,804
[SPEAKER_21]: And between July 1st and the next fiscal year, you could do an override, and then we wouldn't be in the hole.

787
02:30:04,604 --> 02:30:06,085
[SPEAKER_21]: But you won't do an override.

788
02:30:06,105 --> 02:30:14,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

789
02:30:15,084 --> 02:30:18,486
[SPEAKER_11]: We have presentations of the public, not to begin before 7 p.m.

790
02:30:19,346 --> 02:30:19,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

791
02:30:19,687 --> 02:30:22,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Charlene Douglas, MTA president.

792
02:30:38,076 --> 02:30:39,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, thank you.

793
02:30:41,478 --> 02:30:43,639
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't even know where to begin.

794
02:30:45,237 --> 02:30:58,841
[SPEAKER_02]: The school committee members, the mayor, honorable mayor, it was with a very heavy heart that I find myself before you again today.

795
02:31:00,301 --> 02:31:01,862
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I sat there.

796
02:31:03,050 --> 02:31:10,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember 2020, it was 111 teachers and no one else that was let go.

797
02:31:10,734 --> 02:31:18,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember those days well, and they were let go on July 15th, the very last day.

798
02:31:18,538 --> 02:31:20,339
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost diverse staff.

799
02:31:20,639 --> 02:31:22,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost so much in the city.

800
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:25,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that doesn't happen again.

801
02:31:26,650 --> 02:31:47,503
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I find it very interesting and almost unnerving that tonight at the 11th hour, we learn of this $8 million deficit when all but two labor unions are in the midst of long and tedious contract negotiations.

802
02:31:48,243 --> 02:31:49,424
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when we learn of it?

803
02:31:51,185 --> 02:31:52,046
[SPEAKER_02]: How sad.

804
02:31:53,885 --> 02:32:13,412
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a month ago, we rallied to call your attention to the struggles in our negotiations for a fair and equitable contract, a contract that would show that the people of Medford love their children and respect the people entrusted to teach them.

805
02:32:14,773 --> 02:32:20,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Members of the community stood before you and asked you, where have you been?

806
02:32:21,741 --> 02:32:25,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And why don't you show that you care about teachers?

807
02:32:26,863 --> 02:32:36,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers shared the struggles they endured, they have endured and how the complete lack of support they received, they have received.

808
02:32:39,509 --> 02:32:40,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm just so.

809
02:32:42,349 --> 02:32:50,612
[SPEAKER_02]: and how the complete lack of sport, they struggled, they have endured and how the complete lack of sport they received led them to leave teaching.

810
02:32:51,392 --> 02:33:02,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We had already this year, five teachers in the last month resigned from this profession and met with five teachers within the last month.

811
02:33:03,956 --> 02:33:05,357
[SPEAKER_22]: Was it six?

812
02:33:07,324 --> 02:33:11,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't know, but I know that's within the last couple of months.

813
02:33:11,748 --> 02:33:20,074
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, in my 30, whatever years it is, within this system, I don't remember receiving teacher resignation letters.

814
02:33:20,114 --> 02:33:22,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying we didn't, but we have.

815
02:33:26,079 --> 02:33:32,504
[SPEAKER_02]: We, the teachers, the parents, and the community asked, even begged for your help, but to no avail.

816
02:33:34,005 --> 02:33:35,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not about money.

817
02:33:36,343 --> 02:33:40,867
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about basic fulfillment of your duties as the elected officials.

818
02:33:42,368 --> 02:33:59,021
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the Method Teachers Associating Contract, you, the school committee, the mayor, are our negotiating partners, not the superintendent, not the finance director, not the superintendent's intern.

819
02:34:00,262 --> 02:34:02,784
[SPEAKER_02]: We have worked without a contract for a year.

820
02:34:03,635 --> 02:34:08,443
[SPEAKER_02]: and not once has a member of the school committee showed up to negotiations.

821
02:34:09,905 --> 02:34:13,530
[SPEAKER_02]: For the last two months, we've staged walk-ins.

822
02:34:14,778 --> 02:34:26,251
[SPEAKER_02]: at the school to call your attention to the lack of progress at the negotiations table and not a single member of the school committee or the mayor has shown up.

823
02:34:27,153 --> 02:34:34,801
[SPEAKER_02]: We came here by the hundreds last month to get your attention and still not a single member of the school committee showed up.

824
02:34:35,951 --> 02:34:44,263
[SPEAKER_02]: All of you as elected officials ran on the platform that you support union labor and public education.

825
02:34:44,724 --> 02:34:48,349
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask, where is that support?

826
02:35:04,741 --> 02:35:14,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, you've delegated the negotiations, as is common, I will say, to your representative, the superintendent of school.

827
02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:21,454
[SPEAKER_02]: She has yet to turn on her camera in our Zoom negotiations, let alone speak.

828
02:35:22,575 --> 02:35:29,421
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, our only real negotiations have been with the assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

829
02:35:30,683 --> 02:35:37,826
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the major asks from the school committee, which you may not know, was for a revised schedule for the high school and the vocational school.

830
02:35:38,766 --> 02:35:51,751
[SPEAKER_02]: This was so important that an agreed to joint task team was formed to work out the details, agreed to both by the teachers and administration.

831
02:35:53,083 --> 02:36:06,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet the only representative on the district's negotiating team on that task force was the superintendent's intern who completed her internship in May.

832
02:36:08,089 --> 02:36:22,454
[SPEAKER_02]: While it may not be allowed for you not to be involved in negotiation, we are approaching the end of the school year and I needed to bring this negotiations to a fair conclusion

833
02:36:24,028 --> 02:36:30,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Last month, a member of this body accused the teachers of violating the rules of these negotiations.

834
02:36:31,154 --> 02:36:36,799
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, teachers were called untrustworthy in violation of the decorum rules of this chamber.

835
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:51,532
[SPEAKER_02]: What that member would have known had they had shown up at any part of the negotiation process is that the agreed upon ground rules require us to give 24 hour notice before going public, which we clearly did.

836
02:36:52,503 --> 02:36:55,786
[SPEAKER_02]: as we were published on the school committee agenda.

837
02:36:56,326 --> 02:36:57,567
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's untrustworthy?

838
02:36:58,428 --> 02:37:12,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Untrustworthy is throwing out accusations against your negotiation partners and calling them names when you haven't even attended any part of the negotiations process.

839
02:37:14,061 --> 02:37:19,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Untrustworthy is the mayor mischaracterizing the negotiating timeline

840
02:37:20,373 --> 02:37:35,744
[SPEAKER_02]: to make it seem like the MTA was unavailable to meet until November of 2021, when the facts clearly demonstrate that the MTA formally requested to negotiate in October.

841
02:37:36,805 --> 02:37:45,611
[SPEAKER_02]: After completing the COVID MOA, the response from administration was, okay, untrustworthy.

842
02:37:47,921 --> 02:38:08,156
[SPEAKER_02]: is getting the endorsement of Our Revolution, an organization that has teachers, that organized for workers, teachers, and organized laborers, and then trying to have teachers removed for publicly meeting because they are exercising their First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.

843
02:38:08,816 --> 02:38:15,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Untrustworthy is betraying the trust of people who elected you by not showing up.

844
02:38:16,502 --> 02:38:21,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Last month, we felt disrespected and underappreciated.

845
02:38:21,547 --> 02:38:25,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we feel angry and betrayed.

846
02:38:25,710 --> 02:38:37,180
[SPEAKER_02]: We are losing many of our veteran colleagues to career changes because one of the great rewards of teaching was feeling of doing something special for the community, for the future, and for the children.

847
02:38:37,721 --> 02:38:39,763
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't feel special anymore.

848
02:38:40,848 --> 02:38:45,272
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel trivialized and you made us feel trivialized.

849
02:38:45,592 --> 02:38:48,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Even tonight, other people could speak.

850
02:38:48,855 --> 02:38:52,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You never recognized any of us until we were on the agenda.

851
02:38:53,999 --> 02:38:56,461
[SPEAKER_02]: You always put us last.

852
02:39:05,649 --> 02:39:06,390
[SPEAKER_02]: In my years,

853
02:39:08,877 --> 02:39:22,425
[SPEAKER_02]: In my years as president of this union and as a teacher in this city of Method, for 30 plus years, when we came to this podium to speak, the rules were suspended and you let us speak.

854
02:39:22,886 --> 02:39:24,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you make us wait.

855
02:39:25,387 --> 02:39:28,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the respect you want to afford your teachers?

856
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:30,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you see us?

857
02:39:31,536 --> 02:39:33,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We are second class citizens.

858
02:39:34,719 --> 02:39:35,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

859
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:39,704
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is, then I feel really sorry for the city of Medford.

860
02:39:41,286 --> 02:39:43,048
[SPEAKER_02]: We have only one question.

861
02:39:44,069 --> 02:39:45,650
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do to fix it?

862
02:39:46,651 --> 02:39:49,474
[SPEAKER_02]: There are only three more weeks until the school year ends.

863
02:39:50,215 --> 02:39:52,237
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you going to show up?

864
02:39:53,965 --> 02:40:04,892
[SPEAKER_02]: My teachers, our teachers, the Mass Methodist Teachers Association is willing to do whatever is necessary to get a fair and equitable contract.

865
02:40:05,472 --> 02:40:08,174
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask for your support, we ask for your help.

866
02:40:09,415 --> 02:40:16,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I have shared with all of you where we believe there is financial flexibility to provide a fair and equitable contract.

867
02:40:16,926 --> 02:40:19,211
[SPEAKER_02]: contract on cost of living increase.

868
02:40:19,912 --> 02:40:24,121
[SPEAKER_02]: We the MTA are going to share and go through that PowerPoint with you.

869
02:40:26,769 --> 02:40:31,151
[SPEAKER_02]: We based this whole thing on the 2021-22 budget.

870
02:40:31,431 --> 02:40:35,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't even look at the, because we didn't haven't seen the budget book yet for the 2022.

871
02:40:36,313 --> 02:40:37,433
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we based this on.

872
02:40:37,833 --> 02:40:46,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to introduce two of my, well, I'll start it, but two of my negotiating team members, I'd like to let them speak about this.

873
02:40:47,597 --> 02:40:49,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Anthony Guillen and Ms.

874
02:40:49,918 --> 02:40:50,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Regano.

875
02:40:59,226 --> 02:40:59,747
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope so.

876
02:40:59,967 --> 02:41:00,387
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

877
02:41:01,908 --> 02:41:02,549
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Charlene.

878
02:41:05,591 --> 02:41:06,432
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Anthony Gann.

879
02:41:07,192 --> 02:41:09,054
[SPEAKER_20]: I work at 489 Winthrop Street, Medford High School.

880
02:41:11,836 --> 02:41:12,517
[SPEAKER_20]: In case you didn't know.

881
02:41:14,618 --> 02:41:19,942
[SPEAKER_20]: We'd like to start with the premise of this by saying we care deeply about the long-term financial health of these schools.

882
02:41:20,083 --> 02:41:22,344
[SPEAKER_20]: It does us no good to have short-term goals.

883
02:41:23,025 --> 02:41:24,246
[SPEAKER_20]: We're here for the long-term.

884
02:41:24,406 --> 02:41:26,908
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm here for the majority of the rest of my life, hopefully.

885
02:41:28,891 --> 02:41:29,771
[SPEAKER_20]: and as well as Mr. Garner.

886
02:41:31,412 --> 02:41:41,255
[SPEAKER_20]: We have carefully analyzed the finances and we have come to the conclusion that there is sufficient room to get a fair cost of living increase.

887
02:41:44,856 --> 02:41:45,897
[SPEAKER_20]: If we could go to the next slide.

888
02:41:49,298 --> 02:41:55,680
[SPEAKER_20]: So careful analysis of the MedFed's financial 2022 budget book reveals capacity

889
02:41:56,752 --> 02:42:02,133
[SPEAKER_20]: for a $962 cost-of-living increase for the MTA.

890
02:42:02,593 --> 02:42:06,514
[SPEAKER_20]: This equals about to 2.25% cost-of-living increase.

891
02:42:07,955 --> 02:42:15,356
[SPEAKER_20]: This is cost-of-living, this is longevity, mentoring, advanced degrees, new steps, new positions.

892
02:42:16,497 --> 02:42:16,737
[SPEAKER_20]: Go on.

893
02:42:18,597 --> 02:42:23,158
[SPEAKER_20]: So, our current ask, where we stand for financial year 2022 is a 4% cost-of-living increase.

894
02:42:26,977 --> 02:42:30,158
[SPEAKER_20]: We analyze that currently you have the ability to do 2.25%.

895
02:42:30,218 --> 02:42:31,179
[SPEAKER_20]: That is a $727,679 difference.

896
02:42:31,199 --> 02:42:31,859
[SPEAKER_20]: You can go on.

897
02:42:31,879 --> 02:42:34,100
[SPEAKER_20]: So, where are we gonna make up the difference?

898
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:37,061
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to call your attention to the first square.

899
02:42:37,081 --> 02:42:38,182
[SPEAKER_20]: This should be taken as an umbrella.

900
02:42:57,113 --> 02:42:58,934
[SPEAKER_20]: cost of school funding.

901
02:43:00,675 --> 02:43:10,741
[SPEAKER_20]: The second square is a letter from the Department of Education, which says that ESSER funding may be used for teacher attention and cost of living increase.

902
02:43:13,563 --> 02:43:18,546
[SPEAKER_20]: The Department of Education has given three rounds of ESSER funding representing $8.3 million.

903
02:43:21,428 --> 02:43:27,691
[SPEAKER_20]: The funds needed to reach our ask of 4% in 2022 is again, let's see if I can do it right this time.

904
02:43:27,711 --> 02:43:28,371
[SPEAKER_20]: $727 and six, no.

905
02:43:28,391 --> 02:43:30,332
[SPEAKER_20]: You get the English teacher to do the numbers.

906
02:43:30,352 --> 02:43:30,332
$727,679.

907
02:43:31,372 --> 02:43:32,333
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

908
02:43:32,653 --> 02:43:34,134
[SPEAKER_20]: We have here projected sustainability.

909
02:43:49,192 --> 02:43:53,534
[SPEAKER_20]: The black in that graph represents the ESSER fundings, which we do understand is limited.

910
02:43:55,375 --> 02:43:58,257
[SPEAKER_20]: What is factored in after that is the Chapter 70 money.

911
02:43:59,818 --> 02:44:02,719
[SPEAKER_20]: That Chapter 70 money will sustain our COLA increases.

912
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:09,103
[SPEAKER_20]: That Chapter 70 money has been passed through the Student Opportunities Act and has been passed through other funding.

913
02:44:10,524 --> 02:44:10,884
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

914
02:44:12,445 --> 02:44:13,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I just add to that?

915
02:44:13,765 --> 02:44:14,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

916
02:44:14,366 --> 02:44:15,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I just add to that?

917
02:44:15,486 --> 02:44:18,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at what you see in front of you is that

918
02:44:19,895 --> 02:44:40,514
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can't because I'm blind, but if you look at it, you see that the student, Chapter 70 money, which was something that this committee supported, and we wanted to have that increase, that was the Student Opportunity Act that we worked very, very hard for, that you supported, you see that it increases every year significantly.

919
02:44:40,834 --> 02:44:42,616
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time we get to the year, I think it's 2020,

920
02:44:43,757 --> 02:44:58,147
[SPEAKER_02]: five, or 2026, that whatever ESSER funds we need to use will then, 2025, whatever ESSER funds we need to use will clearly be available in the Chapter 70 funding.

921
02:45:00,849 --> 02:45:01,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

922
02:45:01,810 --> 02:45:02,830
[SPEAKER_20]: On to the next slide.

923
02:45:05,672 --> 02:45:08,935
[SPEAKER_20]: The city of Medford invests, by our estimations, 37.4% of the city budget

924
02:45:11,547 --> 02:45:13,868
[SPEAKER_20]: from the 2020 due data that was available.

925
02:45:14,088 --> 02:45:16,490
[SPEAKER_20]: This was the most recent data that was available to us.

926
02:45:17,770 --> 02:45:22,413
[SPEAKER_20]: This is beaten by Belmont, Malden, Arlington, Taunton, and Everett.

927
02:45:23,173 --> 02:45:28,136
[SPEAKER_20]: The city of Medford has room and should continue to grow its investment in its public schools.

928
02:45:29,457 --> 02:45:29,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

929
02:45:32,458 --> 02:45:35,660
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to now share a quote from Mayor Kern.

930
02:45:38,361 --> 02:45:40,362
[SPEAKER_20]: This is taken from the patch in June of 2021.

931
02:45:42,708 --> 02:45:59,484
[SPEAKER_20]: You stated, with a more sustainable financial outlook, I am proud to say that thanks to the hard work of the superintendent of schools, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, the entire school administration team, and with the hard work and unanimous support of the Medford School Committee, we are proposing a significant increase to the support of our schools of the upcoming year.

932
02:45:59,504 --> 02:46:00,124
[SPEAKER_20]: That was June, 2021.

933
02:46:00,165 --> 02:46:00,725
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, ahead.

934
02:46:13,129 --> 02:46:18,591
[SPEAKER_20]: In conclusion, the Medford Teachers Association is sharing this information based on the facts in front of us.

935
02:46:18,671 --> 02:46:23,853
[SPEAKER_20]: These facts includes by law, Medford's Chapter 70 money funding will increase dramatically.

936
02:46:24,453 --> 02:46:29,895
[SPEAKER_20]: The federal government encourages districts to use ESSER funding to increase permanent compensation and teacher retention.

937
02:46:30,575 --> 02:46:33,976
[SPEAKER_20]: And the city has the capacity and will to increase spending in our schools.

938
02:46:34,716 --> 02:46:37,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Increased compensation improves student outcomes.

939
02:46:38,268 --> 02:46:41,794
[SPEAKER_20]: We encourage the school committee to discuss this further with the NCAA's bargaining team.

940
02:46:42,094 --> 02:46:45,159
[SPEAKER_20]: We look forward to seeing some of you tomorrow when we go into bargaining.

941
02:47:07,503 --> 02:47:08,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any questions?

942
02:47:08,463 --> 02:47:10,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I walked away and I wanna do that this time.

943
02:47:10,624 --> 02:47:12,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any questions?

944
02:47:12,945 --> 02:47:14,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Any concerns about our presentation?

945
02:47:15,185 --> 02:47:18,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that you think that is misrepresented there?

946
02:47:19,686 --> 02:47:19,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor?

947
02:47:21,527 --> 02:47:22,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

948
02:47:22,867 --> 02:47:29,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a few questions and I wanted to make sure that we're on the same page about some of the numbers.

949
02:47:29,809 --> 02:47:32,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So just let me get, let me, can I just pull it up on my computer?

950
02:47:32,981 --> 02:47:35,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Please give me a second, because I can't see that.

951
02:47:35,942 --> 02:47:38,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with the glasses.

952
02:47:38,784 --> 02:47:41,025
[SPEAKER_02]: These 65-year-old eyes, not what they used to be.

953
02:47:43,346 --> 02:47:43,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

954
02:47:44,966 --> 02:47:53,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I wanna start by saying, I agree with you that Medford has room to prioritize education.

955
02:47:54,951 --> 02:47:56,892
[SPEAKER_09]: This committee can't do that.

956
02:47:57,938 --> 02:48:03,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So all we can do is ask and I feel like we're doing that every year.

957
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:05,741
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're with you, I'm with you.

958
02:48:06,581 --> 02:48:11,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the city needs to do more for education and we're ready to spend it as soon as that materializes.

959
02:48:13,344 --> 02:48:15,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Having said that, a couple of questions.

960
02:48:15,804 --> 02:48:18,145
[SPEAKER_09]: 906962 equals roughly a 2.25% cost of living increase

961
02:48:23,285 --> 02:48:25,325
[SPEAKER_09]: from the FY22 budget book.

962
02:48:26,566 --> 02:48:36,268
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is, does that leave funds available for all the other staff who have unnegotiated contracts?

963
02:48:37,668 --> 02:48:44,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was, yes, because what it said, if you read it, it says analysis for cost of living budgeted for other units.

964
02:48:45,209 --> 02:48:52,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put all the other units in there, longevity, mentoring, advanced degrees, new positions, step lane increases.

965
02:48:53,177 --> 02:49:01,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we put all of that in there, great and we included that, and that comes out to 2.25% comes out to 2.25% calculator.

966
02:49:01,464 --> 02:49:01,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

967
02:49:03,105 --> 02:49:03,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Second question.

968
02:49:05,027 --> 02:49:06,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw the press release from

969
02:49:09,352 --> 02:49:11,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Secretary of Education Cardona, right?

970
02:49:12,773 --> 02:49:15,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a press release and it talks at a high level.

971
02:49:15,595 --> 02:49:30,081
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding of the regulations that have been promulgated from DESE provide a lot of qualifiers about how ESSER money can be used and explicitly using it sort of to straight pay for COLA is like not in the list.

972
02:49:30,181 --> 02:49:34,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's not to say ESSER can't be used in various ways to compensate

973
02:49:35,202 --> 02:49:37,687
[SPEAKER_09]: teachers for things related to the pandemic.

974
02:49:38,028 --> 02:49:40,173
[SPEAKER_09]: But my understanding of the DESE regulations is that

975
02:49:40,922 --> 02:49:44,983
[SPEAKER_09]: they go well deeper than the press release from Secretary Cardona.

976
02:49:45,023 --> 02:49:47,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that your understanding of the DESI regs as well?

977
02:49:48,484 --> 02:49:55,565
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it isn't, because we did some research and I did share the actual, and I can share it with you, the actual press release.

978
02:49:56,466 --> 02:50:10,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe it was a statement, it was a 10-page statement, or I think it was, I don't remember the exact amount of pages, but is that he stated that, and it was clear that when this money was given to the cities and towns, that that could be used because

979
02:50:10,709 --> 02:50:19,877
[SPEAKER_02]: of the concern of the vast majority of teachers leaving this profession and those not going into the profession, young teachers, senior teachers.

980
02:50:20,137 --> 02:50:24,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We have teachers leaving this year going at 72% of their retirement.

981
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:26,062
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not waiting to get to that 80%.

982
02:50:26,722 --> 02:50:28,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I had three teachers come up and say that to me.

983
02:50:28,984 --> 02:50:30,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do this anymore, Shalini.

984
02:50:31,166 --> 02:50:32,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't do it.

985
02:50:33,868 --> 02:50:34,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And that saddens me.

986
02:50:35,369 --> 02:50:36,530
[SPEAKER_02]: That really saddens me.

987
02:50:37,130 --> 02:50:40,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I stayed beyond that time.

988
02:50:40,956 --> 02:50:44,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of us have, but not now they're counting the days.

989
02:50:46,340 --> 02:50:47,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is that?

990
02:50:49,583 --> 02:50:55,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, couple other questions I just want to make sure again I'm understanding the numbers so 2.25% is what the 2022 budget can bear.

991
02:50:55,147 --> 02:50:55,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

992
02:50:55,387 --> 02:50:55,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

993
02:51:01,178 --> 02:51:08,719
[SPEAKER_09]: You all just sat, I know you just sat through a really ugly presentation about our budget for next year where there's a $1.4 million shortfall.

994
02:51:08,999 --> 02:51:09,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

995
02:51:09,860 --> 02:51:12,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So that picture gets worse next year.

996
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:14,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like it's going to get worse the year after that as well.

997
02:51:14,941 --> 02:51:21,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I don't understand is last year's budget was 61 point something, right?

998
02:51:21,702 --> 02:51:21,422
67.

999
02:51:22,362 --> 02:51:22,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it 67,000?

1000
02:51:23,682 --> 02:51:23,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1001
02:51:24,202 --> 02:51:26,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are going up two million to 69.

1002
02:51:26,763 --> 02:51:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that projected?

1003
02:51:28,363 --> 02:51:28,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1004
02:51:28,888 --> 02:51:38,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are increasing to 69, but I, so I don't, I haven't, for me to intelligently look at that, I need to have all that information.

1005
02:51:39,371 --> 02:51:42,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot respond to something that I don't have.

1006
02:51:43,072 --> 02:51:45,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all the slide decks and all of that.

1007
02:51:45,533 --> 02:51:47,074
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have budget books yet.

1008
02:51:47,194 --> 02:51:48,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're not ready, right?

1009
02:51:48,494 --> 02:51:49,454
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not understanding.

1010
02:51:49,715 --> 02:51:53,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like we have a lot of cutting to do before the budget books, unfortunately.

1011
02:51:53,576 --> 02:51:57,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I, if you know what, cutting,

1012
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:03,621
[SPEAKER_02]: In education, why don't you just put, why don't you just, why don't you just close the schools?

1013
02:52:05,162 --> 02:52:09,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just put out a big playpen out there and let us all just play all day?

1014
02:52:10,823 --> 02:52:16,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you really seriously, I could go on and on about some of the hardships these teachers have been through.

1015
02:52:16,865 --> 02:52:25,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you about the professional development day where we all sat 627 people and listened to a presentation on equity and diversity.

1016
02:52:26,806 --> 02:52:27,687
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our professional.

1017
02:52:27,907 --> 02:52:33,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go on and on and tell you how slighted we feel as teachers, but I'm not going to.

1018
02:52:33,112 --> 02:52:35,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna tell you that they're angry and I don't know.

1019
02:52:35,935 --> 02:52:39,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you cut teachers, I have no idea.

1020
02:52:39,398 --> 02:52:42,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what to, I don't even have a comeback to that.

1021
02:52:43,181 --> 02:52:47,986
[SPEAKER_02]: You talked about our paraprofessionals, the lowest paid people, $17,000 a year, some of them make.

1022
02:52:51,012 --> 02:52:54,055
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even have paraprofessionals, how many teachers here.

1023
02:52:54,495 --> 02:53:04,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask this question, how many of my teachers here this year, have students that did not have a individual professional Charlie, Miss Douglas if you could just talk into the microphone.

1024
02:53:08,787 --> 02:53:16,815
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have a paraprofessional for either one-on-one, in their classroom, were being pulled to cover substitutes.

1025
02:53:17,075 --> 02:53:21,219
[SPEAKER_02]: How many teachers here experience that on a regular basis?

1026
02:53:24,822 --> 02:53:26,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Stand up.

1027
02:53:30,207 --> 02:53:33,711
[SPEAKER_02]: If that doesn't save volumes, I don't know what does.

1028
02:53:37,284 --> 02:53:44,068
[SPEAKER_02]: My teachers, I know there were students whose IEPs, I don't even wanna discuss, but I don't know.

1029
02:53:44,809 --> 02:53:49,932
[SPEAKER_02]: No one-on-one aids, not being pulled, not in compliance.

1030
02:53:50,713 --> 02:53:52,194
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing here as a district?

1031
02:53:52,694 --> 02:53:55,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we really care about students?

1032
02:53:56,561 --> 02:53:57,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we really?

1033
02:53:57,822 --> 02:53:59,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we really care about students tonight?

1034
02:54:00,304 --> 02:54:02,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And this may not set well, but really?

1035
02:54:02,686 --> 02:54:09,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we recognize our tough students in the newsletter that went home this week?

1036
02:54:09,973 --> 02:54:10,173
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1037
02:54:11,054 --> 02:54:14,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we finally say something after everybody was recognized?

1038
02:54:15,338 --> 02:54:15,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1039
02:54:16,038 --> 02:54:16,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1040
02:54:17,219 --> 02:54:18,220
[SPEAKER_02]: You answer that question.

1041
02:54:18,661 --> 02:54:20,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you make that decision.

1042
02:54:21,796 --> 02:54:25,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we feel unappreciated and unrespected.

1043
02:54:25,497 --> 02:54:40,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And teachers tonight came up to me from the Curtis Tufts, and they were hurt that their students who are high needs, high needs, really, you wanna talk high needs, what are they?

1044
02:54:42,421 --> 02:54:49,123
[SPEAKER_02]: If they are not our most neediest of students, and those teachers work tirelessly with those students.

1045
02:54:50,711 --> 02:54:55,993
[SPEAKER_02]: and they graduated, what an accomplishment for those students.

1046
02:54:56,453 --> 02:55:08,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I service those students.

1047
02:55:08,936 --> 02:55:13,998
[SPEAKER_09]: So just, can I ask one more question and then I will cede the floor to somebody else.

1048
02:55:14,938 --> 02:55:19,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that as part of the discussion, we are not,

1049
02:55:21,109 --> 02:55:24,511
[SPEAKER_09]: in the same place about wage colas, which is why you're here, right?

1050
02:55:27,432 --> 02:55:34,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to, I do want to say as much as I love hanging out with you all on Monday nights, I do care deeply about the children of this district.

1051
02:55:34,495 --> 02:55:35,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is why I do this job.

1052
02:55:35,876 --> 02:55:38,577
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think my colleagues would share that sentiment.

1053
02:55:38,657 --> 02:55:48,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So I love hanging out with you all on Monday nights, but I also care about the 4,000 kids in this district and I'm not okay with the cuts we're going to be asked to make.

1054
02:55:48,821 --> 02:55:49,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not okay with it.

1055
02:55:50,622 --> 02:55:52,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not okay with it.

1056
02:55:52,764 --> 02:55:53,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never been okay with it.

1057
02:55:53,965 --> 02:55:57,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I voted no on the last budget that cut too deep and I will do it again.

1058
02:56:01,906 --> 02:56:04,047
[SPEAKER_09]: These six people can't do anything about it.

1059
02:56:04,147 --> 02:56:07,389
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do we get to this $8 million?

1060
02:56:07,429 --> 02:56:08,190
[SPEAKER_09]: How did we get there?

1061
02:56:08,430 --> 02:56:11,612
[SPEAKER_09]: All of a sudden, we're talking like the last time.

1062
02:56:11,632 --> 02:56:11,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1063
02:56:11,812 --> 02:56:30,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Douglas, I did want to say, I know that we're not in the same place about these wage increases, but the district has proposed a way that allows us to use ESSER funds that is permissible under the DESE regulation to provide stipends

1064
02:56:31,673 --> 02:56:35,136
[SPEAKER_09]: to your teachers for two of the years.

1065
02:56:35,797 --> 02:56:41,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that's not, let me finish please.

1066
02:56:42,984 --> 02:56:44,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that isn't ideal.

1067
02:56:44,706 --> 02:56:47,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I recognize fully its limitations.

1068
02:56:47,568 --> 02:56:53,034
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we cannot use that money if it is not a defensible and permissible use.

1069
02:56:53,634 --> 02:56:54,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And that may be

1070
02:56:55,936 --> 02:57:07,062
[SPEAKER_09]: the compromise we have to think about and explore in the right now when we're faced with a $1.4 million surprise deficit here in Medford.

1071
02:57:07,642 --> 02:57:12,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We should do lots of things as a community to fix that so we don't have to do this again.

1072
02:57:12,645 --> 02:57:19,589
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I said, I'm ready to pound the pavement for that two and a half override that is gonna fix this structurally.

1073
02:57:20,129 --> 02:57:23,051
[SPEAKER_09]: But until then, I would ask that

1074
02:57:23,331 --> 02:57:31,477
[SPEAKER_09]: the district, think about how to use that money in a permissible fashion to with the proposal that's on the table.

1075
02:57:32,037 --> 02:57:35,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would ask you all to think about how we can make that work.

1076
02:57:35,800 --> 02:57:41,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm it's if it was my pocketbook, it would be different.

1077
02:57:41,965 --> 02:57:45,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I we cannot this committee cannot spend money that we do not have.

1078
02:57:45,707 --> 02:57:47,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to make sure that you all know

1079
02:57:49,113 --> 02:58:10,279
[SPEAKER_09]: We, I recognize fully that that proposal is not ideal, I get it, but there's nothing ideal about this situation that we are in and I'm terribly sorry about it and I really do hope the city can find a way to do better as we go forward because we can't we can't keep having this conversation like we're, we're out, we're out of things to cut.

1080
02:58:10,979 --> 02:58:15,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things and you know I didn't get enough detail into it.

1081
02:58:16,007 --> 02:58:25,390
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to look into it, but obviously a proposition two and a half percent override, our property values have increased significantly.

1082
02:58:25,730 --> 02:58:29,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're selling shacks in the city for millions of dollars, right?

1083
02:58:29,752 --> 02:58:30,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be honest, okay?

1084
02:58:31,192 --> 02:58:33,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have a home in the city that I own.

1085
02:58:33,713 --> 02:58:40,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it needs some work, but I know that I could get a million standing on my head and I know it needs work, okay?

1086
02:58:40,876 --> 02:58:44,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So that increase in property value

1087
02:58:45,987 --> 02:58:48,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Increase tax, 2.5%.

1088
02:58:48,528 --> 02:58:49,188
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do that.

1089
02:58:49,248 --> 02:58:50,289
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't reevaluate.

1090
02:58:50,329 --> 02:58:53,290
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't look at that 2.5% increase.

1091
02:58:53,830 --> 02:58:55,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So can anyone address that?

1092
02:58:55,691 --> 02:58:56,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1093
02:58:56,652 --> 02:58:58,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin was waiting to speak.

1094
02:58:58,532 --> 02:58:59,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have an answer?

1095
02:59:00,233 --> 02:59:01,193
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't have an answer to that.

1096
02:59:01,214 --> 02:59:02,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I have something else I wanted to comment on.

1097
02:59:02,774 --> 02:59:03,514
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to respond.

1098
02:59:06,566 --> 02:59:15,508
[SPEAKER_21]: If I see this in my neighborhood house across the street, just sold for $1.1 million and I'm just like, what is going on?

1099
02:59:16,448 --> 02:59:25,450
[SPEAKER_21]: But because of prop two and a half, we can tax that house more, but we gotta tax other houses less because we cannot increase our taxes more than two and a half percent.

1100
02:59:25,750 --> 02:59:32,091
[SPEAKER_21]: So it doesn't matter if a whole quarter of the city sold their houses that were fully paid off and bought 30 years ago,

1101
02:59:32,611 --> 02:59:35,992
[SPEAKER_21]: for a price that now looks amazing.

1102
02:59:36,572 --> 02:59:43,894
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we sold all those houses for millions of dollars each, the taxes will go up exactly two and a half percent anyways.

1103
02:59:44,315 --> 02:59:46,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't re-evaluate properties?

1104
02:59:46,255 --> 02:59:47,415
[SPEAKER_21]: We re-evaluate.

1105
02:59:47,475 --> 02:59:48,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Even those that are not sold?

1106
02:59:49,276 --> 02:59:49,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1107
02:59:49,696 --> 02:59:50,536
[SPEAKER_02]: We re-evaluate.

1108
02:59:50,556 --> 02:59:51,957
[SPEAKER_21]: That's how come this year

1109
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:59,823
[SPEAKER_21]: Some people's taxes went down because those million dollar homes are getting taxed appropriately for the sale price.

1110
03:00:00,663 --> 03:00:05,866
[SPEAKER_21]: But because we cannot collect more taxes than two and a half percent from the previous more than the last year.

1111
03:00:06,306 --> 03:00:10,308
[SPEAKER_21]: We got to subtract that from somebody else's property taxes.

1112
03:00:10,648 --> 03:00:11,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it absurd?

1113
03:00:11,649 --> 03:00:12,989
[SPEAKER_21]: The whole system is absurd.

1114
03:00:13,169 --> 03:00:16,271
[SPEAKER_21]: And honestly, I can't I get really.

1115
03:00:16,291 --> 03:00:16,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1116
03:00:17,271 --> 03:00:27,522
[SPEAKER_21]: worked up about how crazy the law is, but in the aggregate, the total amount of revenue collected from residential property tech property cannot increase more than two and a half.

1117
03:00:27,922 --> 03:00:36,171
[SPEAKER_21]: And it doesn't matter if somebody walked in and started paying by every house on the street for $10 million, they'll pay a lot of taxes, somebody else will pay less.

1118
03:00:37,062 --> 03:00:39,363
[SPEAKER_21]: to compensate for the increase in one place.

1119
03:00:39,663 --> 03:00:42,565
[SPEAKER_21]: It's crazy and it's gross, frankly.

1120
03:00:42,585 --> 03:00:46,687
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so hopefully we can see you tomorrow and we can really discuss this.

1121
03:00:46,727 --> 03:00:51,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will bring some of that information that my questions too.

1122
03:00:51,289 --> 03:00:54,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't have it all available to me in front of me right now.

1123
03:00:54,571 --> 03:00:55,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

1124
03:00:55,551 --> 03:00:55,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1125
03:00:56,732 --> 03:00:57,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

1126
03:00:57,372 --> 03:00:59,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Douglas, for the presentation.

1127
03:00:59,173 --> 03:01:03,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to just comment on a couple of things that were said as well for the folks that are here.

1128
03:01:04,912 --> 03:01:10,857
[SPEAKER_10]: just through the chair, I want to concur with my colleague that we do very much care about our children, our teachers, our paraprofessionals, our staff.

1129
03:01:11,397 --> 03:01:15,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's really commendable that you're standing up for the parents here.

1130
03:01:15,400 --> 03:01:17,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciated the folks that did that.

1131
03:01:17,462 --> 03:01:20,184
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that you'll continue to do that.

1132
03:01:20,204 --> 03:01:22,887
[SPEAKER_10]: $17,000 a year is not a livable wage.

1133
03:01:22,907 --> 03:01:24,528
[SPEAKER_10]: $50 a day is not a livable wage.

1134
03:01:24,888 --> 03:01:30,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a caregiver of a child with an intellectual and developmental disability, I can tell you how hard that work is from a personal perspective.

1135
03:01:31,380 --> 03:01:37,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to say that I think it's really important that you folks are doing that and appreciate that very much.

1136
03:01:37,423 --> 03:01:51,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to say, if you're looking at a $71.67 million budget and $55 million is for personnel, we roughly have $12, $13 million to spend on the entire rest of the district.

1137
03:01:51,810 --> 03:01:54,411
[SPEAKER_10]: So how do we cut that pie?

1138
03:01:54,812 --> 03:01:59,474
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we decide who gets what, when, where, when everybody wants more?

1139
03:02:00,259 --> 03:02:19,407
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, you know, again, as we're talking about each other compassionately I hope with some empathy, seeing things from your perspective I'm also asking you know that you see things from this perspective as well, nobody's doing this job up here because, you know, it pays a lot, or because you know, you know, for the notoriety for the for the friends, I don't think so.

1140
03:02:21,709 --> 03:02:22,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes for me.

1141
03:02:23,790 --> 03:02:24,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm retired.

1142
03:02:25,611 --> 03:02:30,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to know what my stipend was, it's a lot less than yours.

1143
03:02:31,493 --> 03:02:36,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do this really, really because I do care about this city.

1144
03:02:37,334 --> 03:02:40,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do care about these people.

1145
03:02:40,856 --> 03:02:46,257
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just think getting back to that point about caring about our children, I think we all care for our children.

1146
03:02:46,297 --> 03:02:49,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope that we can move forward with that in mind together.

1147
03:02:49,779 --> 03:02:50,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1148
03:02:51,937 --> 03:02:52,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1149
03:02:52,597 --> 03:02:53,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other questions?

1150
03:02:55,739 --> 03:02:57,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm done.

1151
03:02:57,680 --> 03:03:00,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there might be other people who want to speak, but I'm done.

1152
03:03:00,221 --> 03:03:01,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1153
03:03:02,463 --> 03:03:13,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

1154
03:03:13,969 --> 03:03:14,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

1155
03:03:14,469 --> 03:03:15,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Name and address of the record, please.

1156
03:03:15,750 --> 03:03:16,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie Taylor.

1157
03:03:16,530 --> 03:03:19,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say I live at school, but Anthony took my joke.

1158
03:03:19,532 --> 03:03:21,033
[SPEAKER_00]: So 47 Burnside Street in Medford.

1159
03:03:22,195 --> 03:03:30,359
[SPEAKER_00]: The word unprecedented has been used numerous times since March of 2020 by administrators and city officials to describe the efforts being made by Medford Public Schools.

1160
03:03:30,919 --> 03:03:38,482
[SPEAKER_00]: When the email was sent out on March 12 of 2020 notifying the Medford Public Schools community of its temporary two week closure, its teachers swung into action.

1161
03:03:38,883 --> 03:03:46,146
[SPEAKER_00]: They met with their students daily on Zoom, they delivered schoolwork to apartments, they organized car parades so they could see their students and let them know how much they missed them.

1162
03:03:46,846 --> 03:03:51,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks quickly turned into three months and teachers continue to show up every day for their students.

1163
03:03:51,770 --> 03:03:59,195
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last day of school, June 15, in an unprecedented move, over 100 public school educators received a letter of termination.

1164
03:03:59,935 --> 03:04:03,218
[SPEAKER_00]: On August 30, 2020, an unprecedented school year began.

1165
03:04:03,758 --> 03:04:10,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the next several months, teachers adapted to numerous different learning models with minimal notice or instructional support from administrators,

1166
03:04:10,683 --> 03:04:15,826
[SPEAKER_00]: and continue to provide meaningful and engaging lessons to a wide range of students and circumstances.

1167
03:04:16,447 --> 03:04:23,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers were subjected to unprecedented experiences in the classroom and field of education, but persevered nonetheless.

1168
03:04:24,091 --> 03:04:30,795
[SPEAKER_00]: This school year, once again, could be described as unprecedented, with students' emotional and academic needs at an all-time high.

1169
03:04:31,376 --> 03:04:36,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite this, teachers continue to show up for their students and continue to meet and exceed their contractual obligations.

1170
03:04:37,472 --> 03:04:40,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, however, teachers have been working for nine months without a contract.

1171
03:04:41,314 --> 03:04:48,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers are often expected to adhere to the narrative that they are willing to subject themselves to challenging and demeaning work conditions because they do it for the kids.

1172
03:04:48,919 --> 03:04:56,764
[SPEAKER_00]: However, only doing it for the kids is simply not sustainable for these unprecedented times when met with disrespect from administration within our district.

1173
03:04:57,464 --> 03:05:03,688
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important things the district can do for the kids is support its teachers so they in turn can support their students.

1174
03:05:04,315 --> 03:05:10,099
[SPEAKER_00]: The pandemic was and remains a tough, very tough for Medford families and it's been very hard for the teachers of Medford as well.

1175
03:05:10,619 --> 03:05:15,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Many have decided to retire early, others are choosing to leave the district and even the profession of teaching.

1176
03:05:16,263 --> 03:05:22,628
[SPEAKER_00]: If Medford wants to retain its teachers who kept the community afloat during the height of the pandemic, it needs to look no further than its masthead.

1177
03:05:23,248 --> 03:05:28,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford Public Schools MassTED states that it's a caring educational partnership of school, family and community.

1178
03:05:29,054 --> 03:05:39,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers call on the Medford community school committee members and city officials who pledged their commitment to upholding the sentiments of Medford Public Schools to now show their commitment to the pledge they made when running for office.

1179
03:05:40,205 --> 03:05:46,612
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope with their support and partnership, it can be, as our superintendents constantly say, a great day to be a Mustang once more.

1180
03:06:02,858 --> 03:06:03,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1181
03:06:06,079 --> 03:06:06,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1182
03:06:06,639 --> 03:06:07,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions from the committee?

1183
03:06:19,603 --> 03:06:26,405
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's no other comments from anybody in the audience, any teacher, any school committee member, no questions.

1184
03:06:48,038 --> 03:06:48,211
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.

1185
03:07:56,889 --> 03:07:58,453
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go on to continue business.

1186
03:07:58,673 --> 03:08:03,424
[SPEAKER_11]: We have dress code policy approved by rules policy subcommittee on 525 2022 motion to accept.

1187
03:08:08,824 --> 03:08:08,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1188
03:08:10,125 --> 03:08:15,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, so you want to want to page three and we can, you can always switch off with me if you thank you.

1189
03:08:16,170 --> 03:08:21,994
[SPEAKER_21]: We did just adopt rules that require two readings of policies and while I think it's fine to wave the reading of policy updates.

1190
03:08:22,455 --> 03:08:25,417
[SPEAKER_21]: I think an entirely new policy of this nature does need to be read.

1191
03:08:26,498 --> 03:08:31,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Just this one time when we have it next time around I would hope we could perhaps wave the reading.

1192
03:08:32,202 --> 03:08:33,723
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you, everyone.

1193
03:08:34,443 --> 03:08:45,188
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the dress code policy that we approved in the Rules and Policy Subcommittee on May 25th, and I will begin now.

1194
03:08:45,628 --> 03:08:57,473
[SPEAKER_21]: It is the policy of the committee that the student and their parent, guardian, or caregiver hold the primary responsibility in determining the student's personal attire, hairstyle, jewelry, and personal items, e.g.

1195
03:08:57,533 --> 03:08:59,494
[SPEAKER_21]: backpacks, book bags.

1196
03:09:00,254 --> 03:09:11,820
[SPEAKER_21]: Schools are responsible for ensuring that student attire, hairstyle, jewelry, and personal items do not interfere with the health or safety of any student and do not contribute to a hostile or intimidating environment for any student.

1197
03:09:13,081 --> 03:09:13,981
[SPEAKER_21]: The core values.

1198
03:09:14,681 --> 03:09:18,383
[SPEAKER_21]: In relation to student dress, the district's core values are the following.

1199
03:09:18,884 --> 03:09:28,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Students should be able to dress and style their hair for school in a manner that expresses their individuality without fear of unnecessary discipline or body shaming.

1200
03:09:29,469 --> 03:09:31,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Students have the right to be treated equitably.

1201
03:09:31,871 --> 03:09:55,627
[SPEAKER_21]: Dress code enforcement will not create disparities, reinforce or increase the marginalization of any group, nor will it be more strictly enforced against students because of racial identity, ethnicity, gender identity, gender expression, gender nonconformity, sexual orientation, culture or religious identity, household income, body size or type, or body maturity.

1202
03:09:56,568 --> 03:10:08,579
[SPEAKER_21]: Students and staff are responsible for managing their personal distractions students should not face unnecessary barriers to school attendance, the universal dress code students must wear.

1203
03:10:09,594 --> 03:10:22,244
[SPEAKER_21]: One, a top, which could be a shirt, blouse, sweater, sweatshirt, tank, tank top, et cetera, bottom, pants, shorts, skirt, dress, et cetera, and footwear.

1204
03:10:23,045 --> 03:10:30,331
[SPEAKER_21]: This policy permits additional student attire requirements when necessary to ensure safety in certain academic settings, e.g.

1205
03:10:30,751 --> 03:10:35,936
[SPEAKER_21]: physical education, science, or CTE courses, as well as recess.

1206
03:10:36,693 --> 03:10:50,437
[SPEAKER_21]: Additionally, this policy allows for reasonable variation in required student attire for participation in activities such as swimming or gymnastics students may not wear clothing jewelry or personal items that contain.

1207
03:10:51,662 --> 03:11:02,364
[SPEAKER_21]: that are pornographic, contain threats, or promote illegal or violent conduct, such as the unlawful use of weapons, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or drug paraphernalia.

1208
03:11:03,124 --> 03:11:14,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Demonstrate hate group association or affiliation and or use hate speech targeting groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, or other protected groups.

1209
03:11:16,027 --> 03:11:22,495
[SPEAKER_21]: intentionally show private parts, nipples, genitals, or buttocks, or undergarments, with the exception of bra straps.

1210
03:11:24,077 --> 03:11:28,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Clothing must cover private parts in opaque, not able to be seen through material.

1211
03:11:30,253 --> 03:11:43,678
[SPEAKER_21]: cover the items that cover the student's face to the extent that the student is not identifiable except clothing, headgear worn for religious or medical purposes, or demonstrate gang association or affiliation.

1212
03:11:44,338 --> 03:11:48,279
[SPEAKER_21]: Attire worn in observance of a student's religion is not subject to this policy.

1213
03:11:49,140 --> 03:11:53,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Clothing that displays profanity or other vulgarities can disrupt the learning environment.

1214
03:11:54,142 --> 03:11:58,043
[SPEAKER_21]: School leaders reserve the right to address disruptions on a case-by-case basis.

1215
03:11:59,770 --> 03:12:00,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Enforcement.

[SPEAKER_21]: staff will use reasonable efforts to limit disciplinary, that disciplining or removing students from class as a consequence of wearing attire in violation of this policy, unless the attire creates a substantial disruption to the educational environment, poses a hazard to the health or safety of others, or factors into a student behavior rule violation, such as malicious harassment, or the prohibition on harassment, intimidation, and bullying.

1219

[SPEAKER_21]: Further, no student shall be referred to as a distraction due to their appearance or attire.

[SPEAKER_21]: A student may be instructed to leave their classroom briefly to change clothes.

1223

[SPEAKER_21]: The principal or their designee will notify a student's parent, guardian or caregiver of the school's response to violations of student dress code policy.

1224
03:13:17,612 --> 03:13:24,076
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I may just add a quick commentary, I really wanna thank aside from the members of the rules committee

1225
03:13:24,836 --> 03:13:28,179
[SPEAKER_21]: and Policy Subcommittee, Member Graham and Member McLaughlin.

[SPEAKER_21]: Whalen's class.

1228
03:13:38,069 --> 03:13:44,035
[SPEAKER_21]: They worked on this project about the dress code around hoods.

1229
03:13:44,475 --> 03:13:45,336
[SPEAKER_21]: That was their angle.

1230
03:13:46,317 --> 03:13:48,960
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, with this policy, hoods and hats will be allowed.

1231
03:13:49,680 --> 03:14:00,242
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just can't thank them enough because they also provided feedback that was really useful in fine tuning this policy.

1232
03:14:00,702 --> 03:14:09,404
[SPEAKER_21]: I also would recommend people listen to the podcast, No Caps, which was an NPR finalist.

1233
03:14:10,284 --> 03:14:17,466
[SPEAKER_21]: And there was a new version of the Medford Bites podcast this two days ago, I believe, which is again on this policy.

1245
03:14:52,938 --> 03:15:00,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently three times a year, the report will show the progression of results across the school year and include a summary of actions being taken to act on the results.

1254
03:15:16,764 --> 03:15:17,524
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1255
03:15:18,185 --> 03:15:19,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion is approved.

1256
03:15:20,145 --> 03:15:40,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Member Rousseau, Member Graham, 2022-37, whereas the best way to help working families and build a stronger economy for us all is to make sure that we have quality public schools for our children, affordable public higher education, and a reliable transportation system, whereas students need a well-rounded education founded on a rich and varied curriculum

1257
03:15:41,425 --> 03:16:02,047
[SPEAKER_11]: that includes science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM, music, art, and athletics, whereas major investments in public education are needed to help students recover academically, socially, and emotionally from the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas tuitions and fees at our public colleges are among the highest in the country, and students are forced to take an enormous debt to receive a degree.

1258
03:16:03,626 --> 03:16:15,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas for Massachusetts to compete against other regions around the nation and the globe, we need modern, reliable transportation, safer roads and bridges, public transportation that works, and safe ways to walk and bike around town.

1259
03:16:16,493 --> 03:16:23,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas we have a large backlog of neglected and structurally compromised bridges, tunnels, roads, and public transportation infrastructure in need of repair.

1260
03:16:23,857 --> 03:16:33,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas new state revenue is necessary to rebuild crumbling roads and bridges, improve our public schools from pre-K through college, invest in fast and reliable public transportation,

1261
03:16:33,902 --> 03:16:38,524
[SPEAKER_11]: make public higher education affordable then and expand opportunities for healthy walking and bicycling.

1262
03:16:39,464 --> 03:16:45,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas Massachusetts needs new investments in our transportation and public education systems, even before the COVID-19 pandemic.

1263
03:16:46,287 --> 03:16:52,009
[SPEAKER_11]: And now those investments are needed more than ever to lift our economy into an equitable and long lasting recovery.

1264
03:16:52,029 --> 03:16:59,192
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas our Commonwealth's highest income residents who have seen their collective net worth skyrocket in recent years pay a lower

1265
03:16:59,633 --> 03:17:28,452
[SPEAKER_11]: percentage of their income in state and local taxes than do the rest of us and clearly have the ability to pay a little more for the investment we all need now, therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee supports the proposed fair share amendment that would create an additional tax of 4% points on annual income above $1 million and dedicate the funds raised by this tax to qualify, to quality public education, affordable public colleges and universities and for the repair and maintenance of roads,

1266
03:17:29,275 --> 03:17:31,217
[SPEAKER_11]: bridges and public transportation.

1267
03:17:31,918 --> 03:17:33,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau, Member Graham.

1268
03:17:34,161 --> 03:17:35,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor.

1269
03:17:35,422 --> 03:17:39,306
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say it speaks for itself that you're the doll that's speaking.

1270
03:17:41,339 --> 03:17:54,923
[SPEAKER_21]: So the fair share amendment is, is going to be on the ballot this fall and I urge everyone to vote for it because it will add a 4% additional tax for those with incomes, greater than a million dollars a year.

1271
03:17:55,444 --> 03:18:05,167
[SPEAKER_21]: For most of us, it's hard to conceptualize what that even means, but that additional 4% will be used for schools and roads and.

1272
03:18:06,104 --> 03:18:09,527
[SPEAKER_21]: We just had a very interesting evening about the lack of revenues.

1273
03:18:10,027 --> 03:18:17,453
[SPEAKER_21]: So to alleviate some of that burden coming from the state would be nice.

1274
03:18:17,833 --> 03:18:29,263
[SPEAKER_21]: So I do ask that everybody consider supporting this, not just tonight, but when you're talking to your friends and family and they're like, what is this fair share amendment?

1275
03:18:30,043 --> 03:18:32,665
[SPEAKER_21]: It is just on income over a million dollars.

1276
03:18:32,685 --> 03:18:34,767
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you have a million dollars in the bank, that's not income.

1277
03:18:36,035 --> 03:18:41,818
[SPEAKER_21]: These are people who are getting a paycheck throughout the year that is more than a million dollars.

1278
03:18:42,519 --> 03:18:50,243
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's 4% on that is not a lot of money, but it will add up to, I can't remember how many billions of dollars for education, so.

1279
03:18:51,183 --> 03:18:51,844
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to approve.

1280
03:18:52,504 --> 03:18:55,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by Member Rousseau.

1281
03:18:55,626 --> 03:18:56,426
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1282
03:18:57,006 --> 03:18:57,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1283
03:18:57,467 --> 03:18:58,227
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1284
03:18:58,547 --> 03:18:59,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1285
03:19:00,228 --> 03:19:03,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Reports requested is number nine, number, sorry, 11.

1286
03:19:05,109 --> 03:19:16,293
[SPEAKER_11]: 2022-27 update on implementation of NWEA map offered by members Sharon Hayes, member Melanie McLaughlin, and member Mima Stone from our March 21st, 2022 meeting.

1287
03:19:18,853 --> 03:19:20,034
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think that one's ready yet.

1288
03:19:20,054 --> 03:19:29,917
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we might want to have a rule update next time around to indicate when things are just here to be carried forward versus when they're actually ready.

1289
03:19:30,677 --> 03:19:31,837
[SPEAKER_21]: But we'll get to that next year.

1290
03:19:32,098 --> 03:19:32,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Gotcha.

1291
03:19:32,858 --> 03:19:33,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And then number

1292
03:19:34,126 --> 03:19:34,966
[SPEAKER_11]: 12 as condolences.

1293
03:19:36,147 --> 03:19:45,290
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Angela Modica, a Medford Food Service worker at Medford High School and McGlynn School Cafeteria.

1294
03:19:45,670 --> 03:19:47,091
[SPEAKER_11]: We all may rise for a moment of silence.

1295
03:20:00,756 --> 03:20:01,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1296
03:20:02,153 --> 03:20:14,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Our next meeting will be next Monday, June 13 6pm regular school committee here and all the F. All the memorial chambers Medford City Hall and also by zoom motion to adjourn.
