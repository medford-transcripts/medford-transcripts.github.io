1
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,291
Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:50,822
We'll just give Paulette one minute.

3
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:11,378
Dr. Maurice, I could change my name without your help tonight.

4
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:14,258
After 18, how many months?

5
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:16,459
I couldn't figure it out myself.

6
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,579
Now you're an expert.

7
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,261
Good evening, everyone.

8
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:30,441
Good evening.

9
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:31,001
Hi.

10
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:31,902
Good evening.

11
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:33,942

Present.

42
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:01,873
Member Van de Kloet.

43
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:02,554
Present.

44
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:04,135
Mayor Long-Term.

45
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,978
Present, seven present, zero absent.

46
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:14,485
Dr. Edward-Vinson, I'll turn it over to you.

47
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,460
So good evening, everyone.

48
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:27,432
I am pleased to have presented my goals and my self assessment form to you at our last meeting.

49
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:35,341
And essentially, I had one key goal, which talked about safety.

50
00:04:36,982 --> 00:05:01,575
equity and consistency, all of the things that we did to have a successful launch to the school year, from creating schedules to eventually testing and making sure that what we did was done in an equitable way to meet the needs of our students that were both hybrid and our students that were fully remote.

51
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:13,084
followed by one student, key student learning goal, which was a focus on mathematics and elementary mathematics.

52
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:22,851
And I talked about the shifts and changes that will be coming down the pike for us this coming school year moving forward, but what we have done thus far.

53
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:30,958
And I provided one professional practice goal, which was the new superintendent induction program.

54
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:37,214
I completed the third year of the formal training of the program.

55
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:49,299
In addition to being part of an affinity group through on monthly equity sessions, and that final outcome or final product that was produced.

56
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:57,904
was the district strategic plan, which was presented, the draft plan, but it was presented back to the committee a few weeks ago.

57
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:07,450
And so those were the three goals that I presented to the committee and the committee was going to share their responses.

58
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,131
Thank you.

59
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:18,404
Mayor.

60
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:19,707
Member Van de Kloet.

61
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,815
So looking at the, I don't know whether

62
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:35,547
Mr. Rousseau who tabulated the responses wants to say anything at this point, but looking it over, I see that my colleagues hold you in the same high esteem that I do.

63
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:51,250
Because as I look over the different scores, all of which are often 3.5 or above with four being the highest, you can see that's truly a remarkable standard.

64
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,431
And so that,

65
00:06:53,933 --> 00:07:08,285
I think that we all value so much what you set out this year, your achievement in getting kids back to school, holding the safety of our students to the highest level.

66
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,667
And I think you should be really proud of yourself.

67
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:16,171
Thank you.

68
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:18,873
Thank you, Member van de Kloot, Member Roussel, and then Member Krath.

69
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:20,568
Thank you.

70
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:28,774
Yes, I did the compilation this year and I will say one of the things I'm, you know, I'm a bit of a nerd.

71
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:38,500
So I'm very, very interested in things like big discrepancies and how individuals might grade the superintendent on the 42 things that we grade you on.

72
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:43,323
And certainly some of us are harder graders than others.

73
00:07:45,425 --> 00:08:10,518
but I was happy to see no gigantic, you know, like nobody said you were a one, and then other people were saying you were a four, like there were none of these giant gaps, which I think is really, well, I think it's a great, I think it's a great thing, because when there's a giant gap, I think that there might be questions about, you know, the review process itself, which is still fairly new, and I think has, I think we're still kicking the tires.

74
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:13,440
I hope that the state, the DESE,

75
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:19,646
does some more fine tuning instead of waiting for 25 years like they did the last time before making an update.

76
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:31,775
But the one of the things about the current review process that I still find very challenging is that when you read the review process that they lay out, it's all about your goals.

77
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,677
And that's great.

78
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:37,178
That makes so much sense.

79
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,761
And then we get 42 things to grade you on which seem to have nothing to do with the goals.

80
00:08:41,752 --> 00:09:01,377
So to me, it's still a very, very confusing, it's a very cute dog, but it's a very confusing process even after they've made a huge improvement, but I was very happy to see that there were not giant discrepancies in any of the grading by the individual members, which I know you don't see all that, but I just wanted to say that.

81
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:06,118
And I appreciate all the members for sending me your scores and your comments.

82
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:08,378
I integrated the comments as best I could.

83
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:16,791
Some of them didn't make it in because they might've been duplicates and I wanted to make it sound like one voice because that's the review is just one voice.

84
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:17,472
It's all of us.

85
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:18,373
So thank you.

86
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:20,136
Thank you.

87
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:20,717
Thank you members.

88
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:21,478
So memocrats.

89
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:26,123
Kathy, please.

90
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:27,423
Yes.

91
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:28,764
So I'm sorry.

92
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:33,805
I'm just having some trouble locating the complete document.

93
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:38,906
When I click on the link I got from Susie, it keeps on bringing me into just my evaluation.

94
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:42,687
I can't see everybody else's.

95
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:47,689
Before we began the process, I could see the prior.

96
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,889
So it came today, Kathy?

97
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,410
It came today around 3.15?

98
00:09:54,016 --> 00:10:05,205
Yeah and I like I'm in the Google Sheets share drive and I open it up at 608 and it's just my, it's just my evaluation.

99
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:06,606
Okay.

100
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:08,487
I know.

101
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:08,687
Yes.

102
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:09,628
Member Rousseau.

103
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:10,569
Thank you.

104
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,570
I do see that you're in that evaluation, Kathy.

105
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,111
Yeah.

106
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,372
Member Kratz, sorry.

107
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:15,593
That's not yours.

108
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,294
That says SC folder copy 2020-2021.

109
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:17,574
Okay.

110
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:25,299
It doesn't have all of the individual scores, because we're not supposed to share all of our individual scores.

111
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:26,639
This is the combined one.

112
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:26,700
OK.

113
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,121
OK.

114
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,682
Yeah, this is the averaging.

115
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:30,042
Yeah.

116
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:39,915
Oh, OK, because I think the last time we did it, there was like a tab for all the individual scores, because that's what I saw before.

117
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,255
But that's fine.

118
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,575
I think it's just a little bit different.

119
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:45,696
Or maybe I'm just not remembering, even though it was just a few months ago.

120
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:55,257
But yes, no, I mean, I'm happy to see that the scores are very consistent with what I did for my evaluation.

121
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:58,678
So I think we're all on the same page with,

122
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:23,559
the remarkable job that the superintendent has done this school year during the pandemic, you know, transitioning from fully remote over to hybrid, then in-person, then the return to school, the staggered start, and just making sure all the classrooms were ready and safe for all the students and the teachers.

123
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,281
You know, I think

124
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:43,239
know, with all the different bulletins that Lisa Evangelista sends out, you know, there was just communications, pictures with you at every school, where you were, you know, helping out here, you know, giving out meals, computers, you know, not computers, but the Google Chromebooks, and

125
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,002
You were there when all the students returned.

126
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:53,126
You made sure you went to every classroom at all the different events.

127
00:11:53,566 --> 00:12:02,012
I'm just grateful for your leadership and what a great successful school year that we had despite the pandemic.

128
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:05,094
And I look forward to another successful year of learning.

129
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:06,495
Thank you.

130
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,336
Thank you.

131
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:09,837
Member McLaughlin.

132
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:13,988
Thank you.

133
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:27,153
Yes, through the chair for member Kretz, in the last occasion, I had tabulated the numbers and I did do different sheets for each of the members, which I think is helpful.

134
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:33,336
And maybe, you know, later we can see the evaluations in that form as well.

135
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:38,838
Again, through the chair for member Russo, because I do think it's helpful to sort of see each other's feedback as well.

136
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:44,894
I know that this is a remote meeting, so it's a little bit different, but just wanted to sort of put that out there as well.

137
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:54,722
But regarding Dr., and I also want to thank my colleagues for the process, for helping to create this process, to create this form.

138
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:56,363
It's made it so much more streamlined.

139
00:12:56,804 --> 00:13:03,329
I know when I was putting the data together, it was really interesting to look at the data and also to see the tabulation and have that form already created.

140
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,432
I think that could be marketed, frankly, Member Russo.

141
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:07,394
to the chair.

142
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:11,157
I think you could get that to other school committees and they'd be really valuing it.

143
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:12,137
It's a really helpful form.

144
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:12,638
So thank you.

145
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:21,183
And then to the superintendent, I also just wanted to reiterate the leader that you've been throughout this process and how much

146
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:25,086
I value you and how lucky I think our district is to have you.

147
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:34,229
And one of the things that I thought was really notable about our experience this past year with you is the way that you remain steadfast in your morals and your values.

148
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,631
And I think that's what differentiates individuals.

149
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:45,113
I think that's what differentiates politicians and leaders and what have you is, you know, who stays with their morals and their values.

150
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:47,954
And you do that even when the going's tough.

151
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,735
And I think that that's a sign of a true leader.

152
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:56,815
And I thank you for that and I want to, you know, tell you I know that and I recognize that that has not always been easy.

153
00:13:57,516 --> 00:14:02,122
And then also I wanted to say and just share with the community you know last week we were at the middle school.

154
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:04,769
graduation ceremony.

155
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:11,855
And we have the privilege of being out on, in this instance, out on the field, and we're facing the audience, but the students are facing us.

156
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:19,422
So they're back to the audience, but we have the opportunity to look at the students and watch the students during the ceremony, which is really quite remarkable as well.

157
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:28,549
And I was so proud when you were speaking to the students, because I could see so many of the students sitting up in their seat and listening to you and really watching you.

158
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,431
And I think that they've been doing that.

159
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:41,716
some time and to have a leader such as yourself, a woman, a woman of color in this role and have our students to be able to see you and look up to you in that role I think is quite remarkable.

160
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:44,818
So I think we're very fortunate and I want to say thank you.

161
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:54,205
Thank you and I would be remiss if I didn't say in this evaluation that I share this evaluation with my team

162
00:14:54,823 --> 00:15:08,919
If we think about the strategic plan that see for collaboration, I strongly, strongly believe in the power of the team and collaboration and that the collective is greater than the individual.

163
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,665
And so, although you see me, I have a phenomenal team.

164
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:25,360
that is supporting me and I just want to thank them so much for supporting me and helping me to be able to execute this vision for the Medford Public Schools.

165
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:27,743
Thank you.

166
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:29,065
Member Graham.

167
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:31,954
Thank you.

168
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:51,140
To that point, Dr. Edward Benson, I just want to also point out that as a leader, you acquire a staff, and then you have to sort of assess the staff as they are and think about how to move forward as the organization shifts and evolves.

169
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,542
And I think one of the things that you've done remarkably well is bring the right people onto the bus with you.

170
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:14,848
I've been so impressed with the work that you've done as you've hired new folks into the district to really be a compliment to the team and the strengths that already exist, and really to find those folks who are as invested in moving Medford forward as you are so that.

171
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:35,789
decision making is often one of the most complex things you do as a leader and one of the most impactful but I think you are doing an exceptional job as you decide and recommend us who those folks are and make hiring decisions really all throughout the district.

172
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:39,092
So I want to say thank you for that and certainly you know as you

173
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:53,823
review somebody, it's very, it's sort of counterintuitive to reflect the work of others into somebody's review, but that is often something that, you know, you look at leaders as the sort of sum of the parts.

174
00:16:54,603 --> 00:17:06,447
And, you know, when I think about the strategic plan and even just the dramatic shift in the strategic plan in one short year, it's really been very remarkable to watch you all work.

175
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:06,988
So thank you.

176
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:17,647
Member McStone, you echo the sentiments, I'm sure, of everybody else.

177
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,068
I think that's exactly it.

178
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:28,872
And Dr. Edouard-Vincent, I do want to say what I appreciate most is that you always see the best in everyone.

179
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,052
And you tap into that.

180
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:33,153
And that, I think, is why you have such a strong team.

181
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:38,796
And it's been a pleasure seeing you just really go for it here at Method.

182
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:39,556
So thank you.

183
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,705
And just from the chair, I want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

184
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,007
I think you've done a really great job.

185
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:56,611
I think the communication from three years ago to today is just really out of this world.

186
00:17:56,651 --> 00:18:06,737
To be able to hear from your superintendent, even as a mom, once a week, and then to see it trickle down to your assistant superintendent, who we're hearing from, it means a lot as a parent.

187
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:12,820
I know it goes a long way with the staff, the teachers and all that, you know, work in the schools.

188
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,921
So that's been a real highlight for me.

189
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:21,524
Your strategic plan was extremely thorough and I can't wait to see you fulfill it, which I know you will do.

190
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:29,467
I know you're working on curriculum and a number of other things and just great job, just great, great job.

191
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:30,327
Thank you.

192
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:31,748
Thank you.

193
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:37,119
Motion to approve the evaluation.

194
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:38,020
Oh, I'm sorry, Paula.

195
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,800
I'm sorry, nevermind.

196
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,142
Member Rousseau?

197
00:18:42,302 --> 00:18:45,384
I actually was gonna do that, so Member McLaughlin can get to it.

198
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:54,388
Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Rousseau to accept the evaluation.

199
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:55,289
Roll call, please.

200
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,990
Member Graham?

201
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:01,192
Yes.

202
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:03,633
Member Kratz?

203
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:04,454
Yes.

204
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,810
Member McLaughlin, yes.

205
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,630
Member McStone.

206
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,330
Yes.

207
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:10,931
Member Russo.

208
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:11,751
Yes.

209
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:13,531
Member Van de Kloet.

210
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:14,091
Yes.

211
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:15,792
Mayor Longo-Kern.

212
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:16,672
Yes.

213
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,452
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

214
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,753
The evaluation is approved.

215
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:23,473
Thank you.

216
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:25,874
Congratulations.

217
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:31,334
Next up, proposed fiscal year 2022, Medford Public Schools operating budget.

218
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:34,135
Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations

219
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:47,214
David Murphy, and this is the district administration will ask the Medford School Committee to approve the proposed operating budget consistent with the mayor's recommendation to the Medford School Committee conveyed on June 1st, 2021.

220
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:59,080
And the superintendent's recommendations posted publicly on June 18th, 2021 for a fiscal year 22 operating budget for the Medford Public Schools of $67,461,003 contingent upon the eventual appropriation by the Medford City Council.

221
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:23,303
The district administration will ask the Memphis School Committee to endorse a series of strategic investments made possible through the use of ESSER II and ESSER III funding aimed at mitigating the impacts of school year 2021-2022 of the instructional disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during school year 2019-2020 and school year 2020-2021.

222
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,464
Mr. David Murphy.

223
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:25,244
Thank you, Mayor.

224
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:40,478
Members of the school committee, this is one final budget deck prior to the fiscal year 2022.

225
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:43,479
I'm gonna share my screen now.

226
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:59,926
I'm gonna move relatively quickly through this presentation as it's information that as we have discussed at length in a series of public meetings since late April, the ESSER funding priorities are

227
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:07,012
Also information that we've shared with you in various parts, but we're asking you to endorse the use of these funds.

228
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:14,875
That will be followed by our submission to DESE of the grant application and the distribution of the ESSER II funding.

229
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:28,680
If this were to stretch into ESSER III, we would consider your endorsement to apply to ESSER III, but based on the total numbers that we're looking at, in all likelihood, this will be specific to ESSER II.

230
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:40,026
linked in the presentation that you were provided are the DESI descriptions of restrictions on ESSER 2 and ESSER 3.

231
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,107
They are largely similar.

232
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:58,253
I don't believe that those distinctions are relevant for tonight's discussion, both because of the nature of the priorities transcending the ESSER 2 and ESSER 3 funding, and as I said, we don't anticipate needing to tap into ESSER 3 funding based on the numbers that we're looking at.

233
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:05,682
First, with respect to the operating budget, you've seen this chart several times over the last couple of months.

234
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,685
Each time we've presented, we've tried to clarify where in the process we are.

235
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:21,173
As you can see, we are at the end of the process tonight asking you to adopt an operating budget contingent upon the city council's appropriation.

236
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:28,398
I will just speak very briefly now about with regard to this process, because I know it's something that we've discussed at length many times at this forum.

237
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,532
but it is something that has been discussed publicly very recently.

238
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:56,465
The distinction between this budget process and the budget processes that, as it's been related to me, you have engaged in in the past, primarily boils down to the fact that you as the governing body of the school system directed us and then engaged with us in a process to authentically assess the needs and priorities of the district.

239
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:58,526
That process,

240
00:22:59,163 --> 00:23:08,409
or that phase of this process culminated on June 1st when we recommended to you to make a budget request of approximately $68.2 million.

241
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:22,559
As we told you throughout that process, and as we said publicly throughout that process, the school administration understands its responsibility to prepare for all eventual contingencies with respect to the actual appropriation.

242
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:28,943
And understanding that the municipal government must balance the needs of the city in its entirety, we were prepared

243
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:34,286
to operate the district with less funding than was originally requested on June 1st.

244
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:39,350
We are grateful that that gap was a relatively narrow one of $760,000.

245
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:56,982
And on June 14th, we advised you of the modifications that we would recommend are made to the budget in order to account both for that $760,000 Delta and other amendments or changes that we felt were in the best interest of the district.

246
00:23:57,473 --> 00:24:14,838
and had been developed between June 1st and June 14th, based on the continuous scrubbing and scrutiny that a 67 or $68 million budget of taxpayer dollars must go through during this, at this point of the process and throughout the fiscal year.

247
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:25,361
So what you're voting on tonight is essentially giving the district authority to implement the budget as it's been presented to you, totaling $67.4 million.

248
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,535
Of course, there will be fluidity within that $67.4 million.

249
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:33,316
And we've spoken about that on a number of occasions.

250
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:53,749
And what taking this vote does, it essentially means that once the city council appropriates the funding, provided they appropriate the amount recommended by the mayor, you won't have to keen mean again to adopt that budget because that will take effect based on your vote.

251
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:54,551
tonight.

252
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:56,833
So that's where we are with regard to the process.

253
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:08,001
I will say, as I did my communication to you, should the city council exercise its right to reduce the school department's budget, we would need to reconvene and present to you a new plan, essentially.

254
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:14,005
So the number you're looking at is $67,461,003.

255
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:16,367
That's the operating budget.

256
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,248
Again, there will be fluidity.

257
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:21,071
There will be grants that will come in that will offset some of that.

258
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:28,177
that is expected, but this also builds in the necessary contingencies for unexpected costs.

259
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:34,739
That's particularly true in the area of special education, as we discussed at that committee of the whole and subsequent to that.

260
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:42,581
And also this does provide capacity to address expiring collective bargaining agreements as well.

261
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,061
As you know, we have nine of them.

262
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:49,863
Mayor, I'm gonna pause here to see if there are any questions specific to the operating budget before we go into the ESSER.

263
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:56,358
budget unless you or the committee would like me to continue and move through the proposals with respect to ESSER.

264
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,079
I think you can continue unless anybody has questions.

265
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:07,220
OK, hearing none, I'm going to keep going with ESSER.

266
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:17,502
So our ESSER funding, again, and for the community's benefit, as I know we've discussed this before, but just want to be clear, there are essentially two very significant

267
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:32,590
funding sources derived from the federal legislation designed to ease the burden on municipalities and school districts related to COVID-19 and the disruption that our students have faced over the course of the past two years.

268
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:41,419
The ARPA funding, American Recovery Plan Act, is funding that goes to, in our case, other places as well, but for our case, to the municipality.

269
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,822
Our operating budget includes approximately $3.7 million of ARPA funding.

270
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:59,208
That's money that does not need to go to the schools, but has been recommended by the mayor to the city council to help offset the challenges within our budget and some of the difficulties from a financial perspective that the pandemic has wrought.

271
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,871
The ESSER funding is funding that is earmarked specific to school districts.

272
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:07,052
So the rationale is that

273
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:14,236
school districts have taken on disproportionate burdens and challenges as a result of the pandemic and those instructional disruptions.

274
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:17,718
And so ESSER funding is specific to the school system.

275
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:21,880
And what we're presenting now, and often you'll hear us talk about ESSER I, II, and III.

276
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,881
ESSER I, the funding that was available to us in FY21.

277
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:29,523
ESSER II and ESSER III totaling for Medford's purposes, $7.6 million and extending through FY25.

278
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:29,984
So it's $7.6 million.

279
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:47,158
But as we'll discuss momentarily, that's the intention of the legislation is for that to be funded over the course of the next four fiscal years.

280
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,959
These are typical funding sources.

281
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:56,102
You've seen this slide before, just pointing out the fact that this is a significant variable in our budget, not something that happens every year.

282
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,082
We have to think of it as one-time funding.

283
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:05,305
But as we've discussed many times, we also know that there's an urgency to providing the remedial support that our students need.

284
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:09,238
And that is, those are the things that we have to balance as we build this budget.

285
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:15,182
This slide just details the ESSER I funding and the other external sources that have come in.

286
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:23,007
As you can see, a significant portion of this, we were the beneficiary of a significant amount of external funding.

287
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:32,774
And as you can see here, a significant portion of that went toward our instructional technology, which is why, as we discussed last night with the city council,

288
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:52,458
there's more of a focus on some of our urgent personnel needs because a lot of our infrastructure and the things that we would normally want to invest one-time funds in, we've put a lot of that money toward things like HVAC improvements, infrastructure improvements, and instructional technology to the tune of $2.3 million.

289
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,942
This is a bunch of stuff that you're welcome to read.

290
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:02,066
It's about ESSER II and ESSER III and the priorities as we

291
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,388
look toward the upcoming fiscal years.

292
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:13,315
And this gets into what we're saying now would be our general plan with respect to utilizing this funding.

293
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:28,626
And the rationale here, I'm happy to go into greater detail as we did last night with the city council, but the thinking here is that we know right now students are experiencing a pronounced impact of this disruption that's occurred over the past two years.

294
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,888
We also know that in the second fiscal year,

295
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:47,589
they will both be experiencing the impact caused by the disruption, and we will, because of the investments that we will make through the operating budget and having more tools at our disposal with respect to district-level data and assessments, we'll have a better sense as to where we can target that funding.

296
00:29:47,949 --> 00:30:00,595
And so while ESSER III, at least, is funding that is available to us for the next four fiscal years, we're thinking along the lines of wanting to concentrate the expenditure of those funds in the first two fiscal years

297
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:07,265
because we want to mitigate that impact as rapidly as possible in as sustainable a manner as possible.

298
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:27,453
I do just want to pause here for one second to say, I think that the 35% number in FY22, constituting about $2.1 million, I think there's a chance, maybe even a significant chance, that that will prove to be somewhat inflated.

299
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:32,686
I'm saying that because I would rather you endorse the use of the $2.1 million.

300
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:46,135
And when we report back halfway through the fiscal year or at the end of the fiscal year, we're able to say that because of some shifts, because of capacity in the operating budget, because we were able to fine tune some things, we're only going to spend $1.6 or $1.7 million.

301
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:54,900
That's good in this case because unlike operating funds, the ESSER funding is going to roll over and we're going to have the, it will just expand our capacity in FY23.

302
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,842
Why is it better to spend it in FY23?

303
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:07,107
as opposed to FY22, because in FY23 and FY24, we're going to have better data and more reliable data to say, this is what our students need.

304
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,227
This is where they need it.

305
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,209
This is how they need it, so on and so forth.

306
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:15,933
So this should be very much seen as sort of a very tentative plan of 35, 35, 2010.

307
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:22,978
Very easily could turn into 25, 35, 30, or something along those lines.

308
00:31:23,318 --> 00:31:26,941
I think that just in terms of every time you're budgeting, you can either do it, you know,

309
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:31,119
in a very conservative fashion or not as conservative fashion.

310
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:39,306
And I would say this is a very conservative fashion in terms of wanting to leave ourselves some runway space for the subsequent fiscal years.

311
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,408
So these are the total numbers.

312
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:47,792
I did add that third row there because the district recently received a summer programming grant in the amount of $106,000.

313
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:56,719
With that funding, we're planning literacy and math acceleration academies that will take place in late August.

314
00:31:57,526 --> 00:32:02,647
Students will be invited to participate in that programming and it's something that we're in the process of hiring.

315
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,668
We've discussed this briefly here before.

316
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:17,370
The rate of pay for staff in these acceleration academies by the direction of DESE will be significant as compared to normal summer pay.

317
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:23,411
We've been speaking with our collective bargaining partners and the teachers union about that and wanting to make sure that we're

318
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:35,020
both keeping a focus on equity and also not disincentivizing participation in some of the other programs that don't have this backing and directive behind it.

319
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:51,623
So with regard to the categories broken down, our strategic staffing investments, our professional development training, ensuring that we have an effective expanded school day program to provide that year-long remedial support that we know our students will need

320
00:32:52,063 --> 00:32:54,125
going into the 21-22 school year.

321
00:32:54,545 --> 00:33:03,251
Summer programming, which I just spoke to a moment ago, that, frankly, is one of the numbers that we have 106,000 coming from the DESE grant.

322
00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:09,456
So it's about a $200,000 hit to ESSER as we're looking at it right now.

323
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,978
I think that's going to turn out to be a little high.

324
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:17,001
And I think there's a good chance that the total summer budget will end up being significantly lower than $314,000.

325
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,543
But we just want to make sure that we

326
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:25,725
we're budgeting in a conservative fashion.

327
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:27,606
Supplies and infrastructure.

328
00:33:28,146 --> 00:33:37,450
We have a stockpile of pandemic-related infrastructure that I'm frankly confident is going to last us to the next pandemic.

329
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,911
And I hope that's a very, very long way away.

330
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:46,273
But just for purposes of making sure that our reserves are where they need to be, that's where that is.

331
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:51,175
And then there are some miscellaneous pieces that we just discussed as part of the budget process.

332
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:53,176
I'm gonna walk through these categories again.

333
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:58,559
I'm moving quickly because we've discussed this several times publicly.

334
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:00,480
I'm more than happy to stop.

335
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,901
I'm more than happy to go into detail.

336
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:06,843
I don't want anyone to think that we are rushing through a $2 million expenditure.

337
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:14,928
So with regard to strategic staffing, you heard our presentation regarding the re-engagement specialists.

338
00:34:15,308 --> 00:34:19,430
You know that the reading intervention specialists, one per elementary school was a key budgetary priority.

339
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:30,656
That, along with the instructional coaches that we want to scale up to, were the biggest pieces of reconciling the $760,000 delta that I mentioned a few minutes ago.

340
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:33,017
Behavior specialists, adjustment counselors.

341
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,118
There is an ESSA requirement.

342
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:43,800
It's a very modest requirement, frankly, of a set amount that must be spent on mental health support and coaching for students.

343
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:48,602
We are exceeding that to a very significant

344
00:34:49,752 --> 00:35:05,056
And we're doing it because we're looking to see how do we make sure that the social emotional supports that students need as the foundation of their educational experience are there so that they can make the type of academic progress that the conditions over the course of the past two years have stymied to some degree.

345
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:17,159
With regard to professional development training, there's $164,000 change from the information you received yesterday related to the Hill Literacy Professional Development Program that we're very excited about.

346
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:19,564
for our staff in kindergarten to second grade.

347
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:28,349
These other pieces are professional development and training programs, again, with a heavy focus on SEL that we discussed as part of our priority.

348
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:40,696
It would be my hope that you would see the consistency between the ESSER-based priorities that we're discussing tonight and the budgetary and strategic priorities that we discussed over the course of the budget cycle.

349
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:44,818
With regard to the expanded school day program, many of us

350
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:58,487
believe very strongly from a philosophical perspective and making sure that we have expanded school day and we look at the variables that we have flexibility over and how do we create a well-rounded wraparound environment for our students.

351
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:09,154
There is a urgency to that coming into the 21-22 school year that I think is far exceeds the urgency of any school year any of us have ever worked in.

352
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:14,738
We can't think of school in the normal traditional fashion because our students are coming in

353
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:27,296
with experiences that are not by any stretch of the imagination normal or traditional, and we need to maintain the flexibility to meet students where they are and provide the individualized learning experiences that they need.

354
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:32,578
We are going to spend a good portion of our summer building out our expanded school day program.

355
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:39,021
Does that going to mean one two-hour day at each elementary school or two one-hour days at each elementary school?

356
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:40,801
What does it mean for after-school program?

357
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:42,702
How do we incorporate enrichment programming

358
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:47,008
physical activity along with the literacy math supports that we know students are going to need.

359
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:59,999
These are all questions that the ESSER budget is going to position us along with the time during the summer months to answer and that we'll be prepared to support our students with coming into the new school year.

360
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,504
COVID-related infrastructure, again, we have a lot.

361
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:10,527
We're going to buy more just so that we can maintain some of them.

362
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:11,168
We're going to be

363
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:19,663
Advising the district of some modifications to our public health protocols within the next several days, consistent with changing DESE mandates.

364
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:34,352
There are going to be some pieces like additional sanitation, like sign-in, sign-out sheets, most likely some of the tape in the hallways to keep students and staff from bottlenecking too much.

365
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:41,256
These are things that we're going to put in place both because the pandemic is still technically happening and because we think they're good practices

366
00:37:42,057 --> 00:37:45,098
And in order to do that, we are going to use some of that as our funding.

367
00:37:47,419 --> 00:37:50,000
Summer programming, I thought we already did this.

368
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,300
Did we?

369
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:59,424
We're going to do a bunch of, the summer program, I think we've already touched upon, but we're looking at, typically our summer program consists of extended school year programming.

370
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:04,026
It may be because I've just talked about this so much today that I thought we had already presented on this, so I apologize for that.

371
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:09,508
Our summer programming typically consisting of ESY, extended school year,

372
00:38:10,018 --> 00:38:11,880
summer fun and credit recovery programs.

373
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,623
This year, that is going to be, as well as EL Enrichment Program.

374
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:38,562
This year, that's going to be coupled with Acceleration Academies, Camp Mustang, a program focused for three days at elementary, two days at middle school, one day at high school on social and emotional supports, as well as instrumental band camp being put together to make sure that students who have had some gaps in their music instruction because of how the past year and a half have gone

375
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:41,440
we'll have an opportunity for a two-week intensive program there.

376
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:49,645
We're trying to do this in a coordinated way, make sure that we have appropriate levels of health services support, custodial support, and food services support.

377
00:38:50,806 --> 00:39:01,132
By early July, the general rule will be if you're involved in a Medford Public Schools program, there'll be a nutritional focused snack at 10 a.m.

378
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:05,175
and a lunch to go for all students participating in summer programs or

379
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,941
lunch to stay if your program is continuing into the afternoon.

380
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:16,846
And we're trying to do that in a very coordinated fashion throughout the various weeks in which we have summer programming coming in, in summer 2021.

381
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:33,217
And then some miscellaneous programs in terms of making sure that some of the other pieces that in other situations might have been included in the operating budget, we're able to include in the ESSER budget with the understanding that it's certainly our hope

382
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:48,953
that these pieces, again, we're only talking about $60,000 here, but this is an example of an ESSER funding priority that we're funding for ESSER now with the expectation that in time it'll be incorporated into the operating budget and we'll make it sustainable in order to make sure that that is always the case.

383
00:39:50,353 --> 00:40:00,615
So the total ESSER, again, ESSER 2 or ESSER 3, but my expectation would be, because I think this number is going to turn out to be a little high, I think this will stay within the confines of ESSER 2.

384
00:40:01,262 --> 00:40:12,449
Theoretically, as we go through, if we get additional guidance that narrows the restrictions on use for ESSER 2, theoretically, we could tap into ESSER 3.

385
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:18,433
But I'm, at this point, pretty comfortable that this will stay within the ESSER 2 budget.

386
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:22,196
And the total amount that we'd ask for your endorsement of is $2.1 million and $68,000.

387
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:22,196
$2,168,000.

388
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:22,836
So thank you.

389
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:35,192
for your patience throughout this presentation and several that preceded it and we're happy to take your questions.

390
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,722
Member McLaughlin.

391
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:43,397
Thank you.

392
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:44,658
Thank you for the presentation.

393
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:45,458
It's very helpful.

394
00:40:47,019 --> 00:41:08,331
I'm particularly interested in the summer programming, especially as, you know, I have been talking to a lot of families regarding ESY, ESY for folks who are watching that might not know, the extended school year program is often affiliated with IEPs, students on IEPs or other programming, summer fun, the EL enrichment, the camp Mustang, the SEL supports.

395
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:09,592
I'd like to hear more about that.

396
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:10,693
And then the,

397
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:16,039
the health services, oh no, you're saying health services and what have you will be involved in early July.

398
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:33,486
I'm really curious for both the superintendent and Mr. Murphy, as we're thinking about how we are including all students in these opportunities, both the summer programming and the enrichment programming after school for next year and others.

399
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:39,408
And I know that you said there's 25K for EL and 25K for unified sports to sort of be thinking of

400
00:41:40,328 --> 00:41:55,840
the inclusion opportunities, but out of 2 million, I wanna be thinking about, or I wanna be asking about, how are folks being trained to ensure that our more vulnerable populations are actively participating in these programs?

401
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:02,745
For example, Summer Fund just started receiving training, I think it was about three years ago, from the Special Education Department.

402
00:42:02,765 --> 00:42:07,388
The Summer Fund counseling and staff were receiving training from the,

403
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:20,226
expertise of folks in the special education department to ensure inclusive practice and best practice around both the American with Disabilities Act and also, obviously, you know, IEP supports, what have you.

404
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:47,353
So as we're thinking about these expanded school days, these, you know, wraparound environments, the enrichment programs, I'm wondering how are we thinking about all of those programs being accessible to our students that are most vulnerable from our students who are currently enrolled in access programs to students, you know, with autism to English learners to, you know, all of the above sort of

405
00:42:48,154 --> 00:42:54,120
What is the strategic and proactive plan for making sure that we are truly being an inclusive school district?

406
00:42:54,201 --> 00:43:11,458
As I know that equity is one of our big aces in that we're looking at how our staff is receiving appropriate professional development and training to make sure that these programs are all inclusive so that all families and all students are able to access and be enrolled.

407
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:41,078
Well, the first thing I would just say is that I don't think some of those miscellaneous funding priorities should, I hope no one infers from that that the bulk of the funding is not being geared toward both students with disabilities or English learners or students of any other category or group because all of this funding is about making sure that students in

408
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:50,155
some of those more vulnerable constituencies are being provided with as comprehensive a set of supports as possible.

409
00:43:50,195 --> 00:44:04,281
So I think the first thing to your point with regard to making sure that we're being a fully inclusive district is that if there isn't access to a program, then it shouldn't be on the priority list.

410
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:08,503
It shouldn't be something that's funding because we want to make sure that whether it's

411
00:44:10,155 --> 00:44:26,318
during the school day and it's the reading intervention supports that we're prioritizing or whether it is after the school day, all of this programming is meant to be for all students and it should be accessible to that point.

412
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:35,020
So it's certainly not the case that there's a sort of $25,000 learning environment that's specific to students, to English learner students.

413
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,661
And the idea is that hopefully all students are participating in those programs.

414
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:49,436
it's something we have to be very vigilant about and making sure that as this programming is implemented, it's not being implemented and benefiting some subgroup.

415
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:51,197
I think that, I see Ms.

416
00:44:51,237 --> 00:45:06,945
Galuzzi's hands up, so I'm happy to defer if there's anything specific in the elementary world, but I think the sort of first point has to be that all of this is on a foundation of equity and not something that we're sort of putting in place and then hoping some students with disabilities or English learners or whomever

417
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,376
are able to participate.

418
00:45:08,436 --> 00:45:09,997
The idea is it's for everyone to begin with.

419
00:45:11,238 --> 00:45:11,618
Thank you.

420
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:17,822
And if I may, just as a point of privilege, may I just respond before anyone else, if I might?

421
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,103
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

422
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:20,303
Yes, thank you.

423
00:45:20,404 --> 00:45:26,367
And I appreciate you saying that, Mr. Murphy, and you're always really thoughtful about that.

424
00:45:26,508 --> 00:45:27,768
And I appreciate your response.

425
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:32,351
And I guess my sort of response to that would be with effective training, right?

426
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:34,553
So there needs to be training to make sure that

427
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:36,513
these programs are inclusive.

428
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:45,796
It's one thing to say we're inclusive and everybody can come, but then when you have children who need supports and you show up and their supports aren't there or staff hasn't been trained, it's not really.

429
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:52,578
So, you know, where is this sort of effective, you know, the planned training around how to make sure that these environments are inclusive?

430
00:45:52,618 --> 00:46:01,540
And so I think to just the after school program, there's a lot of times where, you know, families are unfortunately, you know, asked to leave because there's not enough supervision for the child with a disability.

431
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,180
Or I think about

432
00:46:02,623 --> 00:46:10,768
you know, the enrichment programs where the academic enrichment programs, some of these students might be, you know, seventh grade students working on a second grade level.

433
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:17,993
And, you know, there's enrichment opportunities for them too, but there has to be teachers and staff that are trained to be able to do that participating in these programs.

434
00:46:18,033 --> 00:46:23,357
So I'm wondering how we're strategically thinking about that.

435
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:26,399
I think that I'm glad to see that the hearts seem to be there now.

436
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,761
And now I wanna make sure that the minds are there.

437
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:31,763
So the hearts and minds in terms of thinking about this in a way that,

438
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:34,576
we're being thoughtfully inclusive.

439
00:46:34,956 --> 00:46:37,681
I just appreciate someone acknowledging that I have a heart.

440
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:41,907
That doesn't happen always in this role, so I'm going to take that as a plus.

441
00:46:42,288 --> 00:46:42,749
Yeah, well.

442
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,954
I'm sorry, Ms.

443
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:47,817
Guzzieri, I didn't want to cut you off there.

444
00:46:48,442 --> 00:46:59,174
No, no, I was just going to echo what you were saying, Mr. Murphy, and just add, you know, one or two points, which was because you did such a great job, but which was, of course, we're taking the same approach.

445
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:03,719
Um, with camp Mustang, as we will with our other summer camps.

446
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:08,925
And so it is in collaboration with Joan Bowen and the, and the training that she offers the summer fun.

447
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:23,277
In addition, we were very mindful of the week that we picked to run this camp because we wanted to make sure that it was after the ESY programs and the EL programs were completed so that all students would be able to participate in this social emotional camp.

448
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:25,219
Thank you.

449
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:26,120
And may I, Mayor?

450
00:47:27,727 --> 00:47:28,689
just to follow up to that?

451
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,152
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

452
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:36,905
Can you explain to the community camp Mustang and the SEL component or you or Mr. through the chair, either Ms.

453
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:38,368
Galusi or Mr. Murphy, please?

454
00:47:39,391 --> 00:47:40,751
Sure, no problem.

455
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:50,133
Camp Mustang was born out of the need that we know some students are going to need a transitional period back to school.

456
00:47:50,273 --> 00:47:56,655
So for some of our students, they missed 15 months of school working remotely from home.

457
00:47:57,095 --> 00:48:03,316
And so we know that that transition back, just the transition back into a building is going to be a lot for students.

458
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:06,837
So the whole point of Camp Mustang is a social emotional camp

459
00:48:07,477 --> 00:48:12,841
where students can get re-acclimated to their surroundings and working alongside their peers.

460
00:48:13,201 --> 00:48:26,151
So it's going to be activities that are school-based and using all of the locations within the building so that you may be playing in the gymnasium to remind them of what that is like in that space.

461
00:48:26,192 --> 00:48:27,693
We'll be eating in the cafeteria.

462
00:48:28,193 --> 00:48:30,214
We'll be doing scavenger hunts throughout the building.

463
00:48:30,234 --> 00:48:32,475
We'll be doing team building, collaborative.

464
00:48:33,315 --> 00:48:38,557
It will start at the elementary level with a morning meeting, which is how we start the day every day.

465
00:48:38,657 --> 00:48:45,479
So just to build in those routines and locations to just help ease their transition back to school.

466
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,360
Thank you.

467
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,362
And if I could also just ask how parents or how families engage in that process.

468
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:58,782
Sure, I had sent an update to all current families last week.

469
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:06,728
I mentioned the summer offerings and I had said that more information about signing up will be coming out at the beginning of July.

470
00:49:12,472 --> 00:49:12,953
Member Kretz?

471
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:15,097
Yes, thank you.

472
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:17,259
And thank you for the presentation, Mr. Murphy.

473
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:25,604
And I just wanted to say I did watch most of the city council meeting last night until I fell asleep in the middle of the meeting.

474
00:49:25,984 --> 00:49:28,085
But everybody did a great job.

475
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:29,086
The questions were great.

476
00:49:29,106 --> 00:49:30,146
The answers were great.

477
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:40,593
And so I'm getting to the email that you sent us this afternoon with the color-coded itemized budgetary

478
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:48,316
The memo where you have everything shaded in light green or dark green, and then there's some light blue.

479
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:54,839
So I just wanted to ask if you could touch on that memo that you sent us.

480
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:03,743
And I noticed that there were some things here that are still listed as discretionary or necessary.

481
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:06,704
Some items are funded.

482
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:10,106
Would you be able to just give an overview of that memo?

483
00:50:12,303 --> 00:50:15,665
I'm just, if it's okay, Mayor, I'm just gonna share my screen very quickly.

484
00:50:15,685 --> 00:50:23,749
I think typically I don't spend a lot of time using the, the memo usually doesn't serve as a good visual, but in this case, it might be helpful.

485
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:35,494
So in June of 2020, going into fiscal year 21, the school committee conveyed as part of its budget process, an itemized list of funding priorities.

486
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:41,117
Earlier in this budget cycle, you asked the administration to take that memo

487
00:50:41,593 --> 00:50:52,021
and identify, excerpted from that memo, identify what has been funded or what will be funded as part of the proposed FY21 budget, excuse me, FY22 budget.

488
00:50:52,381 --> 00:51:07,572
And so if you go through this memo, you can see this is the actual list excerpted, and dark green indicates something that is, whether it's through ESSER or through the operating budget, we anticipate funding in FY22.

489
00:51:08,113 --> 00:51:10,614
Light green, like the Chromebooks and the,

490
00:51:11,698 --> 00:51:18,223
laptops for teachers are items that we were able to fund through funding sources in FY21.

491
00:51:18,383 --> 00:51:35,457
And the light blue, of which there's only a few items, indicates, and as I said in the memo, this is a pretty lengthy list, and there's a few items that they're either the price tag or the description are a little different than what we would probably articulate now.

492
00:51:35,998 --> 00:51:41,222
And so I probably wouldn't want to submit this document under oath,

493
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:52,197
frankly, but it's a pretty accurate summary of what was funded or what was adjusted as we went through FY 21 and prepared for FY 22.

494
00:51:52,517 --> 00:52:05,008
So the light blue, for instance, is an example of where a modification was made, where I'm just seeing one from my office right in front of me here, where there was a desire for two accounting specialists.

495
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:08,911
We hired one very high caliber accounting specialist and

496
00:52:10,629 --> 00:52:13,511
That's a modification that was made just to indicate that.

497
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,132
And there's a few other instances.

498
00:52:16,252 --> 00:52:26,259
The 340 access points we funded, I think it was like 70, but I could be wrong about that.

499
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:34,624
A significant investment was made in FY21, and additional access points, additional access points are planned in FY22.

500
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:39,086
So if we were to go back to this now and make a list of priorities,

501
00:52:42,222 --> 00:52:48,844
we wouldn't have a $340,000 price tag associated with it, but it would still be something that eventually we have to pursue.

502
00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:53,306
So this is just, again, I provided this just in response to the committee's question.

503
00:52:53,646 --> 00:52:57,228
There are some items here that, as you can see, we have not yet invested in.

504
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:06,471
And some of these, I think, as you obviously, we noted a difference in the scrubbing of the budget between June 1st and June 14th, 2021.

505
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:18,125
So you can imagine that between June 29th, 2020 and June 24th, 2021, there were a number of priorities that we would likely think differently on if we were to make this list today.

506
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:31,114
And so, you know, this is a great list in terms of something that we're able to keep track of at all times and understand sort of where the budget process is sort of a continuing narrative.

507
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:34,997
But this is just to give you a sense as to where we are

508
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:39,210
looking back on the list that was generated at the end of FY20.

509
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:42,293
I hope it's helpful.

510
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,134
Yes, thank you very much.

511
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,276
Thank you for the clarification.

512
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:50,180
Member van de Kloop?

513
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:53,843
Yes, thank you.

514
00:53:54,724 --> 00:53:59,748
First, I did want to thank the team, those who presented yesterday to the City Council.

515
00:54:00,774 --> 00:54:09,102
Thank you for representing us so well and answering all the questions that were brought to you last night.

516
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:11,965
I just want to go back to Suzanne.

517
00:54:12,225 --> 00:54:19,792
When you were talking about the camp, sort of reintroducing kids back to school and whatever, what are the numbers that you

518
00:54:20,998 --> 00:54:23,283
Anticipate, how many kids can you accommodate?

519
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:31,802
I would hope that everybody who wants to go gets to go, but I wanted to understand how you're facing that.

520
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,421
But that absolutely is our hope.

521
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:41,967
That's, that's the whole purpose of the camp is for students and families that feel students would benefit from this experience.

522
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:51,473
So, um, once we send out the, uh, signup forms, we'll have a better sense as to how to adjust staffing and what the groupings will look like.

523
00:54:51,894 --> 00:55:00,100
But I mean, we want to keep the specific groups, um, to a manageable number, but then that would just mean bringing on some staff, some additional staff.

524
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,280
So.

525
00:55:01,287 --> 00:55:03,168
We'll just wait and see what the enrollment looks like.

526
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:04,728
Okay, thank you.

527
00:55:04,748 --> 00:55:11,411
Thank you.

528
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:16,932
If there's no further questions, we have one more item on our agenda, executive session.

529
00:55:17,293 --> 00:55:29,557
Mayor, if you could just take a vote to adopt the budget contingent upon the city council's appropriation and if the committee would be willing to offer a vote for endorsing the ESSER priorities

530
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:31,683
would be appreciated as well.

531
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:33,464
OK, is there a motion on the floor?

532
00:55:33,484 --> 00:55:36,525
I take a motion to adopt the budget proposal.

533
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:37,565
Second.

534
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:41,947
Motion to adopt by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Cranston van de Kloet.

535
00:55:43,087 --> 00:55:43,808
Roll call, please.

536
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,669
Can I just ask a question real quick?

537
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:47,309
Oh, sorry.

538
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:55,912
Does the motion include both the budget recommendation as outlined and the ESSER funds?

539
00:55:56,672 --> 00:55:58,453
Are we taking one vote on both?

540
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:00,979
Member McLaughlin, is that your- I've been splitting it.

541
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,400
Sorry, Chair.

542
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,621
Oh, you would like to split it?

543
00:56:04,681 --> 00:56:13,565
Okay, so we will take the recommendation on the budget first as approved, motioned by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

544
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:15,025
Roll call on the budget.

The budget is adopted.

561
00:56:39,049 --> 00:56:44,993
Is there a motion on the floor to approve the spending of the ESSER funds as recommended by the administration?

562
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:49,316
Member Kratz.

563
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:50,076
Second.

564
00:56:50,436 --> 00:56:52,057
Motion to approve.

565
00:56:52,097 --> 00:56:53,338

00:57:38,553 --> 00:57:50,025

589
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:59,612
as well as to conduct a collective bargaining strategy session on the basis that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the litigating and bargaining positions of the Memphis School Committee.
