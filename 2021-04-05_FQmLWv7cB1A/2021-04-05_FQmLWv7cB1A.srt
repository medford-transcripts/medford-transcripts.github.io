00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,160

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure Dr. Cushing is going to put us into rooms accordingly.

25
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:41,483

28
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:52,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the superintendent's trying to unmute.

29
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:57,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make her call, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:58,206 --> 00:02:58,767

00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:00,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edwards-Benton, you should be set.

32
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:07,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everyone.

33
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,218
[SPEAKER_14]: This evening, we're joining today for our roundtables.

34
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:14,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry I have it on two devices.

35
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Just give me a moment.

36
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to just give a breakout for today's sessions.

37
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:36,380
[SPEAKER_14]: We will be having an elementary school session, a middle school session, high school, and a special education session, and four language groups.

38
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Those language groups are Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Spanish.

39
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:54,042
[SPEAKER_14]: In each language group, we will have specific translators who will support those groups.

40
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:58,043
[SPEAKER_14]: So for Portuguese, we have Genevieve Young.

41
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:01,323
[SPEAKER_14]: For Haitian Creole, we have Mr. Raul Bonbon.

42
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,304
[SPEAKER_14]: For Arabic, we have Mai Abusan.

43
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:12,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And for Spanish, we have Mr. Paul Textera, who will be supporting us.

44
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:14,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're freezing.

45
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:16,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Facilitators.

46
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,949
[SPEAKER_06]: We missed that, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, you froze.

47
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,954
[SPEAKER_06]: After you announced all four interpreters.

48
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:28,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, frozen again.

49
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

50
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we can.

51
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

52
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:37,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Were people able to hear the four language groups or?

53
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:39,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you got cut off right after that.

54
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:48,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, for elementary, we have member Graham and Mayor Lungo-Koehn, with Ms.

55
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:51,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Suzanne Galusi supporting the elementary group.

56
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,785
[SPEAKER_14]: For middle school, we have Ms.

57
00:04:53,865 --> 00:05:00,487
[SPEAKER_14]: member Rousseau and member Mustone, with Dr. Riccadeli supporting middle schools.

58
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:07,793
[SPEAKER_14]: For high school, we have member Krutz and member Van der Kloot with Dr. Cushing supporting high school.

59
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:15,300
[SPEAKER_14]: And for special education today, we have member McLaughlin and Ms.

60
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:20,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Susanna Campbell, who will be supporting special education.

61
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:29,893
[SPEAKER_14]: So those will be the eight respective groups, and we will be focusing in on the three questions related to vision and mission.

62
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:45,045
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanted to say that all of this work that's happening today was birthed out of the work for the strategic planning and communication subcommittee group, which is chaired by member Graham.

63
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,408
[SPEAKER_14]: But this today's roundtable convening

64
00:05:50,229 --> 00:06:06,636
[SPEAKER_14]: is to push those conversations about the mission and vision and have members of the community be able to weigh in on the strategic planning work that we have been doing and the full participation of the entire school committee group.

65
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:16,360
[SPEAKER_14]: So I look forward to today's session and I wanna thank all the administrators that have signed up to be scribes and timekeepers

66
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,341
[SPEAKER_14]: to support all of the respective groups today.

67
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,721
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to thank them in advance as well.

68
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:25,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

69
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:27,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

70
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:46,327
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, ladies and gentlemen, I have assigned, I believe, all of the appropriate people for our groups, meaning our translators as well as our

71
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,203
[SPEAKER_04]: scribes and facilitators and school committee members to the groups.

72
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:56,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna open the rooms now for the parents and other people on the call.

73
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:08,898
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be able to, if you have the most up-to-date or recent update to Zoom, you should be able to self-select into the rooms once I open the rooms, all right?

74
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:09,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

75
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:14,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Could the interpreters introduce themselves and tell them which room they're going to?

76
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that would be awesome, and thank you very much for that hiccup.

77
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:24,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Teixeira, if you want to go first, which room will you be in?

78
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:25,273
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are?

79
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:28,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, what room will I be in?

80
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:36,118
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be in the Spanish room, which I think is room eight.

81
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:37,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Eight, OK.

82
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Buenas noches.

83
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Si alguien necesita interpretacion en espanol, elija numero ocho.

84
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:44,763
[SPEAKER_17]: May?

85
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing, do you have an idea what room am I going to be in?

86
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be Arabic room seven.

87
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:53,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Bonbon, you're muted.

88
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:22,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the room number I'll be in?

89
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:23,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Room six.

90
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

91
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

92
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:27,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go ahead.

93
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:28,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing.

94
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:28,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

95
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:29,304
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.

96
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:30,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's room five.

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

101
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,561
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, rooms are opening now.

102
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:58,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I also ask, may I ask a question?

103
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

104
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:20,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

105
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:31,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we also just keep a record of how many people are in each of the rooms in terms of respondents for all of the different divisions so we know what kind of demographics we're getting?

106
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:34,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

107
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:34,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

108
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't seem to be able to pick a room.

109
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,475
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not finding that I can do that.

110
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:09,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in elementary school.

111
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Sarah, you'd like to go to elementary?

112
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:11,897

113
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:12,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:14,139
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't either, Peter.

115
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Diane Guarino, I can't get in either.

116
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,242
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Diane, we'll get you in there in a second.

117
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:21,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:27,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

121
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:29,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start with Sarah Cohen.

122
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm going to start with Diane Guarino.

123
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:32,532

129
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:50,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I also can't choose, please.

130
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,227
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you got it, Roger.

131
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:55,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Polk, I'm going to send you to high school.

137
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:09,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So Fernald, where would you like to go?

138
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:09,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

152
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:47,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything's fine.

153
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:52,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Bloch, would you mind going to room four?

154
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:54,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no problem.

155
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

156
00:11:55,731 --> 00:12:01,677
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was just checking just to see if everyone was placed and it looks like they probably were.

157
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:03,978
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I'm going to head back.

158
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:08,120
[SPEAKER_01]: If I leave, will that put me back in the same room, or Peter, do you have to put me back?

159
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,381
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're already there.

160
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if you click the breakout rooms down on the bottom, it should go.

161
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:15,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

162
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:17,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter, am I in a room?

163
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Susie, you are not assigned yet.

164
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:21,766
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

165
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:23,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Where would you like to go?

166
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wherever you need a scribe.

167
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:26,728
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it's room one.

168
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:34,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So Craig is Craig's in the room number four.

169
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:37,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to join up room number two middle if that's fine with everyone.

170
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:38,055
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no scribe.

171
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:39,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks.

172
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:44,658
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

173
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think Farsner is actually in a room elsewhere under another account.

174
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:54,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you're aware.

175
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:03,545
[SPEAKER_16]: could we put the fires that's here in that room as well?

176
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:07,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a sign, but I think they have to click on their end as well.

177
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:17,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Murphy, what room would you like to be assigned to?

178
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:21,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm a little curious, like what have I not done?

179
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:23,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Peter did not have the button just at the bottom of the screen.

180
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:26,499
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably just need to update your Zoom

181
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:31,506
[SPEAKER_04]: that's downloaded on your desktop to the most recent version.

182
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:33,667
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

183
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And to just re-download Zoom?

184
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:36,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

185
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,549
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

186
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,730
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go into your settings, it might say, like, update.

187
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I, myself, haven't done it on one of my computers, so.

188
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:45,733
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

189
00:13:46,353 --> 00:13:48,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you throw me in the middle school for the time being?

190
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:56,838
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm, like, working on something else at the same time, but I'll listen to it as closely as I can.

191
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:57,618
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it.

192
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:06,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks a lot.

193
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:07,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Vincent, where would you like to go?

194
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:12,278
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I have access to the ones I just was checking to see where I should go support.

195
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,700
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will.

196
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to just move into one of the rooms right now.

197
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to high school.

198
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:20,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

199
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello Pixel 3 and Stephanie McCann.

200
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,907
[SPEAKER_04]: We have multiple rooms open right now.

201
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:29,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Elementary, middle school, high school, special education, as well as some rooms for translation.

202
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a preference for which room you would like to go into?

203
00:29:36,494 --> 00:29:36,894
[SPEAKER_12]: High school.

204
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,650
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're good to go.

205
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And pixel three are you there.

206
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:07,770
[SPEAKER_04]: pixel three.

207
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:13,202
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll be back in a few minutes to check.

208
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:15,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize if you have to wait.

209
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:17,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're gone.

210
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:18,065
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

211
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:35,395
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, my kids.

212
01:01:51,764 --> 01:01:52,784
[SPEAKER_14]: So good afternoon.

213
01:01:52,844 --> 01:01:56,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope all groups were able to come back in.

214
01:01:56,406 --> 01:02:02,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I was able to jump into every room for a little bit of time.

215
01:02:02,388 --> 01:02:07,650
[SPEAKER_14]: There were wonderful conversations, rich topics that were being shared.

216
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:16,053
[SPEAKER_14]: And at this point in time, we really would like to just give the different groupings an opportunity to share.

217
01:02:16,173 --> 01:02:17,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Some groups were able to,

218
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:39,551
[SPEAKER_14]: come up with draft versions of draft revisions that they want to be able to share out and I think it'll be a rich experience for all of us to be able to listen to the feedback from our different groups.

219
01:02:41,673 --> 01:02:43,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I did not go into

220
01:02:46,292 --> 01:03:05,441
[SPEAKER_14]: all of our groupings just yet, but I just wanted to be able to take this opportunity to hear a little bit from each group.

221
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:06,982
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'm going to ask

222
01:03:10,155 --> 01:03:12,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have us start with special education.

223
01:03:12,817 --> 01:03:23,126
[SPEAKER_14]: If special education member McLaughlin's group could just report out, give us an overview.

224
01:03:23,186 --> 01:03:24,568
[SPEAKER_14]: We have about 24 minutes.

225
01:03:24,628 --> 01:03:30,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to try to do three minutes per group and see if you can share out

226
01:03:32,856 --> 01:03:44,331
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, a key highlight or a suggestion that your particular group had to support this work around mission and vision statements.

227
01:03:45,132 --> 01:03:45,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin.

228
01:03:46,893 --> 01:03:47,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, thank you.

229
01:03:49,475 --> 01:03:59,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So we talked a lot about sort of, you know, in the sort of language of IEP actually, what are the measurable benchmarks, current performance level, right?

230
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:15,494
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, knowing what our current performance level is, you know, based on this mission and vision, and we expect to go with measurable benchmarks and how the data is actually going to demonstrate that was a big part of our conversation.

231
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:32,200
[SPEAKER_05]: and having some more specificity around, you know, what sort of some of these, how do you define, you know, what it means to be successful in the 21st century, you know, and also that we're sort of thinking about when we say all students, what does that mean?

232
01:04:32,221 --> 01:04:35,344
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, students regardless of ability, background, ethnicity, et cetera.

233
01:04:36,004 --> 01:04:37,985
[SPEAKER_05]: So being more specific in the wording.

234
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:56,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we talked a lot about the partnerships that we've really appreciated in this past year with the pandemic and being able to see what's actually happening in schools and teachers really relying on parents and vice versa and us being able to appreciate what they're doing and be included in what our children are learning has been really valuable.

235
01:04:56,273 --> 01:04:58,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything anyone else from the group would like to add?

236
01:05:04,771 --> 01:05:06,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, great job member McLaughlin.

237
01:05:06,752 --> 01:05:09,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Up next.

238
01:05:09,374 --> 01:05:11,035
[SPEAKER_14]: High school had a draft.

239
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:28,708
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you can screen share that, but I would like for the group to see the possible draft that was shared with some different wording and just do high school, middle, and then elementary has a lot of suggestions as well for the group.

240
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Cushing, you might have the chat.

241
01:05:37,055 --> 01:05:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not see a member band includes version member band include put that in the chat.

242
01:05:43,353 --> 01:06:04,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me, I put it in the chat, but I think it said, Medford Public Schools provide safe and equitable learning environments that fosters academic success, personal growth, positive relationships, civic responsibility, adaptability and resiliency for all our students.

243
01:06:07,538 --> 01:06:12,619
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of our conversation was about, there was nothing wrong with the vision statement as written, but it was,

244
01:06:14,644 --> 01:06:17,025
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, tended towards to be too encompassing.

245
01:06:17,085 --> 01:06:25,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, a lot of our discussion really was, we really liked one from Boston, Paul, every student, every day.

246
01:06:25,689 --> 01:06:26,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

247
01:06:27,189 --> 01:06:27,489
[SPEAKER_13]: You know.

248
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:41,115
[SPEAKER_09]: We should know that one from BPS, but I think we were looking for that, that taking our mission statement and sort of making it into that catchphrase so that even if you're a new community member, you know,

249
01:06:41,795 --> 01:06:51,638
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, Boston Public Schools, every student, every day, which means like, we're here for our students every single day, no matter what the timeframe is, whatever they need.

250
01:06:52,298 --> 01:06:56,399
[SPEAKER_09]: So even parsing that down, so that's like our catch layer.

251
01:06:56,419 --> 01:07:02,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I even said, Maurice, too, like in your emails, you always write, in partnership with children.

252
01:07:03,581 --> 01:07:07,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So those kinds of things we need to kind of whittle down a little bit so we have our,

253
01:07:08,271 --> 01:07:11,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford Public Schools catchphrase that we can all utilize.

254
01:07:13,472 --> 01:07:19,315
[SPEAKER_13]: So the one that I read, what we were really talking about is what key phrases came up.

255
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:31,240
[SPEAKER_13]: And we had a discussion about how important the school environment, how it had become clear this year that the school environment was so important in nurturing our kids.

256
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:36,782
[SPEAKER_13]: And we talked about equity, and we talked about adaptability and resilience.

257
01:07:36,822 --> 01:07:41,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were just trying to incorporate some of those key concepts, I think.

258
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,247
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, the shorter the better in so many ways.

259
01:07:48,428 --> 01:07:48,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

260
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:49,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

261
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:54,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that I when I when I saw the.

262
01:07:56,578 --> 01:07:57,978
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, how you worded it.

263
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:03,380
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we get to elementary, member Graham will be able to, you know, kind of report out.

264
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:14,583
[SPEAKER_14]: But one of the things I know specifically calling out critical thinkers or social emotional learning, different pieces like that, but to look at what we have and what your group worked on.

265
01:08:14,903 --> 01:08:23,485
[SPEAKER_14]: And right now we're gonna just, if it's okay, member Graham, unless another member of the group wants to speak, I was gonna quickly transition to member Rousseau.

266
01:08:23,925 --> 01:08:43,875
[SPEAKER_14]: to report out on middle schools, but I really appreciate just, you know, the creative thinking, the ideas, the suggestions, so that we're able to, you know, take all of this information and really work it into something that's relevant to everyone today in 2021.

267
01:08:45,376 --> 01:08:45,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

268
01:08:47,517 --> 01:08:49,198
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll go next then, I guess, right?

269
01:08:49,218 --> 01:08:50,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you were saying?

270
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:51,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

271
01:08:52,938 --> 01:08:53,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

272
01:08:53,358 --> 01:08:55,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had a great conversation, of course.

273
01:08:56,419 --> 01:08:59,139
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a few things that I'm gonna touch on.

274
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:09,061
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a serious discussion around whether the mission and the vision statements deserve to be split, that there's an actual different use case for the two different statements.

275
01:09:10,141 --> 01:09:14,522
[SPEAKER_11]: And there were a number of people seem to be in agreement with that.

276
01:09:16,462 --> 01:09:21,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the ACEs do not seem to actually, they seem to be completely absent from the current statement.

277
01:09:22,383 --> 01:09:29,028
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only four aces, so it feels like we should be able to get all four of them in some way into the mission or the vision or both.

278
01:09:30,889 --> 01:09:43,457
[SPEAKER_11]: We, a number of us, we had interesting conversation around 21st century education, and there seemed to be a consensus, I would say, that spelling out what we mean by that is important.

279
01:09:44,998 --> 01:09:50,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we don't need a 700 word mission statement, but that that,

280
01:09:51,294 --> 01:09:59,337
[SPEAKER_11]: that phraseology doesn't really mean anything to anybody who isn't an educator and hasn't spent any time looking it up.

281
01:10:00,758 --> 01:10:09,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we had three words in the current statement, which I think it was just three, that need more conversation.

282
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:11,742
[SPEAKER_11]: One was the word contributors.

283
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:18,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one was reached, which felt very kind of like you're finished.

284
01:10:18,384 --> 01:10:19,985
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very like end of life,

285
01:10:20,832 --> 01:10:22,913
[SPEAKER_11]: not early in life where our students are.

286
01:10:23,873 --> 01:10:30,175
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the word fostering in the ACEs feels very unmeasurable and vague.

287
01:10:31,316 --> 01:10:36,138
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a lot of other notes, but I'll, I probably used my three minutes.

288
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:37,058
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

289
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Could I ask a question, member Rousseau?

290
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:54,673
[SPEAKER_14]: When you said fostering felt vague, was there another word that your group said they felt would better capture the feeling?

291
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:57,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Just so I can report that.

292
01:10:57,494 --> 01:10:58,654
[SPEAKER_11]: There was not a better word.

293
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:08,277
[SPEAKER_11]: It felt, I brought this thing up, but it was, we could say we offered something, but that doesn't mean it's really available to everybody.

294
01:11:09,091 --> 01:11:14,772
[SPEAKER_11]: So fostering, at the end of the day, literally nobody could take advantage of something.

295
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:25,634
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we fostered that, the goal isn't to say we as the professionals made something available, it's that it actually was delivered or received.

296
01:11:26,154 --> 01:11:28,534
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I don't think we had a better word.

297
01:11:28,974 --> 01:11:38,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember a better word coming up, but that word fostering felt a very kind of, it didn't feel like we were taking responsibility for delivering on the goal.

298
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:40,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

299
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:42,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that clarification.

300
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:46,694
[SPEAKER_14]: That's very helpful as we go back to the drawing board.

301
01:11:48,495 --> 01:11:51,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there anyone else from the middle school team that wanted to speak?

302
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:55,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

303
01:11:55,675 --> 01:12:03,599
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna pass now to member Graham for her to speak with the elementary school on behalf of the elementary school group.

304
01:12:04,139 --> 01:12:09,842
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we will go to the language specific groups after that.

305
01:12:10,342 --> 01:12:11,223
[SPEAKER_14]: So member Graham.

306
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:17,849
[SPEAKER_12]: So we actually had a good conversation about a number of things.

307
01:12:17,949 --> 01:12:21,112
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think, you know, overwhelmingly the participants in our group.

308
01:12:22,133 --> 01:12:31,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Had a lot of passion at the elementary school level around making the after school programming more available to all those families who need it.

309
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:33,203
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, I thought one person.

310
01:12:33,962 --> 01:12:46,228
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of said that, you know, I'll sort of know we're making progress when, as a working parent, I can send my child to NPS and they can have after-school care.

311
01:12:46,268 --> 01:12:51,131
[SPEAKER_12]: That is what, like, being able to access any of this statement means to me, which I thought was really

312
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:52,912
[SPEAKER_12]: compelling.

313
01:12:53,553 --> 01:13:04,465
[SPEAKER_12]: We did talk a lot about the 21st century comment being really abstract, and we went on to talk about the notion of wanting

314
01:13:06,868 --> 01:13:22,472
[SPEAKER_12]: to ensure that we are creating critical thinkers, which is really sort of, I think we're at the beginning of that either success or failure really being very evident in our society.

315
01:13:22,552 --> 01:13:30,715
[SPEAKER_12]: So being able to understand what is real, what is not, how to really critically think about the world around you,

316
01:13:32,015 --> 01:13:39,002
[SPEAKER_12]: When people are being truthful or frankly they're not, which is I think the really scary part of like looking forward for me anyway.

317
01:13:39,022 --> 01:13:53,335
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also we also talked about the fact that the education that we provide itself needs to be drawn from a diverse set of skills and backgrounds and I think that really taps into.

318
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:14,210
[SPEAKER_12]: thoughts for me anyway about ensuring that our curricula are up to date and are rigorous and can be accessed by all of our students, but also that they are reflecting our current knowledge and thinking across the world and across the profession.

319
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:18,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thought that was all like really, really good commentary.

320
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:21,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought a couple of other things that came up a couple of times is that,

321
01:14:23,775 --> 01:14:30,859
[SPEAKER_12]: There was an overwhelming comment about the plan feeling sort of incomplete at the moment.

322
01:14:31,059 --> 01:14:38,702
[SPEAKER_12]: So just trying to kind of connect the dots of all the components and the one pager and like

323
01:14:39,102 --> 01:14:43,984
[SPEAKER_12]: what that really looks like as it comes to life and a lot of questions around that.

324
01:14:44,584 --> 01:15:04,110
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think the other conversation that we had that I thought was really excellent was around how do we measure that we're making progress and in sort of on the like contrasting side of measurement a feeling that just because it can't be quantified doesn't mean it should

325
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:25,347
[SPEAKER_12]: uh not be prioritized so in other words there's a lot of things that are very hard to measure about what we do in public school systems and just because we can't put a number to it doesn't mean it doesn't deserve prioritization so that we really have our work cut out for us as we as we think about

326
01:15:26,308 --> 01:15:36,437
[SPEAKER_12]: how to critically evaluate things that are quantifiable and things that are not quantifiable and be able to prioritize across that set of topics.

327
01:15:38,752 --> 01:15:56,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think the other comment that I heard, which I think is important is, you know, we haven't ever had meetings like this, you know, pre a year ago, and that Zoom has really enabled us in a different way than we were able to take advantage of before.

328
01:15:56,739 --> 01:16:05,982
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, certainly when you talk about the number of working parents, whether they're on the call tonight, or they come to our meetings, that that was a pretty important thing.

329
01:16:07,345 --> 01:16:10,808
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think that was it.

330
01:16:10,968 --> 01:16:13,150
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that those were like the biggest things.

331
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Did I miss anything, Mayor?

332
01:16:18,594 --> 01:16:20,035
[SPEAKER_06]: You covered everything very well.

333
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:26,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe just the one thing I thought would be a great addition is somebody, I think Ms.

334
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:34,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Cohen mentioned when you talk about school, family and community as it relates to meetings and the word engage or engagement.

335
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:38,532
[SPEAKER_06]: is, I think, important because we want to keep people engaged.

336
01:16:39,272 --> 01:16:41,674
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, you covered it perfectly.

337
01:16:46,196 --> 01:16:46,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that.

338
01:16:47,317 --> 01:16:54,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually had one probing question I was going to ask member Graham when I was just jotting a few notes when you were talking about

339
01:16:57,313 --> 01:17:01,497
[SPEAKER_14]: how we're measuring progress and things that are quantifiable and things that are not.

340
01:17:01,657 --> 01:17:17,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know, because I may have left that room at the time, if you had a concrete example of something that was quantifiable and something that was not, just so that we could continue to work on that.

341
01:17:19,524 --> 01:17:20,945
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually didn't get that far.

342
01:17:20,985 --> 01:17:22,105
[SPEAKER_12]: We ran out of time.

343
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:33,328
[SPEAKER_12]: But the thing that immediately sort of came to my mind is this notion of, you know, with MCAS, you can measure.

344
01:17:33,788 --> 01:17:34,608
[SPEAKER_12]: You have numbers.

345
01:17:35,308 --> 01:17:40,230
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really easy to prioritize things that get tied to numbers.

346
01:17:42,440 --> 01:18:02,552
[SPEAKER_12]: And in contrast, something like the fine arts that don't attach themselves to an MCAS score so directly and like really figuring out how do you weigh the balance of math and fine arts is I think an example that sort of my wheels started turning as we were talking about it.

347
01:18:04,011 --> 01:18:06,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that clarification.

348
01:18:06,694 --> 01:18:16,184
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a great example to help us, you know, just think about, cause I wanted to at least be able to bring that back to the larger group.

349
01:18:16,824 --> 01:18:17,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

350
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:22,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor, I see member McLaughlin has her hand up.

351
01:18:23,371 --> 01:18:24,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin.

352
01:18:25,017 --> 01:18:25,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

353
01:18:25,517 --> 01:18:43,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just regarding the data, which is also what the special education subgroup was saying is that, you know, the quantifiable piece is also, you know, again, you could say MCAS scores, but also getting back to that all students, how are we disaggregating the data by subgroups, right?

354
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we're looking at, you know, how all students are doing, if we're looking at quantifiable data, how are we doing that around subgroups and reporting that out so that we're thinking about all students?

355
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:54,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

356
01:18:55,561 --> 01:18:55,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

357
01:18:55,821 --> 01:18:58,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, ma'am McLaughlin as well.

358
01:18:59,544 --> 01:19:18,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Mary, I wanted to say I did just communicate with Mr. Texera and for today's session, we did not have EL participation in the language groups, but tomorrow, again, is another opportunity from 6 to 7.30 p.m.

359
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,661
[SPEAKER_14]: for families to be able to jump on and

360
01:19:23,062 --> 01:19:36,550
[SPEAKER_14]: give us another opportunity to have this conversation so that we can gather the data and information and feedback in order to work on, you know, having

361
01:19:37,127 --> 01:19:43,451
[SPEAKER_14]: this living, breathing strategic plan that will continue to help us guide the work that we're doing.

362
01:19:44,012 --> 01:20:05,867
[SPEAKER_14]: We're doing the work and member Graham, you did a great job explaining it in the elementary group, just about why, the why behind a strategic plan and how it really allows a district to have all of their work, kind of the work that's pushing us and moving us forward housed in one place.

363
01:20:06,926 --> 01:20:11,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a critically important document for us to have.

364
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:15,749
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a requirement of the new superintendent's induction program.

365
01:20:16,389 --> 01:20:20,890
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it is something that we look forward to finalizing.

366
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:26,032
[SPEAKER_14]: But even as we say, finalizing that document, it's a living, breathing document.

367
01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:29,153
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's never in its final phases.

368
01:20:29,213 --> 01:20:32,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It can kind of continue to change and grow and evolve.

369
01:20:33,634 --> 01:20:35,835
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanna just thank

370
01:20:37,015 --> 01:20:59,189
[SPEAKER_14]: all the parents who are on the call today to give their feedback and share their concerns, share their feedback, give us information so that we can take it, bring it back to the larger group and work on making revisions and improving our strategic plan.

371
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:02,110
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to thank everyone who's on the call tonight.

372
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:03,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

373
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and thank you all for joining us.

374
01:21:08,511 --> 01:21:10,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion?

375
01:21:11,592 --> 01:21:17,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, actually, I was pointing, we did not end up doing the roll at the beginning, so I didn't know if you wanted to do that now.

376
01:21:19,934 --> 01:21:20,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

377
01:21:21,535 --> 01:21:22,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

378
01:21:26,176 --> 01:21:26,356

[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

381
01:21:30,137 --> 01:21:31,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, present.

382

[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

383
01:21:36,315 --> 01:21:37,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe she's with us tonight.

384
01:21:38,236 --> 01:21:38,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

385
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:40,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, here.

386
01:21:42,418 --> 01:21:43,239

[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

388
01:21:48,182 --> 01:21:49,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm present, so that's six present.

389
01:21:49,662 --> 01:21:50,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry, Mayor.

390
01:21:51,563 --> 01:21:52,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And one absent.

391
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:55,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, thank you all for joining us.

392
01:21:55,165 --> 01:22:00,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomorrow's will be actually 6 to 7.30, a little bit different time.

393
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:04,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So 6 to 7 30, same three questions.

394
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:05,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Please feel free to join us again.

395
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:09,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we'll have additional guardians and parents, but thank you.

396
01:22:09,772 --> 01:22:10,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great night, everybody.

397
