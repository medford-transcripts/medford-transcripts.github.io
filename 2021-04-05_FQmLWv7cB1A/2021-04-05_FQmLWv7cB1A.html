    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=159.662s">Are</a>  we going to have an initial introduction?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=170.765s">It</a>  looks like the superintendent's trying to unmute.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=186.593s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=189.716s">This</a>  evening, we're joining today for our roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=192.298s">I'm</a>  sorry I have it on two devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=195.641s">Just</a>  give me a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=198.57s">I</a>  wanted to just give a breakout for today's sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=203.012s">We</a>  will be having an elementary school session, a middle school session, high school, and a special education session, and four language groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=217.64s">Those</a>  language groups are Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Spanish. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=225.86s">In</a>  each language group, we will have specific translators who will support those groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=234.522s">So</a>  for Portuguese, we have Genevieve Young. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=238.603s">For</a>  Haitian Creole, we have Mr. Raul Bonbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=242.124s">For</a>  Arabic, we have Mai Abusan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=244.744s">And</a>  for Spanish, we have Mr. Paul Textera, who will be supporting us.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=254.285s">Oh,</a>  you're freezing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=255.306s">Facilitators.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=257.028s">We</a>  missed that, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, you froze. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=260.611s">After</a>  you announced all four interpreters. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=268.057s">Oh,</a>  frozen again.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=269.519s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=270.179s">Now</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=272.281s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=273.943s">Were</a>  people able to hear the four language groups or?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=277.586s">Yes,</a>  you got cut off right after that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=280.742s">Okay,</a>  for elementary, we have member Graham and Mayor Lungo-Koehn, with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=288.924s">Suzanne</a>  Galusi supporting the elementary group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=291.785s">For</a>  middle school, we have Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=293.865s">member</a>  Rousseau and member Mustone, with Dr. Riccadeli supporting middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=301.587s">For</a>  high school, we have member Krutz and member Van der Kloot with Dr. Cushing supporting high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=308.634s">And</a>  for special education today, we have member McLaughlin and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=315.621s">Susanna</a>  Campbell, who will be supporting special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=321.626s">So</a>  those will be the eight respective groups, and we will be focusing in on the three questions related to vision and mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=330.393s">And</a>  I just wanted to say that all of this work that's happening today was birthed out of the work for the strategic planning and communication subcommittee group, which is chaired by member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=346.226s">But</a>  this today's roundtable convening <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=350.229s">is</a>  to push those conversations about the mission and vision and have members of the community be able to weigh in on the strategic planning work that we have been doing and the full participation of the entire school committee group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=367.156s">So</a>  I look forward to today's session and I wanna thank all the administrators that have signed up to be scribes and timekeepers <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=376.98s">to</a>  support all of the respective groups today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=380.401s">So</a>  I just want to thank them in advance as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=383.662s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=385.982s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=393.184s">All</a>  right, ladies and gentlemen, I have assigned, I believe, all of the appropriate people for our groups, meaning our translators as well as our <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=407.9s">scribes</a>  and facilitators and school committee members to the groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=411.423s">I'm</a>  gonna open the rooms now for the parents and other people on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=417.448s">You</a>  should be able to, if you have the most up-to-date or recent update to Zoom, you should be able to self-select into the rooms once I open the rooms, all right?</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=429.198s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=429.939s">Could</a>  the interpreters introduce themselves and tell them which room they're going to?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=435.067s">Yes,</a>  that would be awesome, and thank you very much for that hiccup.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=441.571s">Mr.</a>  Teixeira, if you want to go first, which room will you be in? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=444.712s">And</a>  you are?</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=445.293s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, what room will I be in?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=451.596s">You</a>  will be in the Spanish room, which I think is room eight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=456.859s">Eight,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=458.339s">Buenas</a>  noches. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=459.16s">Si</a>  alguien necesita interpretacion en espanol, elija numero ocho. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=464.623s">May?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=698.055s">So</a>  Lisa Evangelista was already there as a scribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=701.238s">Is</a>  there another spot where you'd like me to go or should I join up? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=705.262s">Anything's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=707.944s">Mr.</a>  Bloch, would you mind going to room four?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=712.949s">Yeah,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=714.71s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=715.731s">No,</a>  I was just checking just to see if everyone was placed and it looks like they probably were. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=722.878s">All</a>  right, so I'm going to head back. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=724.179s">If</a>  I leave, will that put me back in the same room, or Peter, do you have to put me back?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=728.72s">No,</a>  you're already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=730.561s">So</a>  I think if you click the breakout rooms down on the bottom, it should go.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=735.403s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=736.484s">Peter,</a>  am I in a room?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=738.725s">Susie,</a>  you are not assigned yet.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=741.586s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=742.526s">Where</a>  would you like to go?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=744.087s">Oh,</a>  wherever you need a scribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=745.547s">I</a>  believe it's room one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=750.132s">So</a>  Craig is Craig's in the room number four. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=754.334s">So</a>  I'm going to join up room number two middle if that's fine with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=757.455s">There's</a>  no scribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=758.135s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=759.516s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=766.399s">So</a>  I think Farsner is actually in a room elsewhere under another account. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=774.322s">Just</a>  so you're aware.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=779.423s">could</a>  we put the fires that's here in that room as well?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=783.966s">I</a>  have a sign, but I think they have to click on their end as well.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=792.891s">Mr.</a>  Murphy, what room would you like to be assigned to?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=797.994s">Well,</a>  I'm a little curious, like what have I not done? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=801.256s">Peter</a>  did not have the button just at the bottom of the screen.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=804.258s">You</a>  probably just need to update your Zoom <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=808.865s">that's</a>  downloaded on your desktop to the most recent version. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=813.427s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=813.867s">And</a>  to just re-download Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=816.288s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=817.269s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=818.209s">If</a>  you go into your settings, it might say, like, update. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=822.431s">I,</a>  myself, haven't done it on one of my computers, so.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=825.453s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=826.353s">Can</a>  you throw me in the middle school for the time being? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=829.154s">I'm,</a>  like, working on something else at the same time, but I'll listen to it as closely as I can.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=837.278s">You</a>  got it.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=838.371s">Thanks</a>  a lot.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=846.716s">Dr.</a>  Vincent, where would you like to go?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=848.036s">I</a>  know I have access to the ones I just was checking to see where I should go support. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=853.419s">So</a>  I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=855.48s">I'm</a>  going to just move into one of the rooms right now.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=859.142s">And</a>  I'm going to high school.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=860.683s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1754.625s">Hello</a>  Pixel 3 and Stephanie McCann. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1757.966s">We</a>  have multiple rooms open right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1761.748s">Elementary,</a>  middle school, high school, special education, as well as some rooms for translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1772.272s">Do</a>  you have a preference for which room you would like to go into?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1776.494s">High</a>  school.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1784.949s">And</a>  you're good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1785.67s">And</a>  pixel three are you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1807.189s">pixel</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1811.521s">All</a>  right, I'll be back in a few minutes to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1813.782s">I</a>  apologize if you have to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1815.803s">Oh,</a>  they're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1817.825s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1828.171s">All</a>  right, my kids.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3711.764s">So</a>  good afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3712.844s">I</a>  hope all groups were able to come back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3716.406s">I</a>  was able to jump into every room for a little bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3722.388s">There</a>  were wonderful conversations, rich topics that were being shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3728.37s">And</a>  at this point in time, we really would like to just give the different groupings an opportunity to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3736.173s">Some</a>  groups were able to, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3739.654s">come</a>  up with draft versions of draft revisions that they want to be able to share out and I think it'll be a rich experience for all of us to be able to listen to the feedback from our different groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3761.673s">I</a>  did not go into <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3766.292s">all</a>  of our groupings just yet, but I just wanted to be able to take this opportunity to hear a little bit from each group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3785.921s">And</a>  so I'm going to ask <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3790.155s">I'm</a>  going to have us start with special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3792.817s">If</a>  special education member McLaughlin's group could just report out, give us an overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3803.186s">We</a>  have about 24 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3804.628s">So</a>  I'm going to try to do three minutes per group and see if you can share out <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3812.856s">you</a>  know, a key highlight or a suggestion that your particular group had to support this work around mission and vision statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3825.132s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3826.893s">Sure,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3829.475s">So</a>  we talked a lot about sort of, you know, in the sort of language of IEP actually, what are the measurable benchmarks, current performance level, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3839.702s">So,</a>  you know, knowing what our current performance level is, you know, based on this mission and vision, and we expect to go with measurable benchmarks and how the data is actually going to demonstrate that was a big part of our conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3856.085s">and</a>  having some more specificity around, you know, what sort of some of these, how do you define, you know, what it means to be successful in the 21st century, you know, and also that we're sort of thinking about when we say all students, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3872.221s">You</a>  know, students regardless of ability, background, ethnicity, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3876.004s">So</a>  being more specific in the wording. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3878.025s">And</a>  then we talked a lot about the partnerships that we've really appreciated in this past year with the pandemic and being able to see what's actually happening in schools and teachers really relying on parents and vice versa and us being able to appreciate what they're doing and be included in what our children are learning has been really valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3896.273s">Is</a>  there anything anyone else from the group would like to add?</p>
