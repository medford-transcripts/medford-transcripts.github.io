    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=159.662s">Are</a>  we going to have an initial introduction?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=170.765s">It</a>  looks like the superintendent's trying to unmute.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=186.593s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=189.716s">This</a>  evening, we're joining today for our roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=192.298s">I'm</a>  sorry I have it on two devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=195.641s">Just</a>  give me a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=198.57s">I</a>  wanted to just give a breakout for today's sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=203.012s">We</a>  will be having an elementary school session, a middle school session, high school, and a special education session, and four language groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=217.64s">Those</a>  language groups are Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Spanish. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=225.86s">In</a>  each language group, we will have specific translators who will support those groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=234.522s">So</a>  for Portuguese, we have Genevieve Young. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=238.603s">For</a>  Haitian Creole, we have Mr. Raul Bonbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=242.124s">For</a>  Arabic, we have Mai Abusan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=244.744s">And</a>  for Spanish, we have Mr. Paul Textera, who will be supporting us.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=254.285s">Oh,</a>  you're freezing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=255.306s">Facilitators.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=257.028s">We</a>  missed that, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, you froze. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=260.611s">After</a>  you announced all four interpreters. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=268.057s">Oh,</a>  frozen again.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=269.519s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=270.179s">Now</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=272.281s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=273.943s">Were</a>  people able to hear the four language groups or?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=277.586s">Yes,</a>  you got cut off right after that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=280.742s">Okay,</a>  for elementary, we have member Graham and Mayor Lungo-Koehn, with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=288.924s">Suzanne</a>  Galusi supporting the elementary group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=291.785s">For</a>  middle school, we have Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=293.865s">member</a>  Rousseau and member Mustone, with Dr. Riccadeli supporting middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=301.587s">For</a>  high school, we have member Krutz and member Van der Kloot with Dr. Cushing supporting high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=308.634s">And</a>  for special education today, we have member McLaughlin and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=315.621s">Susanna</a>  Campbell, who will be supporting special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=321.626s">So</a>  those will be the eight respective groups, and we will be focusing in on the three questions related to vision and mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=330.393s">And</a>  I just wanted to say that all of this work that's happening today was birthed out of the work for the strategic planning and communication subcommittee group, which is chaired by member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=346.226s">But</a>  this today's roundtable convening <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=350.229s">is</a>  to push those conversations about the mission and vision and have members of the community be able to weigh in on the strategic planning work that we have been doing and the full participation of the entire school committee group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=367.156s">So</a>  I look forward to today's session and I wanna thank all the administrators that have signed up to be scribes and timekeepers <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=376.98s">to</a>  support all of the respective groups today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=380.401s">So</a>  I just want to thank them in advance as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=383.662s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=385.982s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=393.184s">All</a>  right, ladies and gentlemen, I have assigned, I believe, all of the appropriate people for our groups, meaning our translators as well as our <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=407.9s">scribes</a>  and facilitators and school committee members to the groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=411.423s">I'm</a>  gonna open the rooms now for the parents and other people on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=417.448s">You</a>  should be able to, if you have the most up-to-date or recent update to Zoom, you should be able to self-select into the rooms once I open the rooms, all right?</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=429.198s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=429.939s">Could</a>  the interpreters introduce themselves and tell them which room they're going to?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=435.067s">Yes,</a>  that would be awesome, and thank you very much for that hiccup.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=441.571s">Mr.</a>  Teixeira, if you want to go first, which room will you be in? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=444.712s">And</a>  you are?</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=445.293s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, what room will I be in?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=451.596s">You</a>  will be in the Spanish room, which I think is room eight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=456.859s">Eight,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=458.339s">Buenas</a>  noches. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=459.16s">Si</a>  alguien necesita interpretacion en espanol, elija numero ocho. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=464.623s">May?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=698.055s">So</a>  Lisa Evangelista was already there as a scribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=701.238s">Is</a>  there another spot where you'd like me to go or should I join up? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=705.262s">Anything's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=707.944s">Mr.</a>  Bloch, would you mind going to room four?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=712.949s">Yeah,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=714.71s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=715.731s">No,</a>  I was just checking just to see if everyone was placed and it looks like they probably were. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=722.878s">All</a>  right, so I'm going to head back. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=724.179s">If</a>  I leave, will that put me back in the same room, or Peter, do you have to put me back?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=728.72s">No,</a>  you're already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=730.561s">So</a>  I think if you click the breakout rooms down on the bottom, it should go.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=735.403s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=736.484s">Peter,</a>  am I in a room?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=738.725s">Susie,</a>  you are not assigned yet.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=741.586s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=742.526s">Where</a>  would you like to go?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=744.087s">Oh,</a>  wherever you need a scribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=745.547s">I</a>  believe it's room one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=750.132s">So</a>  Craig is Craig's in the room number four. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=754.334s">So</a>  I'm going to join up room number two middle if that's fine with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=757.455s">There's</a>  no scribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=758.135s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=759.516s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=766.399s">So</a>  I think Farsner is actually in a room elsewhere under another account. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=774.322s">Just</a>  so you're aware.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=779.423s">could</a>  we put the fires that's here in that room as well?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=783.966s">I</a>  have a sign, but I think they have to click on their end as well.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=792.891s">Mr.</a>  Murphy, what room would you like to be assigned to?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=797.994s">Well,</a>  I'm a little curious, like what have I not done? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=801.256s">Peter</a>  did not have the button just at the bottom of the screen.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=804.258s">You</a>  probably just need to update your Zoom <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=808.865s">that's</a>  downloaded on your desktop to the most recent version. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=813.427s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=813.867s">And</a>  to just re-download Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=816.288s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=817.269s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=818.209s">If</a>  you go into your settings, it might say, like, update. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=822.431s">I,</a>  myself, haven't done it on one of my computers, so.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=825.453s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=826.353s">Can</a>  you throw me in the middle school for the time being? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=829.154s">I'm,</a>  like, working on something else at the same time, but I'll listen to it as closely as I can.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=837.278s">You</a>  got it.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=838.371s">Thanks</a>  a lot.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=846.716s">Dr.</a>  Vincent, where would you like to go?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=848.036s">I</a>  know I have access to the ones I just was checking to see where I should go support. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=853.419s">So</a>  I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=855.48s">I'm</a>  going to just move into one of the rooms right now.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=859.142s">And</a>  I'm going to high school.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=860.683s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1754.625s">Hello</a>  Pixel 3 and Stephanie McCann. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1757.966s">We</a>  have multiple rooms open right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1761.748s">Elementary,</a>  middle school, high school, special education, as well as some rooms for translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1772.272s">Do</a>  you have a preference for which room you would like to go into?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1776.494s">High</a>  school.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1784.949s">And</a>  you're good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1785.67s">And</a>  pixel three are you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1807.189s">pixel</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1811.521s">All</a>  right, I'll be back in a few minutes to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1813.782s">I</a>  apologize if you have to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1815.803s">Oh,</a>  they're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1817.825s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1828.171s">All</a>  right, my kids.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3711.764s">So</a>  good afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3712.844s">I</a>  hope all groups were able to come back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3716.406s">I</a>  was able to jump into every room for a little bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3722.388s">There</a>  were wonderful conversations, rich topics that were being shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3728.37s">And</a>  at this point in time, we really would like to just give the different groupings an opportunity to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3736.173s">Some</a>  groups were able to, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3739.654s">come</a>  up with draft versions of draft revisions that they want to be able to share out and I think it'll be a rich experience for all of us to be able to listen to the feedback from our different groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3761.673s">I</a>  did not go into <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3766.292s">all</a>  of our groupings just yet, but I just wanted to be able to take this opportunity to hear a little bit from each group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3785.921s">And</a>  so I'm going to ask <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3790.155s">I'm</a>  going to have us start with special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3792.817s">If</a>  special education member McLaughlin's group could just report out, give us an overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3803.186s">We</a>  have about 24 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3804.628s">So</a>  I'm going to try to do three minutes per group and see if you can share out <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3812.856s">you</a>  know, a key highlight or a suggestion that your particular group had to support this work around mission and vision statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3825.132s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3826.893s">Sure,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3829.475s">So</a>  we talked a lot about sort of, you know, in the sort of language of IEP actually, what are the measurable benchmarks, current performance level, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3839.702s">So,</a>  you know, knowing what our current performance level is, you know, based on this mission and vision, and we expect to go with measurable benchmarks and how the data is actually going to demonstrate that was a big part of our conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3856.085s">and</a>  having some more specificity around, you know, what sort of some of these, how do you define, you know, what it means to be successful in the 21st century, you know, and also that we're sort of thinking about when we say all students, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3872.221s">You</a>  know, students regardless of ability, background, ethnicity, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3876.004s">So</a>  being more specific in the wording. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3878.025s">And</a>  then we talked a lot about the partnerships that we've really appreciated in this past year with the pandemic and being able to see what's actually happening in schools and teachers really relying on parents and vice versa and us being able to appreciate what they're doing and be included in what our children are learning has been really valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3896.273s">Is</a>  there anything anyone else from the group would like to add?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3904.771s">Great,</a>  great job member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3906.752s">Up</a>  next.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3909.374s">High</a>  school had a draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3911.756s">I</a>  don't know if you can screen share that, but I would like for the group to see the possible draft that was shared with some different wording and just do high school, middle, and then elementary has a lot of suggestions as well for the group.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3934.19s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, you might have the chat.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3937.055s">I</a>  did not see a member band includes version member band include put that in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3943.353s">Let</a>  me, I put it in the chat, but I think it said, Medford Public Schools provide safe and equitable learning environments that fosters academic success, personal growth, positive relationships, civic responsibility, adaptability and resiliency for all our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3967.538s">A</a>  lot of our conversation was about, there was nothing wrong with the vision statement as written, but it was, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3974.644s">you</a>  know, tended towards to be too encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3977.085s">Now,</a>  a lot of our discussion really was, we really liked one from Boston, Paul, every student, every day.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3985.689s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3987.189s">You</a>  know.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3987.509s">We</a>  should know that one from BPS, but I think we were looking for that, that taking our mission statement and sort of making it into that catchphrase so that even if you're a new community member, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4001.795s">For</a>  example, Boston Public Schools, every student, every day, which means like, we're here for our students every single day, no matter what the timeframe is, whatever they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4012.298s">So</a>  even parsing that down, so that's like our catch layer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4016.419s">I</a>  even said, Maurice, too, like in your emails, you always write, in partnership with children. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4023.581s">So</a>  those kinds of things we need to kind of whittle down a little bit so we have our, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4028.271s">Medford</a>  Public Schools catchphrase that we can all utilize.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4033.472s">So</a>  the one that I read, what we were really talking about is what key phrases came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4040.075s">And</a>  we had a discussion about how important the school environment, how it had become clear this year that the school environment was so important in nurturing our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4052.46s">And</a>  we talked about equity, and we talked about adaptability and resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4056.822s">So</a>  we were just trying to incorporate some of those key concepts, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4063.125s">But,</a>  you know, the shorter the better in so many ways.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4068.428s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4069.029s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4071.21s">Thank</a>  you for that I when I when I saw the. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4076.578s">you</a>  know, how you worded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4078.158s">And</a>  when we get to elementary, member Graham will be able to, you know, kind of report out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4083.42s">But</a>  one of the things I know specifically calling out critical thinkers or social emotional learning, different pieces like that, but to look at what we have and what your group worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4094.903s">And</a>  right now we're gonna just, if it's okay, member Graham, unless another member of the group wants to speak, I was gonna quickly transition to member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4103.925s">to</a>  report out on middle schools, but I really appreciate just, you know, the creative thinking, the ideas, the suggestions, so that we're able to, you know, take all of this information and really work it into something that's relevant to everyone today in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4125.376s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4127.517s">So</a>  I'll go next then, I guess, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4129.218s">Is</a>  that what you were saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4131.059s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4132.938s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4133.358s">So</a>  we had a great conversation, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4136.419s">We</a>  had a few things that I'm gonna touch on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4139.739s">There</a>  was a serious discussion around whether the mission and the vision statements deserve to be split, that there's an actual different use case for the two different statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4150.141s">And</a>  there were a number of people seem to be in agreement with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4156.462s">Some</a>  of the ACEs do not seem to actually, they seem to be completely absent from the current statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4162.383s">There's</a>  only four aces, so it feels like we should be able to get all four of them in some way into the mission or the vision or both. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4170.889s">We,</a>  a number of us, we had interesting conversation around 21st century education, and there seemed to be a consensus, I would say, that spelling out what we mean by that is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4184.998s">Again,</a>  we don't need a 700 word mission statement, but that that, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4191.294s">that</a>  phraseology doesn't really mean anything to anybody who isn't an educator and hasn't spent any time looking it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4200.758s">And</a>  then we had three words in the current statement, which I think it was just three, that need more conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4210.101s">One</a>  was the word contributors. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4213.002s">Another</a>  one was reached, which felt very kind of like you're finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4218.384s">It's</a>  very like end of life, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4220.832s">not</a>  early in life where our students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4223.873s">And</a>  then the word fostering in the ACEs feels very unmeasurable and vague. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4231.316s">So</a>  I have a lot of other notes, but I'll, I probably used my three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4236.178s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4238.609s">Could</a>  I ask a question, member Rousseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4241.45s">When</a>  you said fostering felt vague, was there another word that your group said they felt would better capture the feeling? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4254.793s">Just</a>  so I can report that.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4257.494s">There</a>  was not a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4259.555s">It</a>  felt, I brought this thing up, but it was, we could say we offered something, but that doesn't mean it's really available to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4269.091s">So</a>  fostering, at the end of the day, literally nobody could take advantage of something. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4274.792s">And</a>  if we fostered that, the goal isn't to say we as the professionals made something available, it's that it actually was delivered or received. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4286.154s">And</a>  so I don't think we had a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4288.974s">I</a>  don't remember a better word coming up, but that word fostering felt a very kind of, it didn't feel like we were taking responsibility for delivering on the goal.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4300.068s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4300.568s">Thank</a>  you for that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4302.65s">That's</a>  very helpful as we go back to the drawing board. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4308.495s">Was</a>  there anyone else from the middle school team that wanted to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4314.815s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4315.675s">I'm</a>  gonna pass now to member Graham for her to speak with the elementary school on behalf of the elementary school group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4324.139s">And</a>  then we will go to the language specific groups after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4330.342s">So</a>  member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4333.204s">So</a>  we actually had a good conversation about a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4337.949s">So</a>  I think, you know, overwhelmingly the participants in our group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4342.133s">Had</a>  a lot of passion at the elementary school level around making the after school programming more available to all those families who need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4351.641s">And</a>  actually, I thought one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4353.962s">sort</a>  of said that, you know, I'll sort of know we're making progress when, as a working parent, I can send my child to NPS and they can have after-school care. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4366.268s">That</a>  is what, like, being able to access any of this statement means to me, which I thought was really <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4372.372s">compelling.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4373.553s">We</a>  did talk a lot about the 21st century comment being really abstract, and we went on to talk about the notion of wanting <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4386.868s">to</a>  ensure that we are creating critical thinkers, which is really sort of, I think we're at the beginning of that either success or failure really being very evident in our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4402.552s">So</a>  being able to understand what is real, what is not, how to really critically think about the world around you, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4412.015s">When</a>  people are being truthful or frankly they're not, which is I think the really scary part of like looking forward for me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4419.022s">And</a>  they also we also talked about the fact that the education that we provide itself needs to be drawn from a diverse set of skills and backgrounds and I think that really taps into. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4436.08s">thoughts</a>  for me anyway about ensuring that our curricula are up to date and are rigorous and can be accessed by all of our students, but also that they are reflecting our current knowledge and thinking across the world and across the profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4454.29s">So</a>  I thought that was all like really, really good commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4458.052s">I</a>  thought a couple of other things that came up a couple of times is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4463.775s">There</a>  was an overwhelming comment about the plan feeling sort of incomplete at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4471.059s">So</a>  just trying to kind of connect the dots of all the components and the one pager and like <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4479.102s">what</a>  that really looks like as it comes to life and a lot of questions around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4484.584s">And</a>  then I think the other conversation that we had that I thought was really excellent was around how do we measure that we're making progress and in sort of on the like contrasting side of measurement a feeling that just because it can't be quantified doesn't mean it should <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4505.23s">uh</a>  not be prioritized so in other words there's a lot of things that are very hard to measure about what we do in public school systems and just because we can't put a number to it doesn't mean it doesn't deserve prioritization so that we really have our work cut out for us as we as we think about <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4526.308s">how</a>  to critically evaluate things that are quantifiable and things that are not quantifiable and be able to prioritize across that set of topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4538.752s">And</a>  then I think the other comment that I heard, which I think is important is, you know, we haven't ever had meetings like this, you know, pre a year ago, and that Zoom has really enabled us in a different way than we were able to take advantage of before. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4556.739s">And,</a>  you know, certainly when you talk about the number of working parents, whether they're on the call tonight, or they come to our meetings, that that was a pretty important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4567.345s">And</a>  then I think that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4570.968s">I</a>  think that those were like the biggest things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4573.31s">Did</a>  I miss anything, Mayor?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4578.594s">You</a>  covered everything very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4580.075s">Maybe</a>  just the one thing I thought would be a great addition is somebody, I think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4586.479s">Cohen</a>  mentioned when you talk about school, family and community as it relates to meetings and the word engage or engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4594.67s">is,</a>  I think, important because we want to keep people engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4599.272s">But</a>  otherwise, you covered it perfectly.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4606.196s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4607.317s">I</a>  actually had one probing question I was going to ask member Graham when I was just jotting a few notes when you were talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4617.313s">how</a>  we're measuring progress and things that are quantifiable and things that are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4621.657s">I</a>  didn't know, because I may have left that room at the time, if you had a concrete example of something that was quantifiable and something that was not, just so that we could continue to work on that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4639.524s">We</a>  actually didn't get that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4640.985s">We</a>  ran out of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4642.685s">But</a>  the thing that immediately sort of came to my mind is this notion of, you know, with MCAS, you can measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4653.788s">You</a>  have numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4655.308s">It's</a>  really easy to prioritize things that get tied to numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4662.44s">And</a>  in contrast, something like the fine arts that don't attach themselves to an MCAS score so directly and like really figuring out how do you weigh the balance of math and fine arts is I think an example that sort of my wheels started turning as we were talking about it.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4684.011s">Thank</a>  you for that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4686.694s">That's</a>  a great example to help us, you know, just think about, cause I wanted to at least be able to bring that back to the larger group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4696.824s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4699.988s">Mayor,</a>  I see member McLaughlin has her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4703.371s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4705.017s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4705.517s">Yeah,</a>  just regarding the data, which is also what the special education subgroup was saying is that, you know, the quantifiable piece is also, you know, again, you could say MCAS scores, but also getting back to that all students, how are we disaggregating the data by subgroups, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4723.32s">So</a>  if we're looking at, you know, how all students are doing, if we're looking at quantifiable data, how are we doing that around subgroups and reporting that out so that we're thinking about all students? <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4733.862s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4735.561s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4735.821s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am McLaughlin as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4739.544s">Mary,</a>  I wanted to say I did just communicate with Mr. Texera and for today's session, we did not have EL participation in the language groups, but tomorrow, again, is another opportunity from 6 to 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4759.52s">for</a>  families to be able to jump on and <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4763.062s">give</a>  us another opportunity to have this conversation so that we can gather the data and information and feedback in order to work on, you know, having <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4777.127s">this</a>  living, breathing strategic plan that will continue to help us guide the work that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4784.012s">We're</a>  doing the work and member Graham, you did a great job explaining it in the elementary group, just about why, the why behind a strategic plan and how it really allows a district to have all of their work, kind of the work that's pushing us and moving us forward housed in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4806.926s">And</a>  it's a critically important document for us to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4811.607s">And</a>  it was a requirement of the new superintendent's induction program. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4816.389s">And</a>  so it is something that we look forward to finalizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4820.95s">But</a>  even as we say, finalizing that document, it's a living, breathing document. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4826.592s">And</a>  so it's never in its final phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4829.213s">It</a>  can kind of continue to change and grow and evolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4833.634s">So</a>  I wanna just thank <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4837.015s">all</a>  the parents who are on the call today to give their feedback and share their concerns, share their feedback, give us information so that we can take it, bring it back to the larger group and work on making revisions and improving our strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4859.589s">So</a>  I just want to thank everyone who's on the call tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4862.891s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4864.25s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and thank you all for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4868.511s">Is</a>  there a motion?</p>
