26
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:17,238
[SPEAKER_21]: This amendment is requested due to a recently negotiated agreement with the Teamsters Local 25 covering employees from three departments.

27
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:22,022
[SPEAKER_21]: It is estimated that the contract will cost approximately $288,920.92 in retroactive funds.

28
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:26,325
[SPEAKER_21]: This contract for which negotiations began in 2019 is the first covering the affected employees.

29
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:43,721
[SPEAKER_21]: A request for transfer of the funds to the affected apartments will be submitted to the city council under a separate cover.

[SPEAKER_21]: I'll try it here.

33
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:27,289
[SPEAKER_21]: be it further ordained that the positions outlined herein be removed from the current classification as they appear in the current classification compensation plan.

34
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:29,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

35
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Any discussion on this?

36
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,151
[SPEAKER_10]: The representative from the administration might want to explain what's going on with this, Mr. President.

37
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:41,672
[SPEAKER_21]: There is no one from the, I don't see anybody from the administration here, Mr. Vice Presidents.

38
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:46,573
[SPEAKER_21]: How much are they asking us to spend tonight?

39
00:02:48,354 --> 00:03:00,464
[SPEAKER_21]: There is, I do not see anyone from the administration on here unless there's another name here.

40
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:08,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, maybe we can have a representative from this newly organized employee group come up and explain to us what this is all about.

41
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:12,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that this is something that's been long awaited.

42
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:14,696
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been waiting for a long time for this contract to come before us.

43
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,538
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe someone can be here to fill us in.

44
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:19,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

45
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:22,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephen South 106 Damon Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

46
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:27,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, Mr. South, if you want to give us a little brief synopsis of what this is about.

47
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

48
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:44,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the new collective bargaining agreement in front of you and your fellow counselors is a first time collective bargaining agreement covers 12 members of this bargaining unit consisting of the recreation department, the

49
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,861
[SPEAKER_00]: DPW superintendents as well as the code enforcement officers.

50
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:56,102
[SPEAKER_00]: It was over a year and a half in the making through negotiations, long and tedious negotiations.

51
00:03:56,722 --> 00:04:13,125
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that the final agreement that has been agreed to by the administration and Teamsters Local 25 is very fair and will compensate and provide benefits to these 12 employees that are fair.

52
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,568
[SPEAKER_00]: for the very, very important work that they perform for the city.

53
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:25,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So we respectfully request that the council, um, prove this new collective bargaining agreement.

54
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and then we'll see you in three years.

55
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:28,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.

56
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:29,619
[SPEAKER_19]: Council Scott Pelley.

57
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,762
[SPEAKER_19]: And thank you, Mr South for bringing this forward.

59
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:36,345
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that with the teams is representing, uh,

60
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,870
[SPEAKER_19]: these employees, I think it looks like it's an upgrade that's overdue.

61
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,491
[SPEAKER_19]: And I appreciate your effort and your hard work with this.

62
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:53,993
[SPEAKER_19]: But the question I can, if we can make an amendment to just send this to the city administration.

63
00:04:54,954 --> 00:05:07,017
[SPEAKER_19]: I got word back that non-union employees, there were a handful of non-union employees that were bypassed their regular step rate during the COVID.

64
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:14,628
[SPEAKER_19]: So my question is, are we going to make that whole with their upgrade that they deserved?

65
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:27,238
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want them to, we approve a step, a new agreement, but they're still missing a big piece of their, what was owed to them.

66
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:34,284
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that we acquired funds from the federal government and hoping we could,

67
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:37,733
[SPEAKER_19]: ask that from the administration, Mr. Clark.

68
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:38,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

69
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:42,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, we can please.

70
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

71
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:58,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, we can also find out what positions in particular did not receive this step race for the past fiscal year.

72
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking about for this unit or for?

73
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:05,348
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

74
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:06,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

75
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:06,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

76
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:08,809
[SPEAKER_00]: He got nervous.

77
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,050
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready to fight.

78
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

79
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

80
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

81
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:17,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

82
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:17,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

83
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,671
[SPEAKER_03]: If he doesn't mind.

84
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:23,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a question about the language.

85
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:31,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President says, be it further ordained, the positions outlined herein will be removed from their current classifications as they appear in the current classification and compensation plan.

86
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:36,825
[SPEAKER_10]: So it looks like we're passing it, and then it looks like we're eliminating it.

87
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:41,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it ordained that the following classification plan is adopted, we're adopting it.

88
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:44,749
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it says, be it resolved that the positions outlined herein be removed.

89
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:49,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

90
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:51,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Best.

91
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:56,714
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm reading it as add these new classifications and then remove the positions from the old classifications.

92
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:01,096
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like there's 18A, 15A,

93
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:15,148
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm reading it as it's creating new classifications for these specific positions and then removing those positions from the former classifications.

94
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,049
[SPEAKER_02]: They should put new in there or something.

95
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:28,695
[SPEAKER_13]: I would assume so.

96
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:32,637
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a PW21A is a new classification.

97
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:33,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

98
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,419
[SPEAKER_13]: And these positions are now in PW21A.

99
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:42,402
[SPEAKER_13]: but if there are positions that are in PW21 that aren't included here, they're staying the way they are.

100
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:48,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, it's moving these positions out of existing caps into new caps.

101
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:49,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

102
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:49,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

103
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:50,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

104
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:53,305
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's no one on the line from the administration to answer these questions.

105
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:54,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Not at the moment.

106
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:57,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further questions?

107
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:00,827
[SPEAKER_21]: Further questions?

108
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:02,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Chair awaits a motion.

109
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:04,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

110
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:05,248
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion by council.

111
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:14,843
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scapelli, and we'll vote on the B paper first.

112
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:24,614
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion on the B paper, offered by Councilor Scapelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

113
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:28,638
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on this.

114
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:33,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Behrs?

115
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:34,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

116
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:35,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

117
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:35,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

118
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:37,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight?

119
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:37,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

120
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

121
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:38,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

122
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:39,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell?

123
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

124
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

125
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

126
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,200
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caraballo?

127
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I have the affirmative.

128
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:46,361
[SPEAKER_21]: None, the negative motion passes.

129
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:59,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, where we have waited 19 months, 20 months for this contract to come to fruition, something that started during the previous administration and was negotiated almost to the end of the current administration, I would offer the motion that

130
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:07,118
[SPEAKER_10]: the additional readings be waived and the employees before us this evening be afforded their cost of living increase ASAP.

131
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:09,719
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be a retroactive increase to January 1st, 2021.

132
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:16,862
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's about seven months of benefits that these employees would be able to receive should we waive these additional readings.

133
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:18,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

134
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:22,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so you wanna make that as an amendment?

135
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:26,246
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll be a motion, Mr. President, to waive the additional readings on the passage of the ordinance.

136
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:29,327
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

137
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:33,016
[SPEAKER_20]: So the motion to waive the three readings.

138
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:36,179
[SPEAKER_20]: So the motion is to approve the ordinance and waive the three readings, that's one.

139
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,239
[SPEAKER_20]: No, just to waive the three readings.

140
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,340
Okay.

141
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,421
[SPEAKER_20]: Just waive the three readings.

142
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:40,922
[SPEAKER_20]: All those in favor?

143
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:42,603
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

144
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:43,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

145
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:43,544
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

146
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:44,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

147
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,145
[SPEAKER_21]: On the original paper.

148
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:53,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on that one.

149
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:55,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight moved for approval.

150
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:56,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the second on that?

151
00:09:57,553 --> 00:10:00,195
[SPEAKER_21]: No, Council Member Moxmoor for approval, I think.

152
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:01,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

153
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:01,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

246

247

00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:42,126
[SPEAKER_21]: The engineering division recommends that the city council determine if this process is adequate and reasonable pursuant to section 74-63 of Sydney Ordinance 2.

249
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:53,623
[SPEAKER_21]: The engineering division recommends that existing encroachments be allowed to remain so situate for as long as they remain in good condition.

[SPEAKER_21]: The existing encroachments will include a metal fire escape, building cornices, and signs attached to the building three.

253
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:13,965
[SPEAKER_21]: The engineering division takes no exception to this approach.

254
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:24,093
[SPEAKER_21]: However, the license agreement should indicate that no new encroachments or expansion of the existing encroachments is allowed beyond the limits of the existing encroachments as shown on the easement plan.

255
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:29,762
[SPEAKER_21]: the license agreement should indicate that the licensee will maintain encroaching items in good condition.

256
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:36,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Five, the license agreement should indicate that the city will revoke the license upon removal of the encroaching items.

257
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:38,296
[SPEAKER_21]: Seven, the city council to decide

258
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:43,125
[SPEAKER_21]: If the license agreement should include a renewal period or expiration.

259
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:50,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Seven, city council should recommend a reasonable fee be charged by the city for use of the public property for the benefit of the petitioner.

260
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Eight, the licensed area must include a level landing at the base of the ramp.

261
00:17:55,473 --> 00:18:04,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Nine, the license agreement should acknowledge that the potential presence of underground utilities beneath the proposed ramp should not restrict access to these utilities. 10,

262
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:17,314
[SPEAKER_21]: The notification for the public hearing regarding this approval should include utility companies that have infrastructure in this block of Spring Street.

263
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:21,477
[SPEAKER_21]: 11, sidewalk work associated ramp adjacent to the cracked sidewalk panels.

264
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,478
[SPEAKER_21]: Adjacent cracked panels should be replaced.

265
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,982
[SPEAKER_21]: 12, the ramp is a projection of the building and associated with the building exit entrance.

266
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:35,977
[SPEAKER_21]: The ramp must be built per applicable building code inspected by the building department for code of compliance.

267
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:40,701
[SPEAKER_21]: 13, the building indicates a national grid manhole near the proposed ramp.

268
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:44,705
[SPEAKER_21]: The licensee agreement should not restrict access to this manhole.

269
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:52,531
[SPEAKER_21]: 14, the plan indicates a tree pit on Spring Street that conflicts with the clearances needed for the ramp.

270
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:56,715
[SPEAKER_21]: The new location appears reasonable and should be confirmed with the tree ward.

271
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:04,167
[SPEAKER_21]: 15, the license agreement should indicate the minimum clearance between the minimum ramp and the front of the car to be 72 inches.

272
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:08,528
[SPEAKER_21]: Call 781-393-2425 for further accommodations.

273
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:09,468
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Cleo.

274
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:15,210
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, do we have anybody here from... Tim, are you on the call here?

275
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,431
[SPEAKER_21]: No?

276
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Tim?

277
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:19,311
[SPEAKER_21]: Hang on.

278
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:22,992
[SPEAKER_21]: Tim is on.

279
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Mr. President, I'm here.

280
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,435
[SPEAKER_21]: I've read all these recommendations.

281
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:29,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any further comments on this?

282
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:38,425
[SPEAKER_12]: No, besides just so everybody understands what they're asking to do is to build a portion of their building the ADA ramp in the public way.

283
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:42,148
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is a building projection in the public way.

284
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:46,512
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is what you would be, you know, approving tonight.

285
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:59,148
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other thing to note is that there are existing encroachments that include the elements in described the fire escape, some signage and actually the building itself.

286
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:03,890
[SPEAKER_12]: So the easement plan submitted sort of takes care of all those elements.

287
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:05,831
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully that clears things up.

288
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,313
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, Councilor Morocco.

289
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:10,902
[SPEAKER_20]: That's wrong.

290
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:11,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

291
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:18,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tim, if I understand it's the access ramp is extending out onto the existing sidewalk is what's happening.

292
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:19,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

293
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:36,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're, you know, parallel to the building, you know, you're walking down the sidewalk, so there will be, I guess, ramps on all three sides, I'm assuming so people who are just continuing down the sidewalk are able to, whether they're in a, you know, stroller mobility device are able to just go up and down that new ramp.

294
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:38,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, no.

295
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:48,236
[SPEAKER_12]: So the sidewalk is wide enough to accommodate the private ramp associated with the building and public sidewalk, which would be next to it, basically.

296
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:49,597
[SPEAKER_12]: So that part wouldn't change.

297
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:52,840
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, that's a question.

298
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:04,469
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't necessarily break the path of anyone coming down the sidewalk, and they would have enough space for, you know, a stroller, a wheelchair, anything like that without having to, um, come in contact with this ramp.

299
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:05,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

300
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

301
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Biss.

302
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

303
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:20,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Tim, just two questions for you on these conditions six and seven.

304
00:21:21,183 --> 00:21:31,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any recommendation to the council as to what a reasonable fee would be or, you know, renewal period or expiration?

305
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:34,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Not specifically, but

306
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:42,167
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't know if there are, I looked into it before doing this review, I don't think there are very many similar situations in the city.

307
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:45,610
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do not have a recommendation for you.

308
00:21:46,751 --> 00:22:02,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And in terms of the sidewalk that they are replacing in addition to the ramp, is that just gonna go up to the limit of the sidewalk next to their building on Yeomans and Spring Street, or is it going any farther than that?

309
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,204
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe a plan's in your packet, but the ramp itself, I don't know the exact length of it, but it's a rectangle.

310
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:23,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if the proponent is here, but I'd say 10 feet by five or six feet, a rectangle on Spring Street, right in front of Citizens Bank.

311
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,633
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't extend over to Yeoman's, and it doesn't extend over to the parking lot.

312
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:32,115
[SPEAKER_12]: It is isolated in that sidewalk on Spring Street.

313
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:38,143
[SPEAKER_13]: So the sidewalk panels that are being replaced in addition to the installation of the ramp are just on Spring Street.

314
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:41,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor Beza, I didn't hear that last part.

315
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:47,769
[SPEAKER_13]: It says in here that 108 square feet of sidewalk is being replaced as well.

316
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that just the sidewalk adjacent to the ramp on Spring Street?

317
00:22:52,753 --> 00:23:01,619
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be, and the proponent may be able to correct me, but I believe that would be the sidewalk that is taken up by this ramp.

318
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:07,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm gonna have to find it.

319
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:14,279
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a long one, but somewhere in here it says that sidewalk is being, additional sidewalk.

320
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Cracked panels are being replaced as well, adjacent to the ring, number 11.

321
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:20,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, number 11.

322
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:30,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, so that basically is if they're going to be doing this work and there is a cracked panel next to where they're doing the work, then they should be replacing that as well.

323
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:32,116
[SPEAKER_12]: That is in there.

324
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:39,404
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty typical for me and my office to do that because if you're working next to a panel that needs to be replaced, then you should just replace it.

325
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:42,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, okay, gotcha.

326
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:45,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

327
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,753
[SPEAKER_10]: if I may, from the chair, Councilor Fevella.

328
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:51,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim, has this plan been reviewed to ensure that it's compliant with the ADA?

329
00:23:53,616 --> 00:23:55,077
[SPEAKER_12]: The plans, yes.

330
00:23:55,237 --> 00:24:04,563
[SPEAKER_12]: So not the built condition, obviously, but the, yeah, the plans, I reviewed them with the general principles of ADA clearances and slopes and things like that.

331
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:13,528
[SPEAKER_12]: Once it is built, and I would imagine too, before it's built, that the building department would have a review process for the ADA compliance as well.

332
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:16,569
[SPEAKER_10]: and probably our ADA compliance officer.

333
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:23,453
[SPEAKER_10]: So the ADA compliance officer hasn't had an opportunity to review any of this yet.

334
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:24,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

335
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:27,455
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been through my office and I think that's it.

336
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:29,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

337
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:30,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Fevella.

338
00:24:30,397 --> 00:24:31,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:38,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Tim, quick question regarding Councilor Abuerez had mentioned previously the recommendations of number six and number seven.

340
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:42,403
[SPEAKER_15]: So do you know if this has been done in any other cities and towns in the past?

341
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:45,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it has.

342
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:54,051
[SPEAKER_12]: And basically the process and the plan that comes with this is pretty typical.

343
00:24:54,071 --> 00:25:07,040
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's similar to non-building easements that this body has approved before, except the big difference here is that we're talking about a portion of a building as opposed to just a park or a landscaped area or something like that.

344
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,042
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I mean, I'm familiar with the City of Boston's process.

345
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:15,806
[SPEAKER_12]: They license public way areas for private use, and they have a typical process for that.

346
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:22,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you familiar with the structure of what they've done in the past, like the City of Boston?

347
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:23,771
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm not.

348
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:32,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking at this because reasonable is kind of arbitrary as far as what's reasonable.

349
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:36,700
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we're looking to come up with a fee,

350
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:41,820
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, it'd be good to have some sort of guidance as to which way to head on that, I guess.

351
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:43,941
[SPEAKER_13]: A million, two million?

352
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:44,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly, exactly.

353
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:47,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, is it a yearly fee?

354
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:48,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it a one-time flat fee?

355
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:49,686
[SPEAKER_15]: That type of thing.

356
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:53,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's something that needs to be looked at.

357
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:55,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly think it's a step in the right direction.

358
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:03,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that this is something the council's called for in the past, is for the monetization of the use of public spaces in the storage and, you know,

359
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:07,487
[SPEAKER_10]: scaffolding of equipment and stuff like that.

360
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:08,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a step in the right direction.

361
00:26:08,787 --> 00:26:10,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to see we're making an effort to do it.

362
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:13,089
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I said.

363
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,110
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.

364
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a great idea.

365
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:33,978
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just looking for in the past, if we've done something like this, and because I don't remember doing something like this since I've been on the council, maybe I could, I don't think it comes up that often, but I'm just wondering, and I'm not sure if some of the senior councilors might have recommendations as to which way to head on this.

366
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:40,235
[SPEAKER_15]: If we've done this before in the past, what have we charged?

367
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:41,997
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready, Mike?

368
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,338
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all you, baby.

369
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:43,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Moxley.

370
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:45,680
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair recognizes Councilor Moxley.

371
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:50,364
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have a quick question.

372
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:54,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Would this be an annual fee or a one-time fee?

373
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is that in our purview as well, Tim?

374
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:03,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, so I wasn't sure if you asked me.

375
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:05,284
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that's in your purview.

376
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:10,314
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would think it would be similar to like renting, renting land or leasing space.

377
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:11,637
[SPEAKER_12]: So

378
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:15,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, Mr. President.

379
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:17,304
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the going rate?

380
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:18,965
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the going rate of public space?

381
00:27:19,065 --> 00:27:40,336
[SPEAKER_19]: So could we leave this with the, if we move to approve, but also the caveat that maybe the city assessor could give us a cost estimate of what the amount of land that they're going to use and what the rate is square foot for rental.

382
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,498
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'm just throwing ideas out there,

383
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:46,149
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we can ask them for some guidance.

384
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:53,474
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think it might make sense for us for approval, even to sit down with the assessor to, you know, define the parameters of what we're getting into.

385
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:55,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think it, you know, it's commercial property.

386
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:56,836
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a commercial tax rate.

387
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:58,737
[SPEAKER_10]: We have 108 feet of land.

388
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:02,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's not going to be a formula that's going to be too difficult for us to put together.

389
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,461
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's something that we should know.

390
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I make the motion that we,

391
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:14,845
[SPEAKER_19]: I know if we have further questions, but we table this until the next meeting with the

392
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,682
[SPEAKER_19]: the notes sent out to the city assessor to give us a recommendation.

393
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:28,867
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly to refer the matter to a committee of the whole with the city assessor, seconded by Councilor Falco, Councilor Max.

394
00:28:29,547 --> 00:28:30,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

395
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:33,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering if the petition is on the call.

396
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,891
[SPEAKER_03]: The commissioner is on the call.

397
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:47,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And my question is, Mr. President, are there currently renovations other than ADA that are happening to Citizens Bank and that work triggered off additional ADA?

398
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:49,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Upgrades.

399
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:55,429
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair recognizes Christopher Schultz on behalf of the petitioner.

400
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:57,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you read it?

401
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,793
[SPEAKER_10]: And name and address for the record please Mr. Schultz.

402
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:05,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Schultz with LR Construction.

403
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:11,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you happen to hear Councilor Mox's question?

404
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:13,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you repeat it please?

405
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:13,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

406
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:25,215
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, is Citizen Bank in the process of renovating the building and these renovations triggered off ADA upgrades?

407
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:27,717
[SPEAKER_03]: How did this come about?

408
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:33,022
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not part of a larger renovation.

409
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:40,528
[SPEAKER_05]: This is part of a larger group of citizens branches that are being ADA upgraded.

410
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:53,324
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some other work inside the vestibule we did that we've already completed that did not affect any of the city sidewalks, and this was the second half of the project that does go upside down to the sidewalks.

411
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Bruce Bisbono, the architect, I believe, has also been unmuted.

412
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:59,292
[SPEAKER_05]: He can speak to some of these questions as well.

413
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:03,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Mr. President, if I could.

414
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:12,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there any consideration of doing this work internally and not needing to take over city property?

415
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:20,398
[SPEAKER_05]: The ADA requirements did not with the layout of the building, we did not have the space to do this internally.

416
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free.

417
00:30:29,757 --> 00:30:31,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Bisbon, would you like to add anything?

418
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:36,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we can hear you.

419
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,061
[SPEAKER_09]: You're unmuted, but we have no volume for you.

420
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:50,524
[SPEAKER_05]: The simple answer to that was no, there was no way to do it inside the footprint of the building.

421
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:55,926
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we've talked to Tim and gone through this process, because we needed to use the city sidewalks.

422
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:03,136
[SPEAKER_03]: In my last point, Mr. President is under bullet point two under recommendations.

423
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:16,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It says that the engineering division recommends the existing encroachments be allowed to remain as long as they're in good condition or if they fall into disrepair or poor conditions.

424
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:20,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it says the city will revoke the license.

425
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:23,958
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure what advantage that is.

426
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:31,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say, and I'm not saying this is gonna happen, these particular ramps fall into disrepair, they become an eyesore, they become unsafe.

427
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,145
[SPEAKER_03]: We revoke the license and guess what?

428
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:37,628
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on our city sidewalk and we have an eyesore there.

429
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:43,152
[SPEAKER_03]: What advantage is that to the city of revoking a license?

430
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:49,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see something with a little more teeth, Mr. President, that they will not fall into disrepair.

431
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:59,373
[SPEAKER_03]: or that they maintain a certificate of condition on a yearly basis.

432
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:04,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So they hire their own contractor to come out every year and make sure they're in proper condition and so forth.

433
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:15,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd rather see that than we put a condition that will revoke a license and then be stuck with a ramp that is an eyesore that's dangerous and becomes a city responsibility.

434
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be my recommendations for bullet point number two.

435
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So noted.

436
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:29,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Amir Salam from Citizens Bank.

437
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:46,555
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as I can find how to unmute him.

438
00:32:46,635 --> 00:32:49,036
[SPEAKER_09]: There we are.

439
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:50,297
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

440
00:32:51,183 --> 00:32:51,523
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

441
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:53,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record.

442
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:53,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

443
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:53,625
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

444
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:55,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

445
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,668
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Amir Salam.

446
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,889
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a senior project manager for Citizen Bank.

447
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,272
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm located on Pennsylvania.

448
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:09,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome.

449
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:14,640
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple of items just I want to clarify here, like for maintaining the good condition,

450
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:18,799
[SPEAKER_17]: of any item within our property.

451
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:25,801
[SPEAKER_17]: It's our responsibility for the safety of the public and customers and our colleague in the branch.

452
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:33,444
[SPEAKER_17]: So anything we usually do regular maintenance internally to avoid any damage element of the building.

453
00:33:34,624 --> 00:33:42,907
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is in regard to item number two, to make sure that the enroachment element that's already existing in good condition

454
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:51,265
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason of doing the ADA work is we found out that this, our building is not ADA compliant.

455
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:56,268
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very challenging for senior or somebody in a wheelchair to access the branch.

456
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:57,749
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why we're doing the upgrade.

457
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:01,431
[SPEAKER_17]: And Chris, as Chris mentioned, it's very challenging.

458
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:08,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, it's infeasible to have internal upgrade, to have the ramp internal in the building.

459
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:11,357
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need the approach from the exterior.

460
00:34:12,455 --> 00:34:24,883
[SPEAKER_17]: That being said is we have, as Tim mentioned, is that we have plenty of sidewalk and the ramp is not enroaching, like, you know, that far into the sidewalk.

461
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:36,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Which is, in this case, my kind of concern or comment about item number six and seven, license-wise, our lease for this building is triple net.

462
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:41,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Any maintenance required for the sidewalk or exterior element

463
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:43,712
[SPEAKER_17]: we are required to fix it.

464
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:49,256
[SPEAKER_17]: So I believe there is no need for the license or period of expiration.

465
00:34:49,896 --> 00:35:05,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if under any condition like a city did inspection and found any unsafe condition in the sidewalk or in a building and notify the bank, the citizen bank, we will move on and fix it automatically.

466
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:11,391
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just kind of like item number seven

467
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,533
[SPEAKER_17]: We're doing this for the easement for the public.

468
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:30,464
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I wasn't sure we haven't dealt with this conditions at the town or the city require us to pay fee for adding a ramp to make it facilitated for the public and make it easier compliance.

469
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:34,628
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mr. President, if I could-

470
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:38,188
[SPEAKER_03]: and I appreciate that response.

471
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:48,616
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anywhere in this document or in the proposed license agreement that talks about the liability of this particular structure?

472
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:52,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's liable if someone gets hurt on this structure?

473
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:01,726
[SPEAKER_17]: Citizen Bank, because we have a triple net lease with the owner of the building that we are liable for maintaining the building.

474
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a question for legal counsel to answer, not the engineer.

475
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:13,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know, so maybe that question should be directed, but this is, I appreciate what the gentleman's saying, but this now is going to be located on a city sidewalk.

476
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:20,534
[SPEAKER_03]: and we've been hearing about the building, the building, the building, we're talking about something on a public sidewalk.

477
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:24,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be another question, Mr. President, I have regarding liability.

478
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:33,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would be responsible, Mr. President, regarding the liability if someone were to get hurt on that particular structure?

479
00:36:33,962 --> 00:36:40,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to offer that in the form of a question to the solicitor or to the engineer for follow-up.

480
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:43,668
[SPEAKER_03]: We can offer it to the city solicitor, that's fine.

481
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:52,979
[SPEAKER_10]: or anybody from the public that has anything they'd like to add?

482
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:54,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

483
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,700
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair recognizes Councilor Morrell.

484
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

485
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:06,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I do believe this, I'm thinking, I believe the citizens on High Street has this similar setup where there is a ramp that goes out onto the public sidewalk.

486
00:37:06,063 --> 00:37:09,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if that offers any precedent for these questions we're asking.

487
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:10,024
[SPEAKER_18]: They do.

488
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:17,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair, what's the motion?

489
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:24,257
[SPEAKER_11]: So be a table or a committee of the whole with the assessor or?

490
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:31,960
[SPEAKER_21]: With those two questions that Councilor Marks in about the liability and the cost of.

491
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the body feel that warrants a committee of the whole or does the body feel that warrants something we could do on regular meeting?

492
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:40,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Regular meeting?

493
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:40,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

494
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:43,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to table until the questions are answered by the administration.

495
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:45,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

496
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:49,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And also Mr. President on the bullet point too, if we can get maybe the city engineer to rework that

497
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:57,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't feel comfortable with the city revoking a license with a structure that's left on our public sidewalk.

498
00:37:59,295 --> 00:37:59,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.

499
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:16,341
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Peli, seconded by Councilor Carviello, as amended by Councilors Carviello, sorry, Councilor Scott Peli and Marx.

500
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:18,381
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

501
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:18,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

502
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:20,242
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

503
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:23,472
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it, the matter is tabled.

504
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:31,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Council paper, I'm sorry, motions, orders, and resolutions.

505
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Council paper 21441 offered by President Caravello.

506
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:46,674
[SPEAKER_10]: In light of the recent tragedy in Florida, be it so resolved, the building commissioner report back to the council the protocol for expecting buildings over four stories in the city of Medford.

507
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:47,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

508
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:53,048
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we've all seen what happened down in Florida over the past few weeks.

509
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:55,210
[SPEAKER_21]: And I hope that that never happens in our city.

510
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:04,778
[SPEAKER_21]: But is there a protocol that we have in our city for inspecting buildings every 10 years, every so many years, over so many stories?

511
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:09,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Something that a couple of residents reached out and asked me that I didn't have an answer.

512
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:26,203
[SPEAKER_21]: If you can have the commissioner report back on what the protocol is to what our city does for maintaining the buildings over so many stories, especially where a couple of them are senior citizen buildings and a couple of right close to the water.

513
00:39:26,223 --> 00:39:32,345
[SPEAKER_21]: So just get back a report on what our protocol is to inspect these bases on some kind of basis.

514
00:39:34,226 --> 00:39:36,687
[SPEAKER_09]: A motion by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Max.

515
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:38,467
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

516
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:38,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

517
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:39,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

518
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:41,595
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

519
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:45,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Paper 21442 offered by Councilor Beers.

520
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:54,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it so resolved, the Medford City Council congratulate Medford High School teacher Andrew Milney on his retirement after 22 years of service to our community.

521
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Beers.

522
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

523
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:06,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Andy Milne was personally, and no offense to any of my other wonderful teachers at Medford High School, was my favorite teacher at Medford High School.

524
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I took AP US History with him in 11th grade.

525
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:15,908
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would say that's one of the reasons that I'm sitting right here right now.

526
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:28,133
[SPEAKER_13]: So I could go on and on about how much a wonderful class it was, that he was a great advisor and person to talk to when you had questions or were thinking about college or your future.

527
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:40,947
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think his record speaks for itself 22 years at Medford High School, hundreds and hundreds of students that he personally, not only taught but sought to advising and helping.

528
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:44,030
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think he speaks.

529
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:48,529
[SPEAKER_13]: in his role to the great faculty and educators that we have here in Medford.

530
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:55,672
[SPEAKER_13]: So he deserves our congratulations on his retirement and wishing him the best going forward.

531
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:56,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

532
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:57,733
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a strong member of the union.

533
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,793
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair recognizes Councilor Scott Pelley.

534
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:01,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

535
00:41:01,214 --> 00:41:02,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Council B.S.

536
00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:04,115
[SPEAKER_19]: for bringing this up, this resolution.

537
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:06,916
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that Andy Milton not only

538
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:16,312
[SPEAKER_19]: was a great teacher and someone that we're going to miss because he's left such an impact on our school community, but also in the sports world.

539
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:25,980
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that Coach Milne was head coach at Arlington High School soccer and an avid athlete in his own right.

540
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:30,865
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that a lot of what he did in his personal life, he really

541
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:34,655
[SPEAKER_19]: he really was a driving force for a lot of his students.

542
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:42,302
[SPEAKER_19]: And they talked to some of the students that they really took his drive in all aspects of life.

543
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:45,845
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that's a sign of a great teacher and a sign of a great mentor.

544
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:49,649
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess we can blame him for council's BSV.

545
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:51,230
[SPEAKER_19]: So he's right.

546
00:41:53,172 --> 00:42:17,457
[SPEAKER_19]: but uh he's a great someone say thank someone say thank great teacher and uh wish him wish him well in his retirement and um thank you i'm sure you guys had some great battles on the soccer field coach on the motion by councillor bears seconded by councillor scarpelli all those in favor all right opposed the ayes have it the motion passes

547
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:22,252

[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved the Medford City Council congratulate Alicia Nunley Benjamin on her recent appointment as finance director for the town of Littleton and thank her for her many years of service to the city of Medford.

549

[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

550
00:42:35,162 --> 00:42:35,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

551
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:43,486
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to thank Alicia Nunley-Benjamin for her many years of service to our city as the budget director and CFO.

552
00:42:44,466 --> 00:42:51,389
[SPEAKER_15]: She made a number of great contributions here to our city and with the budget process.

553
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:55,590
[SPEAKER_15]: She was always available to answer questions.

554
00:42:55,851 --> 00:43:01,194
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a pleasure to work with her and I just wanted to wish her well in her new role in all of her future endeavors.

555
00:43:01,814 --> 00:43:06,937
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to say congratulations, good luck and best wishes to Alicia Nunley-Bedger.

556

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr President.

560
00:43:13,181 --> 00:43:20,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think Councilor Falco for bringing this forward, um, throughout the budget season and any financial paper that's come before us.

561
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:27,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia is has spent countless hours with us and it's just a wealth of knowledge and helping us understand what's coming before us the impact and

562
00:43:28,374 --> 00:43:37,740
[SPEAKER_06]: There was rarely a question she couldn't answer, particularly in this time when where there's, you know, there's ARPA, there's COVID relief, there's so many things to understand in a short amount of time.

563
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And she really did an excellent job.

564
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:44,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And not because we just spent 30 hours in budget meetings, but I'm dreading next year's budget without her.

565
00:43:44,864 --> 00:43:48,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So she'll be sorely missed and I congratulate her on her new appointment.

566
00:43:53,309 --> 00:43:54,449
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scafelli.

567

[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Falcone, thank you for bringing this forward.

569
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:10,779
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, for years working in the municipality and also, you know, having, um, worked with Alicia, you realize how amazing she, she is and, uh, how lucky that community is to have her now.

570
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:14,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I too want to thank her for all of her hard work.

571
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:20,165
[SPEAKER_19]: One thing about Alicia, we realized, uh, whenever you were confused about something, she brought it down to layman's terms.

572
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:20,825
[SPEAKER_19]: You understood it.

573
00:44:21,486 --> 00:44:26,609
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and she always had the answer, even if you didn't like the answer, she would tell you the answer straightforward.

574
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:33,151
[SPEAKER_19]: with no reservation, with no political bantering.

575
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:38,273
[SPEAKER_19]: It was straightforward, highly professional and something I'm gonna miss.

576
00:44:38,393 --> 00:44:44,075
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wish her luck in her endeavors and thank you again for council Falco brings forward.

577
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:47,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice president Knight.

578
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:55,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I may, I too would like to take an opportunity to thank Alicia for her service to the city of Medford over the course of the last what must be now

579
00:44:56,507 --> 00:44:57,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Four years, four and a half years.

580
00:44:57,768 --> 00:45:06,014
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fortunate enough to say that I've developed a strong friendship with her and I think she's someone that's been a great asset to this community and she's going to be sorely missed.

581
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:17,022
[SPEAKER_10]: With that being said, although our loss is another town's gain, I think we have to wish her the best of luck in her new endeavor and thank her for all her service here in this community.

582
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:20,464
[SPEAKER_10]: She's certainly been an asset and she will be sadly missed.

583
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:23,046
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, I thank the council for putting this resolution on.

584
00:45:23,506 --> 00:45:25,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

585
00:45:26,612 --> 00:45:27,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

586
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:27,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

587
00:45:27,732 --> 00:45:29,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up.

588
00:45:30,793 --> 00:45:39,816
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's sad when someone leaves that you've worked with for so many years and not being able to thank them before they leave, Mr. President.

589
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:42,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And I too wanna thank Alicia.

590
00:45:43,217 --> 00:45:46,038
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there were many times we didn't agree on issues.

591
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:53,600
[SPEAKER_03]: There were many times that we were at odds as a council and, you know, as a finance department

592
00:45:54,135 --> 00:46:03,310
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can always rest assured that Alicia spoke from her heart and she spoke from a position of knowledge and authority.

593
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:06,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was much appreciated, Mr. President.

594
00:46:07,038 --> 00:46:10,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Even things that potentially would benefit this council.

595
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:23,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia was the first to tell us that during budget time that we were offering suggestions that probably would have been approved if we offered them in a different fashion.

596
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:30,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found out that in this budget session that we had more abilities as a council

597
00:46:30,696 --> 00:46:35,817
[SPEAKER_03]: to make changes to the budget than we were ever explained in all the years I've been on the council.

598
00:46:36,518 --> 00:46:54,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was largely due in part to Alicia realizing her responsibility as the budget finance director in the community, but also realizing that in order to have city government operate that I think all parties have to be on the same page.

599
00:46:55,263 --> 00:46:58,685
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think she keenly understood that, Mr. President.

600
00:46:58,725 --> 00:47:05,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will sorely miss her experience and knowledge, her breadth of knowledge when it comes to finances.

601
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:12,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope the city can find someone pretty quickly to fill her shoes, Mr. President.

602
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:12,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

603
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:13,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

604
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:14,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Baez.

605
00:47:15,156 --> 00:47:16,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

606
00:47:16,757 --> 00:47:22,241
[SPEAKER_13]: I echo the statements of my colleagues and certainly we have big shoes to fill.

607
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:24,953
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been through two budgets now.

608
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:35,180
[SPEAKER_13]: One of them I voted against, one of them I voted for, and I don't think Alicia held it against me that I voted against the first one, but incredibly informed and informative person.

609
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:46,728
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think, you know, I don't think people understand the personal sacrifice that she made over many years, especially these past two years to keep the city moving.

610
00:47:47,068 --> 00:47:48,749
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a huge loss in that respect.

611
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:49,009
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

612
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:57,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope that a position can be filled soon, but I think it'll be difficult to find someone with such aptitude as Alicia Nunley-Benjamin.

613
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wish her the best and congratulate her on her new position.

614
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,143
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Baez.

615
00:48:04,183 --> 00:48:07,424
[SPEAKER_21]: And personally, I wanna thank Alicia for the years that I've worked with her.

616
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:12,987
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly a woman of vast knowledge and she will be missing our community.

617
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:15,988
[SPEAKER_21]: And like you said, our loss is someone else's gain.

618
00:48:16,008 --> 00:48:18,529
[SPEAKER_21]: So Alicia, I wish you well in your new position.

619
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,010
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion.

620
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:22,906
[SPEAKER_21]: by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

621
00:48:22,926 --> 00:48:24,988
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Vice President Knight.

622
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:26,088
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

623
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:26,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

624
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:27,549
[SPEAKER_21]: All opposed?

625
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:28,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

626
00:48:29,931 --> 00:48:43,539
[SPEAKER_21]: 21444 offered by Councilor Falco being resolved that the City Administration provide the Memphis City Council with an update as to how the Finance and Auditing Departments will operate since there was a vacancy in the CFO position.

627
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

628
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:46,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

629
00:48:47,176 --> 00:48:50,938
[SPEAKER_15]: And this resolution is related to the last resolution.

630
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:55,700
[SPEAKER_15]: As we all know, Alicia Dudley Benjamin recently left this position.

631
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:02,583
[SPEAKER_15]: And my question basically is to the administration, what is the plan moving forward for this role?

632
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:10,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia held the role of financial director, CFO, auditor, and I know she also helped out with a number of treasury functions as well.

633
00:49:11,586 --> 00:49:12,267
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe, you know,

634
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:18,290
[SPEAKER_15]: it's these are vital, vital, you know, roles to the daily operations of our city.

635
00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:27,036
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I think it's our fiduciary responsibility to be asking the questions as to what is the plan moving forward for the administration?

636
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:29,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this going, are they going to hire for this role?

637
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:36,182
[SPEAKER_15]: We're full time personally looking, is it going to be on a temporary basis, but we need to have this information.

638
00:49:36,662 --> 00:49:39,144
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's our responsibility to ask these questions.

639
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:48,932
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that the assistant that was recently hired just this year is still in training or was in training, just trying to come up to speed when Alicia left.

640
00:49:49,032 --> 00:49:55,238
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know he's doing a good job, but we need to know what's the plan moving forward.

641
00:49:55,298 --> 00:50:00,022
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the question is basically to the administration, what's the plan?

642
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:02,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, these are vital roles.

643
00:50:02,642 --> 00:50:07,566
[SPEAKER_15]: This position needs to be addressed ASAP.

644
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:13,170
[SPEAKER_15]: It's $190 million budget, $191 million budget, and we need answers to these questions.

645
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,413
[SPEAKER_15]: So I ask for my colleague's support and move approval.

646
00:50:17,873 --> 00:50:18,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

647
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:19,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further questions?

648
00:50:20,214 --> 00:50:22,656
[SPEAKER_21]: No, on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

649
00:50:22,676 --> 00:50:25,098
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Filion.

650
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:26,239
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

651
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:26,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

652
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,060
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

653
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:29,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

654
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,080
[SPEAKER_21]: 2-1-4-4-5.

655
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Offered by Councilor Falco.

656
00:50:31,421 --> 00:50:42,084
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Memphis residents Amy Orcutt on her acceptance to West Point and being named GBL Soccer Athlete of the Year.

657
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:42,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

658
00:50:43,646 --> 00:50:44,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

659
00:50:44,386 --> 00:50:59,234
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to congratulate Amy Orcutt and her family on this remarkable, very impressive achievement being accepted into the West Point Military Academy and also being named the, let's see, GBL Scholar-Athlete of the Year.

660
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:04,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Amy received recommendations from Congresswoman Clark, Senator Markey,

661
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:05,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Senator Warren.

662
00:51:06,098 --> 00:51:09,501
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, you know, this is a great achievement.

663
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:12,182
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be recognized, and I wanted to recognize it.

664
00:51:12,763 --> 00:51:16,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's just a remarkable achievement, and I wanted to wish her well.

665
00:51:17,006 --> 00:51:24,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulate her on all our future endeavors and wish you well at West Point and congratulate her family as well.

666
00:51:24,611 --> 00:51:25,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr President.

667
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

668
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:28,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for Councilor

669
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:30,558
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Falco will bring this forward.

670
00:51:31,478 --> 00:51:35,740
[SPEAKER_19]: I was fortunate enough to watch Amy play as one of my daughter's teammates.

671
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:46,764
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a freshman on the varsity, having a leader like Amy Orca to follow and to emulate is a huge, huge benefit.

672
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Something that I cherish that my daughter had that opportunity.

673
00:51:50,622 --> 00:51:53,103
[SPEAKER_19]: people what has been written last year.

674
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:59,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Amy was probably one of the best players on the team and went up for a layup, came down and tore ACL.

675
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:04,386
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you know Amy Orcutt, I think she wanted to go back in the game.

676
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:10,547
[SPEAKER_19]: And but she sat on the bench, smiled on her face and just kept pushing her teammates.

677
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,508
[SPEAKER_19]: So I know that

678
00:52:13,752 --> 00:52:15,994
[SPEAKER_19]: West Point is such a such an honor.

679
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:20,676
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think she's going to make method proud as she already has.

680
00:52:20,736 --> 00:52:23,878
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to congratulate her and wish her the best of luck.

681
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:31,162
[SPEAKER_19]: She's a she's a great role model for all of our young female athletes, especially, but all the athletes in Medford High School to follow.

682
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:31,762
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

683
00:52:33,343 --> 00:52:38,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, if I may, I wasn't quite finished, but I just wanted to amend, invite her down to a future meeting.

684
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,868
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe she's home right now.

685
00:52:39,888 --> 00:52:44,752
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe she's off in a training, but I want you guys, if you could invite her down for a council accommodation.

686
00:52:44,772 --> 00:52:45,233
[SPEAKER_15]: That'd be great.

687
00:52:45,253 --> 00:52:45,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

688
00:52:46,033 --> 00:52:46,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further discussion?

689
00:52:48,395 --> 00:52:53,259
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, on the motion by, offered by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Knight.

690
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,981
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

691
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:55,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

692
00:52:55,501 --> 00:52:56,422
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

693
00:52:56,462 --> 00:52:57,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

694
00:52:57,923 --> 00:52:59,985
[SPEAKER_21]: 21446 offered by Councilor Falco.

695
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:09,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that the DPW perform routine maintenance at the city-owned Bridgewell-Hegner Center on Maple Park Avenue.

696
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:11,285
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

697
00:53:11,325 --> 00:53:12,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

698
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:20,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Recently, I was walking down Maple Park Avenue, just taking a walk, and I walked by the property, the former Hegner Center.

699
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:24,254
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in really bad shape.

700
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:28,059
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it is overgrown with all kinds of trees, weeds.

701
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it looks pretty neglected.

702
00:53:30,842 --> 00:53:36,869
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not fair to the residents that live in Maple Park condominiums that they have to look at that every single day.

703
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:41,334
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to ask that the administration please send by the DPW to

704
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:46,275
[SPEAKER_15]: clean up the property, it is the city-owned property.

705
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:49,619
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be on a regular maintenance schedule.

706
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,165
[SPEAKER_15]: By looking at it, it does not appear to be on a regular maintenance schedule.

707
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:56,729
[SPEAKER_15]: The residents that live in that neighborhood should not have to put up with that.

708
00:53:57,511 --> 00:54:03,693
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd also like to find out what the maintenance schedule is for this property.

709
00:54:03,753 --> 00:54:12,197
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I could please get that from the DPW and if we could just have the DPW provide some maintenance on that property, greatly appreciate it.

710
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:16,198
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would ask for my council colleagues support and I move for approval.

711
00:54:16,738 --> 00:54:17,039
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

712
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:17,799
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further discussion?

713
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:18,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

714
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,461
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scapelli.

715
00:54:22,581 --> 00:54:23,301
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

716
00:54:23,321 --> 00:54:23,701
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

717
00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:24,621
[SPEAKER_21]: All opposed?

718
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:25,482
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

719
00:54:27,903 --> 00:54:30,705
[SPEAKER_21]: 21447 offered by Councilor Falco.

720
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:46,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that Park Method report back to the City of Memphis City Council the reason for the system glitch over the past weekend where customers were charged numerous times in error and what steps have been made to resolve the issue.

721
00:54:46,959 --> 00:54:47,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

722
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:48,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

723
00:54:48,821 --> 00:54:53,925
[SPEAKER_15]: I received a number of calls over the past week regarding people that actually

724
00:54:55,404 --> 00:54:55,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Park the cars.

725
00:54:55,924 --> 00:55:00,586
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was actually Haines Square area where they were charged numerous times.

726
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:09,091
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, they basically swiped their credit cards and they were charged like 30, 40 times the same transaction over and over again.

727
00:55:09,111 --> 00:55:10,651
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was to more than one person.

728
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:13,873
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to get a report back to Park Medford as to what the issue was.

729
00:55:14,473 --> 00:55:18,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to confirm that these issues were all resolved by

730
00:55:19,005 --> 00:55:20,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Park Medford or Republic Parking.

731
00:55:21,707 --> 00:55:33,517
[SPEAKER_15]: This here is, it's a big concern, especially since the parking operation is going to be transitioning from Park Medford or from Republic Parking internally to the City of Medford.

732
00:55:33,537 --> 00:55:40,982
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanna make sure that these types of issues are, have been addressed and resolved before the city takes on this new program.

733
00:55:41,863 --> 00:55:42,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Move approval, thank you.

734
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:44,045
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, any further discussion?

735
00:55:44,065 --> 00:55:45,666
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

736
00:55:45,686 --> 00:55:47,848
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion by Councilor Bailão, seconded by Vice President Knight.

737
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:49,671
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

738
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:51,052
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

739
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:52,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

740
00:55:54,616 --> 00:55:56,618
[SPEAKER_21]: 21448 offered by Councilor Falco.

741
00:55:57,459 --> 00:56:09,512
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that the administration provide a staffing update with regard to the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability and the administration's plan to fill any vacant positions.

742
00:56:09,572 --> 00:56:10,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

743
00:56:10,627 --> 00:56:11,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

744
00:56:11,627 --> 00:56:17,870
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just to get an update from the Planning Development and Sustainability Department.

745
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:24,512
[SPEAKER_15]: I know during the budget hearings that the director for the department, Alicia Hunt, I know they're really busy.

746
00:56:24,572 --> 00:56:27,893
[SPEAKER_15]: They have a lot going on, but I believe they lost Annie Streetman, the planner recently.

747
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:40,198
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to get an update as to the progress that's been made with regard to replacing her and when they feel that the position will be filled or the vacancy will be filled.

748
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:42,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, any further discussion?

749
00:56:43,685 --> 00:56:45,887
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

750
00:56:46,928 --> 00:56:48,850
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

751
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:49,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

752
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:51,072
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed, motion passes.

753
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:55,916
[SPEAKER_21]: Communications, City Officers and Employees, 21449.

754
00:56:57,677 --> 00:57:01,380
[SPEAKER_21]: To President Richard Caravaggio and member of the Memphis City Council, registered voters.

755
00:57:03,682 --> 00:57:04,023
[SPEAKER_21]: The St.

756
00:57:04,283 --> 00:57:05,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Francis Parish Center

757
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:10,545
[SPEAKER_21]: will no longer be available to the city as a polling location because the building has been sold.

758
00:57:11,486 --> 00:57:17,169
[SPEAKER_21]: I therefore have worked to identify a new polling location for Ward 2, Precinct 1.

759
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:24,114
[SPEAKER_21]: I am recommending that you approve Roberts Elementary School as a new polling location for Ward 2, Precinct 1.

760
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:33,680
[SPEAKER_21]: I've had a preliminary conversation with John McLaughlin of the Memphis Public Schools, and he sees no obstacles to using the Roberts School for this purpose.

761
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:40,193
[SPEAKER_21]: As you're aware, all municipal elections use the same ballots.

762
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:49,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Placing 2-1 and 2-2 in the same location ensures that both polling locations would use the same ballots for state and federal elections as well.

763
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:54,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Furthermore, there is a precedent in using schools as multiple polling locations.

764
00:57:55,179 --> 00:58:00,480
[SPEAKER_21]: The city already uses the former Columbus School, now renamed for both 5-1 and 5-2.

765
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:04,302
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to notify the voters of a precinct change at least 20 days

766
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:06,498
[SPEAKER_21]: in advance of the election.

767
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:14,022
[SPEAKER_21]: I plan to make this notification via mailing required and by at least two reverse 911 calls for each election.

768
00:58:15,523 --> 00:58:16,984
[SPEAKER_21]: I will also place signs at the St.

769
00:58:17,024 --> 00:58:23,348
[SPEAKER_21]: Parish Center as required, notifying voters that the site is no longer a polling location.

770
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:33,975
[SPEAKER_21]: In addition, we will make all the additional required notifications and we will place the new information on the city's website in advance of the two upcoming elections.

771
00:58:35,092 --> 00:58:39,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Once you have formally designated the new polling place, I will begin this notification process.

772
00:58:41,078 --> 00:58:46,803
[SPEAKER_21]: Our number one concern is to plan and execute full, fair, and transparent elections.

773
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:52,648
[SPEAKER_21]: I am confident that this new polling location will allow us to achieve this goal for the voters of 2-1.

774
00:58:53,669 --> 00:58:55,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your attention on this issue.

775
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:58,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Please feel free to contact me if you have any concerns.

776
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:00,215
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, would you like to address this?

777
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:02,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilors fairly straightforward.

778
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:07,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to keep all the information in the in the memo is as brief but as detailed as possible.

779
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:10,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the parish center has been sold.

780
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:13,738
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to lose that as a polling location.

781
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:18,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, we need to move to one into another location.

782
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:25,162
[SPEAKER_04]: The location that makes the most sense is, uh, is the Roberts school because 22 is already located there.

783
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:32,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as you're aware, all city ballots are the same, uh, for the for municipal elections.

784
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:39,225
[SPEAKER_04]: There are three different ballots for, uh, state and federal elections, but the 21 and 22 ballots are the same.

785
00:59:39,586 --> 00:59:47,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about this because it makes sure that voters are still getting the same ballots, uh, that they're used to getting at these at these locations.

786
00:59:48,229 --> 00:59:57,293
[SPEAKER_04]: It also it also helps with the poll helps the poll workers because, um, the poll workers, if there's ever any kind of late cancellation, they can be sort of interchangeable and they can

787
00:59:57,773 --> 01:00:00,155
[SPEAKER_04]: they can walk from one room to another to assist voters.

788
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:08,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would make a lot of sense having the same ballots in that location as well, which is why we proposed 2-2.

789
01:00:08,502 --> 01:00:17,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And we already know that because the Roberts School is used as a polling place, that it's already meets all the compliance needs.

790
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is why I suggested that polling place.

791
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:21,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

792
01:00:23,238 --> 01:00:31,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Just, and if you haven't figured out yet I understand it would both polling places be in the gymnasium, they would ideally they would be in different rooms.

793
01:00:31,682 --> 01:00:32,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

794
01:00:33,082 --> 01:00:34,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Ideally, they'd be in different rooms.

795
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:40,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the precedent at the at the at the former at the former Columbus school on when schools in session.

796
01:00:41,566 --> 01:00:45,668
[SPEAKER_04]: the voting often takes place in the same room, but when school is closed, it's in different rooms.

797
01:00:46,028 --> 01:00:54,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would prefer that, I would prefer to have the polling locations in different rooms, because that gets rid of some confusion for voters and for poll workers.

798
01:00:55,133 --> 01:00:56,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would prefer that they'd be in different rooms.

799
01:00:58,135 --> 01:01:00,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessary, but that's the preferred route.

800
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

801
01:01:02,457 --> 01:01:03,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

802
01:01:03,598 --> 01:01:09,801
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Mr. Clark, so when someone comes into the office, into the school to vote,

803
01:01:10,974 --> 01:01:21,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there going to be someone directing them as to where the two, two, one, two, one, there's going to be signs up so that people can, people know they're going to go to the right room because it's, and we're going to have to do that because.

804
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,559
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's going to be two polling locations in there.

805
01:01:24,859 --> 01:01:33,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, voters who currently use the former Columbus school are somewhat used to the process now, but, but this is going to be a new process for the, uh, for the two one voters.

806
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:43,791
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be some additional signage and we'll have some, and we'll also have somebody directing people to make sure they're going to the right place, but there'll also be, you know, the check-in tables are set up so that

807
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:49,511
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, only two, one voters can check in at the two, one polling place and only two, two voters can check into the two, two polling place.

808
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:51,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So the check-in tables will be that way as well.

809
01:01:51,932 --> 01:01:52,833
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that part.

810
01:01:52,933 --> 01:01:57,916
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to make sure that it's as seamless as possible.

811
01:01:58,096 --> 01:01:59,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely agree with you.

812
01:01:59,517 --> 01:02:07,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine that there might be a couple of hiccups, but nothing, but I don't anticipate there'll be any, any kind of major, any kind of major issue.

813
01:02:07,943 --> 01:02:11,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And the goal is always to make it as seamless as possible.

814
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:13,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people might not know the difference between 2-1 and 2-3.

815
01:02:13,969 --> 01:02:16,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that it's as seamless as possible.

816
01:02:16,852 --> 01:02:19,955
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm correct, I was told that that building is being leased.

817
01:02:20,015 --> 01:02:20,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it being sold?

818
01:02:21,917 --> 01:02:23,318
[SPEAKER_04]: We were told that it was being sold.

819
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:26,821
[SPEAKER_04]: But regardless, St.

820
01:02:26,861 --> 01:02:29,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Francis told us it was no longer going to be available as a polling place.

821
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:34,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

822
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:39,041
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as we were confirmed with that, we had to move forward with a new polling place.

823
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:53,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than wait to see if we could stay in there, whether it's leased or sold, it was going to be easier and faster and ultimately better for the city if we moved out of there, because we didn't want to wait until the last possible second on this one.

824
01:02:54,665 --> 01:02:54,845
Thank you.

825
01:02:55,246 --> 01:02:55,747
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the best.

826
01:02:55,847 --> 01:03:01,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure you're already there, but just a recommendation that any two one signage say former St.

827
01:03:01,117 --> 01:03:02,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis location, that'll help.

828
01:03:06,058 --> 01:03:06,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

829
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:12,999
[SPEAKER_06]: To that same point, I don't know what the plans are as far as updating the website to reflect the new name of the Columbus School to the Mississauga.

830
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:20,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I know stuff has been changed in, I don't know the status of the physical signage, but I know there have been updates made in mapping tools.

831
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:24,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So if people are looking up, they may have issues ending up the right place.

832
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:27,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know it remains Columbus on the website for the polling location.

833
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:29,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just don't know what the plan is for that.

834
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:41,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry to cut you off, but I can, I can answer that what we're going to have to do when we, and I'm, I'm deliberately waiting on these updates until, until, uh, you've addressed this memo tonight, so we can take care of as much of this at once as we can.

835
01:03:41,812 --> 01:03:49,518
[SPEAKER_04]: But in terms of the former Columbus school, uh, we are required to use the former name and the new name, uh, you know, in the polling location.

836
01:03:49,558 --> 01:03:57,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're going to, that's what we're going to, it's not considered a polling location change, but it is, but because it's been renamed, we have to use both names, at least for this election.

837
01:03:57,702 --> 01:03:58,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, yeah, and that makes sense.

838
01:03:58,663 --> 01:04:00,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make sure in terms of wayfinding.

839
01:04:00,744 --> 01:04:01,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

840
01:04:01,465 --> 01:04:04,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, any further discussion?

841
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:09,411
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

842
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:10,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

843
01:04:10,852 --> 01:04:11,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

844
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:13,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, do we need a roll call on this?

845
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:14,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Or is this a voice vote?

846
01:04:14,514 --> 01:04:15,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That is your discretion.

847
01:04:15,255 --> 01:04:20,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's call the roll on this to make sure everybody's in agreement.

848
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:21,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good to me.

849
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:24,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Behrs.

850
01:04:24,822 --> 01:04:25,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

851
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:26,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Fevella.

852
01:04:27,295 --> 01:04:27,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight?

853
01:04:28,116 --> 01:04:28,376
Yes.

854
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:29,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

855
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:29,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

856
01:04:29,817 --> 01:04:30,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell?

857
01:04:30,557 --> 01:04:30,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

858
01:04:30,977 --> 01:04:31,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

859
01:04:31,778 --> 01:04:32,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

860
01:04:32,158 --> 01:04:32,959
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caraballo?

861
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I'm in affirmative, none in the negative.

862
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

863
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:38,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, motion to take.

864
01:04:40,364 --> 01:04:44,366
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Knight, all in favor?

865
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:45,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

866
01:04:45,387 --> 01:04:45,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

867
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:46,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

868
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:53,542
[SPEAKER_21]: 21453 offered by Vice President Knight and Councilor Scott Pelley.

869
01:04:53,983 --> 01:05:01,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Being so resolved that the Memphis City Council extended steep and sincere condolences to the family of Ray Buckland on his recent passing.

870
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,552
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Knight.

871
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:03,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

872
01:05:05,054 --> 01:05:08,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Recently, Mr. Buckland passed away very suddenly.

873
01:05:08,618 --> 01:05:12,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those of us who don't know who Ray Buckland is, he's probably

874
01:05:13,263 --> 01:05:19,388
[SPEAKER_10]: one of the greatest athletes to come out of high school and one of the greatest people to ever come out of the city of Medford.

875
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:23,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray had a very exceptional basketball career at Medford High School.

876
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:30,859
[SPEAKER_10]: He went on to play basketball at the Division 3 University of Massachusetts at Boston, where he went on to become a three-time Division 3 All-American.

877
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,481
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an unheard of accolade.

878
01:05:33,081 --> 01:05:39,745
[SPEAKER_10]: After his graduation as the president, he went on to play professional basketball all over in Europe, but he always remained true to his roots here in Medford.

879
01:05:39,905 --> 01:05:44,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And he could always be seen coming back to Medford to visit friends and family alike.

880
01:05:44,428 --> 01:05:50,632
[SPEAKER_10]: He was someone that had the blue and white in his veins, who carried himself with pride and was a great friend to many.

881
01:05:51,793 --> 01:06:01,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I recall stories of Mr. Buckland often coming down to Bradshaw Street to visit Mr. Bates, and the stories that they tell about Ray could go on and on and on.

882
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:04,459
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was a great gentleman, a great person, a great friend, Mr. President.

883
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,921
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a loving husband, a loving father.

884
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:09,862
[SPEAKER_10]: His son had a very successful baseball career up at St.

885
01:06:09,902 --> 01:06:11,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary's in Lynn and Salem State.

886
01:06:11,652 --> 01:06:16,600
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you talk to Ray, that was one of the proudest things that he had to talk about was his son and the success that his son had in athletics.

887
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:19,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray had a great career in public service as the president.

888
01:06:22,368 --> 01:06:30,894
[SPEAKER_10]: a worker at the Lynn Housing Authority for a number of years, and he just recently retired and celebrated his retirement after 30 plus years of service to the community.

889
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:43,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So after his unexpected death, his family has certainly gone through a lot of trial and tribulation, and it's my hope that this council will join me and Councilor Scott Pelley in sending our condolences and support during this trying time.

890
01:06:43,923 --> 01:06:50,488
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank you all for allowing me the opportunity to present this resolution on behalf of the Buckland family.

891
01:06:51,002 --> 01:06:51,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

892
01:06:51,682 --> 01:06:52,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

893
01:06:53,063 --> 01:06:54,363
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

894
01:06:54,963 --> 01:06:56,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

895
01:06:57,184 --> 01:06:58,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are great words.

896
01:06:58,604 --> 01:07:03,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, I said it too often lately, but another legend lost.

897
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:12,868
[SPEAKER_19]: I was fortunate to live three houses down from the mythical Ray Buckland.

898
01:07:13,608 --> 01:07:16,489
[SPEAKER_19]: When you were a little kid and you came outside and there was this,

899
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:23,446
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe when I was a kid, he was 10 feet tall and he'd wear his Chuck Taylor's and he'd have a basketball in his hand.

900
01:07:23,947 --> 01:07:28,511
[SPEAKER_19]: And you actually thought that he, he could never be stopped.

901
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:33,675
[SPEAKER_19]: And when you approached him, he wasn't this big monster.

902
01:07:33,776 --> 01:07:38,380
[SPEAKER_19]: He was just this greatest person that could be, that could reach, um,

903
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:48,462
[SPEAKER_19]: reach any kid and it showed when he came back, when he came back from Europe and started coaching basketball for Medford High School.

904
01:07:49,182 --> 01:07:57,586
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a neighbor, I still remember, we had a neighbor that was a great young man, I won't say his name, and he was very tall.

905
01:07:57,646 --> 01:08:06,871
[SPEAKER_19]: And back then to have, I think, size 16 shoes and to be six foot seven and be in middle school was unheard of.

906
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:08,352
[SPEAKER_19]: And he was a little odd.

907
01:08:09,082 --> 01:08:16,466
[SPEAKER_19]: And at the time, you know, growing up and I'll never forget that we would see him and I'd say, hey, where'd you get those awesome sneakers?

908
01:08:16,486 --> 01:08:18,567
[SPEAKER_19]: And he'd say, Ray brought them over to me.

909
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,329
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the type of guy he was.

910
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:27,992
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, he'd see something and he'd do his little piece, little part, little part.

911
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:29,332
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know,

912
01:08:30,757 --> 01:08:39,821
[SPEAKER_19]: I've spent a lot of time in Lynn and Frazier Field with our successful baseball programs, whether it be through Babe Ruth or whether it be through the high school.

913
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:44,283
[SPEAKER_19]: And I still remember when John started playing, I still remember

914
01:08:46,044 --> 01:08:52,726
[SPEAKER_19]: some, that mythical figure walking down the parking lot and screaming out method Mustangs.

915
01:08:53,326 --> 01:09:00,247
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, there was Ray and leaning against the fence with the rest of the Mustangs and rooting on his method Mustangs team.

916
01:09:00,847 --> 01:09:07,769
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, you know, I was fortunate to see him just to just a month ago and sit with them and watch a few winnings of the ball game with them.

917
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:15,711
[SPEAKER_19]: But, uh, he was just a, like Adam said, uh, a great dad, great husband, a great friend loved his mom and dad.

918
01:09:17,431 --> 01:09:22,913
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, it's another legend lost and send our condolences to his family.

919
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:24,713
[SPEAKER_19]: He will be missed.

920
01:09:24,813 --> 01:09:25,313
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

921
01:09:26,774 --> 01:09:27,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

922
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:31,475
[SPEAKER_21]: And I want to send my condolences to the Buckner family.

923
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:36,936
[SPEAKER_21]: And like they said, he's a young man who was larger than life when he was a young kid.

924
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,557
[SPEAKER_21]: He was a legend to our community.

925
01:09:39,597 --> 01:09:44,598
[SPEAKER_21]: And as Councilor Capelli said, another legend who

926
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:49,143
[SPEAKER_21]: whose blood was blue and white, has passed on.

927
01:09:49,163 --> 01:09:52,825
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, my condolences to the Buckland family on his loss.

928
01:09:52,845 --> 01:09:56,748
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we could all rise and stand.

929
01:09:57,308 --> 01:10:06,233
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at Ray's obituary, there's a line in what you just said made me think of it, but I believe at the end of Ray's obituary, it said, heroes never die, but legends live forever.

930
01:10:07,393 --> 01:10:10,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And those are certainly words that represent Mr. Buckland.

931
01:10:12,676 --> 01:10:13,737
[SPEAKER_02]: All rise and stand, please.

932
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:26,055
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

933
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,377
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

934
01:10:34,081 --> 01:10:35,503
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

935
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:39,646
[SPEAKER_21]: 21454, offered by Vice President Knight, being so resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate.

936
01:10:40,097 --> 01:10:51,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Jason sissy Aaron 20 years of success as an owner proprietor of chromatic tattoo and body piercing, located at 365 Main Street in Medford, Vice President night, Mr President, thank you very much.

937
01:10:51,644 --> 01:10:56,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe that it was 20 years ago that Jason sissy or opened up chromatic tattoo.

938
01:10:56,607 --> 01:10:58,128
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like it was just yesterday that.

939
01:10:59,247 --> 01:11:08,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Prior councils were discussing the merits of the House of Payne tattoo application and the Painted Bird tattoo application and Chromatic Tattoos tattoo application.

940
01:11:08,594 --> 01:11:17,581
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we are 20 years later, Mr. President, and he's been operating very successfully in the area, in the region, without a glitch, no problems, no issues, no concerns.

941
01:11:17,601 --> 01:11:20,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, a very successful business, very highly rated on Yelp.

942
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:24,826
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got quite a cult following, but more importantly, Jason's a great guy.

943
01:11:26,118 --> 01:11:29,299
[SPEAKER_10]: contributing member to our society, contributing member to our community.

944
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:38,500
[SPEAKER_10]: He's very concerned about the cleanliness in front of his shop and the cleanliness along that stretch at Sammy Petrella Corner by Bella Ravioli, an Oasis restaurant.

945
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:41,141
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's someone who's not afraid to put his money where his mouth is.

946
01:11:41,241 --> 01:11:48,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And anytime you drive by the shop, you can see Jason out there picking up cigarette butts and making sure the trash is emptied and making sure that the garden beds are weeded.

947
01:11:49,322 --> 01:11:55,523
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's also running a very successful business, putting in hours and making sure that the residents of this community are provided a service.

948
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:02,185
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues in supporting me and approving this resolution, move for approval.

949
01:12:02,806 --> 01:12:03,586
[SPEAKER_21]: And for the discussion.

950
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:09,551
[SPEAKER_21]: And I say I had the opportunity to see Jason's dad this morning and I congratulate him for his son.

951
01:12:09,611 --> 01:12:15,836
[SPEAKER_21]: And I remember coming up here to speak long before I was a counselor in favor of this.

952
01:12:15,856 --> 01:12:19,579
[SPEAKER_21]: 20 years ago, tattooing was abnormal.

953
01:12:19,719 --> 01:12:21,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it is the norm.

954
01:12:22,401 --> 01:12:22,922
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think,

955
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:28,661
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to congratulate him for his 20 years and being a pioneer in the business.

956
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:32,323
[SPEAKER_21]: So congratulations for his success.

957
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:35,484
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

958
01:12:36,324 --> 01:12:37,565
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

959
01:12:37,605 --> 01:12:38,325
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

960
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:39,706
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

961
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:40,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

962
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:46,028
[SPEAKER_21]: 2-1-4455 offer Vice President Knight.

963
01:12:47,089 --> 01:12:50,550
[SPEAKER_21]: Being so resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence in recognition

964
01:12:51,184 --> 01:12:55,347
[SPEAKER_21]: of July 20 2021 being the third annual Brian rabbit day.

965
01:12:55,888 --> 01:12:56,548
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President night.

966
01:12:57,129 --> 01:12:58,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

967
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:03,894
[SPEAKER_10]: There aren't too many people in the history of this community that have their own day annually.

968
01:13:04,415 --> 01:13:05,856
[SPEAKER_10]: And Brian rabbit is one of those people.

969
01:13:06,316 --> 01:13:09,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Brian was a longtime employee of our public works department.

970
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:10,880
[SPEAKER_10]: He worked in the water department

971
01:13:11,394 --> 01:13:13,975
[SPEAKER_10]: And some people said he might have been the hottest working man in show business.

972
01:13:14,275 --> 01:13:20,498
[SPEAKER_10]: There wasn't a time that you didn't see Brian where he didn't have his work boots on, dirt in his hands, and he was ready to climb in or climb out of a hole.

973
01:13:21,138 --> 01:13:25,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And Brian was also someone that would have gave you the shirt off his back, the last dollar in his pocket if you needed it.

974
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:35,204
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why when Brian got sick, so many people came out to support him and to thank him for the type of person that he is and for all the contributions that he's made to our community.

975
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:41,006
[SPEAKER_10]: And in an effort to recognize Brian, Mayor Burke at the time established

976
01:13:42,178 --> 01:13:45,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Brian Rabbit Day, July 20th, 2019 was the first Brian Rabbit Day.

977
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:49,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been celebrated annually since then, Mr. President.

978
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:52,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want this to be something that gets forgotten with the change of administration.

979
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,881
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, I'm bringing this matter forward and I'm asking my council colleagues to support it.

980
01:13:57,422 --> 01:14:04,163
[SPEAKER_10]: We can have a moment of silence and recognition of Brian Rabbit, someone who's been loved in this community, who dedicated his whole entire life to working in this community.

981
01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:11,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully moving forward, Mr. President, we can have more celebrations like this in memory of Brian and his life.

982
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:12,745
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

983
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:19,930
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

984
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:21,311
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

985
01:14:22,231 --> 01:14:22,472
[SPEAKER_21]: Opposed?

986
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:23,072
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

987
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:24,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

988
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:41,913
[SPEAKER_21]: 2-1-4-5-6, offered by Councilor Beas.

989
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:53,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Being so resolved in the Memphis City Council that we send our deepest and sincere condolences to the family and friends of Joseph Placetti on his recent passing.

990
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:53,715
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Beas.

991
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

992
01:14:56,135 --> 01:15:04,436
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the lucky blessings of youth is that I am not often here putting condolence resolutions on the agenda.

993
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:07,437
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, you know,

994
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:14,228
[SPEAKER_13]: when I am in that position, it's very often a very sad situation.

995
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:23,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And all I can say is that Joseph Joey Blasetti as a 26 year old Medford resident passed away unexpectedly.

996
01:15:23,434 --> 01:15:35,863
[SPEAKER_13]: And suddenly he's a musician, comedian, a friend to very many people made a huge impact on many thousands of people here in Medford and across our area and across the country.

997
01:15:37,228 --> 01:15:41,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm close friends with his sister Brittany and friends with his sister Lauren.

998
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:49,294
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a lot of people, his parents, friends, many people in the city mourning and grieving his loss.

999
01:15:49,374 --> 01:15:57,838
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanted to take a moment to recognize it and hold a moment of silence and let everyone know as well.

1000
01:15:58,373 --> 01:15:59,634
[SPEAKER_13]: there will be services at St.

1001
01:15:59,674 --> 01:16:02,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Joe's, Saturday, July 24th at 11 a.m.

1002
01:16:02,878 --> 01:16:04,040
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you very much.

1003
01:16:05,701 --> 01:16:10,367
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's always a shame when a young man of his age passed away in our community.

1004
01:16:10,807 --> 01:16:15,593
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion by Councilor Bez, seconded by Vice President Knight, all in favor.

1005
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:17,635
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1006
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:18,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

1007
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

1008
01:16:33,668 --> 01:16:34,928
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falcone.

1009
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:37,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1010
01:16:37,269 --> 01:16:39,169
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have a quick question while we're under suspension.

1011
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:48,812
[SPEAKER_15]: I noticed we received a number of meeting notifications about, I believe, ongoing marijuana companies that are coming in.

1012
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:52,814
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know there was, I believe it was one meeting last week as well.

1013
01:16:52,834 --> 01:16:57,700
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I look at these, it looks like some of these have Zoom links and others maybe don't.

1014
01:16:58,241 --> 01:16:59,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we, is there any type of requirement?

1015
01:16:59,742 --> 01:17:07,151
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we're starting to head more with our meetings and all the public meetings do have Zoom links or a Zoom component to them.

1016
01:17:07,942 --> 01:17:15,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so everybody can see in the interest of transparency what's going on and if they have questions, they can weigh in and give their opinions as well.

1017
01:17:16,024 --> 01:17:27,708
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just noticed when I look at these here, there's two of these that are before us, I shouldn't say before us, they're just notifications, but we've been notified two of these have Zoom links, one of them clearly does not.

1018
01:17:27,788 --> 01:17:34,050
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was wondering if there's any type of requirement, or if you know of any type of requirement as to whether or not there is a Zoom component?

1019
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,171
[SPEAKER_21]: If I can recall, I thought that,

1020
01:17:38,182 --> 01:17:41,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Each company was supposed to have their own public.

1021
01:17:42,005 --> 01:17:47,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that the Cannabis Advisory Commission was supposed to define those parameters.

1022
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:49,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1023
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:50,532
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1024
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:52,754
[SPEAKER_21]: I would think that everybody should have a link.

1025
01:17:53,114 --> 01:17:56,637
[SPEAKER_21]: So everybody knows it is open and transparent.

1026
01:17:57,558 --> 01:18:01,521
[SPEAKER_21]: So maybe it's something that we should pass on to the committee.

1027
01:18:01,721 --> 01:18:03,243
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could pass it on to the committee.

1028
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,684
[SPEAKER_15]: I just noticed like there's a meeting here.

1029
01:18:04,744 --> 01:18:05,845
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it is.

1030
01:18:08,992 --> 01:18:22,357
[SPEAKER_21]: actually this month this one was is tomorrow I think yeah there's no link to it so I just thought that that was just click if you could pass this on to the committee to make sure that everybody has a zoom link.

1031
01:18:23,898 --> 01:18:24,838
[SPEAKER_21]: Even the ones at City Hall.

1032
01:18:25,599 --> 01:18:26,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

1033
01:18:27,075 --> 01:18:32,777
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could add to that message that the city administration posts these on the city events calendar on the city website as well.

1034
01:18:33,258 --> 01:18:33,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1035
01:18:33,578 --> 01:18:42,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I know there was one meeting last week and I don't think that had a zoom like, and I noticed that some residents have been getting notified.

1036
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:48,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause I have received a couple of calls from some residents questioning, you know, didn't even know about it.

1037
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:57,998
[SPEAKER_15]: So exactly, just people, residents should have the opportunity to attend these either in person or if they can't via Zoom and it should be an option.

1038
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:07,245
[SPEAKER_15]: I know all of our meetings have a Zoom component and just in the interest of transparency, people know what's going on, they can weigh in.

1039
01:19:07,265 --> 01:19:09,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe that public hearings dictated by state law.

1040
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:13,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guidelines and requirements dictated by state law are pretty clear.

1041
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:17,973
[SPEAKER_10]: They're outlined in, you know, I think 44A section 5 about public hearings.

1042
01:19:18,113 --> 01:19:25,419
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that that's the parameters that they're going by.

1043
01:19:25,999 --> 01:19:30,703
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I could, I happen to be out today on something.

1044
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:34,830
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think, some people don't understand.

1045
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:39,491
[SPEAKER_21]: This was not an issue put forward by the Medford City Council.

1046
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:43,592
[SPEAKER_21]: This is something that was voted in by the residents of Medford.

1047
01:19:44,272 --> 01:19:48,773
[SPEAKER_21]: And as city councilors, it was our job to put it forward.

1048
01:19:48,793 --> 01:19:58,015
[SPEAKER_21]: So this wasn't something that we put in, because like I say, I did run into a person today and very upset that this was happening and why the city council did this.

1049
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:01,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Just so everybody knows that this was voted in.

1050
01:20:01,727 --> 01:20:02,588
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

1051
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:06,271
[SPEAKER_15]: My point is just making sure that everyone has access to these meetings.

1052
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:06,852
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the big thing.

1053
01:20:07,112 --> 01:20:07,292
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1054
01:20:07,532 --> 01:20:07,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1055
01:20:08,093 --> 01:20:08,373
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1056
01:20:08,693 --> 01:20:11,036
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion to revert back to regular business.

1057
01:20:13,498 --> 01:20:14,078
[SPEAKER_21]: All in favor.

1058
01:20:15,499 --> 01:20:16,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

1059
01:20:16,761 --> 01:20:17,821
[SPEAKER_21]: Communications from the mayor.

1060
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:19,743
[SPEAKER_21]: Personnel ordinances.

1061
01:20:23,647 --> 01:20:25,068
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, city councilors.

1062
01:20:25,838 --> 01:20:43,425
[SPEAKER_21]: I respectfully request and recommend that the city council approves the following amendments to revise ordinance entitled personnel article two classification and communication plan section 6633 entitled offices employees non-union by making the following amendments.

1063
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:45,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment A, new positions.

1064
01:20:48,848 --> 01:20:52,569
[SPEAKER_21]: I know Mayor Longo Kern is on the call.

1065
01:20:52,609 --> 01:20:54,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Mary, would you like to join in?

1066
01:20:58,127 --> 01:20:58,908
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Madam Mayor.

1067
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:08,899
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so class CAF 17 presently appears as CAF 17 vacant.

1068
01:21:09,139 --> 01:21:13,044
[SPEAKER_21]: The language of CAF 17 shall be amended to read as follows.

1069
01:21:13,144 --> 01:21:17,269
[SPEAKER_21]: CAF 17, Director of Parking Facilities Manager.

1070
01:21:17,889 --> 01:21:19,051
[SPEAKER_21]: Questions on the first one.

1071
01:21:19,571 --> 01:21:24,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I just think it's important to point out that the salary for these two positions would be $100,928.70 annual per position.

1072
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:24,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Say that again.

1073
01:21:24,853 --> 01:21:25,353
[SPEAKER_10]: $103,928.70 per position annually.

1074
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:25,513
[SPEAKER_10]: On CAF 17.

1075
01:21:25,553 --> 01:21:26,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

1076
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:26,713
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

1077
01:21:26,753 --> 01:21:29,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, any further questions on this one before we move on?

1078
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:30,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, amendment B, new and amended positions.

1079
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:51,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Classification CAF 7 presently appears as follows.

1080
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,141
[SPEAKER_21]: CAF 7 parking clerk, business manager.

1081
01:21:54,862 --> 01:22:02,766
[SPEAKER_21]: The language of CAF 7 shall be amended to delete the following positions of parking clerk and to read as follows.

1082
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:09,830
[SPEAKER_21]: CAF 7, business manager, parking enforcement officer, recreation facilities coordinator.

1083
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:11,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Questions on amendment B.

1084
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:25,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I just think it's important to point out that this position of parking enforcement officer in recreations facilities coordinator would bring a salary of $64,666 and 68 cents number one.

1085
01:22:26,565 --> 01:22:30,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, I'd like to ask why the position of parking clerk is being proposed to be eliminated.

1086
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:35,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Number three, recreational facilities coordinator is nothing more than pork.

1087
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:38,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing more than pork, Mr. President.

1088
01:22:39,202 --> 01:22:43,345
[SPEAKER_10]: $65,000 to pay somebody to do a job that somebody was already doing as part of their salary.

1089
01:22:43,665 --> 01:22:44,866
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no need for the position.

1090
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:46,807
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be a program coordinator's position.

1091
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:49,189
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be a program coordinator's position.

1092
01:22:49,209 --> 01:22:58,175
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be someone that's delivering programming for the youth of this community, programming to the recreation department, not scheduling fields for $65,000 a year when we had somebody that was already doing that.

1093
01:22:59,732 --> 01:23:11,618
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so I don't understand the reasoning or the motive behind creating this position, other than the fact that it seems like it's a nice new job to create for somebody.

1094
01:23:12,138 --> 01:23:16,000
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the end of the day, someone was doing it, Mr. President, for $65,000 a year.

1095
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,821
[SPEAKER_10]: We had somebody doing it for $0 a year as part of their salary.

1096
01:23:19,262 --> 01:23:21,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't understand why we're bringing this position forward.

1097
01:23:21,683 --> 01:23:23,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Quite frankly, I don't think we need it.

1098
01:23:24,328 --> 01:23:29,114
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm not gonna be able to support it this evening, the creation of the recreational facilities coordinator position.

1099
01:23:30,136 --> 01:23:33,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Mr. President, looking at this, I don't see a need to eliminate.

1100
01:23:34,157 --> 01:23:35,117
[SPEAKER_10]: the title of parking clerk.

1101
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,618
[SPEAKER_10]: We can keep it in the CAF as well.

1102
01:23:37,098 --> 01:23:39,540
[SPEAKER_10]: We can have a parking clerk and we can have a parking enforcement officer.

1103
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:48,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see a need to eliminate the parking clerk title because we're gonna need a parking clerk if we're gonna have in-house parking programming.

1104
01:23:49,044 --> 01:23:59,449
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, my recommendation would be to strike the position of recreational facilities coordinator from the document and to keep parking clerk in the document.

1105
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:00,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1106
01:24:00,849 --> 01:24:01,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll put that in the form of a motion.

1107
01:24:02,723 --> 01:24:03,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor Locario, would you like to speak on that?

1108
01:24:07,224 --> 01:24:08,704
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, can you unmute the man?

1109
01:24:16,346 --> 01:24:19,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Carviello and members of the city council.

1110
01:24:20,007 --> 01:24:31,410
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here to support the paper, all except the title change part for the payroll director.

1111
01:24:34,825 --> 01:24:37,548
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

1112
01:24:38,049 --> 01:24:42,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment B. Did you want to speak on anything on Amendment B?

1113
01:24:43,094 --> 01:24:45,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here for the entire paper.

1114
01:24:45,457 --> 01:24:51,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important to fulfill the promise I made to get as many positions as I could.

1115
01:24:52,745 --> 01:24:55,388
[SPEAKER_08]: CAF changed accordingly so we can move forward.

1116
01:24:56,957 --> 01:24:58,518
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's why I am here tonight.

1117
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:13,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I think with regards to that one issue with the facilities coordinator recreation, this will be a fourth position in the recreation department, one that will alleviate some of the job duties of

1118
01:25:14,265 --> 01:25:24,451
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, one person having a full-time job, coordinating the field of dreams, and who also is trying to handle Hormel and the rink.

1119
01:25:24,951 --> 01:25:27,233
[SPEAKER_08]: There is nothing whatsoever against that person.

1120
01:25:27,253 --> 01:25:34,497
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a whole lot of duties that have been thrown on one person over the last several years, especially during tough economic times.

1121
01:25:34,957 --> 01:25:41,461
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're trying to do here is create programming year round for La Conte Rink.

1122
01:25:41,982 --> 01:25:47,664
[SPEAKER_08]: which we feel is definitely, people are excited about, people want to see happen.

1123
01:25:48,265 --> 01:25:50,246
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is important for us.

1124
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:58,969
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanna create more recreational programming in all the free hours that are available at the rink, as well as somebody to handle Hormel.

1125
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:05,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So this would be a program coordinator type position anyway, labeled recreation facilities coordinator.

1126
01:26:07,193 --> 01:26:11,535
[SPEAKER_10]: So the program coordinator position, we're just gonna call it a facilities

1127
01:26:12,245 --> 01:26:13,126
[SPEAKER_10]: coordinator position.

1128
01:26:13,266 --> 01:26:15,627
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess they're not going to be doing the duties that they're assigned.

1129
01:26:16,148 --> 01:26:16,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they are.

1130
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:17,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm confused.

1131
01:26:17,529 --> 01:26:24,193
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, in terms of the, um, year round programming at La Conte rink, um, it's been brought to my attention.

1132
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:32,479
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of discussion about privatizing La Conte rink and, um, a longterm lease agreement with the Boston Imperials to allow them to use this as their home rink.

1133
01:26:32,519 --> 01:26:33,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any truth to that?

1134
01:26:35,561 --> 01:26:40,745
[SPEAKER_08]: No conversations about no, no conversations at all about the privatization of La Conte

1135
01:26:42,657 --> 01:26:46,838
[SPEAKER_08]: about having the Imperials, I'm not aware of the Imperials.

1136
01:26:47,138 --> 01:26:59,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have conversations probably right before COVID with Tufts University, maybe doing some work and taking some hours weekly, but I myself am not aware of anything with regards to the Imperials.

1137
01:27:01,103 --> 01:27:08,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm talking about privatization of rank operations, whether it be the Boston Imperials or anybody else, has there been a discussion about privatizing the rank operations?

1138
01:27:08,906 --> 01:27:09,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than maybe

1139
01:27:10,652 --> 01:27:17,936
[SPEAKER_08]: two to five minute conversation between the rec director and myself because of one person reaching out, no.

1140
01:27:20,257 --> 01:27:21,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1141
01:27:22,418 --> 01:27:22,599
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1142
01:27:23,139 --> 01:27:26,181
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further discussion on amendment B?

1143
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:27,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor did you want to make an amendment?

1144
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:29,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

1145
01:27:30,043 --> 01:27:33,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So your motion was to strike the position recreation facilities coordinator.

1146
01:27:34,105 --> 01:27:36,866
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor just said, it's really going to be a program coordinator's position anyway.

1147
01:27:36,946 --> 01:27:37,847
[SPEAKER_10]: We already have a title for that.

1148
01:27:38,715 --> 01:27:39,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know.

1149
01:27:39,395 --> 01:27:42,856
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is a recreation facilities coordinator.

1150
01:27:42,876 --> 01:27:52,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that that is the majority of the job because there is a ton of programming already for Hamel that needs to be organized as well as La Conte Rink.

1151
01:27:52,979 --> 01:28:05,863
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're hoping to open the rink year round and create some recreational programming, whether that would be through Kevin and Danny and Kate on the side, but it would still be

1152
01:28:06,883 --> 01:28:12,585
[SPEAKER_08]: the recreation facilities coordinator that would obviously be a bit of a part of that.

1153
01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:16,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this is extremely important.

1154
01:28:16,267 --> 01:28:19,408
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been in consult with the rec department.

1155
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:21,449
[SPEAKER_08]: This is exactly what they're hoping.

1156
01:28:22,169 --> 01:28:30,092
[SPEAKER_08]: The position was labeled, and it's a fourth person in that department that could help move Bakanchi Rink, you know,

1157
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:34,906
[SPEAKER_08]: do more improvements and also open it year round, which we're extremely excited about.

1158
01:28:34,986 --> 01:28:36,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And so isn't the community.

1159
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:45,993
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would just ask for your support on this paper, you know, it was explained like this in the budget and we are here to just get your support and changing the calf.

1160
01:28:48,065 --> 01:28:49,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, it's not a maintenance position.

1161
01:28:49,966 --> 01:28:51,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what improvements they're gonna be doing down the rink.

1162
01:28:51,788 --> 01:28:54,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they're gonna be painting and fixing benches and sweeping and cleaning.

1163
01:28:55,290 --> 01:29:02,616
[SPEAKER_10]: But like I said, we had the athletic director that was, since we've taken over all the fields in the rink, he was doing it as part of his salary.

1164
01:29:02,636 --> 01:29:05,418
[SPEAKER_10]: This is $65,000 of expenditures that I don't think we need to make.

1165
01:29:05,738 --> 01:29:07,479
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I offer the amendment.

1166
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:13,363
[SPEAKER_21]: So Councilor Knight has amended amendment B to remove the,

1167
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:16,483
[SPEAKER_21]: recreation facilities coordinator.

1168
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:17,944
[SPEAKER_21]: And to keep the parking clerk position.

1169
01:29:17,984 --> 01:29:19,225
[SPEAKER_21]: And to keep the parking clerk.

1170
01:29:21,366 --> 01:29:23,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Before the roll is called, if I can just add one thing.

1171
01:29:23,607 --> 01:29:30,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I'm incorrect, but I think you might be talking about step five on the salary that you're mentioning, Councilor Knight.

1172
01:29:33,533 --> 01:29:40,998
[SPEAKER_08]: So step one would be about, if I'm correct, 53, seven?

1173
01:29:41,578 --> 01:29:41,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Cap seven.

1174
01:29:44,816 --> 01:29:46,437
[SPEAKER_21]: parking enforcement officer.

1175
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,182
[SPEAKER_19]: The position for recreation is 53 to 64.

1176
01:29:51,362 --> 01:29:53,363
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

1177
01:29:54,224 --> 01:29:56,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's I just wanted to make sure everybody is clear on that.

1178
01:29:59,068 --> 01:30:02,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so Council night is amended it to.

1179
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:20,173
[SPEAKER_19]: remove the the facility recreation facilities coordinator, and keep the parking enforcement officer, Mr. Mr President, if I can, I completely understand what counsel nights going with this but I think that looking at the.

1180
01:30:21,194 --> 01:30:42,762
[SPEAKER_19]: the description and talking to the director, I think that this person's role, not only opening the rink full time, full year, but also providing much needed programming with the middle school sites on site and having a dedicated person there to assist with that.

1181
01:30:44,543 --> 01:30:59,607
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, sometimes you try to look at the benefits and something that you feel that, I don't know what Councilor Knight's feeling and the reason why, but I think that this is a beneficial position, something that I'll be supporting tonight.

1182
01:30:59,807 --> 01:31:04,409
[SPEAKER_10]: One information, I'm not saying don't put a fourth person in recreation, I'm just saying make it a program coordinator.

1183
01:31:04,449 --> 01:31:08,930
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need to hire a $65,000 scheduler when we had someone doing it for free.

1184
01:31:13,428 --> 01:31:14,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the department to grow.

1185
01:31:14,609 --> 01:31:15,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I want them to have more personnel.

1186
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:19,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want the personnel to be utilized in a position where we're delivering a service to the public.

1187
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:20,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1188
01:31:20,794 --> 01:31:21,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1189
01:31:21,115 --> 01:31:22,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address of the record, please.

1190
01:31:24,617 --> 01:31:27,700
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Kevin Bailey.

1191
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:35,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the recreation director for the city of Medford on 34th Street.

1192
01:31:43,007 --> 01:31:45,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to talk a little bit about the position as well.

1193
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:50,012
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, our department has been growing tremendously over the past couple of years.

1194
01:31:50,613 --> 01:32:02,561
[SPEAKER_01]: At that last budget meeting, as we said, on our programming, we have gone from just the past few years of running between two to 300 people per session in our programs, and we're now this summer, close to 800 people.

1195
01:32:03,402 --> 01:32:05,763
[SPEAKER_01]: So our department itself has really grown tremendously.

1196
01:32:06,564 --> 01:32:10,567
[SPEAKER_01]: With this new change, we are gonna be running Hormel and Oconee Rink

1197
01:32:11,594 --> 01:32:16,837
[SPEAKER_01]: and we know that the person who was in charge previously had an enormous amount of work on his plate.

1198
01:32:17,638 --> 01:32:20,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them really good credit on the amount of work that he had to do.

1199
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:37,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping by having this fourth full-time person using the software that we have with MyRocket being able to do online scheduling, but having some consistency between other city facilities for recreational needs would fall into the MyRocket and into Method Recreation website.

1200
01:32:38,671 --> 01:32:40,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel by having this person in here,

1201
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:51,289
[SPEAKER_01]: will help out with the scheduling, but also the staffing as well, to have that person on the Hormel campus to be able to check on the Hormel staff, the people who are staffing at Laconie Rink.

1202
01:32:52,029 --> 01:32:57,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And as mentioned, we can grow those programs as well, just like when we took over the recreation center.

1203
01:32:57,374 --> 01:32:59,275
[SPEAKER_10]: So are they gonna have supervisory responsibility?

1204
01:33:00,316 --> 01:33:03,039
[SPEAKER_01]: They will have some supervisory on the part-time staff, yes.

1205
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:09,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe the job description does have that on it, that they'll be helping with the Zamboni drivers.

1206
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:15,164
[SPEAKER_01]: as the previous manager done.

1207
01:33:15,244 --> 01:33:16,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further questions from Mr. Bailey?

1208
01:33:20,368 --> 01:33:22,650
[SPEAKER_10]: The recreation coordinator is going to be responsible for the scheduling.

1209
01:33:23,188 --> 01:33:28,330
[SPEAKER_10]: of the facilities and also the staffing of the part-time employees and the oversight of the part-time employees?

1210
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:36,512
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have the director, myself, and the assistant director who will also be still overseeing the staff as usual, but helping out with the scheduling of the day-to-day functions.

1211
01:33:36,532 --> 01:33:39,273
[SPEAKER_10]: And presently, do you oversee the staff at Hormel and La Conte?

1212
01:33:39,933 --> 01:33:40,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry?

1213
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:42,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Presently, you oversee the staff at Hormel and La Conte?

1214
01:33:42,594 --> 01:33:43,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.

1215
01:33:43,714 --> 01:33:44,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1216
01:33:44,415 --> 01:33:46,135
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

1217
01:33:46,855 --> 01:33:47,676
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further discussion?

1218
01:33:48,516 --> 01:33:50,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Any questions for Mr. Bailey?

1219
01:33:51,637 --> 01:33:52,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1220
01:33:52,774 --> 01:33:53,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1221
01:33:54,074 --> 01:33:56,695
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, do we wanna vote on this separately or we wanna wait till the end?

1222
01:33:59,715 --> 01:34:12,618
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so motion has been made by Vice President Knight to eliminate the Recreation Facilities Coordinator and to keep the parking enforcement clerk, is that correct?

1223
01:34:13,678 --> 01:34:16,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Separate them if you want, Mr. President, then I'm sure people don't care about the parking clerk job.

1224
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:21,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

1225
01:34:24,485 --> 01:34:26,847
[SPEAKER_21]: seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1226
01:34:28,568 --> 01:34:29,429
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor.

1227
01:34:29,449 --> 01:34:32,131
[SPEAKER_18]: You want the motion to sever?

1228
01:34:32,271 --> 01:34:36,314
[SPEAKER_21]: So the motion is to sever the Recreation Facilities Coordinator.

1229
01:34:36,354 --> 01:34:37,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And keep the clerk.

1230
01:34:49,163 --> 01:34:55,626
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a motion to keep the clerk and a motion to eliminate the facilities coordinator.

1231
01:34:56,086 --> 01:34:56,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1232
01:34:57,687 --> 01:35:05,170
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so on the first vote to keep the clerk, is that correct?

1233
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:06,150
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

1234
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:07,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1235
01:35:07,751 --> 01:35:08,491
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

1236
01:35:08,551 --> 01:35:17,155
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to eliminate the recreation facilities coordinator, roll call vote has been requested by Vice President Knight.

1237
01:35:20,136 --> 01:35:23,977
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do a call vote on both cases appointments.

1238
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,017
[SPEAKER_21]: I would think, yeah.

1239
01:35:25,057 --> 01:35:30,518
[SPEAKER_21]: Do the recording, so please call the call.

1240

01:36:48,457 --> 01:36:54,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Treasurer-Collector, Director of Budget, CPO, Director of Public Health and Elder Services, and Chief Assessor.

1271
01:36:54,622 --> 01:37:03,809
[SPEAKER_21]: The language of CAF 19 shall be amended to delete the position Director, Budget, CPO, and to appear as the following, as follows.

1272
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:16,560
[SPEAKER_21]: CAF 19, City Clerk, Treasurer-Collector, Director of Public Health and Elder Services, Chief Assessor, Chief People Officer.

1273
01:37:22,143 --> 01:37:28,027
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to refer amendment C to a committee of the whole by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

1274
01:37:29,087 --> 01:37:29,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

1275
01:37:29,848 --> 01:37:31,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Marks.

1276
01:37:31,169 --> 01:37:31,929
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

1277
01:37:31,949 --> 01:37:32,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1278
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:34,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

1279
01:37:35,111 --> 01:37:37,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call, please.

1280
01:37:37,052 --> 01:37:39,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Beavers has requested a roll call vote.

1281
01:37:40,374 --> 01:37:41,815
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, before we call the roll.

1282
01:37:43,056 --> 01:37:43,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Madam Mayor.

1283
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to speak in favor of this change.

1284
01:37:50,123 --> 01:38:05,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief people officer is the name that is commonly used for HR director and in a number of other cities and towns, and it's a standard language, and it was this specific title was

1285
01:38:07,912 --> 01:38:17,098
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, request of the city council that we split HR and diversity into two separate departments, which we took under advisement.

1286
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:19,840
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked through it and we ended up doing it.

1287
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,181
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two separate budgets.

1288
01:38:21,261 --> 01:38:30,067
[SPEAKER_08]: We are hopefully after tonight going to be able to hire the diversity director and have a chief people officer

1289
01:38:30,573 --> 01:38:40,536
[SPEAKER_08]: approved so that we can really start to move these two departments forward, as this has been an issue since January when I initially tried to get this CAF changed.

1290
01:38:41,336 --> 01:38:46,398
[SPEAKER_08]: So I respectfully request that we don't stall any longer and we move forward.

1291
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:53,220
[SPEAKER_08]: In the future, too, with CAFs, I'm open to suggestions on specific names because

1292
01:38:53,948 --> 01:39:04,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanna be able to do the work and get things off the ground and get things moving forward versus just another meeting on it since it's been going on since January.

1293
01:39:04,695 --> 01:39:06,756
[SPEAKER_08]: This was something that the council requested.

1294
01:39:06,796 --> 01:39:09,978
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the name we chose for this singular department.

1295
01:39:10,038 --> 01:39:11,439
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just ask that you move forward.

1296
01:39:11,459 --> 01:39:15,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know, I think Mr. Osborne is present in the audience.

1297
01:39:15,302 --> 01:39:19,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And if he has anything more to add, I would just respectfully ask that you consider moving this forward.

1298
01:39:20,965 --> 01:39:21,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1299
01:39:22,565 --> 01:39:22,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1300
01:39:23,105 --> 01:39:23,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1301
01:39:23,706 --> 01:39:26,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I just had a question.

1302
01:39:26,288 --> 01:39:28,550
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the chief people officer.

1303
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:31,412
[SPEAKER_10]: So the people that he'd be the chief of would be the staff, right?

1304
01:39:31,452 --> 01:39:32,172
[SPEAKER_10]: The staff in the building.

1305
01:39:34,594 --> 01:39:36,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief people officer is human resource director.

1306
01:39:36,896 --> 01:39:38,937
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's another name for a human resource director.

1307
01:39:39,738 --> 01:39:42,100
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the chief people officer.

1308
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,141
[SPEAKER_10]: The people that he's the officer of is the staff, right?

1309
01:39:44,161 --> 01:39:45,102
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's the chief of staff.

1310
01:39:45,462 --> 01:39:46,403
[SPEAKER_10]: We already have one of those, don't we?

1311
01:39:48,961 --> 01:39:55,989
[SPEAKER_08]: We have somebody that's titled the chief of staff, but human resource director is handles most of the human resources.

1312
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:58,452
[SPEAKER_10]: So why don't we just call the human resource director.

1313
01:40:01,077 --> 01:40:01,878
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing.

1314
01:40:02,298 --> 01:40:04,321
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another name for human resource director.

1315
01:40:04,721 --> 01:40:18,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the up and coming way to actually Tyler Lovell, who's our assistant, who is our new hire and assistant CFO, is the one who said this, told us that this is the best way.

1316
01:40:18,817 --> 01:40:22,020
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't put words in his mouth, but this is,

1317
01:40:22,941 --> 01:40:24,702
[SPEAKER_08]: it's another name for human resource director.

1318
01:40:25,022 --> 01:40:27,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the one we just happened to go with.

1319
01:40:27,184 --> 01:40:31,466
[SPEAKER_08]: If the council was very clear on that, it would be the human resource director.

1320
01:40:32,427 --> 01:40:35,048
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not opposed to that either.

1321
01:40:35,068 --> 01:40:36,669
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, this is what we chose.

1322
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:41,672
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that's been ongoing since January, and we hope you approve it.

1323
01:40:41,732 --> 01:40:43,453
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another name for a human resource director.

1324
01:40:44,674 --> 01:40:44,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1325
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:45,855
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Morrell.

1326
01:40:46,515 --> 01:40:47,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1327
01:40:47,175 --> 01:40:49,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a question about the director budget slash CPO.

1328
01:40:49,777 --> 01:40:55,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that that's going away because that was a title that reflects staffing needs that are no longer happening.

1329
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:56,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

1330
01:41:00,092 --> 01:41:01,192
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

1331
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:05,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're trying to clean up all the line items, remove duplicates.

1332
01:41:06,034 --> 01:41:10,696
[SPEAKER_08]: So we tried to do as much as we could for this meeting, and there'll be more before you over the next several meetings.

1333
01:41:10,956 --> 01:41:25,661
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll probably be doing this all through the fall because as you dig in, this is definitely a historic problem that we've been uncovering more issues that it's gonna take quite a while to fix this completely.

1334
01:41:25,681 --> 01:41:27,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1335
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:31,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening name and address of the record please.

1336
01:41:31,861 --> 01:41:40,169
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Council President, my name is Neil Osborne, and I am currently in the position of not having a title.

1337
01:41:43,352 --> 01:41:50,318
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't have a title that has been agreed upon by every council member.

1338
01:41:51,019 --> 01:41:52,981
[SPEAKER_16]: I have been working for the city for

1339
01:41:53,752 --> 01:41:54,653
[SPEAKER_16]: more than four years.

1340
01:41:55,393 --> 01:42:02,738
[SPEAKER_16]: When there was an opportunity asked of me to do additional work, I readily agreed to do it.

1341
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:08,262
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor of the city has come before you with different title changes.

1342
01:42:09,043 --> 01:42:18,330
[SPEAKER_16]: At the time when she took over as the new mayor, there were three individuals that took on additional workloads and they were acting.

1343
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:19,771
[SPEAKER_16]: I was one of them.

1344
01:42:20,475 --> 01:42:22,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Those other two individuals now have titles.

1345
01:42:23,097 --> 01:42:38,751
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think this simply reflects reality of the work that has been done by myself in my department to allow me to actually have a title that is respectful of the work and respectful of the type of community that we have.

1346
01:42:39,091 --> 01:42:45,817
[SPEAKER_16]: When I tell people about being a chief people officer for the city of Medford, they are proud of the work that has been done.

1347
01:42:46,432 --> 01:42:51,036
[SPEAKER_16]: and the hope that there will be more progressive work done in that position.

1348
01:42:51,076 --> 01:42:58,081
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully you won't delay that and allow me to have the respect of the title for the work that I've been doing for this community.

1349
01:42:59,022 --> 01:43:00,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1350
01:43:00,363 --> 01:43:03,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President, I certainly have no problem with the title.

1351
01:43:03,246 --> 01:43:07,129
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the rate of compensation that I question.

1352
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:12,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Council President, this is only reflecting the two budgets you've passed for the past two years

1353
01:43:12,747 --> 01:43:19,528
[SPEAKER_16]: It simply makes it the reality of the budgets you have passed already twice, two years in a row.

1354
01:43:19,548 --> 01:43:19,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1355
01:43:21,068 --> 01:43:21,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor.

1356
01:43:21,829 --> 01:43:24,009
[SPEAKER_03]: But the position titles have changed.

1357
01:43:24,629 --> 01:43:25,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you not agree with that?

1358
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:29,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the position titles have not been finalized.

1359
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:31,750
[SPEAKER_03]: They have changed, correct?

1360
01:43:32,611 --> 01:43:40,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So two months ago, we were talking about having a diversity slash human resource, and you spoke in favor of that.

1361
01:43:42,224 --> 01:43:47,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're having a people person, chief people officer.

1362
01:43:48,348 --> 01:43:49,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're speaking in favor of that.

1363
01:43:50,089 --> 01:43:54,672
[SPEAKER_03]: The one consistent thing has been your salary has increased from day one.

1364
01:43:55,232 --> 01:43:56,593
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been the one consistent thing.

1365
01:43:56,833 --> 01:44:03,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may not have a title, but your salary has been consistent over that period of time.

1366
01:44:03,537 --> 01:44:05,619
[SPEAKER_03]: That was not approved by this council.

1367
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:09,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That was not approved by this council.

1368
01:44:09,641 --> 01:44:11,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to the city solicitor,

1369
01:44:11,809 --> 01:44:13,913
[SPEAKER_03]: it needed to be approved.

1370
01:44:13,993 --> 01:44:16,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not up for debate.

1371
01:44:17,059 --> 01:44:21,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the city solicitor's legal opinion, which is not a precedent for debate.

1372
01:44:21,467 --> 01:44:24,233
[SPEAKER_16]: But the work never changed.

1373
01:44:25,067 --> 01:44:28,809
[SPEAKER_16]: The amount of work I have done for the city absolutely has not changed.

1374
01:44:28,849 --> 01:44:29,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not questioning your work.

1375
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not questioning your worth.

1376
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:32,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not questioning your ethics.

1377
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:34,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not questioning any of that, just so you know, Ms.

1378
01:44:34,652 --> 01:44:34,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Osborne.

1379
01:44:35,392 --> 01:44:38,294
[SPEAKER_03]: But my question is regarding policy and procedure.

1380
01:44:38,854 --> 01:44:43,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And clearly the policy and procedure has not been followed by this administration.

1381
01:44:43,837 --> 01:44:45,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're trying to get to the bottom of.

1382
01:44:45,578 --> 01:44:52,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though there may be a sense of frustration because the title is not there, there is a process that we have to follow.

1383
01:44:54,818 --> 01:45:00,283
[SPEAKER_18]: to have a process in place, it needed to flow, and that has not happened.

1384
01:45:01,164 --> 01:45:15,800
[SPEAKER_16]: So the Council President, is not this the process, that the amendments are being brought to the Council, and I think that's what is being asked of all of you, is to adopt what has happened in the past, to reflect the work, and to reflect that

1385
01:45:16,368 --> 01:45:18,269
[SPEAKER_16]: This particular job needs a title.

1386
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:20,331
[SPEAKER_10]: In the process, if I could.

1387
01:45:20,351 --> 01:45:25,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight, has the work that Mr. Durham has done been reflected in his compensation?

1388
01:45:25,894 --> 01:45:26,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Has he been made whole?

1389
01:45:27,215 --> 01:45:28,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, is that the issue?

1390
01:45:28,336 --> 01:45:28,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1391
01:45:29,817 --> 01:45:30,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1392
01:45:31,538 --> 01:45:33,339
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's not owed from 2-120 to 7-920?

1393
01:45:33,399 --> 01:45:39,023
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, that's a personnel matter.

1394
01:45:39,063 --> 01:45:40,564
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not on the table right now.

1395
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,405
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to violate open meeting law.

1396
01:45:46,168 --> 01:45:50,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I believe we're at a roll call vote, and I think we should just take the vote.

1397
01:45:50,651 --> 01:45:50,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1398
01:45:52,092 --> 01:45:53,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks has the floor.

1399
01:45:53,573 --> 01:45:55,114
[SPEAKER_13]: We're already in the middle of a vote.

1400
01:45:55,654 --> 01:45:56,675
[SPEAKER_21]: The vote had not started.

1401
01:45:56,835 --> 01:45:58,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks has the floor.

1402
01:45:59,797 --> 01:46:01,819
[SPEAKER_21]: There was no voice.

1403
01:46:01,859 --> 01:46:06,402
[SPEAKER_21]: You requested a roll call vote, and the roll call vote had not started.

1404
01:46:07,803 --> 01:46:09,123
[SPEAKER_21]: So Councilor Marks still has the floor.

1405
01:46:10,384 --> 01:46:14,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I just wanted to make the point, Mr. President,

1406
01:46:14,787 --> 01:46:20,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I as one member, I can't speak for my colleagues, was never opposed to creating a position title.

1407
01:46:21,029 --> 01:46:29,971
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was opposed to Mr. President is paying someone out of a calf, paying someone out of a calf that was never approved by this council.

1408
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:34,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's always been the way it's been working in this community.

1409
01:46:34,332 --> 01:46:36,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's no fault of Mr. Osborne.

1410
01:46:37,053 --> 01:46:41,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even referring to Mr. Osborne because there are other positions as well.

1411
01:46:41,918 --> 01:46:45,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And those positions are eventually going to be before us as well, Mr. President.

1412
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:47,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has nothing to do with Mr. Osborne.

1413
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:51,480
[SPEAKER_03]: He happened to come up here tonight because he was probably asked by the mayor to come up.

1414
01:46:51,920 --> 01:47:01,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But this has nothing to do with the person in the position, Mr. President, but all to do with following policy and procedure, which is very important in the community.

1415
01:47:01,982 --> 01:47:04,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if that doesn't happen, things can go astray.

1416
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:07,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want things to go astray, Mr. President.

1417
01:47:09,688 --> 01:47:11,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scappelli.

1418
01:47:11,129 --> 01:47:12,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you Mr. Oswald for being here.

1419
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:30,383
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand what you're saying, but my confusion comes in as we debated the position, the diversity position, and debated the process of the CAF and how it went, is that you did do the work, and I appreciate the hard work that you've done, and you were compensated for that.

1420
01:47:30,843 --> 01:47:37,908
[SPEAKER_19]: But as we're moving forward to creating a new CAF, my hesitancy is that it was,

1421
01:47:39,838 --> 01:47:56,124
[SPEAKER_19]: the numbers were created for a position that held something in my eyes that if it was done correctly in the past and it presented to us, whereas the head of diversity, head of human resources to be paid at that level, I can see that's this.

1422
01:47:58,292 --> 01:47:59,333
[SPEAKER_19]: the reasoning for that.

1423
01:47:59,713 --> 01:48:10,382
[SPEAKER_19]: But as we're moving forward and changing the name of chief people officer, which is same as human resource officer, which now takes away the human diversity, you know, position.

1424
01:48:10,883 --> 01:48:15,627
[SPEAKER_19]: It really, to me, that's where the reason why I would want just more clarification, more

1425
01:48:17,843 --> 01:48:24,386
[SPEAKER_19]: understanding of the budget process and how that job will work with the committee of the whole meeting.

1426
01:48:24,426 --> 01:48:26,547
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why, I know that it's frustrating.

1427
01:48:26,567 --> 01:48:32,490
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you've done the work, but you also have to understand that this council is frustrated too in the process and how this was handled.

1428
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:36,572
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, this is no reflection from me personally to you.

1429
01:48:36,632 --> 01:48:39,554
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I've said it a thousand times, you do an amazing job.

1430
01:48:39,934 --> 01:48:45,257
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think the process and understanding the funding mechanism and how this is,

1431
01:48:46,055 --> 01:48:53,680
[SPEAKER_19]: It was presented one way with the same number, and then it was changed with a bigger position that I thought was equally as important.

1432
01:48:54,221 --> 01:48:56,382
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, but the numbers stayed the same.

1433
01:48:56,442 --> 01:48:59,504
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is why I'm a little hesitant.

1434
01:48:59,564 --> 01:49:01,405
[SPEAKER_19]: That's for my vote tonight.

1435
01:49:01,425 --> 01:49:01,906
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

1436
01:49:03,987 --> 01:49:06,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight.

1437
01:49:06,769 --> 01:49:12,373
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, I think it's important to point out, Mr. President, when the administration first presented

1438
01:49:13,325 --> 01:49:19,230
[SPEAKER_10]: the idea or the theory to merge diversity and human resources in January of 2020, this council opposed it.

1439
01:49:21,672 --> 01:49:23,473
[SPEAKER_10]: We asked, we said, is this a conflict of interest?

1440
01:49:23,753 --> 01:49:27,536
[SPEAKER_10]: The city solicitor came back with an opinion that said it is, but it isn't, but it is, but it isn't.

1441
01:49:28,898 --> 01:49:30,219
[SPEAKER_10]: So then we said, we're opposed to that.

1442
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,100
[SPEAKER_10]: And we sat down and we made our council priorities.

1443
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,283
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we made our council priorities, we said we wanted a standalone diversity director.

1444
01:49:37,044 --> 01:49:38,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we got a budget and the budget didn't have that.

1445
01:49:40,387 --> 01:49:41,187
[SPEAKER_10]: The budget didn't have that.

1446
01:49:42,595 --> 01:49:49,279
[SPEAKER_10]: on June 30, the last day of the fiscal year, we were presented a budget and the budget bifurcated the position said, Hey, we gave you what you wanted vote for it now.

1447
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,341
[SPEAKER_10]: This was something that was a year and a half in the making.

1448
01:49:54,201 --> 01:49:55,362
[SPEAKER_10]: It shouldn't have been done in the 11th hour.

1449
01:49:56,843 --> 01:50:02,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I believe the city for a very long time had a director of personnel at

1450
01:50:04,119 --> 01:50:07,746
[SPEAKER_13]: which conducted many of the duties that we're talking about now for the chief people officer.

1451
01:50:07,766 --> 01:50:14,238
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the cap 19 is more than an acceptable rate of pay considering there was a comparable position that was in an even higher cap previously.

1452
01:50:14,258 --> 01:50:16,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should just

1453
01:50:17,782 --> 01:50:18,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information?

1454
01:50:18,382 --> 01:50:20,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I would think we should have this.

1455
01:50:21,744 --> 01:50:25,506
[SPEAKER_10]: That comparable CAF 21 position was the Director of Budget and Personnel, that was Richard Lee.

1456
01:50:26,107 --> 01:50:29,389
[SPEAKER_10]: So he handled all the budget direction and all the personnel direction in this community.

1457
01:50:29,609 --> 01:50:31,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we have three people that do that to the tune of $307,000.

1458
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:33,691
[SPEAKER_10]: We had one person that did it for 90.

1459
01:50:33,791 --> 01:50:42,436
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe there were people who were in that position after the fact of Richard Lee who did not do all the budget work and that there was a budget CTO position at the same time.

1460
01:50:43,877 --> 01:50:44,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

1461
01:50:47,107 --> 01:50:57,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so Councilor Behrs has requested a roll call vote.

1462
01:50:57,255 --> 01:51:04,941
[SPEAKER_21]: To go to Committee of the Whole.

1463
01:51:04,961 --> 01:51:05,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1464
01:51:07,303 --> 01:51:08,584
[SPEAKER_20]: This is to refer to Committee of the Whole.

1465
01:51:08,785 --> 01:51:09,065
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1466
01:51:09,625 --> 01:51:10,206
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Behrs.

1467
01:51:10,826 --> 01:51:11,126
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1468
01:51:12,027 --> 01:51:12,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falcone.

1469
01:51:12,728 --> 01:51:12,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1470
01:51:13,728 --> 01:51:14,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

1471
01:51:14,548 --> 01:51:14,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1472
01:51:15,308 --> 01:51:15,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

1473
01:51:16,048 --> 01:51:16,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1474
01:51:16,889 --> 01:51:17,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell.

1475
01:51:17,669 --> 01:51:17,909
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1476
01:51:18,629 --> 01:51:19,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1477
01:51:19,409 --> 01:51:19,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1478
01:51:20,249 --> 01:51:21,009
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caravaglia.

1479
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:21,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1480
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,470
[SPEAKER_21]: Five in affirmative, two in the negative.

1481
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:25,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

1482
01:51:26,551 --> 01:51:27,831
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment D, new position.

1483
01:51:28,151 --> 01:51:31,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Classification 11 presently appears as follows.

1484
01:51:31,892 --> 01:51:36,433
[SPEAKER_21]: CAP 11, assistant city solicitor, hearing officer, assistant city clerk.

1485
01:51:37,033 --> 01:51:37,893
[SPEAKER_21]: The language in CAP 11

1486
01:51:38,791 --> 01:51:51,356
[SPEAKER_21]: shall be amended to delete the position of Assistant City Solicitor Hearing Officer and to appear as follows, CAP 11, Assistant City Clerk, Elections Coordinator.

1487
01:51:53,177 --> 01:51:55,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Discussion on Amendment D. Mr. President.

1488
01:51:55,998 --> 01:51:56,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight.

1489
01:51:56,838 --> 01:52:01,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I see no reason to eliminate the position Assistant City Solicitor slash Hearings Officer.

1490
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:08,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to further amend that to add Assistant City Solicitor Hearing Officer, Assistant City Solicitor City Council.

1491
01:52:09,554 --> 01:52:12,516
[SPEAKER_21]: Should I say that Assistant City Clerk, City Council?

1492
01:52:12,756 --> 01:52:15,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Assistant City Solicitor, City Council.

1493
01:52:15,277 --> 01:52:22,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Assistant City Solicitor, City Council.

1494
01:52:22,881 --> 01:52:25,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I move for approval of that and the elections coordinated position.

1495
01:52:26,523 --> 01:52:28,464
[SPEAKER_10]: So there will be four positions in CAF 11?

1496
01:52:28,504 --> 01:52:31,345
[SPEAKER_10]: We created CAF 11 for Assistant City Solicitor for the City Council.

1497
01:52:33,786 --> 01:52:34,386
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm confused.

1498
01:52:35,247 --> 01:52:37,308
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to amend the title Assistant City Solicitor.

1499
01:52:37,611 --> 01:52:43,519
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to create or create another one assistant city solicitor slash hearings office so we could have assistant city solicitor slash city council.

1500
01:52:43,779 --> 01:52:45,441
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't want to delete the hearings officer.

1501
01:52:45,461 --> 01:52:48,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we sever that please.

1502
01:52:49,466 --> 01:52:52,110
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so, and you wanted this the assistant city.

1503
01:52:53,668 --> 01:52:55,531
[SPEAKER_21]: solicited to be for the city council?

1504
01:52:55,811 --> 01:52:56,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1505
01:52:56,051 --> 01:52:58,535
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that's something that we talked about major legislative priority.

1506
01:52:58,555 --> 01:53:09,671
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that during the budget, I think the mayor said we would have negotiation to possibly retain services of KP law.

1507
01:53:10,431 --> 01:53:15,055
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would respect if we could also table this one to discuss that.

1508
01:53:15,655 --> 01:53:17,216
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not gonna fund it anyway.

1509
01:53:17,437 --> 01:53:22,981
[SPEAKER_21]: We wouldn't have to fund it if we had access to our own attorney through KP law.

1510
01:53:23,021 --> 01:53:25,643
[SPEAKER_10]: But those negotiations haven't happened.

1511
01:53:25,983 --> 01:53:29,926
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's only been a week since we approved the budget.

1512
01:53:30,366 --> 01:53:33,228
[SPEAKER_21]: I think all we're doing is creating a CAF on a title that we've asked for.

1513
01:53:33,488 --> 01:53:34,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

1514
01:53:34,089 --> 01:53:34,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a problem.

1515
01:53:34,809 --> 01:53:38,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a problem laying that on the table for a future date.

1516
01:53:39,984 --> 01:53:41,165
[SPEAKER_10]: or even withdrawing the motion.

1517
01:53:41,666 --> 01:53:42,026
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may.

1518
01:53:42,046 --> 01:53:43,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Bess.

1519
01:53:44,489 --> 01:53:47,653
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, three weeks ago it was we shouldn't be putting things in the budget if there's no calf.

1520
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:50,797
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should follow the counter principle was we shouldn't be putting these in the calf.

1521
01:53:51,977 --> 01:53:53,379
[SPEAKER_13]: if there's no chance they're gonna be in the budget.

1522
01:53:53,479 --> 01:53:54,540
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just my position on it.

1523
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,003
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to discuss it more in committee of the whole, but- Point of information.

1524
01:53:58,023 --> 01:54:00,965
[SPEAKER_10]: If we went that way, Mr. President, we never would have had a director of substance abuse and prevention.

1525
01:54:01,425 --> 01:54:07,110
[SPEAKER_10]: This council sat down and we created the position director of substance abuse and prevention, and then we pressured the administration to fund it, and then we go.

1526
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:09,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Prior to that, we didn't.

1527
01:54:10,033 --> 01:54:11,614
[SPEAKER_13]: If things get to that point, that's fine.

1528
01:54:12,054 --> 01:54:17,099
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying, if we're trying to align the CAF with the budget and make sure that

1529
01:54:18,493 --> 01:54:19,974
[SPEAKER_13]: boxes are checked on both sides.

1530
01:54:20,414 --> 01:54:25,455
[SPEAKER_13]: We should at least, you know, let's not start on a position where we're in conflict.

1531
01:54:26,456 --> 01:54:36,619
[SPEAKER_21]: The mayor did say we could have a discussion on potentially having our own- Mr. President, I will withdraw the matter and the motion on cleaning that position until sometime as you negotiate with the administration.

1532
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:38,620
[SPEAKER_21]: Give us a little time to negotiate that.

1533
01:54:40,941 --> 01:54:41,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's fine.

1534
01:54:43,202 --> 01:54:43,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So, any further-

1535
01:54:49,128 --> 01:55:02,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, just for clarification, the elections coordinator position, I think this was asked by Councilor Beers during the budgetary session, but once this CAF is approved, there is funding in the budget for full-time position.

1536
01:55:02,772 --> 01:55:09,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the person that currently is in that role be paid at that CAF until someone is hired?

1537
01:55:10,614 --> 01:55:10,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Mayor?

1538
01:55:14,015 --> 01:55:16,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just repeat that question, Councilor Marks, please?

1539
01:55:17,232 --> 01:55:34,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So the election coordinator position, once this CAF is approved, there's funding in the budget that CAF will exist with a person that's currently in a similar position within the registrar of voters office be paid until someone under that CAF, until someone is hired for the position.

1540
01:55:37,349 --> 01:55:41,072
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we plan on posting for this as soon as possible.

1541
01:55:42,913 --> 01:55:43,654
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the plan.

1542
01:55:44,695 --> 01:55:44,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1543
01:55:45,554 --> 01:55:49,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but you have someone that's in the position now doing the function.

1544
01:55:50,841 --> 01:55:52,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope, what's that?

1545
01:55:52,283 --> 01:55:54,787
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a new title though.

1546
01:55:56,573 --> 01:55:56,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1547
01:55:56,993 --> 01:56:02,697
[SPEAKER_03]: But for all intents and purposes, I mean, I won't speak for the clerk, but I think the person is doing that role.

1548
01:56:03,517 --> 01:56:07,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so to me, uh, I thought we had an agreement.

1549
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:09,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you brought up council of beers.

1550
01:56:09,521 --> 01:56:10,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to speak for you.

1551
01:56:10,781 --> 01:56:20,427
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe the question I asked was what the person who's in the position that currently exists continue to be paid the same way that they've been being paid and continue to do the work until the new position is filled.

1552
01:56:21,312 --> 01:56:27,474
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my understanding that grant ran out, and so they won't be paid as of, the city clerk can answer that.

1553
01:56:28,295 --> 01:56:30,235
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my understanding that money dried up.

1554
01:56:30,756 --> 01:56:35,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, well, I wasn't necessarily specifying the source, but the amount of money.

1555
01:56:35,617 --> 01:56:38,118
[SPEAKER_03]: But where are we gonna get the money from?

1556
01:56:38,558 --> 01:56:41,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, well, that was my understanding is that the mayor said that they would continue to be paid.

1557
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:43,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought the grant was until December.

1558
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,361
[SPEAKER_08]: I could be wrong.

1559
01:56:44,761 --> 01:56:46,421
[SPEAKER_08]: The grant is until December?

1560
01:56:48,122 --> 01:56:49,382
[SPEAKER_04]: The grant ran out June 30th.

1561
01:56:50,103 --> 01:56:50,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Grant June 30th.

1562
01:56:52,015 --> 01:57:07,067
[SPEAKER_21]: So the question is, the person currently doing the job, will this person continue to be paid at the current salary or the salary of the elections coordinator?

1563
01:57:07,884 --> 01:57:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing that was approved in the budget.

1564
01:57:10,546 --> 01:57:12,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless there's funding that I'm not aware of.

1565
01:57:12,647 --> 01:57:23,154
[SPEAKER_21]: So the person doing the job, Madam Mayor, will that person get the rate of pay of the elections quarter until you hire somebody?

1566
01:57:26,616 --> 01:57:28,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to look into that starting tomorrow.

1567
01:57:28,617 --> 01:57:31,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't aware there was funding dried up.

1568
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:33,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought there was a grant and we would post for this position.

1569
01:57:35,027 --> 01:57:44,450
[SPEAKER_03]: If the grant's right up at the end of June and we're already two weeks into July, how is this person being paid?

1570
01:57:48,091 --> 01:57:50,752
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Adam Herbies' city clerk's budget.

1571
01:57:51,032 --> 01:58:01,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure you'd have to ask how he's- Mr. Clerk, maybe you can answer that question.

1572
01:58:02,476 --> 01:58:04,737
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I can say in terms of the

1573
01:58:05,428 --> 01:58:31,183
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of any clarification, is that when Councilor Behrs asked two weeks ago if the person who was in the position could stay in that position until the position is filled permanently, and if that person was still gonna be paid and the mayor said yes, and then the council voted to approve that budget, I took that as direction that we were gonna keep paying that person through the process.

1574
01:58:32,911 --> 01:58:33,453
[SPEAKER_10]: What information?

1575
01:58:33,733 --> 01:58:37,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Budget passed with the salary that's attached to this calf, right?

1576
01:58:39,003 --> 01:58:40,103
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the question we want to know.

1577
01:58:40,703 --> 01:58:54,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to figure out if I'm trying to figure out if the person who's in the job now is going to be paid at the current rate at which he's been paid all along under the grant or if it and I think Councilor Marks is asking if she's going to be paid at the new rate.

1578
01:58:55,327 --> 01:58:56,507
[SPEAKER_10]: The grant dried up.

1579
01:58:56,527 --> 01:58:57,367
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the question.

1580
01:58:58,167 --> 01:58:59,468
[SPEAKER_10]: When the grant dried up, the job dried up.

1581
01:58:59,628 --> 01:59:02,288
[SPEAKER_10]: We're creating a new position now.

1582
01:59:02,708 --> 01:59:05,909
[SPEAKER_21]: We just want to know what pay this person will be getting.

1583
01:59:09,702 --> 01:59:10,002
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Mayor?

1584
01:59:10,523 --> 01:59:11,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have to look into that.

1585
01:59:11,603 --> 01:59:12,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

1586
01:59:12,104 --> 01:59:14,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought there was a grant till the end of the year.

1587
01:59:18,128 --> 01:59:27,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I may, through you to the administration, the mayor has no problem voluntarily allowing this position to join a union should they wish to, correct?

1588
01:59:28,274 --> 01:59:30,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Say they wanted to join the clerical union, that wouldn't be a problem, right?

1589
01:59:32,137 --> 01:59:32,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Mayor?

1590
01:59:38,342 --> 01:59:39,922
[SPEAKER_08]: that hasn't been brought to my attention.

1591
01:59:40,342 --> 01:59:41,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1592
01:59:43,183 --> 01:59:46,144
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the question would be what would be your objection?

1593
01:59:46,244 --> 01:59:48,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'd have to go through with our city solicitor.

1594
01:59:48,444 --> 01:59:50,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1595
01:59:50,524 --> 01:59:52,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Any jobs that have been added to the union.

1596
01:59:52,605 --> 01:59:54,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't usually object.

1597
01:59:56,386 --> 02:00:03,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, cause I don't think that this job has any confidential responsibilities in terms of personnel.

1598
02:00:04,062 --> 02:00:06,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I clarify something, Vice President?

1599
02:00:06,363 --> 02:00:08,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it, brother.

1600
02:00:08,985 --> 02:00:11,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the assistant city clerk is not a member of the union.

1601
02:00:12,166 --> 02:00:17,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was classified at the same cap as the assistant city clerk.

1602
02:00:17,069 --> 02:00:24,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that she gave up her union position when she was promoted into the assistant city clerk.

1603
02:00:24,994 --> 02:00:29,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I made my budget request, I deliberately structured it along a parallel,

1604
02:00:31,617 --> 02:00:34,219
[SPEAKER_04]: title a parallel calf with the assistant city clerk.

1605
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:40,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I envisioned it to be a supervisory position.

1606
02:00:40,305 --> 02:00:44,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not envision it to be a union position because the assistant city clerk is not in a union.

1607
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:51,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Do the duties and responsibilities reflect a situation that would preclude them from being able to join a union?

1608
02:00:52,035 --> 02:00:53,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That I don't know the answer to.

1609
02:00:53,076 --> 02:00:53,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to look into that.

1610
02:00:54,957 --> 02:00:56,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'd have to check with the clerical union.

1611
02:00:56,839 --> 02:00:57,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you would think

1612
02:00:58,393 --> 02:00:59,954
[SPEAKER_08]: potentially the clerical union.

1613
02:01:00,254 --> 02:01:06,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So is this a higher salary than, you know, you would have to, it would be a few things we'd have to check.

1614
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:12,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that they might be, should be a better fit for the contract we just passed tonight.

1615
02:01:15,946 --> 02:01:17,727
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1616
02:01:18,247 --> 02:01:22,250
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment D. Chair, what's the motion?

1617
02:01:28,113 --> 02:01:32,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so with the response, where it's getting paid from, Mr. President?

1618
02:01:32,955 --> 02:01:36,117
[SPEAKER_20]: With the response of where it's being paid and what rate.

1619
02:01:36,717 --> 02:01:39,259
[SPEAKER_20]: And what are you doing with the city solicitor?

1620
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:42,240
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry?

1621
02:01:43,621 --> 02:01:43,881
Okay.

1622
02:01:48,123 --> 02:01:48,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1623
02:01:49,404 --> 02:01:57,368
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so Mr. Glitzer, you had the question on Amendment D. All right, let's move on to

1624
02:01:58,353 --> 02:02:02,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment E. So they're not making any change to the Assistant City Solicitor?

1625
02:02:03,236 --> 02:02:05,717
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're not going to make a change to the Assistant City Solicitor, right?

1626
02:02:06,017 --> 02:02:06,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1627
02:02:06,298 --> 02:02:06,518
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1628
02:02:07,638 --> 02:02:09,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment E, reclassification.

1629
02:02:20,983 --> 02:02:22,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, so we're not doing anything there, we'll leave it alone.

1630
02:02:23,485 --> 02:02:32,973
[SPEAKER_21]: All we're doing is asking for the question on the elections coordinator on the rate of pay that the person will be receiving.

1631
02:02:33,213 --> 02:02:41,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, I'm just saying that the final CAF would read, CAF 11, assistant city solicitor slash hearing officer, assistant city clerk, and elections coordinator.

1632
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:45,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I'm trying to clarify, are you deleting?

1633
02:02:45,243 --> 02:02:49,566
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not deleting anything, we're just- So you have to move to keep that in there, don't you?

1634
02:02:49,686 --> 02:02:49,826
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1635
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:53,881
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're gonna keep it in.

1636
02:02:55,082 --> 02:02:56,563
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're gonna vote on that motion.

1637
02:02:58,864 --> 02:02:59,045
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1638
02:02:59,325 --> 02:03:03,728
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're gonna vote on the motion to keep the assistant city solicitor hearing officer.

1639
02:03:03,748 --> 02:03:04,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I correct?

1640
02:03:05,149 --> 02:03:05,369
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1641
02:03:05,650 --> 02:03:05,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1642
02:03:07,231 --> 02:03:08,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on that.

1643
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,502
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, who was the second?

1644
02:03:22,522 --> 02:03:23,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I got vice-president and I'm moving it.

1646

02:05:59,425 --> 02:06:09,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor Longo Kern has withdrawn amendment G. And I think that's it.

1698
02:06:12,049 --> 02:06:12,889
[SPEAKER_21]: Did I miss anything here?

1699
02:06:12,909 --> 02:06:13,409
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's it.

1700
02:06:14,210 --> 02:06:15,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we need to vote on the whole thing?

1701
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:19,031
[SPEAKER_21]: So we need to vote on the whole thing as a package.

1702
02:06:19,251 --> 02:06:19,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1703
02:06:21,012 --> 02:06:21,512
[SPEAKER_21]: Council Meeks.

1704
02:06:22,027 --> 02:06:36,650
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, just for my edification, have all newly elect, uh, new, uh, newly created positions been advertised, uh, Mr. President, all newly created positions.

1705
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:40,490
[SPEAKER_08]: They have not all been advertised.

1706
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:55,393
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working on job descriptions currently, and we realized your meeting was the 13th and not the 20th, so we knew we could get them done, hopefully within the next couple of weeks, we will be able to advertise all these new ones that you've approved tonight.

1707
02:06:56,813 --> 02:07:03,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so even positions that people may be currently holding right now, those positions have not been advertised?

1708
02:07:07,035 --> 02:07:07,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Which ones specifically?

1709
02:07:08,837 --> 02:07:17,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if we have a newly created position, I don't want to call out any particular position, but if there's a newly created position, have they all been advertised?

1710
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:20,860
[SPEAKER_08]: They have not.

1711
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:22,340
[SPEAKER_03]: They have not.

1712
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:24,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I was waiting for the yes to be approved.

1713
02:07:27,301 --> 02:07:31,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So we potentially have people in roles where a position has not been advertised.

1714
02:07:40,114 --> 02:07:42,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Parking director, we are working on a job description.

1715
02:07:42,676 --> 02:07:44,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Facilities director, same thing.

1716
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:47,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Rec facilities coordinator, same thing.

1717
02:07:47,941 --> 02:07:53,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Parking enforcement officer probably will come down the line once we have a director hired.

1718
02:07:55,147 --> 02:08:00,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief people officer, we have somebody in that role.

1719
02:08:00,691 --> 02:08:04,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And then elections coordinator, we will advertise as soon as possible.

1720
02:08:04,935 --> 02:08:08,938
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's a newly created position, how do we not advertise for that position?

1721
02:08:12,998 --> 02:08:14,419
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about the chief people officer?

1722
02:08:14,439 --> 02:08:15,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1723
02:08:17,481 --> 02:08:18,782
[SPEAKER_08]: We have somebody in the role.

1724
02:08:19,142 --> 02:08:28,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So unless there's advice from council or requests from council for me to advertise, I wouldn't.

1725
02:08:28,749 --> 02:08:30,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a newly created position, correct?

1726
02:08:30,590 --> 02:08:31,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That never existed before.

1727
02:08:33,732 --> 02:08:38,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief people officer is taking the role of HR diversity director.

1728
02:08:39,782 --> 02:08:42,985
[SPEAKER_08]: In this budget, which was in the way, which by the way, never existed.

1729
02:08:44,186 --> 02:08:52,954
[SPEAKER_08]: It was approved in the last two in the, in the budget, which the city solicitor stated it requires a calf.

1730
02:08:53,755 --> 02:08:55,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think here we go back again.

1731
02:08:55,396 --> 02:08:58,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we were all on the same page with the creation of calves.

1732
02:08:59,181 --> 02:09:05,131
[SPEAKER_03]: and the budget doesn't create, the fact that something's in the budget does not create a position according to city ordinance.

1733
02:09:08,236 --> 02:09:09,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we were all on the same page with that.

1734
02:09:10,225 --> 02:09:11,185
[SPEAKER_08]: We are on the same page.

1735
02:09:11,245 --> 02:09:26,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, at the budget hearing, it was my impression that when it was approved by the city council and the budget for fiscal year 21, it was with the page, I think it was on page 58 of the fiscal 21 budget.

1736
02:09:27,171 --> 02:09:29,011
[SPEAKER_08]: It had the job description, had the goals.

1737
02:09:29,291 --> 02:09:35,993
[SPEAKER_08]: That was approved when I decided to take the acting title away in January, 2021.

1738
02:09:38,099 --> 02:09:43,123
[SPEAKER_08]: We came before you for a CAF change, which I thought would be easier than it was.

1739
02:09:43,263 --> 02:09:47,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Kim made her ruling, and now we are here getting the CAF change.

1740
02:09:48,387 --> 02:09:54,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So until you have your meeting, because since you tabled that anyway, we have time to figure this all out.

1741
02:09:55,172 --> 02:09:56,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't advertise for it now.

1742
02:09:56,914 --> 02:09:59,956
[SPEAKER_08]: You haven't approved the title of chief people officer.

1743
02:10:00,016 --> 02:10:02,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think- Right.

1744
02:10:02,258 --> 02:10:04,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure that we're consistent.

1745
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,762
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the consistency of-

1746
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:11,943
[SPEAKER_03]: for new position is to have it advertised.

1747
02:10:12,463 --> 02:10:14,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna make sure across the board we're doing that.

1748
02:10:15,485 --> 02:10:17,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems to me we're not doing that.

1749
02:10:17,207 --> 02:10:20,669
[SPEAKER_03]: We're picking and choosing when we wanna advertise for positions.

1750
02:10:21,250 --> 02:10:22,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that's correct.

1751
02:10:24,752 --> 02:10:36,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Then please at your committee meeting when you decide on what title you would like to end and what if you'd like it to be posted, then we will take that under advisement.

1752
02:10:38,411 --> 02:10:41,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought every new position has to be posted, but maybe I'm mistaken.

1753
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:46,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, motion to approve amendments A, B, D as amended.

1754
02:10:46,097 --> 02:10:47,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falcone to the floor next.

1755
02:10:47,899 --> 02:10:49,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1756
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:50,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falcone.

1757
02:10:50,641 --> 02:10:51,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1758
02:10:51,421 --> 02:10:53,603
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have a question regarding the payroll director.

1759
02:10:53,643 --> 02:10:55,564
[SPEAKER_15]: So is that, I know that's been withdrawn.

1760
02:10:55,604 --> 02:10:57,366
[SPEAKER_15]: So does that position still exist?

1761
02:11:00,568 --> 02:11:03,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Payroll director, I'm asking for you to withdraw it.

1762
02:11:05,650 --> 02:11:14,053
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will come back to you for the August meeting with additional, hopefully many additional CAF changes as we're trying to clean things up.

1763
02:11:16,353 --> 02:11:17,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Longo-Kern, I apologize.

1764
02:11:17,534 --> 02:11:18,494
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't hear that response.

1765
02:11:18,514 --> 02:11:19,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you please repeat that?

1766
02:11:22,255 --> 02:11:27,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm asking you to withdraw the payroll director while we work on a number of other different CAF changes.

1767
02:11:27,957 --> 02:11:30,718
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll have another proposal before you in August.

1768
02:11:33,038 --> 02:11:34,959
[SPEAKER_08]: No, nobody's in that role, Councilor Caput.

1769
02:11:36,602 --> 02:11:39,963
[SPEAKER_15]: No one's in that role, but I believe that role was approved in the budget.

1770
02:11:40,023 --> 02:11:41,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that role changing?

1771
02:11:46,764 --> 02:11:49,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this maybe not going to be a director's position?

1772
02:11:50,565 --> 02:11:57,026
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to take a look at all the treasurer collectors salaries and make sure they are coordinated correctly.

1773
02:11:58,626 --> 02:12:01,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so that'll be addressed in the upcoming meeting.

1774
02:12:01,307 --> 02:12:02,067
[SPEAKER_15]: August meeting, yes.

1775
02:12:03,107 --> 02:12:03,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

1776
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:06,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Scafelli.

1777
02:12:17,008 --> 02:12:25,750
[SPEAKER_19]: that we had a question with stopping of a step raised for some non-union employees.

1778
02:12:26,230 --> 02:12:30,571
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanna know if that's been made whole or is that still something they're waiting on?

1779
02:12:31,771 --> 02:12:43,754
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was told to them that it was frozen because of the COVID or I just, you know, is that have been fixed and have been adjusted, so.

1780
02:12:44,328 --> 02:12:51,531
[SPEAKER_08]: You approved the fiscal year 22 budget, which included one step for each non-union employee, correct?

1781
02:12:52,491 --> 02:12:53,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, no, okay.

1782
02:12:54,072 --> 02:12:54,832
[SPEAKER_19]: For 22, for 22.

1783
02:12:54,992 --> 02:13:06,797
[SPEAKER_19]: It was 22, but I know that what, I got a few phone calls from a few non-union members that said that they were due a step raise back in December 21.

1784
02:13:08,317 --> 02:13:09,778
[SPEAKER_19]: And they were told that

1785
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:14,911
[SPEAKER_19]: because of the COVID, they would not be given that step raise.

1786
02:13:14,971 --> 02:13:17,932
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of those were at the highest point.

1787
02:13:17,992 --> 02:13:21,893
[SPEAKER_19]: So it made a big difference on their way of quality of life.

1788
02:13:21,933 --> 02:13:28,875
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we could just look into that and see if we get some clarification on that, that'd be great.

1789
02:13:28,975 --> 02:13:37,677
[SPEAKER_21]: And Madam Mayor, are there any positions that are still outstanding that are not in this list that we have to add?

1790
02:13:41,048 --> 02:13:45,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like I said before, this has been a historical 40-year problem.

1791
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:55,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So between the duplicates trying to clean things up, I think we're going to have CAF changes and recommendations for you over the next several months.

1792
02:13:56,658 --> 02:13:59,779
[SPEAKER_21]: And Madam Mayor, so I can schedule the council of the whole meeting.

1793
02:14:00,799 --> 02:14:02,100
[SPEAKER_21]: How much time do you think you'll need?

1794
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:05,480
[SPEAKER_21]: So I can plan when we should have a meeting.

1795
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:06,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1796
02:14:07,421 --> 02:14:13,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I see no reason to schedule a committee of the whole on these if we're not gonna have the other titles before us that we might wanna have a committee of the whole on as well.

1797
02:14:14,883 --> 02:14:15,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1798
02:14:15,983 --> 02:14:17,204
[SPEAKER_08]: These were the most important.

1799
02:14:17,584 --> 02:14:22,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, these were the ones that are new type positions in the budget.

1800
02:14:22,165 --> 02:14:25,266
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what we wanted to take before you first.

1801
02:14:26,439 --> 02:14:30,882
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should just, excuse me, if you don't mind, I think we should dispense of these in a reasonable amount of time.

1802
02:14:30,902 --> 02:14:39,967
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see a reason to hold until we have everything and then have a- That's why I'm asking, Madam Mayor, how much time do you think you need to do the ones that we're gonna do a Committee of the Whole on?

1803
02:14:39,987 --> 02:14:42,208
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple of weeks?

1804
02:14:42,468 --> 02:14:47,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you can schedule a Committee of the Whole meeting on these anytime in the next couple of weeks.

1805
02:14:49,012 --> 02:14:50,973
[SPEAKER_21]: So two weeks would be sufficient time for you?

1806
02:14:50,993 --> 02:14:54,995
[SPEAKER_21]: Two weeks would be sufficient time for you?

1807
02:14:55,336 --> 02:14:55,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's no-

1808
02:14:56,882 --> 02:14:58,763
[SPEAKER_08]: hold up on my end for these positions.

1809
02:14:59,363 --> 02:15:07,167
[SPEAKER_21]: It is during the summer, so I just want to make sure that everyone is able to... Our next meeting is until, what's the question?

1810
02:15:07,487 --> 02:15:08,268
[SPEAKER_04]: August 17th.

1811
02:15:08,448 --> 02:15:11,249
[SPEAKER_21]: August 17th, so that's a month away.

1812
02:15:23,835 --> 02:15:24,295
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll do it...

1813
02:15:26,031 --> 02:15:27,752
[SPEAKER_21]: At 530 on the 17th, Madam Mayor?

1814
02:15:29,994 --> 02:15:31,035
[SPEAKER_21]: That'll give everybody enough time?

1815
02:15:31,055 --> 02:15:33,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you can schedule your committee of the whole anytime.

1816
02:15:33,877 --> 02:15:37,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, all right, I'll let your office know.

1817
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:40,362
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so Councilor Beas, you had a motion on the floor.

1818
02:15:40,542 --> 02:15:44,185
[SPEAKER_13]: My motion was to approve amendments A, B, and D as amended.

1819
02:15:46,347 --> 02:15:46,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by?

1820
02:15:46,827 --> 02:15:47,388
[SPEAKER_21]: So moved.

1821
02:15:47,768 --> 02:15:49,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Vice President Knight.

1822
02:15:50,110 --> 02:15:51,110
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1823
02:15:53,552 --> 02:15:54,673
[SPEAKER_20]: This is to approve the first reading.

1824
02:16:17,227 --> 02:16:21,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, to approve amendments a B and D as amended for first reading.

1825
02:16:21,453 --> 02:16:21,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President night.

[SPEAKER_04]: Council Scott Billy.

1836
02:16:32,428 --> 02:16:33,209
[SPEAKER_04]: President care of yellow.

1837
02:16:35,251 --> 02:16:36,792
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

1838
02:16:36,852 --> 02:16:40,813
