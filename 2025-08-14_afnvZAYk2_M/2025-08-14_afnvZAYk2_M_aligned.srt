We'll be starting in just about five minutes.

00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:06,168

Okay.

27
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:10,444
I wasn't sure of the crowd.

28
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:14,525
I wasn't sure if we were going to get a big crowd.

29
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,886
I wasn't sure either.

30
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:22,768
I'm also worried about the business community.

31
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:25,690
You have to know about business.

32
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:29,738
I thought it was your friend.

33
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,937
Including me for that matter

34
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:29,776
And it also means no scrolling.

35
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:44,366
All right, everybody, if you have a chair, please take a seat.

36
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:47,548
There's still a couple here and a couple over here.

37
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,045
Otherwise, I believe we're ready to get started.

38
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:57,528
Welcome to tonight's candidate forum put on by the Medford Democratic City Committee.

39
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:06,052
Our intention was to invite all the candidates to share with the citizens of Medford who they are and why they are running for office.

40
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,994
I'm happy to announce that all the candidates expressed interest in attending.

41
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:14,704
Also, before we move on, I wanted to introduce myself.

42
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:15,885
My name is Bruce Kulik.

43
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:22,648
I'm co-chair of the Medford Democratic City Committee, along with Phyllis Morrison, who will also be our timekeeper tonight.

44
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:29,591
Unfortunately, George Scarpelli and Justin Tseng are unable to attend in person due to previous commitments.

45
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:36,875
Mr. Scarpelli sends his regrets, and Mr. Tseng has asked Jessica Attadio to represent him in his absence.

46
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:45,079
Additionally, Matt Lemming has indicated that he, unfortunately, needs to leave early, so if you see him bolt out, that's the reason for it.

47
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:59,146
This event is also being broadcast and recorded for later replay on the Medford Government Channel, which is 22 for Comcast and 43 for Verizon, and via YouTube live stream at YouTube at Medford Community Media 391.

48
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:06,269
We have also published a list of websites, Facebook and Instagram IDs supplied by the candidates.

49
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:15,191
There are cards distributed around the room with this information and a QR code to access the recording and Medford Democrat webpage directly.

50
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:22,894
Additionally, the Medford Democratic City Committee plans to hold additional forums in October before the general election.

51
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,435
We'll let everybody know when that's going to occur.

52
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:31,739
Before I continue, I'd like to acknowledge any non-municipal elected officials who are in attendance.

53
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,840
I didn't see anybody come in.

54
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:39,064
Oh, stand please.

55
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:49,111
So I'm looking for non-municipal candidates and elected officials.

56
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:50,092
Yes.

57
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:54,134
Elections Commission.

58
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:54,735
Okay, thank you.

59
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,737
Anybody else?

60
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,339
I think we're all set with that.

61
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:05,367
We will first introduce all the candidates, followed by each candidate speaking for up to three minutes.

62
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:11,495
Any remaining time will be used to allow the audience to interact directly with the candidates on a one-to-one basis.

63
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,845
Due to the time limitations, there will be no questions asked to the candidates and no questions from the audience.

64
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,669
Please hold your applause until each candidate has finished their talk.

65
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:27,813
And with that, Phyllis will introduce the candidates and continue with the program.

66
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,780
Hi, everyone, and thanks for coming out.

67
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:42,432
I think it's a really important night for our city, and I'm particularly pleased that all of the candidates could be here in person or have sent a representative for themselves.

68
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:47,698
You know, this is how we get to find out about the people who want to be our representatives in our city.

69
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:50,100
So thank you to all of the candidates.

70
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,522
We really appreciate your participation in this.

71
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:57,226
I am going to apologize up front if I say a name incorrectly.

72
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:58,567
I am doing my best.

73
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:04,672
As I call your name, first I would like to say to you, prior to tonight's event,

74
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:12,597
The Democratic City Committee held a lottery to determine the order in which the candidates would speak.

75
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:13,778
It was a random draw.

76
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:17,941
And the candidates, once we did that, the email was sent out to the candidates.

77
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,082
They knew their standing.

78
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:20,843
They knew the amount of time they would have.

79
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,364
They knew that there would be a warning.

80
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:25,446
when they had 20 seconds left to speak.

81
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:31,070
So I will go over those points for the candidates once I've introduced them all.

82
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,613
I'm going to call the candidates' name and I'll ask them to stand, be recognized, and then be seated.

83
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,115
So Patrick Clerkin.

84
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:43,358
Nate Merritt.

85
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,540
Matt Lemming.

86
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:52,044
For Justin Tsang, Jennifer Tadeo.

87
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:55,084
Liz Mullane.

88
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:59,628
George Scarpelli.

89
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:03,912
Anna Callahan.

90
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,056
Nicholas Juleo.

91
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,161
Miranda Berezno.

92
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:16,024
Did I say it correctly?

93
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:17,585
Bresenio, I'm sorry.

94
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,048
Paige Boldini.

95
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:24,328
Rick Caraviello.

96
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,849
Paul J. Donato Jr.

97
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,710
Emily K. Lazzaro.

98
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,631
Well your name isn't next on the list.

99
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:45,553
I apologize.

100
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:47,653
Ms.

101
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:49,794
Tringali I am so sorry.

102
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,347
Emily Calazzaro.

103
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:55,790
Zach Beers.

104
00:17:58,373 --> 00:17:59,314
Trish Ciapelli.

105
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:03,479
Melva McDonald.

106
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:10,330
So with that, what's going to happen now is I'm going to return to my seat.

107
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,454
I will call the person who is going to speak first, who is Patrick Clerking.

108
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:18,078
Patrick, when I give you the go ahead, I'm going to ask you to start speaking.

109
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,760
When I start the timer, I'll give you that.

110
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,443
And at 20 seconds, as I've already shown all of you.

111
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:24,686
This will be your warning.

112
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:27,349
I'll raise it right from that seat so you can see it.

113
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,172
You will have 20 seconds left.

114
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:36,161
Because of the time constraint we have at the library, I am going to have to cut the candidates off at three minutes.

115
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:40,206
I'm not trying to be rude, and the candidates were told about this prior to.

116
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:45,049
Please note that there are no questions to be asked during this time frame.

117
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,351
Any time we have left at the end, you can mingle with the candidates, and we hope there's time to do so.

118
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,832
So thank you once again for coming, and I'm going to take my seat.

119
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:56,773
I'm going to call Patrick Clerken to the podium.

120
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:24,655
Hi everyone, I'm Patrick Clerkin, and I'm going to start off with a little bit of my backstory, and then I'm going to get into why it's relevant and what I'd like to do for Medford.

121
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:26,756
So I'm a mechanical engineer.

122
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:37,864
I've worked in both a corporate context as an employee and as a contractor, and I've also been an entrepreneur, and most recently I've worked as a handyman.

123
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:45,409
And with the handyman work, it's been a lot of meeting neighbors, getting out there, and a lot of practical hands-on stuff, so it's kind of

124
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:52,403
combining the street smarts and the book smarts and the abstract and the physical hands-on stuff.

125
00:19:52,963 --> 00:20:02,409
So I have also been involved with a lot of different civic organizations, both as a member and as a leader within those organizations.

126
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,790
Some of them have been Habitat for Humanity,

127
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:10,143
Big Brother Big Sister, American Red Cross, and the board of my fraternity.

128
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:17,309
So I want to bring all of those perspectives and experiences to my efforts here in Medford for the city's benefit.

129
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,613
And what I wanted to focus on in particular was robust community.

130
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:26,777
And how I see it, community is both communications and unity.

131
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:36,778
And in 2023, when I ran for the first time, what I saw was that this city has so many resources and there's no hub of communications anymore.

132
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:38,119
There used to be a paper.

133
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:39,139
There isn't anymore.

134
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,079
There's some new things.

135
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:45,340
But basically, there's not a dashboard or there's not a consistent reference that people are consulting.

136
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:51,722
And when you don't have that, it causes anger and fear and distrust and confusion to proliferate.

137
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:56,641
And so I have a bunch of different ideas as to how to practically address that.

138
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:57,782
They're on my website.

139
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,143
I can't get into all of them right now.

140
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:02,305
So I recommend that you consult my website for those.

141
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:15,015
But I will say if you want a practical example as to how lack of communications negatively affects the city, look at the current zoning issue, how a lot of the people feel that this information has been dropped on them at the last minute.

142
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,117
They feel like things have already been decided.

143
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:23,621
they feel like basically the neighborhoods aren't getting a say in this citywide process.

144
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:37,126
The other aspect of what I wanted to focus on was unity, and I'm already embodying that democracy within my campaign where I've gone to all 16, canvassed all 16 precincts.

145
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:43,629
I've crossed demographic, geographic, partisan, ideological lines, talked to anyone, I don't care what

146
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:46,500
what flag you have in your yard, what letter you have next to your name.

147
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,463
I want everyone to be involved in this process and I am actively doing that.

148
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:58,447
So the last thing that I'll say is that I'm focused on independent thinking, on practical solutions, on

149
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:04,172
Medford in its entirety and on local issues.

150
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:11,238
So I'm a counselor, I would be a counselor at large for Medford, not for Massachusetts, not for the United States, not for the world.

151
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:17,924
So if these are values that you appreciate, please vote for me on September 16th and on November 4th.

152
00:22:18,224 --> 00:22:18,484
Thank you.

153
00:22:28,518 --> 00:22:30,028
Nate, would you like to come to the podium?

154
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:30,812
Nate Merritt.

155
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,861
Hi, I'm Nate Merritt, and I'm asking for your vote to represent all of Medford as your next city councilor.

156
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:12,401
And I swear I do own a tie.

157
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:13,842
Sorry about not wearing that tonight.

158
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:18,003
I'm running because I think we can get the city on a much better path than it is today.

159
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:19,083
I'm an engineer.

160
00:23:19,343 --> 00:23:19,923
I fix things.

161
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:21,383
I also help people.

162
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:23,484
I was an EMT and a firefighter for many years.

163
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:31,945
In fact, last month when I walked into Tanook, and I found a child bleeding from the back of his head, I decided to step up and help, because that's what people do.

164
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:34,326
And I did, and I'm willing to do it in a larger role.

165
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:35,812
Why me?

166
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:37,074
Why not these fine folks?

167
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:39,837
Because I'm going to stay laser focused on Medford.

168
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,041
Not national, not state issues, Medford.

169
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:44,242
That's the job at hand.

170
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:56,196
And maybe if we took all these meetings and this negative energy that's been going on to ODARC 30 in the morning, trying to relitigate international foreign conflicts and trade embargoes,

171
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:05,010
and instead focused it maybe on Riverside Ave and the Anheuser-Busch property, which now the MBTA picked up, then maybe we wouldn't be 600,000 in the hole.

172
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:08,374
We just passed an override for 500,000 to fix our streets.

173
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,415
So who's gonna make it up?

174
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:10,777
And the answer is all of us.

175
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:12,199
That's not good.

176
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,781
That's not a recipe for success.

177
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:18,139
I want to try to capitalize on the things that the city of Medford has.

178
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:18,920
We're not Cambridge.

179
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,520
We have Interstate 93.

180
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:21,781
We've got the Mystic River.

181
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:23,002
We've got a lot of resources.

182
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:27,444
Let's use it and not try to turn this into the next 15-minute city like the socialist playbook.

183
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:32,046
Let's stop the nonsense of saying single-family homes are a thing of the past.

184
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:32,586
They're not.

185
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:39,269
The city of Lowell, which is twice the population of Medford, has plenty of single-family zoning, and I think we can, too.

186
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:43,491
So, in fact, that's what draws people to Medford, including me and my family.

187
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,952
Let's take a smart look at zoning.

188
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,315
This isn't an emergency.

189
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:52,743
I'm pretty qualified to tell that being a former firefighter in EMT, we can take our time like we did with the charter review.

190
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:54,105
It's not emergency.

191
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:58,172
Let's do it right the first time and not try to be like the Titanic going into an iceberg.

192
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,547
I want places in Medford for kids to play.

193
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,689
I've got two Bambinos, and especially in the wintertime, where do you bring them?

194
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:05,449
We go somewhere else.

195
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,750
You go to Jordan's, you go to Malden, you go everywhere else.

196
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,872
I want people from Assembly Row to come here and bring their kids.

197
00:25:11,332 --> 00:25:13,053
Maybe a sky zone, bigger than that.

198
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:14,994
Maybe a place to fly indoor drones.

199
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,155
There's a lot of things we could do.

200
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:22,218
But if our zoning, we take up every commercial spot and turn it into mixed-use residential, you're never gonna have a spot for that.

201
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:25,541
I think the city needs some balance and we need to restore some balance.

202
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,223
Industrial and commercial is good.

203
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:31,148
It helps pay for our roads, our public safety.

204
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:35,412
And I think with your vote, we can move the city forward together.

205
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:36,814
Let's make it happen.

206
00:25:37,254 --> 00:25:37,555
Thank you.

207
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:58,127
First, I'd like to thank the Democratic City Committee for hosting this event.

208
00:25:58,167 --> 00:25:59,148
My name is Matt Lemming.

209
00:25:59,328 --> 00:26:03,972
I'm a scientist, a naval officer, and for the past two years, a city councilor in Medford.

210
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:11,017
I grew up in a military family, moved around a lot, did my PhD in the UK and moved to Medford as a postdoc at Mass General.

211
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:11,897
When I moved here,

212
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:15,543
I could barely pay for a room in a small apartment.

213
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:19,645
Now, that's not because brain disease research is not valuable.

214
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:23,007
It's because something about the system is deeply flawed.

215
00:26:23,628 --> 00:26:24,328
In the past 30 years, U.S.

216
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:28,451
rents have risen 323 percent, average home prices 441 percent, and median household income a mere 37 percent, and to even begin addressing this,

217
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,657
We need to start locally.

218
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:46,048
So in 2023, after lobbying council to pass an affordable housing trust, I ran for council myself, talked to a whole lot of people, and began serving in 2024.

219
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:59,509
Our state has laws that prevent city budgets from keeping up with inflation, and Medford has stagnated in its growth for a long time, so Medford has a budget problem, and Medford's housing is too expensive.

220
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:17,338
This past term, I and many of my colleagues on council have stopped kicking the can down the road, and backed by many parents and young families in the community, we put on the ballot and campaigned for our city's first ever 2.5 override, which staved 40 union jobs in the Medford Teachers Association and funded a full-time road repair crew.

221
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:25,270
This past term council approved new public housing for seniors and I'm working at the state and local level to fund our new affordable housing trust.

222
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:34,261
The city and the community spent years developing plans to rezone the city both to address our affordability crisis and dwindling budget and council is working on that.

223
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:36,362
Our current zoning is patchwork.

224
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:37,643
It leads to patchwork development.

225
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:41,124
It needs to change, and it's needed to change for a very long time.

226
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:54,628
New zoning will mitigate traffic via transportation demand management program, mandate greener building practices, and with an historic conversion ordinance, maintain the many historic buildings that compose Medford, all while incentivizing housing affordability.

227
00:27:56,133 --> 00:28:05,588
I've made Council a more transparent body by instituting a City Council newsletter, live-streaming our meetings, holding office hours at the Medford Senior Centre, and writing about all of it non-stop on my website.

228
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:15,981
I instituted a first-of-its-kind program to house low-income veterans, and I passed a law that will allow Medford residents to voluntarily donate to an in-need veterans fund on their tax bills.

229
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:28,072
In January, Council passed a Welcoming City Ordinance, and in my work with the Democratic City Committee, I spearheaded a campaign to inform non-English-speaking residents of their constitutional rights in these very dire times.

230
00:28:29,393 --> 00:28:32,498
In short, Council has at long last stopped kicking the can down the road.

231
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:35,622
We need to take action if we're to have an affordable and vibrant city.

232
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:39,809
I've been putting in the work to do just that, and I will continue to put in the work.

233
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:43,975
Thank you very much for your time and attention, and don't forget to vote on September 16th.

234
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,620
Yes.

235
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:05,422
Hello, everyone.

236
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:12,289
My name is Jessica Taddeo, and as a longtime friend and colleague of Councilor Singh, I'm very honored to be sharing these remarks on his behalf tonight.

237
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:16,950
I'm Justin Tsang, and I am honored to be your city councilor.

238
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:23,916
I am the son of immigrants who came to Medford chasing the American dream, looking to make strides in finding the cure for cancer.

239
00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:27,759
My parents stretched their dollars and raised me paycheck to paycheck.

240
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,283
And without our schools, our neighbors in this community, that dream would not be possible.

241
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:36,007
And that's why I've worked these past four years to give back and pay it forward.

242
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:44,382
Now, as national politicians gamble with our economy and threaten the safety of our neighbors, Medford needs steady hands and bold leadership.

243
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:48,576
I'll always stand up for you because Medford stood up for me.

244
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:52,637
And over these past four years, we haven't just made progress, we've made history.

245
00:29:53,237 --> 00:30:02,521
While some leaders are focused on turning our neighbors against one another, Medford is leading by example as a city that makes historic investments in our public schools and supports all of its residents.

246
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:09,063
We protected the freedoms of our neighbors with the Gender Affirming and Reproductive Health Care Ordinance, which I worked on with Councilor Lozaro.

247
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:15,127
And I codified the city's policy of non-cooperation with ICE in non-criminal cases to protect our immigrant neighbors.

248
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:27,716
We've taken bold steps to fight climate change and protect our green spaces, securing millions in funding to modernize and revitalize parks across the city, increasing accessibility for disabled residents, and offering amenities for all ages.

249
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:33,480
We're fixing sidewalks and streets that haven't been touched in decades and bringing back bus routes that our families rely on.

250
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:44,033
Additionally, I've been working with my colleagues to make City Hall more transparent and accessible with new newsletters, more listening sessions, constituent services in different languages, and the list continues to grow.

251
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:57,636
While politicians in Washington and up on Beacon Hill continue to cater to their rich donors, we've passed once-in-a-generation reforms to make housing more affordable, increase local business growth, and lead the fight against climate change right here in our backyard.

252
00:30:58,397 --> 00:31:03,740
And as I've talked to neighbors from all corners of life, I truly believe that there is more that unites us than divides us.

253
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:09,664
I know too many people are feeling the crunch, tired of seeing rents rise and dream of home ownership slip away.

254
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:15,189
They're tired of seeing their kids, my classmates, move because they can't afford to live here anymore.

255
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:19,992
They're tired of having to choose between paying rent, or for childcare, or for pest mitigation.

256
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:25,056
The truth is the status quo isn't working, and doing more of the same isn't an option.

257
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:37,165
And don't get me wrong, this will be hard, and we should be wary of those simply playing politics over simplifying complex problems in the form of flashy soundbites, further perpetuating us versus them attitudes.

258
00:31:37,725 --> 00:31:42,811
But when you really take a moment to sift through all of that noise, we can focus on our shared goals.

259
00:31:43,772 --> 00:31:54,184
Making Medford more affordable, ensuring we hold big developers accountable in our institutions to fight against displacement.

260
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:56,026
And that's why I'm running for re-election.

261
00:31:57,327 --> 00:31:57,608
Thank you.

262
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:14,245
Thank you to Phyllis, Bruce, and the Medford Democratic City Committee for organizing tonight's event.

263
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:15,626
My name is Liz Mullane.

264
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:19,289
I'm an assistant vice president of advancement at Northeastern University.

265
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:25,954
And in that role, I oversee six different teams within our department, which includes parents, planned giving, athletics, and the library.

266
00:32:26,675 --> 00:32:34,982
Since 2020, I've been an adjunct faculty member at Northeastern's graduate nonprofit management program, instructing adult learners on how to build a nonprofit business.

267
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:45,778
I have been in the industry for over 20-plus years with one of my first jobs at EMILY's List, an organization that raises money for pro-choice Democratic women running for office.

268
00:32:46,439 --> 00:33:03,368
Since then, I've continued to work within organizations reviewing budgets and creating revenue streams for a variety of issue areas, like need-based scholarships for students, medical advancements for Alzheimer's and other autoimmune diseases, and capital funding for community-based needs around mental health and the library.

269
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:10,452
In each of these situations, I have successfully raised funds through individual, foundation, corporate, federal, and government grant outreach.

270
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:20,277
As a consultant to nonprofits, I also witnessed the need for further education around budgeting, financial management, and strategic planning, so I went back to school to receive my MBA.

271
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:24,800
I moved to Medford in 2018, where I was a renter until we purchased our home here.

272
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,682
Along with my husband and our two dogs, Medford is where we plan on staying.

273
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:38,237
I've been involved with the Medford Democratic City Committee and serving as the Ward 2 Chair for the past few years, trying to get more individuals involved in the local political process.

274
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:44,020
I was compelled to join the City Council race after witnessing areas in Medford that needed addressing.

275
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,944
Numerous accidents due to lack of pedestrian signage, poorly kept streets, and sidewalks that have become hard to navigate.

276
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:55,586
With budgetary issues being a top concern and a lack of proper funding to some of our

277
00:33:56,046 --> 00:34:02,568
more important community services, I felt both my professional background coupled with my education would bring a different skill set to the city.

278
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:11,652
If elected, I plan to champion for a continued transparent budgeting process with clear updates on how funds are being used, allocated, and distributed.

279
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:25,943
to review how the city approaches funding, and to help find new and creative ways to generate revenue, especially for our community services, Likert Library, senior care, and mental health staffing, all of which I have successfully done in my professional career.

280
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:32,712
Incentivize and streamline the process for small businesses to enter Medford, which would only help to grow our commercial tack base.

281
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:43,180
As a dog owner with no backyard, focus on improved sidewalks and streets and more green space by proactively working on the 2026 Medford Open Space and Recreation Plan.

282
00:34:43,940 --> 00:35:02,627
continue to support the affordable housing trust to make housing more affordable in Medford through linkage fees and fundraising initiatives, to complete a pedestrian safety audit across the city to ensure a more walkable Medford, and to continue providing funding and support of the Medford public school system, which is imperative for our entire community's ongoing success.

283
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:11,110
I've enjoyed meeting so many Medford residents through this process, and I remain a listening ear to anyone who wants to discuss these issues or any other concerns.

284
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:11,911
Thank you.

285
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:23,050
Thank you so much for hosting this and thank you all for being here.

286
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,212
My name is Anna Callahan and I am a first term incumbent.

287
00:35:26,712 --> 00:35:29,554
I am really proud of the things that we did this term.

288
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:32,996
We took many steps to stabilize our city's budget.

289
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:38,780
We really worked on our rodent problems, enabling our staff to be able to take more actions.

290
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,441
to rein those in.

291
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:49,708
We protected, did a number of things to protect our residents from the Trump administration, and we've taken steps toward more affordable housing and affordability in our city.

292
00:35:50,329 --> 00:36:01,678
And you can count on me to be a vote in favor of what I believe are the values that we share here in Medford, and that includes

293
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:03,818
affordability and affordable housing.

294
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:06,519
It includes environment and climate change.

295
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:09,180
It includes being a more inclusive city.

296
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,522
But today, I want to highlight for you the things that make me unique as a city councilor.

297
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:25,284
And that really is in the question of democracy and engaging people in the political process.

298
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:36,082
I take it very seriously that 90 or 95% of the people who live in Medford will never come to a city council meeting and they will never reach out to their city councilors.

299
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:45,507
So I take it upon myself to spend my time and effort in going into the community and listening to those people so that they have a voice.

300
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:53,532
I currently have five different teams of volunteers who help me with different parts of my city councilorship.

301
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:59,236
The first one, and by the way, if anybody here wants to be on one of these teams, please do let me know.

302
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:03,138
The first one is what I call my legislative team.

303
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:08,982
It's a group of people who meets with me before every city council meeting and we go through every item on the agenda.

304
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:12,465
They do a lot of research, they'll reach out to other members of the community.

305
00:37:13,446 --> 00:37:16,309
It's a great way to really level up people who already are active.

306
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,652
The second team I call my democracy team.

307
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:25,438
This is a group of people that helps me to set up listening sessions throughout the community.

308
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:31,464
Sometimes they're based on a policy, sometimes they're based on a demographic group, sometimes they're just in a neighborhood.

309
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,867
And then I have three different policy teams.

310
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:41,350
One of those is around trees because we plant less than half as many trees each year as we lose.

311
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:54,438
So we are organizing, we're gonna be organizing with the city to have events where big groups of neighbors come together to plant trees in our most barren neighborhoods.

312
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:58,816
The second one, the other two are around housing and housing affordability.

313
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:05,304
One is a group of people that came to me and were interested in getting co-housing here in Medford.

314
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:10,470
And the last one is around home sharing, which is really enabling people to age in place.

315
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,334
So if anyone's interested in working with me, please let me know.

316
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:15,936
And I really appreciate you all being here.

317
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:31,873
Hi, everyone.

318
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:32,634
I'm Nick Giurleo.

319
00:38:32,654 --> 00:38:33,574
Thank you all for being here.

320
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:35,256
Just a little bit about my background.

321
00:38:35,576 --> 00:38:43,801
I grew up in Medford, lived here my whole life, went to Medford High School, graduated number one in my class, and decided to stick around for college, and ended up going to Tufts University.

322
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:45,282
Great education there.

323
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:49,405
And after that, I decided to work for a little bit.

324
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:52,007
I ended up working here in the square, actually, for a law office.

325
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:55,929
Really got interested in law through that experience, and decided I would go to law school.

326
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:58,131
So I went to law school, ended up at BC Law.

327
00:38:58,707 --> 00:39:03,912
Graduated from BC Law, became an attorney, and that's what I do today, work for a great firm in downtown Boston.

328
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:07,775
Just one little brief thing about here, about why am I running, right?

329
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:08,416
Why am I running?

330
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:11,799
I'm running because being civically involved is really important for me.

331
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,040
I want to be involved.

332
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:18,546
It's important to not complain when you have problems with what's going on in the city, but to take a step forward and do something about that.

333
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:23,030
So I decided I needed to step forward and do something about the things that concern me.

334
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,503
So two issues that I just want to talk to you about in my very brief time here.

335
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:30,926
Number one, that's been central to my campaign, affordability.

336
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:34,869
Medford is, as everyone probably knows, an increasingly unaffordable place to live.

337
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:40,993
Long-time residents feel pressured out of their homes, and residents who want to move here feel like they can't because of barriers.

338
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:42,314
So what can we do about that?

339
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:46,878
In my opinion, the main reason for unaffordability is just the burden that residents have.

340
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,962
in meeting our spending needs, primarily through property taxes, which is where we get the majority of our revenue.

341
00:39:52,303 --> 00:40:00,530
I think we can be smarter, though, and take that burden off them and shift it into areas like commercial, bringing businesses to Medford and also preserving our commercial tax base.

342
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:06,135
The commercial tax rate is nearly double the residential, so we get significant revenue through that.

343
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:07,216
That's one issue.

344
00:40:07,256 --> 00:40:07,937
The other issue here

345
00:40:08,497 --> 00:40:09,778
is transparency.

346
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,900
And for me, that primarily means council accessibility.

347
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,263
So allowing the city council to be a resource that everybody can use.

348
00:40:16,703 --> 00:40:19,966
So there's a lot of problems in terms of accessibility that we have to do something about.

349
00:40:20,446 --> 00:40:28,212
Very late running meetings, last minute agenda changes, getting very off topic often with the agenda items, as well as

350
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:33,454
reductions in the public speaking time at the expense of hearing people's opinions.

351
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:38,916
So I think we can do simple things like change the rules of our city council to make it more accessible.

352
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:42,177
And also I'm interested in information too, public information.

353
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:44,838
Voters should be informed, they have a right to be informed.

354
00:40:45,218 --> 00:40:54,862
What can we do to make public records more accessible to our citizens, honoring requests and making sure people don't feel left out, people don't feel that communications are lacking.

355
00:40:55,382 --> 00:40:57,163
So these are two issues central to my campaign.

356
00:40:57,764 --> 00:41:00,645
Again, I thank you all for being here, and I would very much appreciate your vote.

357
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:01,046
Thank you.

358
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:19,998
Testing.

359
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:20,358
Okay.

360
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,610
Good evening, everyone.

361
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:24,991
My name is Miranda Briseño.

362
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:33,416
I love calling Medford home, and I'm running for city council to make sure that City Hall delivers better for residents of all ages, wages, and backgrounds.

363
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:41,741
We deserve a Medford that invests robustly in the public places that keep us connected to each other, like our schools, parks, and library.

364
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:44,623
We deserve a library that is open seven days a week.

365
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:47,825
We deserve a Medford with plenty of shade trees and green space.

366
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:54,502
As a renter I felt firsthand how hard it is to afford to remain here amid the skyrocketing cost of living.

367
00:41:54,963 --> 00:42:05,369
We all deserve a more affordable Medford where elders can age in place and where new and longtime residents alike can put down roots without fear of displacement due to rising rents and home prices.

368
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:11,533
Medford students and families deserve thriving public schools and expanded after school and pre-K.

369
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:14,195
Our school staff deserves competitive pay.

370
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:18,478
I will fight for a budget that allows us to meet these goals every single year.

371
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:22,529
In addition, I proudly support building a new flagship Medford High School.

372
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:35,340
We deserve a Medford that invests in keeping all of our neighbors safe through an unarmed mental health crisis response team, continued noncompliance with ICE, and better social services for our neighbors in need.

373
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:41,979
Safety also means our roads and sidewalks and as a transportation planner road safety is my bread and butter.

374
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:48,904
In the last five years Medford has seen at least 84 crashes which resulted in serious injuries or fatalities.

375
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:52,167
We need to treat traffic violence like the emergency it is.

376
00:42:53,388 --> 00:42:58,332
At MassDOT I work with municipalities to help them utilize transportation funding to its full potential.

377
00:42:59,032 --> 00:43:04,857
I work closely on funding for large capital projects and I help manage essential programs such as the Safe Routes to School program.

378
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:11,025
This has given me a bird's eye view of the regional problems that affect us here in Medford and where the solutions lie.

379
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:18,027
As your city councilor, I will make sure we strategically leverage our transportation funding to make our streets safer.

380
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:26,449
I will also make sure the city completes an ADA transition plan so that everyone can participate in civic life and enjoy all that Medford has to offer.

381
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:30,839
But before my time at MassDOT, I worked right here for Medford City Hall.

382
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:41,665
I spearheaded Medford's COVID-19 Business Relief Grant Program, which provided crucial funding to Medford's restaurants, corner stores, salons, and spas to help them survive during an unpredictable time.

383
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:47,929
I developed the city's first outdoor dining program, and I helped the city improve its bus stop and blues bikes infrastructure.

384
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:54,633
As a MassDOT employee, I'm heavily involved in my union, and I currently serve on its board of directors.

385
00:43:55,974 --> 00:43:57,255
Medford runs on union power,

386
00:43:57,997 --> 00:44:02,902
and I'm proud to be endorsed by SEIU Local 509 and UAW Region 9A.

387
00:44:04,103 --> 00:44:07,627
I love being a part of our diverse, multi-generational, vibrant community.

388
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:13,133
My neighbors have always been there for me, and now I'm running for city council to make sure the city is there for you.

389
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:17,277
I look forward to meeting you and talking with you, and I hope to earn your vote this fall.

390
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:17,738
Thank you.

391
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:29,487
My name is Paige Valdini.

392
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:35,831
I'm the owner of Paige Aesthetic Skincare in the Hillside, a Medford public school parent, and I serve on the board of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

393
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:37,632
My husband, Jeff, grew up here.

394
00:44:37,892 --> 00:44:42,936
Our daughter, Kate, is a second grader at Missittuck, growing up in the same schools and community her dad once did.

395
00:44:43,816 --> 00:44:50,121
Nearly seven years ago, I started my business as a new mom and kept it open through the pandemic, when many in my industry closed.

396
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,323
I had to adapt, problem solve, and keep revenue coming in.

397
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:56,125
That's not easy as a solo business owner, but I did it.

398
00:44:57,165 --> 00:45:01,711
I also helped others in the skincare industry push through because I believe in lifting people up.

399
00:45:01,971 --> 00:45:02,692
That's who I am.

400
00:45:02,712 --> 00:45:03,653
I don't quit.

401
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:04,474
I adapt.

402
00:45:04,654 --> 00:45:05,835
I listen and I follow through.

403
00:45:06,276 --> 00:45:07,517
And that's what I'll bring to City Hall.

404
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:19,338
Those lessons also reflect the spirit of Medford, a city with deep roots and tradition, a city that's growing and changing, and above all, a city whose strength is in its people, our schools, our small businesses, and the city services that keep us running.

405
00:45:20,238 --> 00:45:22,960
I've seen what happens when we bring those pieces together.

406
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,461
As a chamber board member, I work to support small businesses.

407
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:31,024
I've coached and sponsored local youth sports, and I know the value of showing up for kids and families.

408
00:45:31,684 --> 00:45:36,628
Partnering with the PTOs and schools, I've helped expand resources for students, families, and educators.

409
00:45:37,228 --> 00:45:51,118
And by connecting groups like The Chamber, run Medford and Tufts University, I've helped raise funds to bring Tufts student athletes in as volunteers for school and community events, proof of what's possible, and a reminder that Tufts can be a stronger financial partner and better neighbor.

410
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:55,799
That's why I believe leadership has to rise above groups or sides.

411
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,160
I chose to run unaffiliated.

412
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,442
It would be easier to do this with a group or a slate, but that's not why I'm here.

413
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:09,625
I'm willing to take the harder path to represent everyone, to bridge divides, and to make decisions rooted in what's best for Medford.

414
00:46:10,345 --> 00:46:11,366
This is a critical moment.

415
00:46:11,726 --> 00:46:14,869
Decisions on zoning and growth will shape our future for decades.

416
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:20,094
When zoning reform came forward, I asked to slow it down, not to stop it, so we could get it right.

417
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:28,761
I championed separating business districts with mixed use from residential, and I used that time to ask questions and push for input from fire, police, and educators.

418
00:46:29,262 --> 00:46:31,083
That's how I will approach every issue.

419
00:46:31,504 --> 00:46:35,447
Do the work, listen first, and make decisions with real-life data and community voices.

420
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:39,310
That same approach must guide our budget and growth.

421
00:46:39,611 --> 00:46:42,072
We need to generate more revenue to make Medford stronger.

422
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:47,296
That means creating a developer program with clear expectations that ensures developers support our infrastructure.

423
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:55,522
It means attracting the right businesses shaped by community feedback to fill vacant storefronts and bring in revenue that Medford needs to invest in our future.

424
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,944
What sets me apart is I've lived this.

425
00:46:58,584 --> 00:46:59,745
I've run a business here.

426
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:03,028
I've navigated challenges and I stayed the course when it would have been easier to quit.

427
00:47:03,568 --> 00:47:07,769
That experience makes me the candidate best prepared to strengthen Medford's future.

428
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,090
At the end of the day, what I bring is different.

429
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,131
I've proven I can get through hard challenges.

430
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,312
I'm connected across Medford.

431
00:47:14,692 --> 00:47:18,033
I adapt, I listen, and I solve problems, and I'm not afraid to show up for the work.

432
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:24,995
After more than 15 years of living here, I believe Medford's best days are ahead, and I will keep showing up, asking questions, and moving forward together.

433
00:47:25,455 --> 00:47:29,797
Thank you to the Medford Democratic Committee, to my fellow candidates, and to everyone here showing up for our city.

434
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:43,029
Thank you.

435
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:49,091
Tonight I would like to thank the Memphis Democratic City Committee for allowing me to speak here for you.

436
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:50,771
My name is Rick Caraviello.

437
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:56,433
I have served for 12 years as city councilor and three terms as council president.

438
00:47:56,713 --> 00:48:01,454
And I'm also proud to be standing in a building that I played a major role in bringing to our city.

439
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:08,536
I am very thankful for the overwhelming support I have received, encouraging me to run again for city council.

440
00:48:08,936 --> 00:48:10,117
Tonight I stand before you

441
00:48:11,065 --> 00:48:14,946
not just as a candidate, but someone who believes deeply in the power of community.

442
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:21,007
I have walked these streets, shopped our local businesses, and listened to your concerns at coffee shops and kitchen tables.

443
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:27,809
As a result, I am running again because I believe Medford deserves leadership that listens, acts, and delivers.

444
00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:32,990
We are a community rich in history, diversity, and untapped potential.

445
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,750
But potential alone is not enough.

446
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,471
We need a city council that reflects our values,

447
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,922
in fights for our future.

448
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:45,626
The most contentious issue facing Medford is the proposed citywide rezoning and development.

449
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:49,129
The top priority of the council is to protect our neighborhoods.

450
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:52,572
However, this commitment has been put aside by this council.

451
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:57,976
This council wants to rezone our residential areas to allow two to six units per house lot.

452
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:01,098
This is a direct attack on Medford's character.

453
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:05,902
We should instead be concentrating on our commercial base and its potential.

454
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:12,593
Mephitt has business districts with untapped potential for growth, but smart growth, not overgrowth.

455
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:16,494
Let us build on that rather than changing its character.

456
00:49:17,114 --> 00:49:23,576
I will seek out common sense proposals for our business districts that will increase tax revenue, promote job opportunities.

457
00:49:23,636 --> 00:49:30,478
I will also advocate for responsible development that will protect our neighbors and expand affordable housing options.

458
00:49:31,498 --> 00:49:35,519
Police, fire, and DPW need to be supported by our public officials.

459
00:49:36,146 --> 00:49:39,070
Long overdue contracts need to be settled.

460
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,975
Our streets have long been neglected and it's time to address the matter at hand.

461
00:49:44,936 --> 00:49:47,840
Charter change is also on November's ballot.

462
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:50,763
Please make sure that you support this initiative.

463
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:52,812
This campaign is about us.

464
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:57,177
It's about building a Medford where everyone feels heard, respected, and empowered.

465
00:49:57,557 --> 00:50:00,340
I will listen to your concerns, ensure your voice is heard.

466
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:07,267
My priority is to restore trust in City Hall by making sure that the City Council serves the public, not politicians.

467
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,409
So tonight, I ask for your support.

468
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,314
Let us make Medford stronger, fairer, and more united than ever before.

469
00:50:14,555 --> 00:50:14,835
Thank you.

470
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:28,708
Hello, I'm Paul Donato, Jr., and I'm running to be your next city councilor.

471
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:34,812
I'm a lifelong resident born here and married with four children, with two currently in the school system.

472
00:50:36,123 --> 00:50:42,066
I want to thank you for giving me three minutes to speak, because if I was in front of the Medford City Council, I would only have two.

473
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:45,167
I love Medford.

474
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:51,050
It's a city with rich past and great resources, and most importantly, amazing people.

475
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:55,312
Our residents come from all walks of life and all age groups.

476
00:50:56,132 --> 00:51:02,115
And whether they've lived here for decades or just moved in, they'll all help make Medford what it is.

477
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:07,071
What we all share is a desire to see Medford grow and thrive.

478
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:15,436
To make that happen, we need strong leadership and a city government that truly works for the people.

479
00:51:16,597 --> 00:51:20,779
We need leaders with vision who involve the community in shaping the future.

480
00:51:22,901 --> 00:51:25,963
One example is the city's recent rezoning efforts.

481
00:51:26,523 --> 00:51:27,123
The problem?

482
00:51:28,324 --> 00:51:32,867
The community didn't ask for a complete overhaul of every neighborhood.

483
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:45,416
I believe we should take a smarter, more focused approach, starting with key areas like Mystic F. Right now, it's just a busy road, but it could be so much more.

484
00:51:46,217 --> 00:51:55,603
With thoughtful planning, we could add housing, support local businesses, bring in new shops, and improve safety and the look of the area.

485
00:51:56,744 --> 00:52:02,468
But these changes come from real conversations with the community, not top-down decisions.

486
00:52:03,575 --> 00:52:06,198
Another area full of potential is Medford Square.

487
00:52:06,818 --> 00:52:16,288
We've had plenty of studies and good ideas like more housing, riverfront walking paths, restaurants, parking, and shops that people want.

488
00:52:17,389 --> 00:52:24,476
I've worked with the city council and residents to turn those ideas into actions through workshops and open discussions.

489
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:34,443
As we plan these improvements, we also need to think about our infrastructure, things like roads, buildings, utilities, and city services.

490
00:52:35,743 --> 00:52:44,005
We must ask, do we have enough police, firefighters, and DPW workers and staff and equipment to support these changes?

491
00:52:44,785 --> 00:52:49,967
I'll make sure infrastructure planning is a required part of the development or rezoning project.

492
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:57,692
Smart rezoning and solid infrastructure planning are two key areas that I'll focus on as your new city councilor.

493
00:52:58,273 --> 00:53:05,337
But I'll also work with the new effective council to tackle other challenges and build a bright future Medford.

494
00:53:06,038 --> 00:53:11,842
I'd be honored to earn your vote and you can contact me at Donato4Medford.com.

495
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:12,382
Thank you.

496
00:53:23,796 --> 00:53:24,976
Hi, I'm Melanie Tringali.

497
00:53:25,597 --> 00:53:27,137
I don't know how I'm going to top that, Paul.

498
00:53:27,197 --> 00:53:33,859
But anyways, first of all, I want to thank the Medford Democrat City Committee for organizing this event.

499
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,441
I'm a longtime resident of Medford and a homeowner.

500
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:41,562
My husband, James Murdoch, and I live on Forest Street with our four children.

501
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:46,224
Both my parents were born and raised here and graduated from Medford High.

502
00:53:46,784 --> 00:53:50,085
My father, Salvatore J. Tringali, lived in South Medford.

503
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,886
And my mother, Lorraine Mifflin, grew up on the hillside.

504
00:53:53,826 --> 00:53:58,089
I'm a graduate of UMass Amherst, and have over 20 years of business experience.

505
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:01,372
As long as I have lived here, I have served this community.

506
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:11,080
I served on the Medford Family Network Advisory Board, was co-chair of the PTO for what was then the Columbus School, and served on the Historic District Commission.

507
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:18,846
Today, I'm a board member of the Rotary Club, an organization that provides services to the city and schools.

508
00:54:20,752 --> 00:54:23,738
I'm running because this is my home and a city I deeply love.

509
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:29,470
I want to serve this community, make a positive impact, and ensure Medford is the best it can be.

510
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:38,032
I believe in common sense change, the kind that strengthens neighborhoods, improves city services, and respects the history and character of our community.

511
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:44,814
As a councilwoman, there are many things I will work on, but given the time tonight, let me highlight my top four priorities.

512
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,316
One, I will always protect our neighborhoods and historic squares.

513
00:54:49,956 --> 00:54:53,217
Blanket rezoning would forever change our neighborhoods and community.

514
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:59,479
Instead, we should focus on thoughtful commercial development that grows our tax base and revitalizes our squares.

515
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:04,161
Two, our streets and sidewalks continue to be in disrepair.

516
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:08,762
Recent staffing changes and overrides have not made significant improvements.

517
00:55:09,503 --> 00:55:12,184
Potholes remain and sidewalks are unsafe.

518
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:20,027
Safe, walkable sidewalks and well-maintained streets are basic services that meet the needs of every citizen in the city.

519
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:25,225
Our first responders risk their lives every day to keep us safe.

520
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:31,711
They deserve to be fully staffed, have safe and clean facilities, and the equipment to do their jobs well.

521
00:55:32,571 --> 00:55:34,833
Public safety must come first in our city budget.

522
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:40,484
And fourth, for the fourth year in a row, Medford has had a large amount of free cash.

523
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:47,568
The percentage of that free cash exceeds most cities our size of what is considered to be a normal percent of budget.

524
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:55,493
I will push for line item budget breakdown and responsible planning so taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and timely.

525
00:55:56,493 --> 00:56:00,114
In closing, Medford deserves a City Council that puts Medford first.

526
00:56:00,754 --> 00:56:06,656
Protecting our neighborhoods, fixing our streets and sidewalks, supporting our first responders, and spending responsibly.

527
00:56:07,316 --> 00:56:12,678
As an independent candidate, I will bring balance, common sense, and accountability to City Hall.

528
00:56:13,178 --> 00:56:19,020
On Tuesday, September 16th, I respectfully ask for one of your seven votes for Medford City Council.

529
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:19,680
Thank you.

530
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,881
Good evening everyone.

531
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:32,043
Thank you for spending your Wednesday night with us.

532
00:56:32,604 --> 00:56:35,887
My name is Emily Lazaro and I am running again to be your city councilor.

533
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:47,038
Before being a politician I'm a writer a mom of two kids in our public schools and a cyclist and an advocate who ran for office because I was living out the effects of failed policy.

534
00:56:47,555 --> 00:56:49,336
and I decided I wanted to be part of the solution.

535
00:56:50,417 --> 00:56:58,642
Working in pursuit of a community of care, a city that stands beside each other, not against one another, has underscored my personal and professional life.

536
00:56:59,502 --> 00:57:09,468
As the former assistant director and the current president of the Malden Warming Center, I can attest that our community members with the greatest challenges are worthy of care and have inherent value and dignity.

537
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:18,430
Forty percent of Medford households experience hunger, and 7,500 Medford residents qualify for affordable housing, and we don't have anywhere for them to live.

538
00:57:20,031 --> 00:57:25,336
I've done a lot of listening, consensus building, and learning in my first term, and it reminds me of why I ran for office.

539
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,738
Government can't be afraid to do what's right.

540
00:57:28,298 --> 00:57:30,140
I'm ready to continue in that mission together.

541
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:38,467
I've worked diligently on legislation that shores up the rights of our residents, like the Welcoming City Ordinance and the Gender Affirming Care and Reproductive Healthcare Ordinance.

542
00:57:39,004 --> 00:57:41,046
protecting our neighbors from federal overreach.

543
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:53,036
I've worked with state legislators and city public safety officials to make major improvements to rotaries where Dan Dill and Arthur Weber, Medford residents, were killed crossing the street in crosswalks this past winter.

544
00:57:53,796 --> 00:58:01,543
I secured $750,000 of funding in the supplemental budget as part of the millionaire's tax to improve the rotaries near Dan Dill's crash.

545
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,924
Those improvements are happening right now.

546
00:58:02,964 --> 00:58:03,745
You can actually see them.

547
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:09,942
I am fortunate enough, if I am fortunate enough to earn your vote once more, I will keep up this good work.

548
00:58:10,463 --> 00:58:21,809
I'm advocating for our fire department by asking our mayor to use free cash, Melanie and I agree on free cash, to fund a full dive team to keep our residents safe in our beautiful lakes and rivers.

549
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:25,251
Our firefighters are ready to protect Medford, let's help them do it.

550
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:33,936
I'm working closely with our business community to ensure that Medford is a beautiful and friendly place to operate with vibrant and bustling squares and business districts.

551
00:58:34,613 --> 00:58:45,560
I am working closely with parents and elementary schools across Medford to reimagine the citywide elementary alliance ensuring the money raised is shared equitably based on the diverse needs and populations from Glenwood to Hillside.

552
00:58:46,801 --> 00:58:56,827
And as a member of the Medford comprehensive high school building committee I'm working collaboratively to deliver a brand new high school for our students to learn and grow and so that our community can feel a newfound sense of Mustang pride.

553
00:58:57,908 --> 00:59:02,711
I talked to residents at the senior center Wegmans the disability fair soccer practice

554
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,011
car park, elegant nails, and everywhere in between.

555
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:10,271
I see you, I hear you, and I take action for you, whoever you are.

556
00:59:11,232 --> 00:59:20,093
You deserve an elected official who believes wholeheartedly in the inherent worth of every human being and who will stand up boldly for that policy, for the policy that reflects that.

557
00:59:20,754 --> 00:59:23,334
And above all else, this campaign is about taking care of each other.

558
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:28,915
Everybody deserves to love where they live and a city council that will work tirelessly for their community.

559
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:32,216
You can count on me to continue to put in that work.

560
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:32,756
Thank you.

561
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,202
Thank you for the committee for hosting this event and my fellow candidates for being here today.

562
00:59:50,563 --> 00:59:51,283
I'm Zach bears.

563
00:59:52,024 --> 00:59:59,088
Six years ago I ran for Medford City Council because I saw what decades of shrinking government and reactive decision making had done to our city.

564
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,530
Medford had become a city of no.

565
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:05,212
No you can't get help at City Hall unless you know the right person.

566
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:09,935
No the city won't address the housing crisis that's made it too hard to build a future here.

567
01:00:10,636 --> 01:00:12,757
No the city won't stop the slow bleed.

568
01:00:13,062 --> 01:00:19,086
decades of budget cuts that left our streets crumbling and our schools without the resources students and teachers need to thrive.

569
01:00:19,747 --> 01:00:29,314
But together we've accomplished so much to do big things make hard decisions and start to become a city of yes a city that says yes to more transparent

570
01:00:29,862 --> 01:00:34,543
open government with clear goals processes and principles for how we make decisions together.

571
01:00:35,163 --> 01:00:47,446
Yes to finally creating a comprehensive plan already rezoning Mystic Ave and rezoning and doing the rezoning project that will encourage real and transformative growth build more housing and revitalize our business districts.

572
01:00:48,266 --> 01:00:53,727
Yes to passing questions 7 and 8 last year to stop the bleeding and invest in our schools and DPWU.

573
01:00:54,673 --> 01:01:00,536
And yes, to a real plan for growth and new revenue so we don't rely on regular overrides to provide basic services.

574
01:01:01,736 --> 01:01:09,920
This has only been possible because of the commitment of so many residents and city leaders to work together for a simple and just cause.

575
01:01:10,661 --> 01:01:14,702
To make Medford, an even better place, a city that works for all of us.

576
01:01:15,623 --> 01:01:20,405
A city that leads with shared values, clear principles, and delivers real results for our residents.

577
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:24,347
A city government committed to leading with compassion, hard work,

578
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:35,747
and supporting those most in need, to listening to the unheard, not just the loudest voices, to making tough choices and telling people the hard truths, not the easy falsehoods we might want to believe.

579
01:01:36,647 --> 01:01:38,208
Voters have a clear choice this November.

580
01:01:38,709 --> 01:01:40,289
Do we vote to keep moving forward?

581
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:41,930
My answer is yes.

582
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:46,053
And I believe the people of the city of Medford will keep saying yes to moving forward too.

583
01:01:47,393 --> 01:01:50,015
It's been the honor of my life to serve my hometown.

584
01:01:50,435 --> 01:01:52,256
And if I earn your vote for my fourth term,

585
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:59,471
I guarantee that I will keep fighting for a Medford where our city government lifts everyone up and solves big problems together.

586
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:07,503
If you want compassionate, principled, and effective leadership to keep Medford moving forward, I ask for your vote on September 16th and November 4th.

587
01:02:07,803 --> 01:02:08,063
Thank you.

588
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:18,969
Good evening.

589
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:23,794
I am Trisha Pelly, an independent candidate and homeowner running for the City Council.

590
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:28,259
I moved here to attend Simmons and completed my MBA in 2001.

591
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:37,650
I have 20 years of experience as a commercial lender in the banking industry, working with CEOs and CFOs with companies with revenues of $10 million to $60 million.

592
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:49,275
I became politically active in Medford when I led the battle to stop a methadone dispensary from coming to my Salem Street neighborhood, just 0.23 miles from an elementary school.

593
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,597
And then again with the radical rezoning of Salem Street.

594
01:02:53,097 --> 01:02:59,359
After many protests from us, the residents, the OCD, delistened and rolled back the zoning to what the neighborhood wanted.

595
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:10,790
Unfortunately, this City Council, under the leadership of Zach Baers and a motion from Matt Lemming, denied the citizens what they wanted and reverted back to the original zoning.

596
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:15,935
We must stop radical rezoning, which is now being proposed across the city.

597
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:21,380
Our job on the City Council is to protect our neighborhoods, not exploit them.

598
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:27,304
Yes, we must upgrade our squares and business districts, but not to the detriment of our neighborhoods.

599
01:03:27,824 --> 01:03:30,985
Our city has been left to deteriorate for far too long.

600
01:03:31,425 --> 01:03:33,426
Density is not going to solve that.

601
01:03:33,907 --> 01:03:42,351
The recent fire that took place in Somerville and demolished three homes less than a week ago was caused by all of their zoning changes to accommodate density.

602
01:03:42,911 --> 01:03:49,094
Be warned, this will happen here if we allow the density city council wants forced on our neighborhoods.

603
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:50,955
I will fight for our neighborhoods.

604
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:53,898
We must request a forensic audit.

605
01:03:54,359 --> 01:04:05,836
We all work hard for our money and it is incumbent for the city to accurately report to the public exactly how, where, why our money is being spent, dollar for dollar.

606
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:09,838
Yes, we have an audit annually by state-approved firm.

607
01:04:10,238 --> 01:04:14,179
However, we taxpayers deserve better financial reporting.

608
01:04:14,959 --> 01:04:24,022
Once our finances are in order, we can then make a sound decision and plan to fix our roads, fix our sidewalks, and get the lead out of our drinking water.

609
01:04:24,422 --> 01:04:25,682
Medford deserves better.

610
01:04:26,222 --> 01:04:28,383
We need to increase our commercial tax rate.

611
01:04:28,663 --> 01:04:31,765
The homeowners can't be the sole source of tax revenue.

612
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:44,011
We just lost $600,000 in tax revenue on the old Budweiser campus because our mayor allowed it to be sold to the MBTA, the same MBTA that she sits on the board of directors.

613
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:54,517
I ask you, Madam Mayor, isn't that a conflict of interest, selling out the taxpayers of this city to do a favor for a state agency of which you are a board member?

614
01:04:55,714 --> 01:04:59,557
I most certainly would find that is to be the case, in my opinion.

615
01:05:00,017 --> 01:05:02,459
And we must support our police and fire departments.

616
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,801
They are very important to our city.

617
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:17,410
After meeting with the president of Firefighters Local 1032, I learned that our fire department is understaffed to meet the needs of our current population and will not meet the needs of the proposed expansions.

618
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:19,812
Remember, a vote for me is a vote for you.

619
01:05:20,052 --> 01:05:21,473
I respectfully ask for your vote.

620
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:22,174
Thank you.

621
01:05:38,092 --> 01:05:45,160
Thank you to the Medford Democratic City Committee, the Library, my fellow candidates, and everyone for coming and tuning in.

622
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:57,152
I'm Milva McDonald, and the story of why I'm running for City Council starts a long time ago, as a kid growing up with an immigrant working-class mom who came to America from Italy in the 1950s.

623
01:05:58,934 --> 01:06:02,656
She was the hardest worker I've ever known, and she passed her work ethic on to me.

624
01:06:03,637 --> 01:06:16,144
Whether working at the Boston Globe while raising my four kids, sitting on the board of non-profits, or helping launch the Mystic LGBTQ Plus Youth Support Network, I have always put in the hard work required to get things done.

625
01:06:16,164 --> 01:06:21,067
A few years ago, I decided charter review needed to get done in Medford.

626
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:34,853
In 2021, I convened a group of residents to pursue options, and in late 2022, at our request, Mayor Brianna Lungo Kern formed the Medford Charter Study Committee and appointed me as chair.

627
01:06:35,693 --> 01:06:41,856
For two years, I led our 11-member committee in a comprehensive review of our city's foundational document.

628
01:06:42,556 --> 01:06:50,280
As a result, for the first time in 40 years, a new charter is projected to be on your municipal ballot this November.

629
01:06:51,535 --> 01:06:55,198
My experience chairing the committee inspired me to run for office.

630
01:06:55,938 --> 01:07:02,484
I want to bring the same level of research, outreach, and deep listening to the work of being your city councilor.

631
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:12,651
My priorities include growing the city's tax base through zoning, reviewing fee structures, and fighting for a better pilot agreement with Tufts.

632
01:07:13,432 --> 01:07:16,314
Addressing the affordable housing crisis is a necessity.

633
01:07:16,675 --> 01:07:20,437
We must support the Affordable Housing Trust and the Community Land Trust.

634
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:30,301
To ease the burden on taxpayers and renters, we should explore a residential exemption for owner-occupied homes and look further at the good landlord tax credit.

635
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:41,425
We need to ensure that we are meeting the goals in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which continues to safeguard Medford for the future while improving life now.

636
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:51,674
Medford has great cultural organizations, but I believe the arts need an anchor at City Hall, so I support the installation of a City Arts Coordinator.

637
01:07:52,715 --> 01:08:01,344
As Councillor, I would also work to create a commission to promote visibility, equality, and empowerment of our LGBTQ plus community.

638
01:08:02,405 --> 01:08:11,268
I think it's also the job of municipal officials to support our dedicated city staff and those in need, like seniors on fixed incomes and immigrant communities.

639
01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:16,270
I love people, hearing their concerns and stories, and doing my best to help.

640
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:25,993
As a second generation Italian American with working class roots, I will always put in the time, effort, and research needed to get the job done.

641
01:08:26,573 --> 01:08:31,555
And I will make responsiveness and respect priorities in all my interactions.

642
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:40,738
I'm excited to get to work to make our beloved city an even better place to live, and I ask for your vote in September and November.

643
01:08:40,878 --> 01:08:41,278
Thank you.

644
01:08:50,102 --> 01:08:51,803
I really want to thank the candidates.

645
01:08:51,863 --> 01:08:54,223
They did a fabulous job, but I must say, yes.

646
01:09:01,265 --> 01:09:14,170
In full disclosure, I put up the yellow card about 15 seconds sooner for one of the candidates, and I was going to add it on to the end, and the person finished.

647
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:20,112
So, Mr. Merritt, I want to know if you have one thing more you want to say, because you'll be able to sing.

648
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:25,477
I mean, I would have added it on the end, but he finished his speech.

649
01:09:25,618 --> 01:09:29,122
And I so apologize, but he didn't want to say, come back.

650
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:37,233
And I didn't want to say to all of you, but full disclosure, it was one timing error that I profusely apologize for.

651
01:09:37,254 --> 01:09:38,956
I am sorry.

652
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:42,280
Okay, good.

653
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:42,800
Thank you.

654
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:43,800
But I did want to say that.

655
01:09:44,141 --> 01:09:46,241
So thanks, everybody, for coming.

656
01:09:46,321 --> 01:09:50,162
I think this is such a great turnout, and I think we have a wonderful pool of candidates.

657
01:09:50,802 --> 01:09:52,942
And I say, Bruce, would you like to say anything?

658
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:54,622
We're all set.

659
01:09:54,662 --> 01:09:55,643
Thank you all for coming.

660
01:09:55,723 --> 01:09:56,083
Mingle.

661
01:09:56,283 --> 01:09:57,003
Have a great night.

662
01:10:09,965 --> 01:10:20,610
It's just in the interest of saving our earth, could I please have these back when we're done?

663
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,571
Okay, it's just a minor thing.

664
01:10:23,611 --> 01:10:25,632
The name tags back because we can reuse them.

665
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:26,832
Thank you.

666
01:10:29,328 --> 01:10:29,648
I'm good.

667
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:52,422
Thank you.

668
01:11:13,323 --> 01:11:15,904
leave it on while you mingle, and then give it to Anita.

669
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:18,785
You know, Melanie, I'm sorry.

670
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:21,745
Why don't you leave your name tag?

671
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,426
Everybody knows you're right.

672
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:24,106
That's right.

673
01:11:24,366 --> 01:11:24,926
That's right.

674
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:34,303
Yeah, exactly.

675
01:11:34,363 --> 01:11:35,083
What a nice turnout.

676
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:01,570
Okay.

677
01:12:30,877 --> 01:12:30,977
Yeah.

678
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:44,850
next

679
01:13:05,323 --> 01:13:06,465
No, but I saw that you were trying to listen to me.

680
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:22,958
Okay.

681
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:23,158
Yeah.

682
01:13:49,528 --> 01:13:52,930
Yeah, I wanted to ask, so I'm meeting next to Mystic.

683
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:56,773
What was the, what were the zoning things that you don't think are good for it?

684
01:13:56,813 --> 01:13:58,374
I want them to have firewalls.

685
01:13:58,494 --> 01:13:59,395
Yeah, okay, got it.

686
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:00,476
Shield on the right line.

687
01:14:00,496 --> 01:14:00,936
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:18,571
That's great.
