1
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,558
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:11,439
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,821
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:17,863
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:20,205
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:28,171
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:32,274
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,776
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:48,528
All right, we're here with Christine Barber, state rep from the 34th Middlesex District, Medford and Somerville.

10
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,130
So Christine, thanks for joining us.

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:57,337
We're going to start with our normal question for everyone, which is what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there?

12
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,578
Well, thank you so much for having me.

13
00:00:58,698 --> 00:00:59,759
I'm excited to be here.

14
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:05,944
Speaking about the question, I admittedly don't go out a lot.

15
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:09,405
I usually grab something at kind of a coffee shop.

16
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:12,687
So I do go to the Danish pastry house on Boston Ave a lot.

17
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:18,770
They have good quiches for lunch, and I've been known to get maybe a croissant or a pastry for lunch.

18
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:23,933
But if I'm going to actually sit down at a restaurant, Semolina is really good.

19
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:27,575
I'm actually having lunch with a friend there early next week.

20
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:29,396
They have great pasta.

21
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:30,397
So good choice.

22
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:31,097
Love it.

23
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:31,478
Yeah.

24
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:32,459
Great.

25
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:38,466
So we invited you on today to talk about a question on the ballot and the upcoming, which is new.

26
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:46,915
So we talked to Zach Bares several weeks ago ahead of the primary, and he talked us through the first three questions on the ballot, but a fourth question has been added.

27
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,859
So we were hoping that you could give us some context for that.

28
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:53,166
Yeah, so thank you for bringing this up.

29
00:01:53,307 --> 00:02:00,393
So question four is new to the ballot, and because of that, it's one that people don't know much about.

30
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:06,078
A yes on question four would preserve a current state law that passed a few months ago.

31
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:15,507
It's called the Work and Family Mobility Act, and that law would let all drivers apply for a driver's license regardless of their immigration status.

32
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:22,474
And what that really means is everyone driving would have insurance, would have a license, and we know, you know, knows the rules of the road.

33
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:32,105
So this was a late-breaking repeal attempt of that law, and it is confusing, but a yes on four preserves the law.

34
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,242
So it's sticking with a law that already exists.

35
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:36,902
Yeah.

36
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:41,204
So it's a law that has been many years in the making.

37
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:43,324
Folks have worked on this law for decades.

38
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:46,405
I came in and worked on it in the last four years.

39
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:49,947
We passed it earlier this spring overwhelmingly in the House and Senate.

40
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:54,048
There was three quarters of support in the House and Senate for this bill.

41
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,331
And it's actually really supported by law enforcement.

42
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:04,799
We've worked with police chiefs at the district attorneys and Attorney General Healey on this law.

43
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,862
So it is roundly supported.

44
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:10,486
A small group was able to get enough signatures to try to repeal it.

45
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:12,107
And that's what's on the ballot this fall.

46
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:15,790
just so I totally see what this means.

47
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:26,081
So we're voting to keep a law that allows undocumented immigrants to have driver's licenses, which also allows them to or mandates that they have insurance for their car.

48
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:27,816
Exactly.

49
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:30,417
So it's for undocumented immigrants.

50
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:36,520
There are some people who have TPS and some other immigration statuses where there can be, can be more challenging.

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,362
And this will be a standard Massachusetts license, which a lot of people have.

52
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:43,403
So, you know, in Massachusetts, we have the, there's two licenses you could get.

53
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:51,527
You can get the real ID, which, which you use to fly, but there's also an option to get a standard mass ID, which I have, a lot of people have.

54
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,869
And that's what would be provided.

55
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,916
And so no matter your immigration status, you would be able to apply for a driver's license.

56
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:05,463
And just to be clear, because it does come up, people still have to provide ID when they get the driver's license.

57
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:09,909
So you'd have to provide either a passport or a consular ID card, which

58
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,494
even though folks are documented, they have lots of this kind of identification and information.

59
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:26,781
So there are documents that, you know, a lot of us have that they are providing to be able to get a driver's license and drive legally in Massachusetts.

60
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:33,245
And are you hearing any opposition to voting to voting as Elizabeth?

61
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:41,445
So I have been mostly canvassing in my district, and I'll say there is a lot of support for this.

62
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:48,028
What I'm mostly hearing in my district is people are surprised that it's on the ballot because it's new to the ballot.

63
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:55,052
As people know, it didn't make the book, called the red book, the information for voters that gets sent out from the Secretary of State.

64
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,953
It was so late that it's not in that book.

65
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,074
So there's just confusion.

66
00:04:58,154 --> 00:04:59,815
I'm like, oh, I didn't know this was there.

67
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,657
So that's mostly what I'm hearing.

68
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:09,762
So we are, we're doing door-to-door canvassing, we're doing phone banks to try to just get the word out that this is on the ballot.

69
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:15,026
For most people, you also have to flip your ballot over because there are so many questions.

70
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:21,351
So make sure you fill out all of the questions and that it's a yes on four because it is a little confusing.

71
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:25,435
That is a repeal attempt, but it's a yes that preserves the law.

72
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:27,816
That does sound confusing.

73
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:46,026
And so the benefit of having more people insured, more people able to drive with a legal license, that means like I get in an accident with somebody now who doesn't have a license, doesn't have insurance, I'm like on the hook for like whatever damages are caused to my own vehicle, right?

74
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,728
And this would change or this does change that already.

75
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:54,690
Yeah, this would change that, though, that everyone driving would have a license and then, yes, would have insurance.

76
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,651
So this is actually not a new thing.

77
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,812
So 16 other states have already passed this law.

78
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:03,073
So it's actually good because we have data on what happens.

79
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:17,579
So in California and Connecticut, when they passed, each passed this law, they did studies and actually the cost of insurance for other drivers went down a little bit because you're not paying the costs of

80
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,342
uninsured motorist.

81
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:20,124
And that's true.

82
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:25,837
You have more security that you know if you're in an accident, the other person's likely to have insurance.

83
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:34,534
Are there any benefits for folks that are able to now get these licenses other than being able to drive legally?

84
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:56,686
Yeah, the benefit that I've heard from working with folks on this is really there is greater fear in just getting behind the wheel, you know, take your child to the doctor to get groceries, to go to work, and just a lot of fear of driving without a license and what that could mean.

85
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:56,966
Yeah.

86
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:06,092
This is something that provides security for people to feel, you know, less, less fear in their day to day, really basic activity.

87
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:26,685
But I also think about this as, you know, for all of us on the roads, it really makes all of us safer and safer when our kids are driving or when we're on the roads that we know everyone actually has a license and, and has, you know, we all have to go through a driver's test, knows the rules of the road and that we all have more security.

88
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:43,197
I think I'm just thinking about how access to state ID might just support the process of sort of pushing immigration and maybe just make that easier.

89
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:53,364
Yeah, a lot of people, I think, talk about this as an immigration issue, but one of the interesting things, and I think, you know, when I look at the other 16 states that did this, even though

90
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:57,809
It's some of our neighboring states like Connecticut, New York, Vermont.

91
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:12,347
There are also states like Utah that have passed this, so more red states, and that it isn't really, you know, we can't, I mean, as a state legislator, I can't do anything about the challenges of immigration reform or what I think should happen.

92
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:19,410
with immigration reform at the federal level, but driving and who has a license is a solidly state issue, right?

93
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,051
Like that is something the state controls.

94
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:29,815
So while I feel like I don't have control over what we do about immigration, but I do, we do have some say over, okay, so you're here.

95
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:32,316
do you have a license?

96
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:34,237
Do you even have the option of having a license?

97
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:42,763
And that is a, so it's a state responsibility and something that we can and we did do at the state level, like under our own purview.

98
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:53,670
And I do think that's why states you see that aren't necessarily like quote unquote blue states have done this is because they're, they know they're immigrants in their community and it's really about

99
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:57,074
It's about driving and what are the state rules there.

100
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:00,495
What does this mean for minors?

101
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:06,076
I'm thinking about maybe high school drivers, kids who might be driving for older parents and transporting siblings.

102
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:07,776
Yeah, that's a great question.

103
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:13,718
So it doesn't change a lot for minors and for the test process for what you're

104
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:15,220
for getting a license.

105
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:25,096
Really what it does is it just changes for people who are waiting or applying for a license that you can use your passport as a different form of ID.

106
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:28,181
So yeah, it doesn't change the ages or anything.

107
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:38,977
Yeah, I imagine just access to a car does a lot for families, like economically, they can get to work, they can get their kids to school more easily.

108
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:45,822
Like it seems like there are some non-safety like sort of advantages to those folks at this impact as well.

109
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,584
And there's also an economic, there is a real economic benefit.

110
00:09:49,684 --> 00:10:06,342
So a group called Mass Budget Policy Center, they do economic analyses for the state and they looked at other states too who had done this and they found that some of the money is from, comes to the states, state revenues and things like you have to

111
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,303
pay money to get a license and to get a registration, right?

112
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:10,344
Like, we all pay for that.

113
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:13,825
That will bring in, I think it's about $5 million a year.

114
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:20,068
But then there's also the economic cost of maybe getting insurance, the other things that aren't as big.

115
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:27,992
Now you have to get insurance, you may be buying a car, and then you'll be working and probably contributing to the economy in a different way.

116
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:28,692
Paying extra.

117
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:31,113
So, yeah, it's about, yeah, exactly.

118
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,335
It's about, I think, around $10 million a year in economic

119
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:39,057
benefit in allowing this as well.

120
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:42,198
So there is some other ancillary benefits.

121
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:51,563
And then the part about, you know, for all of our insurance, it can make us all safer and hopefully bring your car insurance down a little bit, which would be good.

122
00:10:52,796 --> 00:11:02,065
I know I lived in Boston before I moved to Medford and like parked my car on the street and our insurance went up when we moved to Medford and I was like very surprised.

123
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:03,426
Yeah, definitely.

124
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:08,130
It depends on where you live and then what the accidents rates are.

125
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:11,894
Some precarious rotaries for sure.

126
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:12,575
Yeah.

127
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:13,195
Great.

128
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:18,020
Well, I was wondering if there was any other else about the November ballot that you wanted to bring.

129
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:20,400
Yeah, there's definitely some other good questions.

130
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:29,188
But before we went to that, I did want to just also mention that on the question four, one thing to keep in mind is that that law enforcement also really supports this.

131
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:36,715
And I think that's something not everyone knows, but so locally Chief Buckley and other local police chiefs in this area support it.

132
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:39,837
And it's actually something that we've worked on with law enforcement.

133
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:43,641
And even though that might seem like a weird alliance, there was concern about

134
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:51,404
how to make sure we're keeping people safe and how to make sure that, honestly, police have the information they need when they're doing their job.

135
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:59,408
And we work together really well, including, you know, immigrant activists who work directly with some police leaders and

136
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:03,431
it actually has been a place where we found a lot of common ground.

137
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:18,284
So you may see we're trying to get a question for, there is a question for Ed, we're trying to raise enough money to get it on TV, which is really expensive, but actually the police chief from Lawrence is the main spokesperson and he has been really great in helping us shape the law.

138
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:22,488
So just for folks to know that, you know, including, you know,

139
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:28,735
more heelies, of course, running for governor, but as attorney general, she's done some of this work and worked on us with a lot, too.

140
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,277
So along those lines, really.

141
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:38,807
It makes me actually think about, like, is there any risk to folks who are undocumented, maybe have temporary status, that is there any risk to having a license?

142
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:39,267
Sure.

143
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:40,728
So this is something that worked on a lot.

144
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:48,010
So Laura Rotolo, Medford resident, who I know you've had on your show, she is a ACLU lawyer.

145
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:57,513
And we worked with a number of privacy lawyers on this very closely because we wanted to make sure when information is collected, it's protected.

146
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:06,316
So we wrote the law that's on the books in a way where it cannot be pulled by either

147
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:14,461
the federal government or by kind of a rogue employee who is handing out information that legally that it is protected.

148
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:21,724
We do know there's a, there is, you know, in the age of hacking and there's always a slight chance that people's information will be shared.

149
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:32,270
And in working with immigrant communities, there is this, there's an acknowledgement of that and that, you know, there's, there are people who say we'll take the risk to be able to drive and

150
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,394
you know, participate in our community fully.

151
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:43,186
So it's good to kind of have that information out, but the people most affected know about that and have that as a kind of calculated risk.

152
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:47,173
And we have done everything we can and a lot to try to protect people's information.

153
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:52,488
So other, your question was on other things on the ballot.

154
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:57,090
So, so I've actually, I am excited about the Democratic ticket as a whole.

155
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,033
There are, I think, five women running for constitutional officers.

156
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,454
So statewide office, which has never happened.

157
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:11,577
So I'm really excited to, I've done a lot of work to try to get women to run and to be able to vote for that many women statewide is really exciting.

158
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,338
And they're all of course, amazing candidates and really qualified.

159
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:16,699
And it's just, it's great that.

160
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,181
we're going to have so many women on, that we have so many women on the ballot.

161
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,442
There are a lot of ballot questions.

162
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:29,947
The other one that I've been also talking about is question one, which I think there's more knowledge about, but this is the fair share amendment.

163
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:38,172
And it's actually something I voted for four times now, because to get it on the ballot, we have to vote on it in successive legislatures.

164
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:43,655
Once you get this on the ballot, because we have to change the constitution to change our tax

165
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:47,016
policy in the state than how our tax policy is done.

166
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:51,218
And folks may already know about this, but this is really the millionaire's tax.

167
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:55,699
So if on only your income you get your first million dollars, you should be free.

168
00:14:55,859 --> 00:15:00,501
And above that, you would have a 4% increase on your taxes.

169
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:02,162
Any dollar above.

170
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,745
A million dollars is taxed at this different rate.

171
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:13,231
And importantly, that money would go to, and it's protected in the Constitution, go to transportation and education.

172
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:17,555
And I think we all know schools can use more support all across the board.

173
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,598
We're trying to invest more money in early education, public higher ed.

174
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,921
And then transportation is on fire.

175
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:29,944
We need a lot more investment in not in public transit, but also in our roads and bridges.

176
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:32,606
There's a lot more that we can do there.

177
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:37,289
So Massachusetts right now has a flat tax, which ends up being regressive.

178
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:41,732
So this would be a progressive taxation for the first time.

179
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:46,716
Regressive meaning the less money you make, like the sort of proportionally more taxes you pay.

180
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,256
Yeah, because it's a flat tax.

181
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:58,002
So if we all, we all pay the same percentage, you know, your percentage when you're barely making ends meet is a lot harder to make.

182
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,943
Wealthy have more, it's a bigger income.

183
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:07,767
So this would be a way to invest in our education and transportation systems and create a progressive tax in Massachusetts.

184
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:16,494
And that so that I understand like this has been the fair share amendment or something similar has been like tried that you've tried to get on the ballot before.

185
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:21,158
And was that change in the Constitution to like allocate that money to those things?

186
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:22,159
Is that new?

187
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,881
So this that's a good question.

188
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:32,167
And actually, before my time in the legislature, that there's been attempts over many years to try to change our tax policy in the state.

189
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,608
But it's true that

190
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:43,940
tying it to probably some of the most important things in people's lives, like education and transportation and making sure that we have to spend it on those is more popular, right?

191
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:58,684
So no one, you know, it's hard to make a case for paying taxes, but if it's, you're sure that it's going to important things like education, transportation, if it's- And we are sure about that because of the, because what you're saying, the adjustment to the constitution.

192
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:03,025
So it's in the constitution that there would be trust funds for education and transportation.

193
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:08,409
Yeah, some of the questions that I've got when I've talked about this is like, well, how do we know it's going to be spent right?

194
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:09,290
But it's good to know.

195
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:14,670
And honestly, education and transportation are two of the biggest things that we spend in the state government.

196
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,251
So I think, so we have to, at the state level, we have our budget.

197
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:21,592
It is around 40 billion.

198
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:23,433
We have to balance our budget every year.

199
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:28,094
And we don't, you know, when you think about the state budget, it's different than the federal budget.

200
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,955
We don't have defense spending, things like that.

201
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:36,137
So the big outlays are education and transportation are two of the biggest things, especially since we passed

202
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:41,002
Student Opportunity Act a few years ago to really put more investments in education.

203
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:48,370
So to meet those needs of where our schools need to be, we have to be able to put more and more in education in the next couple of years.

204
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,470
And how is that filtered to the city?

205
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,811
So we've, in Medford, you know, we've had a big year with budgets and education and, you know, Bruins and everything.

206
00:17:55,951 --> 00:18:01,912
How do you, how would the fair share money for, or like revenue from the fair share of the MISH, how would that be allocated to Medford?

207
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:03,353
That's a great question.

208
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,453
I don't, there's not, it's a complicated answer.

209
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:16,275
So right now, education funding to Medford, we have, there's a formula for how much Medford gets based on really Medford's income and how much property tax Medford's already putting in.

210
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:19,197
So some communities get more, some get less.

211
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:27,764
And then there's also challenges with things going into that, like money that's going out the door to charter schools and other things where money gets piped off.

212
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:34,489
But an increase in education funding will help raise Medford too.

213
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:45,117
And the other place is, I think, for early education, which is a place that Medford could build more, is figuring out how to supplement what we're doing for education and figure out for

214
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:49,520
you know, for early ed and for, you know, going to helping support younger families.

215
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,942
How do we increase that amount?

216
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:53,464
It is, are public colleges included?

217
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:56,266
Yeah, so it includes public higher ed too.

218
00:18:56,366 --> 00:19:06,395
And even though we don't have one right here in town, something I've been working on is just addressing the cost for families of public higher ed has gotten really expensive in the state.

219
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:11,239
We have a lot of great colleges, universities, community colleges, and it's just getting, we're out of reach.

220
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:11,959
So how do we

221
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:22,245
invest more so families can actually go there and be debt-free or, you know, be able to work a job and actually pay for school in that way.

222
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:23,346
Great.

223
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:27,068
I did just fill out an application for Joe Biden's, what is it?

224
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:28,569
The relief grant.

225
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:28,929
Yes.

226
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:35,612
There's the, well, yeah, there's the public service relief if you're in and out of Iowa.

227
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,595
It is, but they've redone the application where it's,

228
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:41,536
It's supposed to be easier.

229
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:48,783
So there's a new version out there that we're trying to promote, but you have to, the goal is to do it by the end of October is that everyone should do that.

230
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:49,224
Yeah.

231
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:55,009
And then of course the new benefit for everyone who has student loans that has a longer re-enrollment period of life.

232
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:56,651
And teach less than a minute, honestly.

233
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:56,951
Yes.

234
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:58,353
We'll do it if you can.

235
00:19:58,393 --> 00:19:58,653
Yeah.

236
00:19:58,893 --> 00:19:59,594
Yeah, definitely.

237
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:03,417
So more to come there, hopefully on, on.

238
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:07,662
at least for public higher ed, making them more accessible for people.

239
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:08,543
Good to know.

240
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,406
Any other points about the bell that you want to make?

241
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:12,667
I think that's it.

242
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:14,249
Yes on four, yes on one.

243
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,992
Anything else you're working on that you want to bring up?

244
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:20,754
There's a lot of things happening.

245
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:33,126
I guess I would say one of, of course, the questions I get a lot is about the T. And there is a lot to do to both invest more money in the T and hopefully manage it better in the new administration.

246
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:34,968
So, you know, vote for Maura Healey.

247
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:36,009
She has a plan.

248
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:46,237
And but one of the things that just to do a plug for for Medford is one of the things that he has been doing is they're rerouting all their bus buses.

249
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:57,126
You've heard about this, but when they came out with their proposal, there was a big hole in Medford Hillside in particular and in some of other routes that went to Medford Square and the express bus.

250
00:20:57,446 --> 00:20:58,707
So I just went on a briefing.

251
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:01,189
They're going to they're going to next week announce

252
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,169
the changes to their routes.

253
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,310
And when I went to the briefing, they said they heard them.

254
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,991
They did like a list of where they heard the most comments.

255
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:14,072
And by far, they heard the most from Unford Hillside area, which across the whole state.

256
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:14,773
That was very important.

257
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:17,073
And then the second was Somerville, which made me proud.

258
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:19,134
It's my district where they heard from most people.

259
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:23,615
But I think people will be happy with some of the changes they're making back.

260
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:25,836
to the roots and we've really been fighting for that.

261
00:21:25,957 --> 00:21:28,658
So stay tuned on that.

262
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:34,362
But it's really the result of people's organizing and really making a big deal about this issue.

263
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:42,008
So we're trying to get better T access and get the T to run on time, which is a big challenge, but one that I'm continuing to work on.

264
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:42,968
Well, thank you.

265
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,691
Well, thank you so much for having me.
