    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=31.465s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend the rule seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=37.27s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=37.931s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=40.933s">Madam</a>  President, I offer a motion this evening as I look out in the audience and I see a number of our friends from organized labor that are here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=47.219s">Normally</a>  they have been able to provide us with updates throughout the course of this past term. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=51.917s">as</a>  to the status of the contract negotiations and the status of labor relations here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=56.318s">And</a>  they've always very patient. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=58.578s">They</a>  usually wait till the end of the meeting, sometimes three and four hours after the opportunity to speak before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=63.259s">So</a>  I thought it'd be a nice gesture to allow them to speak first this evening.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=66.32s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=66.9s">And</a>  there's a motion to take public participation out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=70.32s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=71.641s">All</a>  right, so we already suspended the rules to take public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=75.821s">So</a>  who would like to come up and speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=78.222s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=87.919s">Good</a>  evening, Madam President, members of the City Council, Stephen South, 106 Damon Road, also Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=97.634s">I've</a>  come here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=100.036s">Recently,</a>  the mayor gave a state of the city address and we are here to give a state of the union negotiations address, if you will, or update. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=111.824s">So</a>  currently Teamsters Local 25 represents hundreds of your employees and our members within the city of Medford in eight separate bargaining units. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=122.311s">And</a>  I'll give you a short <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=124.752s">update</a>  of where we are on the bargaining for all these. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=128.113s">With</a>  the DPW group, many of them are here tonight behind me. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=132.755s">Their</a>  last raise was January 1 of 2022, and we had our last negotiations on January 20, which seems to be the end of the city's good faith bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=144.818s">The</a>  city has verbally gave us a last and final of <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=150.741s">2%</a>  each year for three years on top of a bunch of concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=155.005s">And</a>  for those of you on this side of the rail and this side that aren't aware of what concessions mean, that means that a lot of the benefits that the employees, the hardworking employees behind me currently enjoy, the city wants to take away and give them only 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=172.179s">The</a>  city's inspectors, recreation department, and DPW superintendents, the second group, their last raise was January 1, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=183.828s">We</a>  also met on January 20, and the city gave us their last and final of many concessions to the benefits and things that our members currently enjoy, and also 2% each year for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=199.121s">in</a>  the January 20, 2023 was the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=203.903s">January</a>  20. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=204.664s">Yes,</a>  when they told us one of the make sure things when they made it clear that none of our groups are getting more than 2% each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=212.287s">The</a>  parking department, which just came into existence in January of 2022, they've never had a race. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=219.33s">And</a>  since you hired these people and created this department, they have suffered more than any <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=227.653s">more</a>  than most groups in the city, including but not limited to. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=232.318s">You</a>  have changed their schedules from a five day work week to a six day work week. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=236.522s">They're</a>  now required many of them to work Monday through Saturday and that's to get 35 hours pay.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=243.388s">Just</a>  to be clear when you're saying you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=245.35s">Council</a>  has not made that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=247.071s">The</a>  city administration has.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=248.051s">Yes,</a>  the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=249.051s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=249.392s">The</a>  city's administration, the mayor and her people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=253.333s">They're</a>  required to work six days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=255.234s">This</a>  is not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=256.914s">And</a>  that's to get 35 hours, which there is no other bargaining unit in the state of Massachusetts that I'm currently aware of that is required to work six days to get 35 hours pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=268.313s">They've</a>  also changed it to where now these guys have alternate schedules, meaning this week they work days, next week they work nights, the following week they work days, the following week they work nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=280.118s">Call</a>  it an alternate schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=283.88s">Some</a>  of these guys have families. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=285.4s">I</a>  don't know how they can plan their family life with a wife and children with those schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=291.323s">And</a>  I know many of you have families, so I know you can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=298.62s">don't</a>  fall over, they put body cameras on our parking control officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=303.221s">And</a>  I do want to point out, and I love the police in Medford, they are amazing, but the police in Medford don't wear body cameras, but the parking control people that write tickets wear body cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=316.544s">It</a>  was never bargained with Local 25, we currently have litigation outstanding related to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=321.685s">They</a>  also, when people call in sick, they will change their hours <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=327.126s">even</a>  on a day-to-day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=328.608s">If</a>  someone calls in sick tomorrow and you're a day person, they may make you work nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=334.433s">These</a>  guys really have a tough road. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=339.077s">That's</a>  the parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=341.078s">And</a>  again, the city has indicated we're meeting with them tomorrow, but the city's attorney, not the city's attorney because we don't have any, but KP law attorney indicated that they would be offering 2% for all of our groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=355.442s">Number</a>  five is the Medford Clerical. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=359.405s">Their</a>  last raise was January 1 of 2019, which is over four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=365.208s">It's</a>  exactly tomorrow, 49 months since they had a wage increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=372.013s">We</a>  last met about three weeks ago, and the city had offered us at the previous session <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=380.498s">Now,</a>  mind you, other groups got $1,500 COVID bonuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=386.561s">They</a>  offered us $500 COVID bonus at the previous session, and at the last session, which was our final, they went from 500 to a 0% bonus. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=397.067s">And</a>  one of our big issues with that group is these are some of the lowest paid employees in the city, and right here in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=406.331s">And</a>  there's a couple different classifications in that group the junior clerk and senior clerk which are, I believe, the lowest paid employees in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=415.021s">So</a>  we asked the city to do a market rate adjustment which many communities have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=421.568s">And</a>  they agreed, finally, at the last session and said that they would agree to give the lowest paid workers in the city a $4 per week wage increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=431.358s">So</a>  that was the city's fix for their very low wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=434.802s">And</a>  I don't mean per hour, per week, $4 per week in addition to their raises, $4 per week to make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=444.672s">So</a>  that's obviously a no. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=447.514s">Let's</a>  talk about the schools and the school security. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=450.275s">And</a>  I know that's been a huge topic in the last month plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=456.934s">Our</a>  school security personnel, their last raise was July 1 of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=460.116s">That</a>  was three years and a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=464.74s">They</a>  currently make $17.50 per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=468.342s">These</a>  are people that are reporting to fights and stabbings, a stabbing, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=476.277s">They</a>  have a very difficult job, $1,750 per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=479.58s">So</a>  obviously, we're trying to bring that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=482.021s">But</a>  the problem in that negotiation is the city is offering us, again, they just settled with the teachers and gave them $1,500 per year COVID bonuses, and they're offering us half of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=493.871s">It's</a>  unacceptable, and that won't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=497.693s">School</a>  custodians last raised July 1, 2020, three years and one month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=503.158s">Same</a>  thing, they're being offered less than the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=507.043s">that</a>  less bonuses, less raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=511.767s">And</a>  number eight is the school administrators, directors, coordinators, assistant principals, outside of the superintendent and assistant superintendent, these people run Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=523.456s">Their</a>  last raise was January 1 of 2021, a little over two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=528.981s">And</a>  the city took the position at the last, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=531.623s">negotiation</a>  we had a few weeks ago that they currently don't even have a contract because they switched to the teamsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=538.331s">We</a>  filed an unfair labor practice with the Massachusetts Labor Relations Board and that's currently pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=545.319s">Um,</a>  and they also notified us that they would not process any grievances because <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=550.925s">this</a>  group doesn't have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=554.407s">But</a>  either way, they're telling us that regardless of all that, they're not agreeing to what the teacher's got. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=559.809s">And</a>  these are people that supervise teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=562.17s">That's</a>  number eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=563.491s">So</a>  I know all of you, not all of you personally, some of you personally, some professionally, and I know you're all very smart people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=571.354s">I</a>  have a lot of respect for what you all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=572.995s">So</a>  I know you're probably thinking in your mind, well, why is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=576.916s">And</a>  what are other communities getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=578.777s">And</a>  what are other groups getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=581.125s">Well,</a>  if that is your question, I have the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=584.548s">And</a>  I can provide you, and I send you guys emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=587.831s">Other</a>  times I can provide you with these via email if you wanna see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=591.334s">So</a>  I negotiate all the surrounding contracts in surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=595.557s">In</a>  the last year, a little over a year, I've negotiated in Everett, three separate collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=601.382s">It's</a>  a four year deal, 3% each year, three, three, three, and three, with many other improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=607.207s">In</a>  Malden, about three months ago, I settled a contract in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=612.431s">This</a>  was 3% each year for three years, three, three, and three, with market rate adjustment raises on top of that and many other improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=620.857s">That's</a>  Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=621.837s">In</a>  Chelsea, we just settled a three-year deal with Chelsea, 4%, 3.5%, 3.5%, and market rate adjustment raises with many other improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=627.902s">Chelsea.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=628.182s">In</a>  Newton, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=635.667s">Little</a>  over a year ago, we settled a four-year deal, 3% each year, 3, 3, 3, and 3, and market rate adjustment raises on top of that with many other improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=645.292s">In</a>  the city of Waltham, about 3 and 1⁄2 weeks ago, I settled a contract for 80 employees there, 3.25, 3.25, 3.25, market rate adjustments on top of that, a three-year deal, many other improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=660.819s">In</a>  North Reading, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=662.425s">About</a>  three months ago, I settled a contract with the North Reading DPW, 3% each year, 3, 3, and 3, with many other improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=671.628s">In</a>  the town of Stowe, last year, I settled a contract for the DPW there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=678.297s">and</a>  it was anywhere between 15 and 21% for over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=683.38s">That</a>  includes market rate adjustments and many other improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=686.842s">So</a>  that's seven communities, six are right near here, one still is a little bit further out, but that's just in the last little over a year, myself personally negotiating with the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=699.01s">We're</a>  being told by the KP law lawyer that <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=703.533s">any</a>  final deal with any of our groups will be 2% each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=708.016s">And</a>  they're also insisting upon many concessions with my groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=713.759s">Just</a>  to give you a quick update that I know that the city does not provide all of you, and I come here every month or so to provide it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=722.323s">Currently,</a>  my members have five open federal lawsuits against the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=726.786s">These</a>  are wage and hour lawsuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=729.127s">These</a>  are five separate groups of employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=733.029s">We</a>  have approximately 30 or a little over 30 unfair labor practice charges with the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=741.418s">And</a>  we've been meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=743.22s">We</a>  met with a mediator just Friday, a state mediator, to try to mediate some of these before we go to more hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=750.847s">We've</a>  received favorable decisions from the Labor Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=753.949s">I've</a>  been sending them to you via email. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=756.831s">There's</a>  been several of those in the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=759.913s">We</a>  have an open complaint at the Secretary of State's office for the city refusing to provide the union with public documents, including bills for KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=770.5s">They</a>  gave them to us, but they were 100% redacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=772.321s">They</a>  claimed <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=774.142s">attorney</a>  client privilege, which there's no such thing with a simple legal bill that just states the dollar amount and what the issues were. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=783.946s">We're</a>  also filing another complaint because we've been requesting information regarding the city's use of private investigators to follow city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=796.03s">They've</a>  provided us a bunch of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=799.902s">over</a>  the course of a year with multiple requests and labor charges, but there's still information that they're redacting. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=807.589s">And</a>  we feel that it's important, but they have finally admitted in writing that the city is hiring these people through KP Law as a shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=817.298s">So</a>  KP Law hires them and then the city reimburses. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=820.421s">And</a>  I think that's how they get around giving us some of the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=825.47s">So</a>  regarding the open negotiations, and I'm almost done, I apologize for the length of my report, but, and I'll use a quote that I heard last week, very similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=840.243s">This</a>  union, Local 25 and our members, our couple hundred members and their families, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=845.421s">will</a>  never ever agree to 2% in a bunch of concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=849.924s">That</a>  will never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=851.645s">And</a>  the quote is, not now, not ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=854.947s">That</a>  is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=856.808s">And</a>  for all of you, for the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=862.327s">You</a>  know, we come up and report things to you often, but I never really ask of anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=867.47s">But</a>  I'm asking all of you to assist with this, because this is your city, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=872.352s">You</a>  all work here and live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=875.634s">And</a>  it's not just us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=877.055s">And</a>  I can't speak for other unions, but I'm aware that there's other unions that are in the same boat as us, that are working without a contract, some of which are protesting with us, like last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=889.261s">It's</a>  unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=890.282s">There's</a>  no reason why all of these other communities can provide fair wages, fair contracts to their employees, but Medford can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=901.51s">That's</a>  just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=903.771s">And</a>  the teachers settled their contract recently, and they settled for a four-year deal, 2.5 year one, 2.5 year two, 3.5 year three, 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=916.876s">year</a>  four for 11.5% over four years, and we're being offered 2% a year in a bunch of concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=924.783s">And</a>  I don't want this to be divide and conquer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=927.744s">I</a>  love the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=928.745s">Many</a>  of them are my friends and family. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=930.826s">They're</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=931.646s">They</a>  deserve everything that they got. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=933.447s">They</a>  deserve more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=935.768s">But</a>  there's no way that the city can give a fair contract to 500 teachers and then tell the rest of the city that they have to take things away from them just to give them 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=948.794s">When</a>  last year, the inflation rate <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=951.915s">when</a>  anywhere from 6.5% to 9.1% and currently as of December 2022 at 6.5% and the new data comes out in a couple weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=963.403s">So</a>  I would ask all of you to write a letter to the mayor and her administration and demand that the employees that you all represent or <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=975.544s">that</a>  work in this city, just like you all do, that they get what they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=980.187s">And</a>  we know these guys aren't gonna be millionaires. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=982.528s">We</a>  know they're not gonna buy mansions off of city salaries, but they shouldn't be living in poverty. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=990.494s">People</a>  shouldn't be making $17 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=994.216s">People</a>  shouldn't be having to beg just to get a small raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1001.653s">to</a>  be able to pay the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1003.274s">People</a>  shouldn't go 49 months and counting without a wage increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1010.478s">That</a>  is just unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1012.239s">And</a>  this isn't a chess game. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1013.64s">This</a>  isn't some kind of game, maybe for the administration it is, but these are real <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1021.224s">people</a>  with real families and spouses and children and dogs and mortgages and lots of bills to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1028.366s">So</a>  this is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1029.647s">So</a>  I am finally once I'm asking you all to help, not to help me, but to help <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1037.069s">your</a>  employees and my members because what is going on now is unacceptable and certainly I'm open to any and all questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1045.652s">I</a>  would even encourage if one of you wants to show up or all of you show up to our contract negotiations, I will gladly send you <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1054.067s">the</a>  dates for all of our upcoming negotiations, because I know this seems unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1059.43s">You're</a>  probably, I see a few of you shaking your heads, because it seems so ridiculous, and it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1064.592s">But</a>  if you want to see it for yourself, under Mass General Law, I have the right to bring whoever I want to negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1071.415s">So</a>  I would certainly offer an open invite to all seven of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1075.557s">And</a>  Adam, if you would like to go as well, sir, you're more than welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1080.259s">So</a>  the eight of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1082.18s">You're</a>  more than welcome to come to our bargaining and anything you can do to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1085.905s">I</a>  know I appreciate my members appreciate and I thank you for your kind attention.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1091.813s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1093.094s">If</a>  I can, Mr. South, I appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1095.694s">I</a>  appreciate the updates because I don't think people understand, you know, when you see the mayor come up and they do the state of the city address and everything's happy and, you know, skate with the mayor, that's a new one that's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1108.177s">This</a>  is what infuriates this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1110.798s">I</a>  remember just a few short years ago, this body, including the mayor, talking about the essential workers and how important they were during the most difficult time in our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1123.791s">people</a>  that got up every single day to make sure the streets are plowed, make sure that the parks are clean, making sure that the pipes that burst are fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1134.716s">We</a>  made sure that our municipal workers, our DPW, were applauded, and this is a true slap in the face when it comes to what I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1145.38s">So</a>  I have a dumb question, because I can only imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1149.562s">I</a>  know what's going on, but I will tell you <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1152.862s">as</a>  a first member of this community, I see each and every member that's sitting behind you in their trucks every single day, working every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1161.849s">I</a>  haven't seen one iota of change, and that's what I find impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1166.033s">So</a>  my question truly is, how is the morale of this team? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1170.156s">I</a>  mean, I know, are we filling openings? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1173.259s">I</a>  mean, are they still doing the job of our minimal <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1177.362s">compared</a>  to what we were looking for during negotiations when we heard the ridiculous numbers, when we talk about a city the size of Medford and the DPW team that we have and how limited it is, that hasn't changed, correct?</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1193.502s">Well,</a>  yes, several questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1195.603s">And</a>  first of all, I just want to say thank you for your service, for your question, and for the fact that you've always been a champion for the working people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1204.486s">So</a>  we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1206.426s">The</a>  morale in Medford, not just with the DPW, but with all the different groups, is very, very poor. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1212.568s">Frankly,</a>  I've represented workers in the city since 2008, and I've never seen it like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1218.19s">It's</a>  actually depressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1221.733s">The</a>  as far as being able to fill vacancies, the city's not posting all the vacancies and we are short staffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1229.798s">We're</a>  extremely short staffed and we have been for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1233.4s">But</a>  it's funny that you asked because I just looked on the city's website today and saw some of the vacancies that are posted, such as the city solicitor, the assistant city solicitor, the IT director, the benefits coordinator, tree climber, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1248.889s">And</a>  so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1250.39s">The</a>  list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1251.55s">And</a>  many of them that are vacant are not even posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1254.491s">So</a>  that is also very problematic with our groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1260.373s">Last</a>  year we saw people fleeing <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1265.088s">the</a>  city of Medford from working here, fleeing, not just the people that were unlawfully terminated, but people just quitting and going elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1273.73s">And</a>  I've gotten up and spoken about it previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1276.571s">And</a>  I'm not just talking union members, I'm talking union management, non-union. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1283.312s">I</a>  mean, just within the last few weeks, the assistant superintendent of Medford public schools quit to go work for Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1290.732s">What</a>  does that tell you? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1291.533s">That</a>  was the number two person at Medford Public Schools, just quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1295.981s">And</a>  that's now vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1297.223s">I</a>  mean, this is problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1298.526s">This</a>  has been going on the last couple of years, three to be exact. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1303.015s">and</a>  something has to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1305.516s">And</a>  I know that the state of the city, when addressed by one person, seems rosy, but it is not rosy. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1312.817s">We</a>  have big problems in the city and something has to give, but I'm asking you all for your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1318.279s">And</a>  I do appreciate everything you guys do, but I just want you to know how bad it is and how desperate your employees and our members are. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1327.141s">Well,</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1328.642s">And</a>  I think that this is what bothers us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1331.024s">I</a>  mean, you know, I'm hearing from from colleagues and neighbor communities that they they used to say they used to open a bottle of wine on a Tuesday night to watch Council Penter and Council Camuso go after each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1342.974s">And</a>  they thought that was funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1344.635s">But</a>  what you had there, you had two people that they had different views, but they both loved Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1349.419s">That</a>  was the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1350.459s">And</a>  they wanted Medford to be the greatest city in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1354.122s">What</a>  I'm seeing right now is <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1356.658s">what</a>  I'm hearing, what I'm seeing right now, not getting any financial paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1360.924s">We</a>  don't know where the city's finances are. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1363.347s">If</a>  this is an indication, I think this is pretty scary, that if she's only offering 2% to the most, the hottest working people in our workforce, that <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1373.88s">They're</a>  only offering 2% standing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1376.641s">I</a>  find it scary to where we're going to be in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1379.882s">So</a>  for one, I'll do anything and everything that I'm not afraid to stand on any soapbox if it can carry me and say whatever has to be said for the men and women that work for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1391.906s">I</a>  think that what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, is that the morale in this community is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1397.748s">The</a>  workforce just isn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1400.009s">And</a>  everybody's being pit against each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1403.465s">And</a>  what keeps coming back to me, the mayor made a comment that it's difficult to clean up city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1412.591s">I'm</a>  still confused with that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1414.252s">I</a>  don't know where that's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1415.933s">She's</a>  been in office now, it's in her fourth year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1418.455s">I</a>  don't know what that means because all I'm seeing right now is a city that has no leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1425.439s">I'm</a>  seeing a city that has no directors and no leaders in different departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1430.983s">We</a>  have a city council that has no power. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1434.085s">We're</a>  an absolute laughingstock when I'm talking to colleagues in other communities that they can't believe what we have to do as a council when we're asking for simple documents to do our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1445.312s">Now,</a>  are you just negotiating? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1446.593s">Is</a>  this the, it's not the chief of staff, it's not the HR director anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1450.976s">I</a>  know that we gave him a fancy name with more money, but I don't, you know, that's the other piece is when we talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1458.401s">the</a>  higher level. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1459.263s">I'd</a>  like to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1460.505s">You</a>  probably have it somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1461.807s">And</a>  if you could forward it to us, I'd like to see what the leadership at the school system is making. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1467.236s">I'd</a>  like to see what the leadership here at City Hall is making that are in that are <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1472.215s">are</a>  negotiating with you because I bet you they're not worrying about how they're gonna pay their sons or daughters tuitions that members behind you have kids going to school as cost of living increases or the price of gasoline. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1484.122s">So</a>  for one council, I'll do anything, any invitation that's offered to me, I'll gladly join in and share my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1493.488s">I</a>  think what people really have to understand out there is that we're not in very good shape in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1498.771s">And</a>  this is a great example of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1500.912s">The</a>  teachers settled, but they're not happy either. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1503.985s">They're</a>  not happy either. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1504.828s">We</a>  know they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1506.398s">but</a>  they know they had to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1508.359s">One</a>  thing we're seeing from our DPW employees, they're not stopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1511.92s">There</a>  is no threat of a strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1514.581s">They're</a>  still doing the job above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1517.823s">So</a>  I applaud them all and I applaud you for sticking with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1521.004s">And</a>  you've named a couple of communities that I know employees that work there and are so pleased the way you negotiated fairly with their negotiating teams in different communities and their outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1533.729s">And</a>  that's what's so frustrating with this community <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1536.883s">Again,</a>  it just, it brings a fear to my heart that if she's only offering 2%, how bad are we looking financially? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1548.013s">No</a>  one's telling us, no one Mr. Selk. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1551.176s">And</a>  I'm just afraid what's gonna come in a few months because this is a scary time and method. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1558.442s">And</a>  I think people need to stand up and wake up because <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1563.165s">When</a>  the dust settles, the people behind you are still gonna be the ones standing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1568.53s">They're</a>  still gonna be up at two in the morning plowing our streets to make sure our kids have a safe walk to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1573.654s">They're</a>  gonna be the ones, when your basement's flooding, the first ones in the basement dealing with that junk in your basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1580.7s">no</a>  question about it, and they need to be treated fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1583.742s">So</a>  for one Councilor, I'm going to stand beside you or in front of you to make sure that someone has to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1589.767s">So</a>  I appreciate what you're doing, and I appreciate everybody's hard work behind you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1595.131s">I'm</a>  sick to my stomach because I, you know, I'm, again, I hate to say it, but I work in a community that has hundreds of DPW workers that are making a lot of money, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1607.665s">The</a>  administration, they are looking at readjusting their pay scale for what their wage analysis looks like with cost of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1615.51s">So</a>  I can't imagine what our next negotiation looks like in my community that I work in, because it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1623.295s">They</a>  want to keep people happy and in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1625.636s">What</a>  we're doing here in Medford is scaring people off. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1628.326s">and</a>  no one's going to want to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1629.607s">And</a>  that scares me.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1631.029s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1632.13s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1633.492s">I</a>  just wanted to point one thing out or clarify one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1636.395s">When</a>  you talk about us bargaining with the city officials, we really don't bargain directly with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1642.782s">We</a>  bargain with a K. P. Law attorney who deals with does all the <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1647.887s">grievance</a>  hearings negotiations meetings everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1651.191s">There</a>  is someone from the city that sits quietly at all the meetings, just by himself and observes but we negotiate directly with KP law, and I'm aware that you're the only community anywhere around here because we negotiate with many of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1665.707s">And</a>  some of them have three, four, five, six, seven solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1670.888s">And</a>  Medford currently has zero for anyone that didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1675.609s">And</a>  those postings have been on the website for a long time for an assistant solicitor and city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1684.192s">And</a>  obviously it goes just like anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1687.012s">The</a>  city's not paying enough to attract people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1690.673s">to</a>  come and work here?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1691.294s">To</a>  interject, and I don't want to be rude, but I sat at a fundraiser with eight former city solicitors, and I offered them all as a joke to please come work. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1700.261s">I'll</a>  try to get them whatever they want to come to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1702.983s">And</a>  the answer was, are you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1704.724s">We</a>  see what's going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1706.165s">It</a>  has nothing to do with what we're hearing, that it's the climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1710.849s">It's</a>  very difficult to get people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1713.251s">No,</a>  it's getting very difficult to get people that can work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1716.473s">That's</a>  what we're seeing firsthand.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1719.62s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1720.742s">Well,</a>  if the climate's bad at the schools, they just do studies for 50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1724.127s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1726.31s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1727.432s">So</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1729.735s">And</a>  once again, providing us with such a detailed outline as to the status of the negotiations for the <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1735.906s">200</a>  plus families that you represent here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1739.449s">Um,</a>  recently it was brought to my attention that there's a certain issue with new hires and their ability to access health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1745.293s">Um,</a>  you know, it's, I have a little bit of a background in the union as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1747.855s">And</a>  it's my understanding that, uh, here in the city of Medford, the municipal employee is required to offer health insurance to their employees.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1754.14s">If</a>  they work what more than 22 hours a week, I believe, is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1756.982s">I</a>  believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1757.623s">And</a>  the city always have, uh, up until this year, last year, I should say back when the mayor was the city councilor,</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1765.017s">She</a>  used to have to fill out this affidavit and submit it to mayor Burke in order to get her group health insurance that she was receiving from the city when she was a city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1773.994s">and</a>  she had to file an affidavit that said I work 22 hours a week and that made her eligible for the health insurance that she received through the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1780.276s">So</a>  I was looking at this and I'm not understanding why exactly a new hire now in this community that would come in that's working 37 and a half hours a week wouldn't be afforded the same group health insurance benefits that every other employee here in the community is being offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1794.422s">Is</a>  there an understanding as to what's going on with the application of this benefit?</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1798.243s">There</a>  is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1799.144s">This</a>  is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1800.405s">And</a>  I know that a grievance was filed today by the Public Employees Committee, which is all the unions that negotiate with the city regarding health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1811.775s">That</a>  was filed today. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1812.615s">And</a>  I can forward that to all of you after this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1817.88s">We're</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1818.72s">The</a>  city's taking the position that a new hire that starts isn't eligible for health care till open enrollment, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1825.466s">the</a>  opposite of what this city has done for decades and the opposite of every other community in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1832.773s">My</a>  only guess, because no one will tell me, is the city no longer has a benefits coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1838.758s">They're</a>  trying to hire one. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1839.819s">And</a>  I assume that just like a lot of other functions within the city of Medford, the work just isn't getting done because there's no one in that position anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1850.208s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1850.669s">We</a>  can't get a straight answer.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1852.688s">haven't</a>  worked in insurance and haven't some experience in insurance it seems to me like the open enrollment period especially for employees in the GIC is usually what sometime around June or July is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1863.594s">About</a>  then, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1865.395s">So</a>  what what they're saying is that if an employee that started now in January wouldn't be able to access health insurance while being a city employee for up to 11 months</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1874.495s">That's</a>  my understanding, and prior to the city taking that position recently, in the city of Medford and every other community, starting as a new employee is a qualifying event to become eligible for healthcare. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1887.262s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1887.662s">Point</a>  of information, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1890.643s">The</a>  letter we got said that the administration told those people to buy their own insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1896.419s">in</a>  the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1897.039s">So</a>  I just want to be clear about that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1898.42s">It's</a>  not just, we're not going to give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1899.781s">They're</a>  saying, go buy some, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1901.641s">So</a>  yeah, it's ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1903.983s">They</a>  have to purchase insurance in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1906.284s">You</a>  have to be insured you get penalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1907.824s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1909.165s">It's</a>  just, I'm just, I just want to add that to the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1911.426s">It's</a>  not just, we're not going to give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1912.687s">It's</a>  go buy your own, even though you're entitled to a benefit.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1915.388s">And</a>  in the community I work in, I hired someone yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1919.21s">That</a>  person starts with health insurance the day they start, which is February 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1923.532s">So</a>  that is, that is completely false. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1926.659s">I</a>  deal with that every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1928.141s">To</a>  say that they have to wait for an open enrollment is false. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1931.105s">It's</a>  a disgrace.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1931.946s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Seltz. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1932.647s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1933.128s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1934.85s">You</a>  know, what I see, Mr. Seltz, to be honest with you, is a trend. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1937.794s">It's</a>  a pattern, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1939.179s">And</a>  I think it has less and less to do with good government here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1943.021s">It</a>  has less and less to do with doing what's right for the workers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1947.324s">And</a>  there's more to do with a vendetta, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1950.346s">Someone</a>  that's vindictive, someone that's upset because you're speaking out, someone that's upset because you're expressing the concerns that your membership has and doing your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1961.372s">And</a>  it might be putting some <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1963.579s">some</a>  rust on the can of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1965.64s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1965.94s">So</a>  the way I look at this is I see a lot of it is retaliatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1968.822s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1970.163s">I</a>  see no reason for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1972.324s">I</a>  don't understand why the cost of living adjustment for one group would be more so than the cost of living adjustment for another group when the cost of living is really a reflection on inflation and how far you can stretch it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1985.07s">And</a>  ultimately, we want to keep, you know, the rank and file employees in this community working. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1989.637s">They're</a>  a hard working group. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1990.718s">You</a>  know, I've had the opportunity to know many of these people for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1995.004s">And,</a>  you know, when <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1999.215s">You</a>  pick up the phone and you call, they always answer, they always deliver, they're always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2003.899s">And</a>  like Councilor Scarpelli said, your group prides itself on showing up for work every day and doing its job, regardless of what the climate is here on City Hall, regardless of what's going on between the administration and the union, they come to work every day and they do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2017.97s">And</a>  that should be reflected in this wage package as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2020.452s">I'm</a>  very grateful for the work that your employees do, that your members do, and that these employees do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2025.376s">I</a>  thank you again for coming up here and sharing with us your experience.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2028.625s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2030.486s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2045.197s">What's</a>  the financial hit the community is going to take when all these lawsuits settle and we finally settle all these contracts between back pay and raises? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2055.125s">Do</a>  we have a number, a guess of a number, what the city's gonna be on the hook for?</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2060.647s">I</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2061.687s">This</a>  is a private law firm, a wage and hour law firm that files these lawsuits on behalf of your employees, my members, but I can tell you that one of the lawsuits that the city just settled last summer was for $475,000, and there's five outstanding lawsuits right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2080.654s">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2081.574s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2081.994s">This</a>  board is supposed to approve all <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2084.055s">How</a>  come we never saw that here? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2089.943s">Who</a>  would tell us anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2092.146s">Thank</a>  you for telling us, we never knew about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2094.368s">But</a>  that's our job, and when there's a settlement, what's over $5,000, we're supposed to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2101.357s">Never</a>  saw an approval on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2103.28s">But</a>  you know, so that's really my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2105.582s">I</a>  don't know what the financial hit is. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2107.584s">Is</a>  there going to be this community next year going down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2109.927s">Eventually</a>  these contracts will settle. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2111.748s">But</a>  see, and again, we have no idea where the lawsuits are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2116.773s">But</a>  you know, as you mentioned, you know, people leaving the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2119.977s">But</a>  what they do is they leave, and then we hire you part time to work here for like <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2126.304s">So</a>  we're a full-time city with a bunch of part-time employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2129.528s">So</a>  our economic development director leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2133.594s">He's</a>  working here 10 hours a month now. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2135.156s">We</a>  hired him for 10 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2137.038s">The</a>  guy left. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2139.697s">The</a>  assessor left. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2140.597s">We</a>  have a part-time assessor here, and we borrow, and she works for Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2147.699s">So</a>  another part-time employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2149.539s">The</a>  person who just left the school, took a job in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2154.32s">They</a>  hired him to come back and do the budget, because they didn't have anybody to do the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2157.62s">So</a>  all we do is, people walk out the door, we hire them back part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2162.201s">We're</a>  a bunch of part-time employees here.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2167.631s">Don't</a>  forget the IT director and the assistant IT director who were both fired, we believe, illegally in this litigation.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2176.204s">I</a>  mean, when does this stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2179.328s">When</a>  does this revolving door stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2184.006s">Everybody</a>  I look at, they're all life, most of them are lifetime members of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2188.668s">We've</a>  never seen a revolving door like this ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2191.769s">I</a>  had a meeting before this, next door with somebody, and they asked me a legal question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2196.792s">I</a>  was embarrassed to say, I says, I can't answer because I don't have a lawyer to call to give me a legal answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2203.615s">And</a>  I was embarrassed to tell that to five constituents in the other room when they asked me a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2209.437s">So</a>  how do you think that makes me feel as an elected official when I can't answer a constituent's question and I don't even know where to go to get the answer to their questions because we have no lawyer and we have no access to an attorney, which is really a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2224.486s">But</a>  I would really like to know what the financial hit is going to be in this community when all these contracts settle and the guesstimate when all these lawsuits settle. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2236.647s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2237.187s">Thank</a>  you for the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2237.807s">And</a>  again, I think I see these guys working every day, and they don't miss a beat.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2243.749s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2245.49s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2246.67s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2247.33s">I'm</a>  going to try to be as brief as I can, but I think the quote that stood out to me that you said, Mr. South, is we can't get any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2256.213s">I</a>  think you said that directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2257.253s">I</a>  think all of us behind this rail feel exactly the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2262.575s">It's</a>  not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2264.044s">It's</a>  far worse for people not to be getting raises and benefits and pay and health care that affects their families and their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2270.467s">But</a>  we do share the fact that when we ask for information, we ask for anything, we don't get it either from this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2276.129s">Frustrated</a>  may even be a kind word. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2280.491s">I</a>  think there's days when I'm furious. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2283.332s">We</a>  aren't getting what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2285.013s">And</a>  I just want to put on the table here for you, and then I have a question at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2289.852s">There's</a>  12 items that have been sitting on our agenda table, some of them for over a year that we've been holding on because we don't get basic information on the budget there's another three items on our agenda that are asking for basic information on the budget and finances that we don't get. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2303.102s">The</a>  only reason there was an assistant city solicitor job posting is because we made it clear that we weren't going to pass a budget unless they created the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2310.307s">And</a>  we held multiple meetings to expose the budget issues last June and we haven't gotten any answers for nine months so I completely share your frustration and the frustration of every city employee that we don't have answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2324.012s">You</a>  know, city employees are the lifeblood of the city, they make it run. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2327.733s">And</a>  I completely agree with what Councilor Scarpelli said, the fact that everybody has been showing up every day and doing their job in the face of treatment that they may not have experienced in 10 or 20 years, or even two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2338.238s">I</a>  don't care if you're a brand new employee, you're coming to work and you know that you're not getting a raise, or you're brand new to the city and you're being told you're not getting healthcare and you're still coming and doing your job, it's deeply appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2349.102s">And</a>  it also shows why so many people are leaving <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2354.038s">from</a>  all the different positions that you mentioned before. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2356.339s">I</a>  just had a question on the healthcare piece that was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2361.18s">I</a>  know you didn't bring it up and it came up here, so no issues if you don't have the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2365.062s">Do</a>  you know if every new hire is being told they're not getting healthcare or is it selective?</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2370.854s">I</a>  can't answer for all the other unions, but I have heard from a couple other unions that have the same exact issue, but I'm not privy to the info for all of the unions, so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2383.087s">But</a>  it is affecting more than one union.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2385.85s">Yeah,</a>  and that's become very clear to me with the information that I've seen over the last few days, but I also just want to see <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2392.537s">and</a>  make sure that it's not selective, if you get what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2395.6s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2396.701s">I'm</a>  not sure I can answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2398.422s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2398.963s">Because</a>  that would, you know, just add insult to injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2401.645s">And</a>  then in terms of the bargaining sessions, hey, I'd be happy to take you up on your offer to attend one because I'd like to see what it's like. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2408.371s">But</a>  you just want to clarify, you said the only people who talk on the city's behalf are representatives of KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2413.936s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2414.857s">The</a>  city doesn't say a word in the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2418.778s">City</a>  officials, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2420.098s">Councilor</a>  Nett is a follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2421.138s">That's</a>  all right, ma'am.</p>

    <p>[John Wood]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2421.618s">Does</a>  the mayor show up at these negotiations?</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2423.619s">Never.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2423.999s">We've</a>  requested, because the KP law attorney states that all of the sessions he has certain authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2431.8s">And</a>  we said, who provides the authority? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2433.9s">He</a>  states the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2434.981s">And</a>  we've asked on numerous occasions that the mayor show up so that the person that makes the decisions is in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2441.942s">And</a>  they've declined.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2443.022s">And</a>  pursuant to a city charter, if I'm not mistaken, the mayor is the chief negotiator for the community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2449.068s">That's</a>  my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2450.369s">The</a>  mayor is the chief negotiator, so ultimately we have five bargaining units with unsettled contracts and the chief negotiator refusing to meet with these five unions and instead sending an underling. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2461.098s">It's</a>  paid for outside the scope of city employment.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2467.103s">Councilor</a>  Knight, we have eight bargaining units, five are in the city, three are on the school side, and my understanding is she's in charge there too, she's the head of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2478.036s">But</a>  yes, the mayor's never attended any of the sessions for any of the eight bargaining units, ever.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2484.945s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2485.946s">You're</a>  very welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2486.847s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2487.147s">And</a>  yeah, Mr. South, if you could just share, I appreciate you offered to share the information on the other contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2492.871s">If</a>  you could share that, and then if you have information on upcoming sessions, I'll try to find one that I could attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2497.555s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2498.536s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2499.376s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2501.478s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2502.559s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. South, for being here for tonight and for always keeping us updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2508.123s">You</a>  know, there's a lot that's astonishing in what you shared with us tonight and what you've shared with us over email in recent days. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2516.052s">It's</a>  hard to even remark on it, but I wanted to just thank the rank and file that you represent for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2521.953s">Thank</a>  you for your organizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2523.614s">Thank</a>  you for your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2527.015s">There's</a>  so much to really be astonished by, even though we've heard, I don't even, I'm running out of adjectives to use, you know, the scope of what's being offered to your bargaining units compared to what could be expected to be reasonable or fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2542.638s">Just</a>  one thing that's ringing in my head <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2545.295s">2%</a>  with concessions in a climate of six plus percent inflation, it puts me at a loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2554.122s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that the rank and file is not willing to accept such an offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2564.049s">I</a>  think that one of the exemplars of this, we're actually outsourcing or privatizing the folks who are negotiating with our collective bargaining units. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2572.835s">And</a>  if there's not a crystallizing example of this problem, if that's not it, I don't know what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2579.519s">It's</a>  a really frustrating time, I think, to be on the city council and have what rounds down to no power over the root causes of this, which is our inability to invest in our city employees the way that they deserve and the way that our city deserves, the way that our residents deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2596.248s">I</a>  think, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2601.102s">Obviously,</a>  this all comes down to will, comes down to the will to invest in our city the way that it serves, and that it comes down to the ability to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2610.108s">We're</a>  talking about the budget, but all of our realm of possibility here flows from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2614.451s">I</a>  think we passed this year's budget on June 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2618.133s">I</a>  think this probably goes for all my fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2619.955s">What</a>  date did we start worry about our next budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2622.076s">June</a>  29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2623.997s">It's</a>  a discouraging time to be in, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2628.977s">to</a>  be looking at what's going on right now and staring down the barrel of what we're ever going to be able to offer to the folks who make the city work and make the city run next year and the year after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2644.52s">When</a>  it comes down to what we're able to offer the city employees, it's not just the work that they do, it's investing in the people themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2652.861s">And</a>  I don't know how we're going to expect to maintain, let alone improve our city and the experience of our city if we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2659.126s">figuring</a>  out how to invest in the people that make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2662.568s">So</a>  I just wanted to share some of my disbelief over what we are hearing tonight, what we've been hearing, and thank you to all the city employees that are standing up for what you deserve.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2672.816s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2673.576s">And</a>  I just want to point out one other thing when you talk about the city contracting out legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2681.302s">And</a>  I would just mention that when we have <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2685.2s">somewhere</a>  about 40 or a little over 40 separate litigations and all separate arenas and jurisdictions and federal court and the labor board and the secretary of state and all these different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2698.137s">The</a>  only winner in that game of <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2703.692s">months</a>  and months and even years is KP Law getting paid every single day, every single meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2710.615s">In</a>  the last year, we've had numerous arbitrations, mediations with state mediators, negotiations with all of these different units and meetings and hearings in all different jurisdictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2725.161s">They're</a>  the only ones winning in <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2729.302s">in</a>  that scenario, and they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2732.303s">In</a>  all the other communities that we have any kind of labor relations meetings or negotiations, most of them use their in-house attorneys, including many of the communities I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2745.609s">So</a>  you hear the term, follow the money, you hear that a lot, follow the money and where does it lead you? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2753.413s">And</a>  the only winner in this community, when all of the families of, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2758.931s">Your</a>  employees and my members are hurting the winners and all of this is KP law, I just wanted to reiterate that because I know all of you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2767.438s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2768.238s">I'm</a>  going to go back to Councilor Tseng before that, and then Councilor Caravielloa I do just want to note that we have several items on our agenda and it's, we've been on this for about 15 minutes so I just want to know that this is for back and forth so I appreciate the information but just</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2781.821s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, respecting that I'll try to keep it brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2787.025s">I</a>  wanted to thank you for the information, you know, we always do that when you come, because we, as other Councilors have said, we don't get this information from the administration, oftentimes, when you come to us that's the first time we're hearing of it when you email us that's the first time we're hearing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2802.776s">And</a>  when you give us that information, it gives us at the very least a place to start to ask questions and to demand better from from the people across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2811.901s">So</a>  I really wanted to thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2814.723s">Obviously,</a>  what you've said is very concerning, not just for us on this side of the aisle, but all the residents at home watching as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2821.806s">And,</a>  you know, what we've been talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2824.98s">we've</a>  been talking about tonight, like health care, like, like, legal bills, you know, fiscal response to questions of fiscal responsibility, all of this is common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2835.066s">I</a>  think all of us sitting in the room here can can can agree that, you know, we shouldn't we shouldn't hire employees and not give them health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2844.211s">That's</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2845.652s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2847.14s">I</a>  also want to thank all the workers and the rank and file sitting behind the rail on the other side of the rail tonight for coming out I know you're taking time out of your evening to come to us, taking time out of time with family. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2863.032s">I</a>  wanted to acknowledge that and to thank you for coming as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2865.953s">It's</a>  really important for members of the community and for us to see you guys as well, and it really helps, you know, show us and show the people at home watching that, you know, we're not talking about an abstract group of people, we're talking about people <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2882.557s">If</a>  we can put faces to the people who actually are keeping our city running and, you know, when we talk about policies and makes recommendations and all of that behind the rail, you guys are the ones that have to go out and execute that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2896.18s">And</a>  the pressure on your job is just increasing and increasing every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2901.641s">And</a>  to have all of this on top of that, you know, that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2909.993s">We</a>  need to recognize that when we when we deal with each other I mean, even even between Councilors but at all levels in city government and government we have to treat each other like human beings, and we have to understand that you guys have families, you guys have homes to go, go back to people to feed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2930.786s">You</a>  know, we can talk all day about, you know, all these different concepts, but it's really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2936.849s">Or</a>  it's, it's really important to understand that you guys are human beings too. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2943.131s">I</a>  hope, I hope this tonight helps with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2945.972s">And</a>  I really wanted to thank you for your dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2949.394s">Despite</a>  the lack of morale, all the hard work that you guys are still putting into city work, that's really meaningful and I think shows your dedication to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2961.152s">I</a>  had a few more points written out, but I think I'll end it there because other Councilors have already pointed out a lot of our problems and a lot of the concerns that we have very eloquently. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2974.598s">So</a>  I'll leave it there, but I just want you guys to know that this council stands with you guys and understands what you've been saying tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2983.542s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2984.783s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2986.664s">Quick</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2987.444s">You</a>  mentioned a $465,000 settlement. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2992.667s">$475,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2992.927s">Was</a>  that a wage settlement for wages? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2995.828s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2996.508s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2997.429s">And</a>  what union was that with?</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2999.31s">That</a>  was the custodians. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3001.031s">Custodians,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3003.152s">I</a>  did report on that last, I believe, June. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3006.453s">I</a>  know we have a lot of different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3008.955s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3009.715s">And</a>  isn't it the law that we have to provide health insurance?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3014.395s">That's</a>  my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3015.656s">That</a>  is the law, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3016.796s">That's</a>  my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3018.677s">Just</a>  wanted to make sure that I wasn't wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3021.519s">I</a>  thought everyone, over a certain amount of police, they're required to provide health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3027.122s">So</a>  we are in violation of the law by not providing these other people with health insurance.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3030.944s">That's</a>  my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3032.085s">If</a>  you work a certain amount of hours, you have to be provided, correct?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3035.727s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3036.807s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3075.801s">So</a>  I'm working with vice chair Graham on that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3077.683s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3077.963s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Gerard]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3090.575s">Yes,</a>  I'm pretty horrified about the treatment of the workers in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3098.497s">Yes,</a>  my name is Susan Gerard. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3100.078s">I</a>  live on Farragut Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3102.818s">I've</a>  lived in Medford for 42 years, and I've also been a union organizer and stood on many picket lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3111.761s">I'm</a>  really pretty horrified at what's going on with your unions and how they're being treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3117.842s">I</a>  have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3119.383s">One</a>  is, what can residents do to support you, whether it be a rally, picket line, or whatever? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3127.144s">And</a>  number two, people have talked about how dedicated you are, and I know you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3133.546s">And</a>  the same question came up for us as teachers and the teachers union, which I was part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3141.008s">We</a>  never want to go on strike because we do not want to hurt our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3145.789s">However,</a>  sometimes when push comes to shove and things are terrible enough, people do go on strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3151.452s">And</a>  there's a teacher's union on strike right now, as you know, because of the low pay of some of the workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3156.395s">So</a>  my question is, A, what can we as residents of Medford do to support you? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3163.219s">And</a>  B, are you considering strike?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3167.361s">Through</a>  the chair, I know.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3262.943s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3264.464s">Michael</a>  Callahan was a dear friend of mine, someone who <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3268.323s">represented</a>  the city of Medford and its people with great pride and dignity. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3272.744s">He</a>  was a Vietnam War veteran, the founder of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission and past commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3279.926s">He</a>  was the aide to the late Senator John Bullock, an aide to the late Senator Dennis McKenna, the former assistant commissioner of racing and chief steward for the National Association of Government Employees, just to name a few roles that he helped, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3296.77s">Michael</a>  Callahan was also <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3298.69s">elected</a>  our governor's Councilor, and he served with dignity representing the people of this community for over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3306.394s">Michael</a>  passed away on the last day of his term in office. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3310.096s">He</a>  was never able to <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3311.914s">reap</a>  the benefits of his pension reward. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3316.6s">But</a>  he was someone who has some fame here in the city of Medford for saving Wrights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3322.147s">And</a>  if you go up to Wrights Pond now, you will see a memorial honoring Michael Callahan that Mayor McGlynn put in to recognize the work that he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3330.958s">back</a>  in the late 80s when Medford was undergoing quite a development boom and the condos were being built around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3339.061s">There</a>  was a proposal to turn Wrights Pond into residential housing and Michael Callahan was the catalyst in organizing the neighborhood against this proposal and saving Wrights Pond and keeping it as the beautiful recreation destination that it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3354.167s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3356.576s">with</a>  his vision and foresight, Wrights Pond is now probably one of the city's number one assets. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3361.76s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd like to take a moment to honor my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3365.102s">This</a>  is something that I've put on every year since Michael's passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3368.825s">He's</a>  someone that really cared about the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3371.767s">We</a>  talk about having blue and white debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3373.508s">We</a>  talk about people that step up to the plate and really put their money where their mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3378.412s">And</a>  Mike Callahan was that guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3380.307s">When</a>  he ran for State Senate back in 2005, his logo was, he helps people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3385.291s">And</a>  there was no more truthful saying than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3389.214s">My</a>  county, I woke up every day to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3391.236s">And</a>  he took great pride in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3393.478s">And</a>  he always said to me, you could measure your wealth in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3397.221s">You</a>  could measure it monetarily, or you could measure your wealth in the number of lives that you touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3401.665s">And</a>  Michael is just a great individual who touched many lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3404.427s">And</a>  he was the wealthiest man.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3581.701s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3583.997s">When</a>  I first got out of college, I had the opportunity to work underneath Senate President Thomas Birmingham in the Massachusetts State Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3591.303s">And</a>  he was certainly a brilliant man, a great leader, former candidate for governor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3596.868s">And</a>  I had a great opportunity to work on his gubernatorial campaign where I got to spend a significant amount of time with him and I learned about what a great person he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3606.778s">raised</a>  in the community of Chelsea, representing Revere Charlestown and Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3611.503s">Thomas</a>  Birmingham was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate after defeating, I believe, Reggie Volk. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3616.829s">And</a>  he served in the State Senate admirably, rising to the rank of Senate President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3621.915s">Most</a>  notably, he is remembered for the Education Reform Act of 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3626.5s">And</a>  the Educational Reform Act of 1992 established the standardized testing, standardized measurements of public schools so that we'd be able to identify and compare apples to apples data between school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3637.809s">It</a>  also enacted what's known as the School Building Assistance Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3641.753s">And</a>  the School Building Assistance Program was something that we here in the city of Metric were able to utilize 23 years ago for the construction of other schools in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3649.839s">So</a>  when you talk about Thomas Birmingham, you talk about a gentleman who was surrounded by great help <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3654.953s">And</a>  when you talk about some of the great help that he was surrounded by, you have to mention on real world. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3660.004s">Who</a>  serves here on our community development board, we have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3664.531s">I'm</a>  sorry, CBA now, yes, yes, multiple hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3667.972s">We</a>  talk about James Francis Xavier Walsh from High Street who worked under the Birmingham campaign and worked under Tom in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3677.555s">He</a>  was a great mentor and cultivator of great talent and a great individual that really cared about his community in this state and he accomplished a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3686.137s">It</a>  would be sad to miss, so I ask my council colleagues to join me in honoring him and extending deepest condolences to Selma and the family.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4064.894s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4066.336s">So</a>  I think the representatives BJ's and of course our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4070.862s">I</a>  think that I received multiple phone calls and and the understanding of the process and where we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4078.012s">Um,</a>  it's it's a pleasant, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4082.465s">pleasant</a>  response by the BJS team and what was asked for to really support those neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4089.087s">I</a>  think that was probably the biggest sticking point of what was in the past I know that it was called the flagship store but it sure wasn't shown that way by our neighbors and the <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4105.286s">the</a>  concessions and the understanding of the commitment from BJ's and what really is being put back into our community into the plant to make it look <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4115.077s">very</a>  appealing and a welcoming site. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4119.139s">Everything</a>  that we asked for in the council, I think that we found a way to capture that, but I know that there were a couple of questions that I know usually Councilor Knight, since we don't have legal representation here, that anything that's permitted stays with the permit, Councilor Knight, is that with the permitting? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4139.16s">Okay,</a>  so that was one of the questions I was asked, that if BJs happen to, we don't see it happening, although they'll close, but one of the questions, what happens to that site if BJs does step away? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4155.334s">What</a>  happens to the tanks in the ground, to the environment? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4160.679s">Does</a>  this permit go with the permittee or does it go with the land? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4168.105s">That's</a>  one of the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4169.266s">And</a>  then the other question that came up and it was just passed over a few weeks ago was that back gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4178.894s">the</a>  gate on the Felsway side. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4181.136s">I</a>  know that there was some talk saying that back there was arrangements that that was closed at the end of the evening to stop any traffic coming in from Felsway as people use it as a cut through to come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4191.704s">So</a>  and as I recall, that was one of my jobs as a former employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4198.309s">Yeah,</a>  that I had to that's when the end of the night if you bring the carts in at the end of the night, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4203.293s">the</a>  last person would have to go, whoever worked the tire shop, would go and just lock the gate and the first person the next morning would open the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4211.119s">So</a>  I don't know if that's something that is, no one seems to know if it's true or the intent of it, but I know the residents had a question that it really made, whether we see it or not, they saw a big difference, not having that access after hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4226.212s">I</a>  know that I explained to them that when the delivery trucks come in, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4230.855s">And</a>  then they responded back by saying but George that question is that there are going to be delivery trucks idling in the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4237.818s">So</a>  that shouldn't be an issue so that might be something that just just to look at I know that we've already asked a lot and you've really come back with a lot of great responses and. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4247.382s">And</a>  I also had to explain to the residents our situation on the council and why this went to court and why it came back and really give BJs a lot of credit for opening that line of communication again so we can really get the true context back to BJs to say this is what our community really needs to make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4272.109s">You</a>  know, and again, the last piece was, I'm sorry for being winded, but these are the phone calls I got, was that the idea of the trees on Woodruff, if they die, and PJ's really put in a statement that says if it's anything to do with snow, they'll replace those ones that have died as they move through, but the other piece is, it is up to the city, and this is, you saw our DPW workers here tonight, and it's gonna be tough for them to do, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4302.234s">they're</a>  gonna be the ones maintaining that area after BJ has planted and implemented that look. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4310.641s">And</a>  I know that we explained the fencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4313.383s">We</a>  talked about the fencing people asked for and the new slats that are going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4317.046s">So</a>  I know we're gonna see a major change, but what I like and I appreciate is that there is someone identified at BJ's that's going to be working directly for the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4326.374s">So</a>  if I get a phone call from someone on 4th Street and they say, George, this is what's happening, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4331.538s">I</a>  can directly call to the whether it's the code enforcement officer called directly to the maintenance facilities person to be jays and they can get that response to that resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4340.361s">So</a>  we can get that taken care of something that we haven't seen in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4343.883s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4345.103s">So</a>  again, it's really those three things matter, President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4347.224s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4347.944s">Thank</a>  you, Constable. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4348.704s">Before</a>  I get to attorney off with that question, I do just want to note that the attorney with our thoughts shift did send us another letter during that public comment period representing <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4356.17s">that</a>  group of Medford and Wellington area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4358.431s">I</a>  just I do want to note that I was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4361.052s">So</a>  your first question, Attorney Austin, can you speak to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4363.894s">Would</a>  the permit go with the business or the site as is written currently?</p>

    <p>[Austin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4369.767s">Good</a>  evening, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4371.048s">Thank</a>  you to members of the council for having me here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4374.931s">In</a>  my opinion, Chapter 148, Section 13 does allow that if the license is granted and the property is no longer used for such purposes, then the use shall cease. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4388.162s">So</a>  that's set forth in the specific statutory language, which is Chapter 148, Section 13.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4395.258s">So</a>  a new permit would be needed somewhere else to come into that?</p>

    <p>[Austin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4398.819s">I</a>  mean, it would depend on the nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4400.159s">A</a>  new permit would be needed depends on the nature of the use. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4403.42s">If</a>  the use is abandoned, then essentially it would require the property to be ceased being used for a gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4412.643s">And</a>  if there's a new individual or entity that comes in, then that would have to be transferred over to the new entity, in my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4424.072s">By</a>  way of history, normally what the consul would do is we'd put a restriction on the special permit or a condition on the special permit that would say that the special permit is attached to the business entity and not the address on the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4435.715s">So</a>  that if that business entity moved on, the permit would move on with the business entity and die. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4441.996s">It</a>  would have to go back through the application process again.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4449.516s">Is</a>  that?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4450.236s">That's</a>  just explain what I think Councilor Scarpelli was getting at history. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4454.957s">That's</a>  the way we've normally done it.</p>

    <p>[Austin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4456.237s">Well,</a>  Madam President, just just a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4461.738s">There</a>  certainly can be conditions in my opinion that the council puts on this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4466.779s">This</a>  is a slightly different permit as it's specifically designated under that fuel storage license statute chapter 148 section 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4476.181s">So</a>  I just want to be clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4478.838s">As</a>  you know, other city boards and commissions have already reviewed the other provisions of the BJ's application and certainly BJ's council can speak specifically to any requirements that may exist in those approvals that previously had been granted.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4496.307s">But</a>  the concert night again, if BJ's would leave in a hundred years, they have to go through the same process, like as we're implementing this process as a restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4505.574s">The</a>  last piece is, what is the traditional situation when it comes to gas tanks removal? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4511.459s">If</a>  say BJ's would leave in a hundred years, who for environmental purposes, that was the question I got from someone, are the tanks left abandoned and what harm that would do or <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4523.556s">Is</a>  that something we could implement that if at any time BJ's does close their doors and abandon that site that the tanks have to be taken up? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4534.541s">So</a>  that was the question.</p>

    <p>[Austin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4538.163s">Through</a>  you Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4540.764s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4542.465s">The</a>  holder of the license under chapter 140 section 13 has to within three weeks after they cease using the property for such purposes, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4553.362s">has</a>  to eliminate all hazardous conditions using incident to such cessation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4559.687s">So</a>  essentially, there is a process set forth in the statute, given that it involves environmental considerations and other public safety considerations specifically requiring removal, in my opinion, within three weeks after the cessation is eliminated, along with any other applicable legal requirements that may be set forth by DEP, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4583.212s">So</a>  that is specifically set forth in the statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4585.773s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4587.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4587.974s">That</a>  answers most of the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4589.894s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4591.755s">Do</a>  you have a question about the gate, they have a gate if you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4594.396s">I</a>  mean you can get back to us and just I think that was one of those are the three questions that I did get phone calls from neighbors that, and I explained, shared your information so I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4606.113s">you</a>  know, the gate for some reason, especially for the older ones that remember when it first opened, that that was part of the negotiations they sat with and keeping that open. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4615.179s">But</a>  after business hours, they would close that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4617.621s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4618.482s">Thank</a>  you for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4619.322s">We're</a>  doing our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4620.363s">I'm</a>  sorry, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4622.865s">I'm</a>  the director of real estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4623.945s">Thank</a>  you for your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4625.576s">we're</a>  doing our best to keep our facility away from the front side of the site and the residential side of the site, not having that back gate open. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4633.002s">I</a>  wasn't a part of that discussion back whenever it was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4636.464s">That's</a>  my opinion, critical to keeping the service side on the service side and the residential side on the residential side. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4642.289s">It</a>  would be if we closed it off, we'd have to bring trucks into the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4645.511s">And</a>  then that's just more, I think, disruption in my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4648.814s">And</a>  that was the question they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4651.099s">And</a>  that's what I told them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4651.959s">I</a>  shared that with them about the trucks coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4653.78s">I</a>  also shared that you've already hired a towing company, a contract with a towing company, that any truck that's not supposed to be there is being towed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4662.982s">So</a>  we also appreciate the sweeping trucks after 11 o'clock, that that's been in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4669.544s">I</a>  know that was a point of contention in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4671.405s">So</a>  we see a lot of movement, but again, I think that's just clarification on the gate, was that if that's the question, if that's the concern, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4679.847s">at</a>  the end of the night keeping the trucks away. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4682.948s">The</a>  question there was, well, George, why is that a problem if it's after hours and the trucks out there coming in anyway? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4690.77s">So</a>  that kind of makes sense in the sense if they can't, if there are no trucks coming there, why not close that for, and what they're seeing is the vehicular traffic that's coming down there and causing the speeding or using the cutthroat to get to Wendy's or <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4707.349s">You</a>  know, so that's their concern that in the middle of the night, those houses that have bought the drive on the side, that's where the hair and the, you know, the engines. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4715.601s">You</a>  know, so that's, and I think that a lot, it's going to help with those months with the race, the speed bumps that we're putting in for those months. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4725.406s">I</a>  think that's going to help a lot because I know we hope there's not going to be much speeding in the winter months. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4730.988s">So,</a>  but if people want to be racing their cars usually during the spring and the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4736.771s">And</a>  we understand, but I think that's what clarification with the residents and I appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4742.894s">Thank</a>  you for the attorney of KP Law for answering those, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4746.455s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4747.796s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4748.536s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarapelli for answering, asking so many questions I was going to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4753.138s">I</a>  just had one question on the landscaping condition, specifically as relates to the offering to replace landscaping if it dies of natural causes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4765.823s">I</a>  think that's number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4770.296s">It</a>  says, not because of snowplow or other inflicted harm caused by the cities or other third parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4775.578s">And</a>  I just want to kind of determine what that means so we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4782.842s">When</a>  I see by snowplow, are you saying that if snow or ice is put on that landscaping and it causes it to have damage, that would not be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4792.706s">Or</a>  are you saying that if it's hit with a snowplow, that's what would not be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4799.678s">Your</a>  mic is also off, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4801.378s">I</a>  don't know if you could get the little person talking.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4804.579s">Yeah,</a>  I'm sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4806.4s">I'm</a>  not a landscape architect, but just common sense would dictate to me that if the city were to unfortunately plow snow on top of the nice plants that we just planted on there, a foot or two or three of snow, that those plants will die or may die. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4821.283s">And</a>  if that's the case, that doesn't really seem fair to me to have that happen over and over and over again with a provision <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4829.922s">and</a>  a stipulation of approval that we would just replace it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4833.565s">So</a>  I think it's a situation, sir, of wanting to encourage good behavior on everyone's part. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4838.25s">And</a>  that's how I look at it in plain English.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4842.313s">And</a>  if I just may say, and I'm happy to, Councilor has a follow up, I'm happy to defer to him in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4849.78s">We</a>  contract out snow plowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4851.822s">So</a>  it's not the same person who does <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4854.231s">that</a>  street every snowstorm, nevermind every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4858.052s">We</a>  may need some mulligans in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4859.772s">We</a>  may need a mulligan in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4862.273s">I'm</a>  just saying, you know, this is basically a one and done. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4864.834s">And</a>  I'm not saying every year we'd make the same mistake and you keep replacing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4868.014s">I</a>  don't think that's fair to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4869.255s">I</a>  completely understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4870.895s">But,</a>  you know, there may just be a little more communication needed there because someone could make a mistake at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4878.897s">And</a>  I just want to kind of maybe, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4882.878s">I</a>  count for that in some way, but I'll defer to Councilor Knight's follow up.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4890.779s">Sorry,</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4892.52s">This</a>  is on Woodruff. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4894.54s">Just</a>  to answer your question as the drafter of this, when I drafted it, what I was envisioning was if a third party or a city truck were to knock over a bunch of trees, and it happens repetitively, there comes a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4912.842s">Trees</a>  are gonna get planted. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4914.183s">If</a>  they die, we're gonna replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4916.526s">We</a>  just didn't want to, as Commissioner Travers said, encourage bad behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4921.37s">By</a>  the way, I didn't say my name, Attorney Dennis McKenna. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4924.874s">But</a>  that was the intent, just not to encourage repetitive behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4932.221s">We're</a>  not suggesting that anyone's gonna do anything on purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4935.573s">And</a>  the goal here is a beautiful screen that's going to be there, hopefully in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4940.695s">That's</a>  the plan.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4941.415s">Could</a>  we insert the word repeatedly in there somewhere just so that it's clear that it's not just a, you know, and I'm not trying to, you know, you could, no offense, but maybe the parties are completely different when this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4951.299s">And</a>  no one has an understanding of this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4953.46s">I</a>  just want to make sure our intent is met.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4955.721s">you've</a>  extended the arm of trust, and I think we'll do the same with you on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4959.823s">We've</a>  opened up the communication lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4961.344s">We</a>  provided you all with our regional business manager, who, again, I said, has budget authority to make decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4967.967s">I</a>  think we can trust you that you will not destroy our plants over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4973.789s">You'll</a>  trust us that if you make a mistake, that we will fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4978.051s">And</a>  if there's a plant or two that dies five years from now because someone happens to <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4982.361s">put</a>  some more snow on it than it should have, then we can fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4985.922s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4986.562s">And</a>  council, we have provided the conditions in electronic form to your council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4991.083s">So</a>  if that is some wording you can add it in there and we'll live by it with that understanding.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4997.724s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4998.124s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4998.264s">And</a>  that's what, you know, I'm not trying to box you into anything and I'm not saying you're trying to box us into anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5002.585s">I</a>  just want to make sure we have a shared clear intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5005.065s">I</a>  think reasonable minds can prevent. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5006.785s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5007.465s">And</a>  I do have those conditions in front of me if we want them read at any point. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5011.936s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5012.917s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5014.317s">Um,</a>  ultimately, I think it's safe to say right that this isn't a project that any of this behind the rail were crazy about from the start, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5022.262s">Um,</a>  that's why we went to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5024.243s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5025.223s">Um,</a>  our recourse is very limited legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5028.105s">You</a>  know, that's why the judge remanded the case back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5032.187s">Um,</a>  ultimately, what we're being asked to do is approve a storage tank, a flammable gas, flammable liquid storage tank, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5040.692s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5041.612s">It's</a>  a by right, it's a by right application. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5046.317s">It</a>  just requires a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5048.64s">Virtually</a>  every city board that had this application before we received it, signed off on it in one way, shape or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5058.592s">So</a>  our request was very limited from the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5063.053s">So</a>  when we look at this, the only body here in the community that said no was the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5069.055s">Every</a>  other body negotiated some sort of condition or restriction or compromise solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5077.258s">And</a>  the council dug its heels and it said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5079.499s">And</a>  we lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5081.296s">Okay,</a>  so now we're in the position where, although it's not necessarily a project that many of us were crazy about, it's the project that by right can be there and it's the project that by right we're going to get, in my opinion, after we take this vote this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5096.536s">I</a>  think that BJ's has come up and they've, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5099.842s">done</a>  a mea culpa on some of the bad neighbor issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5103.783s">They've</a>  certainly been very forthright in their willingness to add additional conditions and restrictions and requirements that we're looking for to make us a little bit happier with the proposed use and the impacts and effects that it's going to have on the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5121.829s">So</a>  with that being said, I think that the process has been a long and arduous one, and I'm glad that at the end of the day, we can come to some sort of agreement that protects both parties' interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5133.377s">So</a>  with that being said, Madam President, I support the paper this evening, and I hope we can move for a vote, for a favorable vote in short order.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5140.442s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5141.563s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5142.884s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5143.985s">If</a>  you could refresh my memory again on the, I think I asked you about the traffic patent. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5148.802s">for</a>  when they were gassing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5151.145s">Did</a>  you say that there'll be no traffic going out to Middlesex Avenue?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5155.37s">You'll</a>  have to refresh me on your question specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5162.258s">Not</a>  directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5163.179s">I</a>  think your question was on the queuing up.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5169.916s">The</a>  queuing up of gazeta.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5172.258s">It's</a>  all inside the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5174.78s">Not</a>  only inside the property, it's designed to be inside the gas station area. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5178.824s">The</a>  numbers that the engineer was talking about, I'll have him up again to give you the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5184.489s">They're</a>  all inside the area, not even on the site drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5188.252s">It's</a>  all designed to be held inside the gas station area.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5193.32s">So</a>  when the people turn into the property from Middlesex Avenue, they'll go down and then turn into the gas tank?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5200.388s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5217.497s">For</a>  the record, Austin Turner with Bowler, to answer your question, it was 40 plus vehicles was our calculation on the queue, and they were entirely contained within the fueling facility itself, not queuing onto the exit driveway or the entering driveway, as the case may be, but self-contained in that fueling facility itself and not having any spillover into the driveway, left alone, so we weren't impeding operations to the rest of the facility.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5243.255s">And</a>  I think I had mentioned that, you know, I've gotten gas at the Estonian facility before. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5249.637s">And</a>  there's been times where the line goes right out onto the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5255.739s">Because,</a>  and I think part of the problem is, you know, some gas station on the left, some on the right, and people get angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5264.741s">And</a>  there's been, I saw little scuffles there because, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5268.905s">no</a>  one knows what side they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5270.907s">I</a>  would ask that if the queue gets too big, if the person that's in the little house there, if he can come out and help guide the cars into where there's an open spot, it would be a great help because a lot of times that's why the cars queue up so big is because <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5289.958s">they</a>  don't know what side to go on.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5292.48s">Sure,</a>  it's an excellent point in consideration of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5295.463s">One</a>  that's part of the reason why the attendant in that kiosk is there is to help facilitate traffic.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5299.326s">Because</a>  when I get gas to store them, they don't do it there, and they should be doing it there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5305.371s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5306.331s">One</a>  last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5307.753s">We</a>  talked about the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5309.154s">Are</a>  we buying mature trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5311.606s">The</a>  trees that are planted, are they going to be mature trees though? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5313.767s">Are</a>  they going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5314.387s">Yeah,</a>  they'll still have some growth potential, but the intent is that they're not going to be.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5318.309s">They're</a>  not going to be little twiggy trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5320.03s">They're</a>  not going to be little twiggy trees, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5321.631s">They're</a>  going to be fairly substantial with some additional growth potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5324.893s">So</a>  they won't be fully mature height, but the trees that we've selected are aggressively growing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5330.495s">So,</a>  you know, some of those evergreen trees have the potential to grow multiple feet a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5335.498s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5337.159s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5338.82s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5340.327s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5342.249s">Thank</a>  you to all BJA's representatives for joining us again in the chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5348.133s">Just</a>  to pick up on the thread that Councilor Knight was speaking to, for the benefit of residents that are observing this process, ultimately this is a permit that is allowed by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5359.703s">I</a>  wasn't on the council when this process began. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5361.905s">I</a>  think it's, as it's been stated, it's no secret that this was a project that not everybody on this council was convinced was needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5368.89s">here</a>  in Medford but it's a by right project. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5370.932s">I'm</a>  really grateful for this process that's allowed us to get clarity on hearing from residents, knowing exactly what neighbors want to see from this space in order to, you know, see that reciprocal relationship more fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5384.45s">You</a>  know, through this process, I think we've been able to arrive at a package of conditions that can address specific things that the abutting neighbors need to see to get to specific outcomes that will help us be as as neighborly as possible as possible when this gas station goes into operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5403.41s">You</a>  know, and really attach that as a condition to the permit, not a handshake deal something that we can continue, make sure is followed up on and make sure that this relationship is as good as possible for the people that will affect most directly, the butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5418.9s">your</a>  willingness to engage in this process and really deeply appreciate all of the constituents that reached out to us during this process on both sides of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5429.669s">And</a>  I think what's before us is kind of a best case scenario for this going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5434.173s">So</a>  I'll be supporting this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5435.894s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5437.48s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5438.321s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5439.241s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5440.722s">I</a>  promise, President, I'll keep it brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5443.584s">I</a>  just wanted to reiterate some points from last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5446.766s">You</a>  know, I think, as Councilor Knight said, this isn't necessarily the ideal outcome for all councilors and <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5454.731s">We've</a>  throughout the whole process have had our fair share of concerns about this but we really appreciate all the work that you guys have put into it, all the work that we are lawyers put into it to create a deal that, as Councilors are probably really highlighted I think has some benefits to our, to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5474.72s">And</a>  I hope that this is the start of a. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5477.821s">I</a>  just wanted to make those points and to thank you guys for coming to these meetings and for negotiating good things</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5507.023s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5508.944s">I'd</a>  like to move to approve the license with the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5512.805s">One,</a>  that BJ's will implement an advanced maintenance program, which will consist of weekly parking lot sweeping and day porter service three days a week.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5519.248s">Can</a>  I stop you? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5519.788s">Are</a>  you reading the email?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5520.988s">I</a>  am.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5521.468s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5523.129s">These</a>  are the conditions that were presented after our last meeting, just to make it clear that President Bears isn't just announcing his own conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5529.131s">I</a>  mean, if you want to read them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5531.472s">I'd</a>  like a fact checker.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5535.875s">Do</a>  you want to read over? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5537.277s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5538.158s">So</a>  you want to motion to approve based on the conditions that were presented to us from Attorney Austin based on our previous meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5543.566s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5549.485s">I'm</a>  happy to do that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5550.846s">I'm</a>  willing to hold off.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5551.806s">Yes,</a>  so we'll hold off on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5552.986s">And</a>  just to be clear as well, we did have folks speaking at the last meeting in favor and opposed to this paper, but I do want to open it up once more for any additional comments from residents.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5563.31s">I</a>  have just one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5565.331s">When</a>  is this project going to start? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5566.432s">Do</a>  you have a start date? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5573.354s">And</a>  when is the landscaping going to start?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5587.433s">So</a>  there's anyone else would like to speak about the. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5590.736s">Position</a>  before us, please come up to the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5595.201s">Just</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5597.61s">Nate</a>  Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5601.331s">I</a>  love this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5602.552s">I'm</a>  a loyal BJ's customer in the fact that your gas is cheap, it works, it gets me to work back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5610.275s">I</a>  think we've already talked tonight about the conditions of the economy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5613.896s">6%</a>  inflation is not what it really is with gas compared to last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5618.358s">So</a>  as a parent, this is a great idea and it saves me a trip from going to Stoneham and back every time I wanna go fill up my gas tank, because you guys have the best prices in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5627.701s">I</a>  understand that there's concerns for the residents in the neighborhood and at the same time, I live right in the corner of Lucas street where there was a lot of development forced down our throats. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5638.023s">So</a>  the fact that you guys been able to help work out something that's mutually mutually beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5642.784s">It</a>  will actually benefit the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5646.145s">I</a>  applaud you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5647.345s">So</a>  thank you Councilors, because we need some more commercial business in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5652.059s">We</a>  really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5653.259s">Residential</a>  side is good, but anything we can do to help support commercial business and also people live in Malden, people live in surrounding communities, they will come to BJ's to go get gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5663.743s">They</a>  will help bring money into our economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5667.384s">So</a>  I fully support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5668.525s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5712.69s">Now,</a>  I've been coming, I've been living in Medford for 41 years, and I've seen trucks pop there at nighttime. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5722.937s">Used</a>  to be a fence there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5725.019s">But</a>  when the first owner was there, he used to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5728.381s">But</a>  then when there was another management came in, it just went out, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5734.866s">And</a>  then, I live right across from the transportation, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5738.809s">It's</a>  a transmission plant, okay?

<a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5801.816s">Who</a>  owns the property on Woodruff Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5805.178s">They</a>  say the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5807.519s">Okay,</a>  so I called DPW, there was dead trees, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5814.284s">Now,</a>  you're gonna laugh at this, I never could believe this, I hate to say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5819.807s">I</a>  called DPW, okay, we'll put you down. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5822.209s">I</a>  said, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5824.956s">One</a>  year goes by, two years go by, three years go by. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5830.338s">So</a>  then I said, I'm gonna call the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5835.081s">Call</a>  the mayor's office, secretary call. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5837.101s">I</a>  said, listen, this has been dead trees for three years now, and this is going on four years? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5844.185s">Never</a>  heard nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5846.966s">One</a>  year goes by, two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5848.086s">So</a>  that's five years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5851.407s">And</a>  I said, this is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5852.748s">I</a>  says, you know, I live on this street, I'm paying taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5857.03s">They</a>  passed a buck, BJ's passed a buck and the city of Medford passed a buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5860.811s">So</a>  now I found out who owns the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5864.193s">Then</a>  I'm thinking it's gotta be the city of Medford because I had the hydrant in front of my house and they put it across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5871.396s">So</a>  that's gotta be the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5874.478s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5876.148s">Now,</a>  every night I go by there, it's dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5880.471s">It's</a>  like cars parked, God knows what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5884.594s">But</a>  I call it police, nothing happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5889.057s">So</a>  I'm just hoping that you people keep the truth because I'm gonna be honest with you, even if you put the gas station, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5899.118s">where</a>  on towards Middlesex Avenue, you can have a lot of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5903.741s">I</a>  even asked them to put a light. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5905.723s">There's</a>  been accident on Middlesex Avenue because you got cars coming out of the car wash, you got car coming out of the gas station, mobile gas station, and then you got cars coming straight ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5917.552s">I</a>  mean, this is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5918.873s">I</a>  mean, there's gotta be, something's gotta happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5920.754s">I</a>  mean, there's been four accidents already on that street, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5926.54s">And</a>  then I even called the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5928.922s">There</a>  was an accident there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5930.204s">Oh,</a>  you got to call the state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5932.106s">That's</a>  not up the jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5934.808s">I</a>  says, yeah, there's a guy's hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5936.81s">I</a>  says, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5938.632s">But</a>  can't you call for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5940.094s">They</a>  finally did. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5942.096s">They</a>  called the state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5944.378s">And</a>  all of a sudden, the Medford police come. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5946.56s">And</a>  I said to the Medford police, why are you here? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5947.981s">I</a>  said, you told me that you don't have the jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5951.383s">So,</a>  BJ's on Middlesex Avenue is horrendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5955.425s">The</a>  traffic is, I don't know what I'm gonna tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5959.988s">I</a>  don't think it's gonna work, I'll be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5962.629s">Now,</a>  how, can I ask you a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5965.531s">When</a>  you go into Middlesex Avenue, the way it is right now, you take a left, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5972.395s">But</a>  if you come out on Malden, you take a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5976.737s">Now,</a>  if you're gonna put the gas station there, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5979.207s">where's</a>  the exit, where's the people gonna be going into the gas station? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5988.59s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5998.472s">Now,</a>  where's the gas station gonna be? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5999.913s">Is</a>  it gonna be towards to the right where that empty lot is, towards where the electric plant is? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6009.795s">or</a>  the windy side? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6011.376s">Okay,</a>  because I hope you're not going to put an opening on Woodruff Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6018.642s">Part</a>  of the conditions is actually to narrow the size of the opening to make it safer and to make street improvements, as well as to monitor the lot to make sure that there aren't trucks and people sitting in the lot at night, and to improve the tree maintenance along all of Woodruff Avenue.</p>

    <p>[John Wood]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6032.654s">Now,</a>  can I ask you a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6033.715s">Can</a>  they put lights on Middlesex Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6039.613s">That's</a>  what I've been hearing the same thing as state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6042.674s">I</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6058.177s">Because</a>  I live on Woodruff and I have to watch Tiki Island, gotta watch the gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6065.652s">and</a>  I got to watch people on VJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6070.554s">And</a>  I'm sitting there for 10 to 15 minutes and that's ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6075.755s">I</a>  mean, I don't know what to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6078.296s">I</a>  mean, to me, I really don't want the gas station because I'll tell you right, the reason why, because of electric plant. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6090.06s">I</a>  mean, things do happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6092.42s">Things</a>  do happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6093.501s">I</a>  mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6094.902s">And</a>  I'm glad you answered Matt because that one of the question I was going to ask you about what happens if BJ's closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6100.364s">What</a>  is going to happen in that in, but, but you answered my question so that's was one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6105.747s">Then</a>  my next question is the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6108.368s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6110.489s">Is</a>  the city of Medford got to take care of the trees like when they get tall and they hit the wires, do they take care of that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6150.682s">We</a>  have a direct line to BJ's that as a facilities person going to answer that question for us to take care of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6156.064s">So</a>  the other piece too, is this is something that we'll add as we move forward, but making sure the DPW saw them today, we don't have enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6163.847s">And</a>  they're going to be overseeing that land and that whole, that's going to be maintained by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6170.25s">And,</a>  you know, on the other side that, you know, that we follow through with the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6175.292s">I</a>  like to hear that we've already started a process with <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6178.533s">a</a>  contract that BJ's has with the tow truck company that anybody's in there idling and they don't move themselves, they're going to be hitched and they're going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6186.238s">So</a>  that's big, that's big.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6188.139s">And</a>  so there are several conditions that I can read through that address some of your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6193.062s">I</a>  obviously can't guess the questions you're going to ask next, but there are several conditions that I can read through and this is on top of traffic considerations and things that actually came to us <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6202.545s">before</a>  we start adding conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6204.045s">So</a>  I just want to note that.</p>

    <p>[John Wood]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6205.326s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6205.986s">No,</a>  because the reason why I'm saying trucks are not allowed to go on the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6210.947s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6211.227s">That's</a>  what we were told when BGA was being built. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6213.928s">So</a>  the trucks have to come on Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6216.889s">And</a>  if the trucks come on Middlesex Avenue, how are they going to make a left turn with the gas station there? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6223.471s">I</a>  mean, I just don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6224.891s">I</a>  mean, just, I still can't picture, I can picture where the gas station is going to go, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6232.581s">is</a>  the way it is right now it's, it's towards the entrance is towards like with electric plan is you understand what I'm saying, just saying it to the gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6244.045s">Yeah,</a>  I'm saying if the gas station is going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6246.867s">And</a>  the trucks have to make a U turn there is a truck going to be going into the gas station.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6251.608s">No,</a>  no, it's this that the parking lot is big enough that it's the truck had to make a U turn, because I know that, but the parking lots wide open.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6259.471s">I</a>  think</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6261.453s">Is</a>  it safe to say, sir, that based upon the amount of questions that you have relative to the project, that you'd be opposed to this project at this point in time?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6267.094s">Pardon</a>  me?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6268.434s">Based</a>  upon the amount of questions that you're asking this evening surrounding the project and how it's going to work, it seems like you're opposed to the project at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[John Wood]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6274.916s">Yes,</a>  because I've seen, I'm going to be honest with you, I've seen that they promised us, PJ has promised stuff when the first management, he was good, I liked him, but then a new one came and <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6291.138s">He</a>  said, well, that's not our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6292.538s">That's</a>  not our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6293.258s">I</a>  said, what do you mean it's not your problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6294.919s">So</a>  that's what I'm saying is, if this can be written, I hope they keep that promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6300.46s">I</a>  hope they don't say it's not our problem.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6302.68s">So</a>  the conditions- When you get some of the conditions, you'll understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6305.961s">There</a>  are conditions of the permit itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6307.841s">So</a>  if they do not meet these conditions, their permit will be revoked. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6311.542s">So</a>  it's not just- That's why there's more security. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6315.122s">It's</a>  not just a handshake. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6316.162s">These</a>  are conditions of the permit itself.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6317.823s">Yes,</a>  it's a legal agreement.</p>

    <p>[John Wood]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6319.903s">Okay,</a>  because Mr. Grant, he was the chairperson for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6325.169s">He</a>  was the lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6327.051s">And</a>  he was the one that- Gene Grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6329.073s">Huh,</a>  Mr. Grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6330.014s">Gene</a>  Grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6332.757s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6333.378s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6335.42s">And</a>  he was the lawyer for the city of Medford, and he's the one that told me a lot of stuff about BJ. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6343.063s">So</a>  I want to thank you very much for, you know, I just want to give you my point of view, what I've seen of BJ's because I lived there for 41 years and it's horrendous in Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6355.013s">I</a>  hate to say that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6355.734s">And</a>  I think that's really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6356.615s">And</a>  even just the, you know, people hiding stuff in the trees and the bushes over there, that's really helpful to know because we're not there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6362.119s">We</a>  don't know that.</p>

    <p>[John Wood]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6362.84s">Do</a>  you know, I call it the City Hall and I said, listen, somebody dumped a computer across the street from the electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6369.983s">You</a>  know what they said? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6370.903s">They</a>  laughed at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6371.923s">What</a>  do you want me to do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6373.984s">I</a>  said, what do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6375.045s">I'm</a>  asking you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6377.137s">Somebody</a>  dumped a computer, and there's a serial number. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6380.078s">Can't</a>  you look it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6381.199s">Oh,</a>  that's not our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6383.42s">And</a>  you know what I had to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6384.38s">I</a>  had to pay for that, to have that somebody who dumped the computer behind the electric plant. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6391.323s">That's</a>  not should be my problem, paying for somebody else's dumping. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6400.731s">At</a>  the time, I was being nice, so I did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6403.612s">But</a>  then when they start putting the junk in there, tires and refrigeration, I couldn't believe the stuff that the electric plant showed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6410.755s">And</a>  then they had to pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6413.136s">So</a>  I just want to give you that, my problem, and I've seen what I've been seeing on my street and Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6423.581s">So</a>  that's what I want to ask you, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6425.041s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6433.444s">evening.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6433.724s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Mario Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6435.105s">My</a>  name is Marius. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6436.105s">It's</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6437.326s">I'm</a>  30 forward to a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6438.787s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6441.328s">Uh,</a>  the country made a great presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6445.151s">Fantastic</a>  for all the details of everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6449.213s">But</a>  I went through this before 39 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6461.278s">And</a>  each of them have five gates, a straight type of gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6465.7s">We</a>  were promised 39 years ago they were going to upgrade that gate so the trucks would not be able to, the 64 trailers, they would not be able to pull in the parking lot without parking there for three, four hours at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6483.448s">and</a>  nothing was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6484.829s">The</a>  cable worked for approximately a week and a half to two weeks, and it hasn't worked since in 39 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6492.215s">They</a>  promised all the landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6495.177s">I</a>  think we had there maybe 12 or 13 or 14 frames. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6501.711s">So</a>  basically the point is, before we even get involved with this gas station, 64,000 gallon capacity, we should get DJs to be a little better neighbors to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6516.855s">At</a>  this point, you can't even park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6519.678s">You</a>  know, the promise is so well, they're going to put a stocking fence, this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6524.141s">We</a>  end up with a chair leg fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6526.583s">When</a>  the cars are parked right there, they got the headlights on. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6531.467s">You</a>  can't even watch TV across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6533.809s">You</a>  have to have the shades down. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6536.251s">So</a>  before we discussed, give a permit for a gas station, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6543.901s">We</a>  should talk about, excuse me, I just want to explain something.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6547.494s">Ultimately,</a>  the way this works is because of <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6550.237s">the</a>  zoning in the area where the gas station is going to be located. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6554.758s">They</a>  have the right to do this by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6556.558s">All</a>  they're doing is coming to us for a special permit so that we can put conditions on it to protect the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6562.06s">And</a>  I think we've accomplished that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6564.06s">But</a>  ultimately, we went to court on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6565.541s">We</a>  said we don't want the gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6566.801s">We</a>  lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6567.661s">That's</a>  why they sent it back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6569.301s">So</a>  now here we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6570.202s">What</a>  are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6570.862s">We're</a>  going to go and say, sorry, judge, we don't want to negotiate anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6575.043s">And</a>  then they send it back to the judge. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6576.483s">The</a>  judge says, OK, Medford, you lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6578.023s">And</a>  then all the restrictions go out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6580.624s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6581.044s">Because</a>  that's the alternative at this point.</p>

    <p>[Mario Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6583.045s">I</a>  understand that, but they have to come up with some kind of a permit to renew their license, whatever they have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6589.688s">So</a>  before we allow any more permits for BJs to keep in business, we should take care of a lot of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6598.272s">We</a>  have better neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6600.073s">There's</a>  a possibility they might have to put a six-foot barrier right across the whole Woodrow Fab. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6606.67s">to</a>  keep the headlights down, to keep the noise down. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6610.813s">Right</a>  now, it's a speedway with a construction type of security, a middle six, seven, you could even be remote controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6620.581s">I</a>  went up to the manager myself, in regard to this gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6624.944s">At</a>  nighttime, after the store closes, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6629.087s">It's</a>  like a speedway there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6630.408s">Everybody</a>  cuts across from behind that middle six avenue to the first way. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6635.451s">If</a>  they had a gate up there, that wouldn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6639.714s">You</a>  got trucks, 60-foot trailers, parking there for three, four hours from 11 o'clock on until the storm ends up to make their delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6652.163s">And</a>  that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6654.144s">That's</a>  absolutely asinine for the neighbors to hear the truck running. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6661.345s">So</a>  something should be done about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6663.286s">Even</a>  put a, some type of a security gate across, or pilasters, or pillows, steel pillows, whatever they have to do so that traffic, it doesn't go through the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6676.289s">And</a>  what do we end up with all the problems from B.J. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6679.59s">29</a>  years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6680.53s">We</a>  got a storage propane tank, a hundred feet from a residential house. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6686.132s">That's</a>  what the neighborhoods are. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6689.873s">And</a>  that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6694.108s">Home</a>  Depot carries propane. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6696.368s">You</a>  go down there, you bring your tank, they'll give you a tank. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6699.249s">So</a>  there's no necessity for them to have this 5,000 or 6,000 or 25,000 gallon capacity of propane tanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6708.071s">Now</a>  they want to put a 64,000 gallon gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6713.753s">I</a>  think this Congress should think about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6717.074s">DJ</a>  should be better neighbors before we approve anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6722.875s">That's</a>  what they're gonna have to do.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6726.057s">I</a>  think this brings us right back to the beginning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6729.338s">That's</a>  why we voted no the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6730.739s">That's</a>  why we got sued. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6732.359s">Because</a>  we said BJ should be better neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6734.16s">And</a>  that brought us to where we are today with all these conditions and restrictions that we have on the permit.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6738.882s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6742.964s">So,</a>  I mean, what we did was we did exactly what you're asking, what you asked us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6746.706s">We</a>  just did it a long time ago and we lost in court.</p>

    <p>[Mario Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6750.528s">I</a>  understood that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6754.787s">Okay,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Mario Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6760.59s">I'm</a>  awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6763.632s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6764.032s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Stephen Broadly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6775.279s">Stephen</a>  Broadly and I was here two weeks ago from Aaron Fox shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6779.441s">I</a>  only want to respond to one specific <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6784.421s">tone</a>  that I've heard, more specifically from you, Councilor Knight, and from others who are not interested really in this project, but somehow they have the feeling that because it went to court, you have to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6799.296s">That's</a>  not at all what happened in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6801.458s">Please</a>  don't speak for me, sir, because that's not what I think at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6804.761s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6806.383s">I</a>  want to speak for what happened in court because I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6810.632s">This</a>  matter was refused by this council in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6818.814s">BJs</a>  went to court and in the court proceeding, the judge made no ruling about whether anything was right or wrong about what this city council did. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6831.877s">What</a>  the judge did was to respond to an agreement between your assistant solicitor and the attorneys for BJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6839.993s">And</a>  he said, okay, you've agreed to take it back for another vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6845.474s">And</a>  the judge said, okay, take it back for another vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6848.375s">The</a>  judge did not express an opinion about whether anything was rational or irrational or right or wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6855.737s">You</a>  have a clean slate just because there is zoning that permits this project doesn't mean that you can't refuse it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6863.893s">because</a>  of your special permit powers. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6866.894s">And</a>  that's what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6868.235s">You're</a>  not short on recourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6870.095s">You</a>  can refuse something that even though it meets the zoning, if you don't like it for reasons that you can articulate, then you don't have to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6882.13s">I</a>  just want to clarify and make sure that the city council, in my view, understands that they have full powers under this special permit to refuse this if they really want to refuse it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6893.825s">It's</a>  not being forced down your throat by anything that the court did. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6898.852s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6899.453s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6900.892s">Anyone</a>  else who was just to that point, and I thank the gentleman for putting the words in my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6906.477s">But</a>  ultimately, why would I legal counsel agree to bring it back? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6910.741s">If</a>  we had such a strong case? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6912.763s">All</a>  right, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6915.865s">makes</a>  no sense to me, obviously, because we weren't negotiating from position of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6920.149s">And</a>  now we had the opportunity to negotiate a stronger agreement than we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6923.432s">We</a>  were going in.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6923.992s">Thank</a>  you, guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6925.734s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6925.974s">Any</a>  further thoughts would like to comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6930.27s">Before</a>  we get to the conditions, I do just want to reiterate my point from two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6935.254s">This</a>  is not something I want to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6936.655s">If</a>  it were my choice, we would not be approving any more fossil fuel infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6941.719s">It's</a>  not something we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6942.56s">It's</a>  not the way the future is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6944.301s">And</a>  I'm also, to the attorney's previous point last week, I do not believe BJ's is doing this out of the goodness of their heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6950.886s">I</a>  do not believe that, no offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6953.609s">And</a>  it is because that, that I do believe I have to go yes for this because we have set these conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6958.376s">that</a>  address the issues that the neighbors have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6960.657s">And</a>  I believe that if we are losing court, if we were to go back again, we're not going to get anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6965.119s">And</a>  we won't address any of those conditions because I don't believe this is a goodness of the heart issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6969.3s">This</a>  is a legal matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6970.24s">This</a>  is a agreement that we're trying to set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6972.761s">And</a>  that's why I'll be voting affirmatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6974.802s">I</a>  could vote no. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6976.163s">And</a>  my conscience says that to get the neighbors what they need, it has to be a yes vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6984.127s">going</a>  to the conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6985.608s">So</a>  we have a motion from Vice President Bears to approve with the conditions and the conditions are and these are from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6991.371s">These</a>  are in addition to the plans that came before the council, which have a number of traffic and safety changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6997.415s">So</a>  landscaping one BJ's will implement an advance in advanced maintenance program, which will consist of weekly parking lot sweeping <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7005.058s">and</a>  day porter service three days a week to remove any litter in BJ's parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7009.122s">BJ's</a>  will not conduct any such parking lot sweeping other than for an emergency reason between 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7014.347s">and</a>  6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7015.788s">Biannually,</a>  in the spring and fall, BJ's will conduct on-site landscape cleanups to remulch landscape areas and to remove leaves and to vacuum any solids present in the storm water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7025.757s">Three,</a>  BJ's will empty exterior dumpsters on an as-needed basis, but in no event, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7031.181s">less</a>  than once per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7032.521s">Four,</a>  BJs will ensure that all onsite trash receptacles be covered with a flap lid opening to prevent trash from leaving the dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7040.664s">Five,</a>  BJs will ensure that all existing landscaping and any new onsite landscaping added will be maintained such that any dead trees or shrubs will be removed and replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7051.048s">Six,</a>  BJs will plant additional landscaping improvements on its property consistent with the landscaping plans presented to the city council <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7058.775s">at</a>  the January 17th hearing adjacent to Woodruff Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7061.838s">Such</a>  planting will be done in the first phase of the gas station construction project. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7066.662s">Seven,</a>  BJA's will, subject to the approval and request of the city, remove and replace any of the dead trees with new trees and shrubs in the public right of way along Woodruff Avenue, consistent with the plans discussed at the January 17th hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7080.394s">The</a>  new landscaping will become city property upon planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7083.966s">If</a>  any such new landscaping dies of natural causes and not because of snowplow or other inflicted harm caused by the city or other third parties, BJs will replace each such landscaping for as long as the gas station is in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7097.479s">BJs</a>  will have no other duties in the right of way other than landscaping replacement if and when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7103.991s">8.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7104.631s">Annually,</a>  BJ's will provide the City of Medford with a written summary of maintenance activities to confirm that the conditions of its fuel storage license are satisfied to a representative of the city to be designated by the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7116.915s">BJ's</a>  representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7118.976s">BJ's</a>  will designate a corporate representative who shall be the regional maintenance manager or his or her designee and shall provide the BJ's representative's contact information, both email and telephone number, to the City of Medford to allow for communications between the city and or <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7133.511s">of</a>  its residents regarding any exterior maintenance concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7136.452s">The</a>  city will not publicize such contact information or place the contact information on the city's website, but the city may provide such information to residents or public officials who request such information. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7148.216s">Pedestrians</a>  and traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7150.257s">BJs</a>  will employ vehicular traffic patterns for the

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7786.075s">I'm</a>  also a taxpayer in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7787.776s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7788.297s">So</a>  I just found out that, you know, we've been getting a bill for approximately $220,000 because we couldn't turn the lights off with switches because <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7796.904s">good</a>  intentions for having centrally managed green buildings, but yet <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7804.36s">Information's</a>  fuzzy, there isn't a lot out there in the public domain. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7807.702s">Sounds</a>  like it might be because of a computer hacking or something, and therefore it's a centrally managed issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7812.923s">We</a>  had teachers literally trying to unscrew light bulbs, I guess, to try to turn the lights off because there weren't local light switches. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7819.405s">So</a>  if you adopt this in its current form, are you handcuffing people to build buildings like that where they don't necessarily have local control over their HVAC systems and or lighting, especially when you wanna have, even as, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7833.986s">as</a>  a backup, but also just because it makes sense, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7836.19s">Local</a>  control. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7836.951s">So</a>  if you can turn the lights off, if you want to, and not necessarily rely on the internet and a program because it's free.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7843.827s">Yeah,</a>  so a couple things on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7846.068s">First,</a>  this is just asking the office to draft the language that would be necessary to adopt it so there'd be a further discussion of whether or not it would be adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7853.252s">Secondly,</a>  my understanding and I'm neither a contractor nor working at the State Department of Environmental Affairs, but my understanding is it's kind of sets conditions but it doesn't require a specific system so it would actually be the designer of whatever the property is to, if they chose a system like that then they would be making that choice but it doesn't say you have to have <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7870.941s">XYZ</a>  system in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7873.585s">So,</a>  you know, and, you know, I know there's a lot of, for example, our library <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7879.477s">is</a>  a very green building and it does have local lights in there so yeah.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7884.62s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7885.721s">Like</a>  I said, good intentions right by all I'm sure that we're involved but at the same time, it's really embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7891.064s">And</a>  you've kind of shot yourself in the foot from the green objective when you've literally been just setting energy and money on fire, and yeah, the city can't afford it, quite honestly, to make that kind of mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7901.891s">So</a>  just making sure that</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7904.364s">I</a>  think it's important to point out this doesn't just apply to municipal buildings as well as private residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7909.247s">Right,</a>  this would be all just municipal construction, it's all new construction.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7914.551s">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7916.172s">As</a>  long as you're not handcuffing even private businesses that want to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7920.602s">build</a>  a building, right, that they all of a sudden have to adopt something that's remotely, you know, internet only control.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7925.984s">Yeah,</a>  I don't think there's any, it's more of a broader set of requirements around general principles of environmental, you know, climate goals.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7935.209s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7936.329s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7938.07s">Nathan,</a>  do you know who did the project in your hometown?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7941.128s">I</a>  don't, but you know.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7942.489s">Because</a>  chances are, if you did, they'd probably end up hiring him here at Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7946.372s">Actually,</a>  it may have been, I'm not positive.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7948.694s">I</a>  think it's actually a separate company for whatever's running the lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7950.916s">It's</a>  not the.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7951.677s">It</a>  was a subcontractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7952.658s">It</a>  was a subcontractor who built the building, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7955.58s">Bring</a>  it back when we have the new high school building committee, because we're not going to want to use them.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7961.385s">Totally</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7963.653s">But,</a>  and just as you're doing other, you know, projects in the city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7968.016s">Not</a>  just the high school, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7969.538s">Yes,</a>  yes, no, I'm with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7970.859s">When</a>  I find out, I'll let you all know, but as a taxpayer, yeah, we want some heads on pikes for that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7976.363s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7978.405s">On</a>  the motion, yes, figuratively. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7981.247s">On</a>  the motion, Vice President Bears is seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7984.993s">Councilor</a>  Collins, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7986.334s">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7987.594s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7988.355s">23-024</a>  offered by Vice President Fares. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7991.836s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Metro City Council that the City Administration inform residents about the MBTA policy change to allow two bus trips and one subway trip on a single fare. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8001.521s">The</a>  additional transfer will likely be required for some residents impacted by the MBTA bus redesign project. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8006.823s">be</a>  it further resolved that the MBTA more widely communicate that policy change to riders. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8010.767s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8012.149s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8012.909s">I</a>  just want to thank Anita Nagum for bringing this to my attention, which is that there was kind of a pretty major policy change by the MBTA over the summer that didn't get a lot of fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8023.34s">which</a>  is that if you have you pay a single fare, you can now transfer from one subway trip to two additional bus trips, it used to be just one and one. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8032.867s">So,</a>  you know, that's a pretty significant difference probably making a difference for a lot of folks who use the MBTA, but especially in the context of the bus redesign project and parts of the city that are now going to need to make additional transfers to get to where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8046.416s">You</a>  know, there may be folks who would have said in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8049.157s">Well,</a>  I'm just going to do another route because I don't want to pay two fares, and they actually maybe wouldn't have to do that it will be able to save that money, you know, especially builds up if you're doing it every single day as anyone knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8061.765s">I</a>  think we've had a lot of communication about the bus redesign project as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8065.628s">The</a>  MBTA has not done its job. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8067.109s">Residents</a>  have taken up that spirit and done the outreach themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8071.091s">But</a>  as actual routes start to change or stops start to change, I think it would be important for riders to know that this is an option for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8077.996s">And</a>  obviously, I also included to ask the MBTA to do that communication, but that is not quite as easy for us to ask for. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8085.1s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8086.501s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Bares. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8087.842s">Any</a>  discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8091.597s">just</a>  for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Anita Nagem]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8093.578s">I</a>  need an a gum nine Norton nails Medford Councilor bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8096.739s">Thank</a>  you for pronouncing my name correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8099.199s">Um,</a>  I just wanted to address this MBTA fair policy change. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8104.661s">It</a>  was apparently changed last July. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8106.341s">I</a>  found out by chance because I was attending the last public meeting about the best network redesign. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8113.103s">Um,</a>  no mention of it was made by the MBTA, but <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8116.723s">During</a>  the discussion, I pointed out that many Medford residents were now being told to take two buses and a subway, two buses to get to Davis Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8125.809s">And</a>  I pointed out that that would effectively double the cost of their trip in each direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8131.773s">Well,</a>  an MBTA representative responded and said, oh, we changed the fare policy last July. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8140.528s">That</a>  was news to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8141.489s">I</a>  ride the T regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8143.929s">My</a>  husband rides it every single day of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8146.75s">Neither</a>  of us knew anything about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8149.631s">There</a>  are no signs anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8152.292s">I</a>  looked on the website, it is posted there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8156.034s">But</a>  riders need to be informed of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8159.615s">I</a>  strongly suspect that they are waiting to announce this until the changes for the bus network redesign are implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8168.212s">so</a>  that they can say, oh, we're changing this and you're gonna have to take two buses now, but we're changing the fare. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8174.217s">The</a>  fare policy is in effect right now, the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8180.122s">And</a>  just a couple of other things regarding the bus network redesign. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8183.945s">The</a>  city of Medford pays a substantial sum to the MBTA, yet this new plan is going to cut bus service to West Medford and North Medford significantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8195.243s">The</a>  southeast edge of Medford is going to get much better service if you can get to this new high frequency route. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8201.628s">The</a>  rest of Medford is going to be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8205.651s">And</a>  the city of Medford should push back more against the MBTA's plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8211.315s">Right</a>  now, there will be no bus to the red line between the end of Boston Avenue at High Street and the rotary at Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8220.181s">That</a>  is a full mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8222.743s">When</a>  the MBTA designed this plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8225.483s">they</a>  decided that being half a mile from a bus route was acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8232.309s">I</a>  don't know if you've noticed, but there are posters around the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8235.952s">I've</a>  been posting signs to encourage people to continue submitting feedback because the MBTA plan did approve the plan, but told them to continue adjusting it based on feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8249.023s">Every</a>  person with whom I have spoken and explained this to says half a mile is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8255.338s">What</a>  if you are elderly? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8256.778s">What</a>  if you are disabled? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8258.579s">What</a>  if you have children? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8260.099s">What</a>  if you are carrying groceries or heavy packages? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8263.9s">And</a>  what if there is bad weather? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8267.001s">Half</a>  a mile is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8271.722s">My</a>  name was in the newspaper because of the petition that we did last summer presenting 2000 signatures opposing the bus network redesign. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8279.964s">People</a>  have been finding out about the bus network redesign <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8283.59s">looking</a>  up the article and calling me up and saying, what am I going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8288.231s">Several</a>  people on High Street have called me up saying, I'm elderly, I'm disabled, I can't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8293.753s">The</a>  MBTA's response at the last meeting was, well, if you can't walk down to the Rotary or High Street or Boston Avenue, you can take the 95 bus and then transfer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8306.436s">That's</a>  very nice in theory, but it adds probably at least, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8313.492s">Under</a>  optimal conditions, it would add probably half an hour onto your trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8317.574s">In</a>  worst case scenario, 45 minutes to an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8321.796s">That</a>  is an unfair burden to place on residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8325.477s">And</a>  the city of Medford really should push back more against this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8331.76s">One</a>  more last comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8334.342s">As</a>  I stated, the MBTA board of directors approved the plan, but told the MBTA to continue adjusting it based on feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8342.272s">The</a>  entire plan involves more, it involves things like electrification of buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8347.513s">So</a>  I started putting up an additional round of posters three weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8351.555s">I've</a>  been in touch with State Senator Gellin and her chief of staff encouraged me to continue urging others to submit feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8359.457s">Before</a>  I started putting those posters up, I checked the MBTA website, there was a bus network redesign feedback form. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8366.579s">Last</a>  weekend, I looked at the website, that feedback form had been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8371.829s">I</a>  do not think this is a coincidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8374.571s">The</a>  same thing happened last summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8376.953s">With</a>  my group, four other people, and myself, we had posters all over Medford, Somerville, and Davis Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8384.899s">They</a>  were getting a lot of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8386.721s">All</a>  the little tabs were being taken from the posters that I put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8390.624s">The</a>  last two weeks of the comment period, the MBTA removed the email address, which was the way to submit feedback, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8398.97s">which</a>  was one of the ways to submit feedback from the list of ways you could submit feedback on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8404.113s">There</a>  was an address, a mailing address, a phone number, and the email address. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8408.675s">Last</a>  two weeks, they eliminated the email address. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8415.219s">The</a>  MBTA, or the people who are designing this project, clearly do not want to be inconvenienced by comments from other residents, which will upset their plans, their grand plans for this bus network redesign. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8428.65s">And</a>  I would like to ask if the city council would consider contacting the MBTA and telling them to stop discouraging feedback, changing the way you can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8443.661s">It's</a>  artificially disturbing the chances that residents have to submit feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8453.508s">It</a>  really, really upsets me that they are doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8456.09s">And</a>  again, I do not think it's a coincidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8459.149s">Because</a>  of, I think we said this before, but because of the work that my group did, putting those flyers up with tabs all over, Medford and Somerville had the highest number of public comments of any towns in the MBTA system. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8473.16s">And</a>  the MBTA, I don't think was very happy with those comments because it forced a lot of changes to their overall plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8484.669s">That's</a>  all I have to say about that, but thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8488.82s">Fair</a>  policy is in place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8491.401s">It's</a>  not only a subway and two buses, you can take three buses on one fare as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8495.942s">But</a>  Medford residents should know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8497.843s">It</a>  could affect them right now, and they might as well take advantage of it if they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8503.885s">There's</a>  been enough issues with the MBTA service that if they had this knowledge, again, it could certainly affect their travel plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8512.107s">Anyway,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8513.288s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8515.413s">Thank</a>  you, Miss Needham, for coming to speak to us and for letting Vice President Bears know about the fair change. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8523.78s">I</a>  use the T in the buses almost every day and I didn't even notice it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8529.805s">I</a>  wanted to note that thanks to efforts from people like you, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8533.588s">And</a>  thanks to the work that our council's been doing to organize feedback as well and to send it to the state authorities, to the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8542.054s">Our</a>  state legislators have told me personally that Medford was the most organized municipality in the whole Commonwealth when it came to the bus network redesign plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8550.559s">And</a>  you mentioned that we did get a lot of bus service back, not enough, but we did get a lot of bus service back. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8557.023s">And</a>  it's no coincidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8560.553s">when</a>  you look at how organized we were. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8563.174s">I</a>  thank you for coming up to the podium to speak tonight because it reminds us that to send in more feedback and to keep in communication with MBTA and to keep organizing feedback as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8577.661s">It</a>  is upsetting to hear that the feedback form is now closed and that the link is not on the website anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8586.626s">I</a>  know I've had, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8590.58s">friends</a>  and neighbors use the MBTA complaint forms and last week it was down for a few days as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8597.864s">And</a>  so that's certainly something that we should contact our state reps about and try to create more political pressure on the MBTA to get that back up and fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8609.472s">This</a>  council knows how frustrating it is to work with the state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8613.794s">and</a>  with the MBTA in particular on these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8618.156s">For</a>  example, when the Orange Line shut down, our city government reached out to see what they needed from us when it came to traffic flows and traffic plans, and they didn't get any response from the MBTA when we reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8632.921s">You</a>  know, it's stuff like that that I think really damages the relationship between the MBTA and municipal governments in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8641.125s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8642.291s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you for your effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8645.912s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this up to us, and we will continue to do our best to stay the most organized municipality in Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Anita Nagem]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8653.974s">I</a>  just want to mention, the feedback form is closed, but now the only way to submit feedback is to email it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8661.716s">And</a>  going to that activated feedback form link does tell you that you have to submit comments via the email address. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8672.89s">But</a>  every step you take like that, I mean, every time people are forced to make that extra step, it decreases the number of people who are going to submit feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8682.395s">I</a>  had posters up all around. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8683.936s">I</a>  don't know if any of you've noticed them on pink poster board. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8686.877s">They</a>  have generated a huge response. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8690.399s">I</a>  had to go around last weekend and change all of them, updating them with the new information. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8697.143s">It</a>  was not, I'll just say it was a very time-consuming process. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8703.035s">Again,</a>  the MBTA gets a considerable amount of money from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8707.798s">And</a>  just regarding this overall bus network redesign, they want to have high frequency service on a small number of routes, but they don't have enough money to do it everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8716.562s">So</a>  to do that, they have to cut service in other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8719.524s">Again,</a>  the Southeast side of Medford is going to get the new high frequency 96. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8722.786s">Initially,</a>  that was just going to stay really on the South border of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8727.868s">And</a>  they claimed, oh, we're bringing high frequency service to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8731.075s">where</a>  90% of Medford would not have even been able to access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8735.676s">Because</a>  of the petition that we did, we got the 96 back to Winthrop Street, which will help a larger segment of Medford access the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8744.457s">But</a>  again, a lot of West Medford and North Medford are being left with very little service. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8751.019s">And</a>  generally, I mean, I'm in favor of high frequency service. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8755.279s">I</a>  think they should go for it, but there should be a baseline <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8760.48s">amount</a>  of service across the entire system before they start giving extra service to other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8766.041s">And</a>  that is the issue that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8770.263s">You</a>  shouldn't be leaving large sections of Medford with no access. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8776.224s">I</a>  can tell you, I've probably spoken with three or 400 people in the past three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8782.086s">Everybody</a>  is upset about this and still people do not know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8787.848s">When</a>  they announce that this is gonna start being implemented and these roots are gonna be cut, there is going to be chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8794.73s">I</a>  mean, people have actually given me their phone number and said, if you organize a protest, call me up, I will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8801.072s">I</a>  mean, I'm not at that point yet, but there may be spontaneous protests. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8808.855s">I</a>  just want you to be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8810.055s">And</a>  I really hope that the city of Medford keeps pushing back against the service that is being taken away from other people and given <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8817.846s">to</a>  basically the southeast corner of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8820.207s">As</a>  one person, she was from another town, but at one of the MBTA BNRD meetings said, some people are hitting the bus lottery and other people are being left with nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8831.529s">And</a>  that really is what it's like. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8832.91s">I</a>  mean, some people are going to be on these new high frequency routes that come every 15 minutes and other people will have no buses at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8841.432s">It</a>  needs to be distributed more equally before you start giving extra service to a small segment. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8848.227s">And</a>  thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8850.347s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8852.288s">I</a>  appreciate you for being your you're being so your nuance on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8857.029s">I</a>  mean, it's, it's, you're absolutely right that there are people in the city who will benefit from the plan, especially in South Medford and now metric hillside and I know they're bringing one express route back, which this council's been pushing for forever forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8871.501s">Well,</a>  you're right that, you know, the MBTA, I think oftentimes thinks of the subway extensions as a replacement for bus service, which it's not because they serve completely different goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8883.448s">And</a>  so I totally hear you on West Medford, North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8887.19s">They're</a>  clearly parts of the plan that are lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8890.592s">And</a>  so we'll keep pushing on those points as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8893.774s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8897.376s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8899.085s">Yeah,</a>  and thank you to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8902.148s">I</a>  think there should be further opportunities for us to address this as they ask us to change stops as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8907.893s">So</a>  there's still more steps in the process before they move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8911.876s">I</a>  just want to further amend this to also request that the MBTA maintain a consistent form of public comment and feedback so that they're not changing it up.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8924.577s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8926.679s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Bears, as amended by Vice President Bears, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8939.371s">Oh,</a>  your mic's off. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8942.073s">The</a>  little person.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8944.735s">You're</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8945.296s">OK,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8946.923s">Has</a>  anyone looked into if there's a gap in service, is there something the city can do, and perhaps maybe generate some revenue while helping out the citizens.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8954.586s">You</a>  have school buses.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8956.847s">No,</a>  no, no, I'm not saying compete with the MBTA but if the MBTA isn't going to move and you do have some infrastructure in place we have school buses we have drivers, perhaps there's an opportunity where the city can help the community and fill in the gap of the MBTA isn't going to cooperate.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8972.357s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8973.198s">It's</a>  probably not at the level that you're thinking of, but I do know PDS has been looking into it for the last few months and looking into grants that we could get from the state government to run kind of our own bus network or minivan network, something like that, that goes to different neighborhoods that are underserved, but they, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8992.522s">To</a>  be completely transparent, I think they think that it'll take a few years for us to get that grant in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8999.306s">But</a>  they are looking into it, and they're looking for ways to, I'm asking them for ways to expedite it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9003.949s">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9004.429s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9005.21s">Just</a>  point of information, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9007.771s">I</a>  also don't think it's a good idea for the city of Medford to start getting into the transportation business now. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9013.114s">We</a>  can't even forget shopping pencils in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9015.456s">We're</a>  gonna start freaking running buses all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9017.637s">I</a>  mean, let's be honest here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9019.298s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9019.798s">We</a>  got a parking department that we just opened up in a year, and it's been nothing but a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9022.92s">If</a>  we take over a transit department, who the hell knows what's gonna happen.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9025.481s">Yeah,</a>  but this could actually make money instead of the parking department which is losing money.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9028.703s">Given</a>  how much of the MBTA is publicly subsidized already, I doubt that it would be, you know, it's probably a loser on the profit and loss statement, but you can't always call Councilor Caraviello if you need a ride, so.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9044.373s">I</a>  didn't want to say it, but if there's other options for folks to use, even just information about what's available is probably helpful in the short term.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9055.025s">New</a>  address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9056.797s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9059.758s">My</a>  main thing was actually just to reply to that last comment, which I think was really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9063.358s">I</a>  think it's good when people are thinking outside the box and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9066.319s">That's</a>  not a way to make money, that's a way to spend money. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9069.14s">Because</a>  that's going to be expensive to run buses all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9072.74s">I</a>  think it's a really good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9074.601s">You'd</a>  have to start saying, what you'd have to do is you'd have to start talking to property owners, say, hey, this is going to increase your property value. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9082.682s">You're</a>  willing to raise taxes for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9084.303s">And</a>  they're going to have to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9088.024s">Yeah,</a>  Zach Councilor bears will approach them and this is Garpelli suggestion and hopefully they'll say yes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9097.907s">But</a>  that's what's gonna have to happen and I'd really be in support of that I'd be very excited to say you know if we want to improve, improve buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9106.331s">Here's</a>  that we can pay for that, and the city can take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9111.252s">I</a>  would just like to note that a lot of people have been saying yes to a lot of ideas and I believe in lately. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9133.728s">I</a>  would say yes to this idea, absolutely, to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9136.991s">And</a>  there's one more thing I was going to say, and that is that I do think that as we go through this idea of the high frequency transit, I think that one real benefit of that is that it's going to provide a lot of opportunities where people really can <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9155.406s">the</a>  practical level live in a lot more sections of Bedford without a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9158.727s">You</a>  know, we're gonna we could we could have more development going up without massive parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9166.77s">And</a>  that's going to help the housing crisis going to be up for businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9170.831s">It'll</a>  create under our tax scheme, it'll also create more tax revenue for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9175.333s">So</a>  as that happens, I hope the city will take advantage to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9179.795s">So</a>  to get so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9180.515s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9209.569s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, to be just if we can call these representatives from <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9215.973s">These</a>  fields, I think that there's some questions that were brought up tonight that we really need to get some clarification as city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9222.357s">And</a>  then the other piece is also the fleet, dealing with the fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9227.32s">I</a>  know that there's a few trucks down right now, and we do have a Boston City truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9231.963s">People</a>  have been asking me, why do we have a Boston City truck? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9234.584s">I've</a>  talked to a few firefighters and they explained, so there's reasons for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9238.307s">But</a>  it'd be nice if we get a report dealing with this with all the parties involved, meaning <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9245.571s">you</a>  know, city administration, the HR director and representative for the fight upon but that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9251.794s">So</a>  if I could call for that make a motion for next week, our next meeting to invite all those parties to be present the meeting, city regular city council meeting just to give us a brief update on what's going on to so we have an understanding but I don't see it happening but it's just a thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9269.221s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9299.438s">It's</a>  distracting and devastating working in the municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9303.059s">What</a>  was said tonight, that you have to wait for the open enrollment, not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9307.961s">I</a>  could tell you that working firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9311.422s">But</a>  I do want all the parties in place so we can dispel any rumors and move forward to try to help our firefighters who don't have insurance, and at the same time, also ask for the representatives of the fire department here to tell us what we need to know.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9328.753s">Thank</a>  you, so with those intentions, is the motion to table it until the next meeting and invite those folks? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9335.176s">Right,</a>  if we can.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9335.756s">That's</a>  what the whole idea is, to approve it and then.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9337.577s">Approve</a>  it, okay, and then have it, approve it and have it reappear on the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9341.138s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9342.479s">What</a>  would you like?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9343.079s">I</a>  thought that the council would consult with the council to make sure that it's on the agenda for the next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9363.32s">If</a>  we change the wording, say we would like them to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9367.683s">Yeah,</a>  so if we can't, just... Thanks.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9370.605s">Everyone</a>  understand that?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9371.305s">Thank</a>  you, sorry about that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9373.066s">Oh,</a>  Councilor Stickler, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Perez. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9380.911s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9381.752s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9382.092s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9382.912s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9383.893s">Councilor</a>  Stickler. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9385.854s">23-026</a>  offer... What? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9388.356s">No,</a>  he's a stickler. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9389.637s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9390.897s">Everyone,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9395.626s">23-026</a>  offered by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9398.248s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Metro City Council that the Elections Department and local U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9402.17s">Postal</a>  Service communicate with residents about when they can expect to receive their census forms given the recent mail delays. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9407.614s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Elections Manager and Elections Commission provide an update on the status of the 2022 Elections After Action Report requested by the City Council last fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9417.04s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9419.061s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9421.828s">It</a>  is season for city census forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9424.33s">If</a>  you don't fill out your census form, you'll be marked as an inactive voter, and you'll have to provide additional information to become an active voter again when you go to vote in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9433.518s">So,</a>  you know, I just want to make sure that given there's been a lot of mail disruption and delays in mail across the city, that, you know, A, that the forms are sent out and that, you know, they'll be accepted <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9445.208s">you</a>  know, potentially extending the deadline by which they'll be accepted or making clear to people that as long as they submit them before X date, they will be marked inactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9451.792s">I</a>  just think that really needs to be clarified because there are places, you know, folks have been reporting, it's spot reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9457.155s">My</a>  mail has been pretty good, but people have been spot reporting, not getting mail for three or four days at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9461.898s">And</a>  so that's funny because my mail has been good every day and you live, yeah, you live like five minute walk and it's not coming to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9469.142s">So</a>  there's been different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9470.884s">And</a>  I know that USPS is understaffed and there's also some national issues there, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9475.532s">you</a>  know, really just want to get that communicated out because I know folks, they maybe some folks expect the census to come at a certain time and then it doesn't come so they're not expecting it when it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9485.035s">So</a>  we're not looking for whatever it may be just maybe do a little bit of additional communicating with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9490.677s">We</a>  also did receive the elections after action report today at 416pm so that second clause is not is not there but I do know that <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9504.42s">I</a>  have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9505.1s">I</a>  haven't been able to read that report, so I don't know what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9507.361s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9509.181s">I</a>  do have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9512.922s">I</a>  want to strike that second paragraph of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9517.124s">I</a>  propose the amendment to strike that since we did receive the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9520.545s">And</a>  I'd like to replace it with two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9522.305s">The</a>  first would be, and Mr. Clerk, let me know when you're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9531.408s">Be</a>  it further resolved <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9533.984s">that</a>  the elections manager and elections commission share whether postcards will be mailed to all residents before the 2023 municipal election. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9562.997s">Asking</a>  them if they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9565.738s">Sorry,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9567.639s">Where</a>  are we up to? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9568.299s">10</a>  o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9572.48s">That</a>  too. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9572.881s">If</a>  they want to vote by mail.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9590.623s">And</a>  I'd also like to amend it to include, you know, put in reports do that the 2023 election after action report and invite the elections manager to present that report and have a discussion with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9605.807s">Sorry,</a>  I just like the to add to reports do the 2023 the 2022 election after action report. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9614.267s">and</a>  request that the election manager come to present it and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9618.431s">And</a>  I can email that to you after. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9620.653s">Just</a>  want everyone to know what I'm requesting.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9625.277s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9625.737s">I</a>  just, uh, informed just to share some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9630.021s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9631.342s">Um,</a>  but the it is it is, uh, to the public that, um, as of January 24th that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9641.142s">The</a>  2023 annual census will be arriving in your mailboxes within next week, which means it should be arriving this week or next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9648.065s">So</a>  everybody should look out for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9650.106s">And</a>  again, just to reiterate, the importance of the census plays a lot to do with what funding we get here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9659.389s">So</a>  it's very important that people do their due diligence in making sure they fill out the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9665.951s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9668.472s">Madam</a>  President, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9671.13s">With</a>  the delay of mail, I think we've all been getting barraged with phone calls and emails, and I've been referring everybody to Congressman Clark and Senator Warren and Senator Maki. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9682.583s">I</a>  think they think we have something to do with it, and when I try to explain that we don't, then don't call your state representative because they don't have anything to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9692.042s">It's</a>  a federal issue, but you've got to barrage them and tell them. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9696.064s">I</a>  mean, I get mailed every couple of days, and a couple of weeks ago, I got a mail at 10 o'clock on a Saturday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9703.246s">I</a>  mean, my ring bell goes off, and I see this guy walking up the stairs at 10 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9707.948s">I'm</a>  saying, who's this? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9708.648s">It</a>  was the mailman. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9710.229s">And</a>  he said, I was forced to do a double route. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9711.81s">But</a>  Wakeman's pays more money than the post office now. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9716.28s">That's</a>  why you know that they're not you know they don't want to pay anything but yeah yeah yeah you have to talk to just you know continue to call you the federal representatives to get this mail situation straighter straight away.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9726.704s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9727.965s">Councilmember</a>  bears brings up a good point and it really never was a practice is something that I experienced previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9736.504s">where</a>  when you don't fill out the census, you get removed from the voter rolls, and it's created some significant level of confusion across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9744.345s">In</a>  my historic involvement in the city, up until we hired an election coordinator, we really never removed anybody from the rolls if they didn't participate in the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9754.787s">So</a>  you get into a situation where someone gets removed from the voter rolls for not filling out the census, now they become an uninformed voter, because now they're not on the voter rolls, so they don't get mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9764.615s">They</a>  don't get mail, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9765.736s">So</a>  they get mail from no candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9767.157s">So</a>  they become an uninformed voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9768.918s">So</a>  now you have an uninformed voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9770.218s">That's</a>  me, for example, I haven't missed an election since I was 18 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9773.961s">I</a>  didn't fill up the census this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9775.862s">I</a>  went to go last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9777.182s">I</a>  went to go vote and I wasn't allowed to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9779.944s">I</a>  was on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9784.327s">My</a>  name was on the ballot, but I wasn't allowed to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9788.067s">It's</a>  a bad practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9788.968s">You</a>  know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9789.408s">Because</a>  that person that goes into the voter booth to vote and they get told that they can't or that they're not on the list or that they're inactive is going to turn around and walk out the door and there's a chance they might not come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9798.853s">So</a>  now we have someone that's become an uninformed voter because they're not getting any mail from the candidates because they're not showing up on the voter rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9805.452s">And</a>  then when they go to vote, it's actually an impediment for them to cast in their ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9809.755s">So</a>  I think the practice needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9812.396s">And</a>  again, it was never an issue up until we created this election coordinators position. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9816.819s">And</a>  now we have an election manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9818.778s">But</a>  I think it's a practice that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9820.399s">It's</a>  a policy that needs to be reviewed because, you know, everybody talks about wanting to drive more people out to the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9826.08s">How</a>  do we get more people out to the polls? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9827.441s">We</a>  don't have election day anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9828.661s">We</a>  get like election month for cry-eye, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9830.461s">You</a>  can mail it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9831.202s">You</a>  can come in from, you know, pretty soon we're going to be able to vote through our television or do it on the internet, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9836.363s">and</a>  it's going to be able to be something you can vote for whoever you want, whatever you want for this month, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9841.645s">So,</a>  you know, the way that we're expanding access to voting, it doesn't make sense to me to take people off the rolls for not filling out the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9848.427s">You</a>  know, I think that there's a better practice or a better way that we can look at it, especially if you look at the vote history of an individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9853.429s">I</a>  mean, you're going to see someone that voted in 15 municipal elections in a row or 20 elections in a row and you're taking them off the rolls, but you know, they lived there, they paid the tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9862.332s">You</a>  know, it's just something that I find very confusing when you can't, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9865.353s">the</a>  way the system set up, you can't register to vote in two communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9867.715s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9868.336s">You're</a>  going to get caught because so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9870.498s">It's</a>  just, I don't think it's a great practice that's conducive to promoting participation in elections.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9875.722s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9877.984s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9879.706s">I</a>  had my hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9883.089s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify one quick thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9886.177s">It's</a>  just that you're marked inactive it's something you're taking off so you're still registered to vote, but you do have to provide additional documentation around your, around your address. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9893.824s">So</a>  there is definitely a barrier that's created when you're marked inactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9897.528s">I</a>  do believe, though, that that's actually a function of state law so I don't think it's a city policy, but I'd be definitely be interested in thought it was like one of those things where you have, you may not shout. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9907.979s">And</a>  that would be good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9909.76s">My</a>  understanding is it isn't, but if it's the other way around.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9912.42s">I'm</a>  still blaming you for kicking everybody off the road four years ago.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9916.862s">Which</a>  is one reason why I've reviewed this section of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9923.223s">But</a>  yeah, I just wanted to clarify that and further just state that when I bring up working with the local U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9928.625s">Postal</a>  Service, I mean the staff at the Medford branch of the post office. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9933.346s">In</a>  the past, there has been a historic relationship between <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9936.647s">the</a>  registrar voters, now the Elections Commission and that office, especially as it relates to absentee ballots and vote by mail and the city census to make sure those things go out in a timely manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9945.509s">And</a>  I want to make sure that that relationship is maintained and that that continues to happen as you noted, and everyone's noted that there is just a lot more election related mail happening now with so much vote by mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9955.992s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9957.173s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9958.353s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Bears as amended by Vice President Bears, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9962.626s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9964.007s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9964.327s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9965.828s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9967.009s">23-027</a>  offered by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9968.29s">Be</a>  it resolved that the city council ask the city administration to inform residents about 2023 tax credits they can receive through clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including but not limited to up to $1,200 in credit each year for adding insulation or installing efficient windows and doors, up to 30% of the cost of installing battery storage. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9988.558s">up</a>  to $600 off the cost of a panel upgrade, up to $150 off the cost of an energy audit, 30% of the cost of buying and installing a heat pump up to $2,000, including support for any electric system upgrades needed to make the home heat pump ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10003.304s">Residents</a>  can find a more extensive list of incentives and rebates, as well as more information about the program at cleanenergy.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10010.047s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10010.787s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10011.967s">I'll</a>  be brief because this resolution kind of says it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10015.809s">The</a>  Inflation Reduction Act has a lot of provisions that give financial incentives and rebates for people to make energy efficient upgrades to their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10025.252s">I</a>  know that's something that a lot of Medford families are looking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10029.554s">they</a>  might be able to take advantage of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10033.857s">I</a>  only recently saw on the President's Instagram account. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10037.32s">I</a>  know there are tons of different ways of getting information from the government, but I know a lot of people pay attention to the city government, to the Medford government, and so this would be a good thing for our city to do, especially to meet our clean energy goals with regards to buildings.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10057.065s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10058.105s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10058.765s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10059.606s">A</a>  lot of these things are included in the, every month when you get your electric bill, they're in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10065.307s">They</a>  always, that's part of the stuff you throw away when you open it up.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10068.868s">Or</a>  recycle.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10069.448s">If</a>  you actually read. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10072.489s">I</a>  mean, I personally have taken advantage of some of these things here, but every month they're in your bill and with all the other stuff there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10079.31s">And</a>  they encourage you to, like I just did a new energy audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10082.911s">I</a>  mean, I've got, I have two new heat pumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10087.639s">the</a>  on the wall on demand or water. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10089.32s">So</a>  I've taken advantage of things and I find out most of the time it's through my electric bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10094.602s">And</a>  because they're inside there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10096.523s">So,</a>  but I say these are good things and people should take advantage of them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10100.564s">For</a>  those who have gone paperless, they may not be getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10103.886s">I'm</a>  sorry, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10172.5s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10172.721s">Yeah,</a>  it was.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10173.321s">Okay,</a>  so I already forgot was famous on the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor carving out all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10180.928s">I</a>  suppose motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10184.443s">22-028</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10187.064s">Be</a>  it so resolved that Medford City Council, DPW, and engineering departments have Eversource repaint the line on Winthrop Street that has faded in less than three months in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10195.105s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10195.865s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10196.746s">I</a>  think if we went by, the lines had been repainted and the cones that have been there for the last three days are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10204.187s">One</a>  thing you do notice, since the lines have been painted, you can notice all the valleys and all the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10213.72s">It</a>  fathomed, I'm really bothered by, in front of the high school, why you're having traffic go into each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10221.385s">I</a>  just don't see the safety of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10224.787s">There's</a>  gonna be a head-on collision there, and it's gonna be our fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10227.989s">And</a>  those lines are all, they're just not straight, they're all over the place.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10233.212s">I</a>  did talk with Director Blake specifically about the high school, and there is gonna be some adjustment to that in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10238.516s">Yeah,</a>  someone's gonna die.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10240.317s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10242.8s">But</a>  I'd say what it has done, point of clarification, it has, spring of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10246.463s">It's</a>  told this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10249.406s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10250.647s">It</a>  has accentuated all the valleys in that great paving job that we did there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10256.631s">Madam</a>  President, can we be clear that not water-based paint this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10260.414s">Yeah,</a>  I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10261.515s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10262.016s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10262.336s">Yeah,</a>  thank you, Councilor Caraviello and Ed.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10264.057s">And</a>  also, one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10268.601s">The</a>  speed tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10270.721s">where</a>  the speed tables if there could be a light there because at nighttime people can't see the speed table and listen people don't adhere to the law all the time uh and they fly over them and and uh <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10282.687s">And</a>  it said that that causes more of a safety hazard than what's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10285.949s">And</a>  I did get a, seeing that we're talking about lines and things, I did get a call from a resident asking that the crosswalk at Harvard Ave and High be repainted, because that's where you get a lot of kids cross there in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10303.298s">So</a>  if we can get that done too, I'd appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10305.479s">Thank</a>  you, would you like those as amendments?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10307.4s">Yes,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10308.668s">Any</a>  further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10310.289s">And</a>  I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10311.09s">Yeah,</a>  I appreciate you bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10312.291s">I</a>  live right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10312.852s">So</a>  I noticed the new lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10313.813s">I</a>  am curious as to Councilor Scarpelli's joke, but why, why was this paint in this condition in the first place? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10320.058s">Why</a>  did we get paint that basically disappeared? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10322.52s">You</a>  couldn't see anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10323.99s">We'll</a>  see if we can get an answer to that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10325.31s">I</a>  know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10325.91s">It's</a>  because we complain that we call them up here so many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10328.931s">So</a>  the administration said, you're making us look bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10330.751s">Could</a>  you put something down and see how long it's going to last just to get the noise to go away?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10335.472s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10335.853s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10336.493s">That's</a>  why.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10337.493s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10339.193s">My</a>  understanding is that they had to use, they didn't use like the thermoplastic permanent paint because of the season. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10345.595s">You</a>  know?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10345.895s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10346.155s">Which</a>  I understand, but.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10349.417s">It's</a>  clearly didn't last. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10350.378s">I'm</a>  not defending it, but my understanding was they were planning to go back and do a better job in the spring and they let it go too long in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10355.986s">And</a>  that's probably an indication of what we were talking about around the whole scheduling thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10360.493s">Again,</a>  not to blame any specific party as to why things need to be scheduled the way they need to be scheduled, but it seems that the <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10366.218s">reason</a>  the paint went out is that it was scheduled incorrectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10368.779s">And</a>  the reason that there did multiple passes and there are seams is because it was not scheduled in such a way that they could do a complete pour. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10375.36s">So,</a>  you know, it goes back to this question of scheduling really at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10379.341s">I</a>  heard they blamed the police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10380.961s">It's</a>  his fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10382.482s">Well,</a>  and again, I'm not blaming anybody.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10384.402s">No,</a>  not you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10384.902s">I'm</a>  saying Eversource was told that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10386.623s">Well,</a>  they said it was an issue with details. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10388.503s">And</a>  so they need to come together and get a better plan, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10390.724s">Like</a>  that's really the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10391.604s">Especially</a>  for the second half. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10392.624s">I</a>  think that's important.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10394.025s">That's</a>  a resolution for next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10395.685s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10399.029s">approval.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10858.83s">Thank</a>  you, you know on the appointment of President Tom I recall when we went through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10864.652s">I</a>  believe, I think, Rick and I were the only two that were on the council at the time, yeah man McGlynn was the mayor, and what man McGlynn did was he had a huge fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10875.234s">And</a>  at this fundraiser, they raised a ton of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10878.197s">for</a>  private donors to create a maintenance and upkeep fund that would maintain the upkeep of the fountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10886.685s">Then</a>  the fountain COVID came the phone has been shut off for at least three years right at least three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10891.53s">Yes,</a>  at least three years, but there's a dedicated account here in City Hall and Councilor Caraviello is on point with this we need to find out what balance is left in that account because <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10902.26s">based</a>  upon the financial spending habits that I'm seeing with this administration, the lack of financial and fiscal transparency and responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10909.185s">I'm</a>  thinking to myself that we're in a very significant fiscal crisis here in this community, because they're not sharing any financial documents with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10915.97s">They're</a>  not showing us the Warren articles where the money is getting spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10918.811s">They're</a>  not providing us with the quarterly updates that we're asking for and what the status of our financial picture is here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10924.195s">So</a>  it's leading me to believe that these accounts that are sitting around for a little bit of time that had a dedicated and committed purpose that people have forgotten about are going to be getting graded soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10932.497s">So</a>  I'd like to see that.</p>
