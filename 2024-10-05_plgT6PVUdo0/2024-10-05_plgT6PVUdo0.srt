[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the

25
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:37,230
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend the rule seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

26
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,911
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

27
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:40,553
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

28
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:46,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, I offer a motion this evening as I look out in the audience and I see a number of our friends from organized labor that are here this evening.

29
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Normally they have been able to provide us with updates throughout the course of this past term.

30
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:55,758
[SPEAKER_10]: as to the status of the contract negotiations and the status of labor relations here in the community.

31
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:57,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've always very patient.

32
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:02,659
[SPEAKER_10]: They usually wait till the end of the meeting, sometimes three and four hours after the opportunity to speak before this body.

33
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,680
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought it'd be a nice gesture to allow them to speak first this evening.

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

35
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a motion to take public participation out of order.

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

37
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:15,781
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we already suspended the rules to take public participation.

38
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:18,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So who would like to come up and speak?

39
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

40
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:35,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Madam President, members of the City Council, Stephen South, 106 Damon Road, also Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 25.

41
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:38,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come here tonight.

42
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:51,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, the mayor gave a state of the city address and we are here to give a state of the union negotiations address, if you will, or update.

43
00:01:51,824 --> 00:02:01,710
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently Teamsters Local 25 represents hundreds of your employees and our members within the city of Medford in eight separate bargaining units.

44
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you a short

45
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:07,613
[SPEAKER_01]: update of where we are on the bargaining for all these.

46
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:11,494
[SPEAKER_01]: With the DPW group, many of them are here tonight behind me.

47
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:24,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Their last raise was January 1 of 2022, and we had our last negotiations on January 20, which seems to be the end of the city's good faith bargaining.

48
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:29,540
[SPEAKER_01]: The city has verbally gave us a last and final of

49
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:34,344
[SPEAKER_01]: 2% each year for three years on top of a bunch of concessions.

50
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:50,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you on this side of the rail and this side that aren't aware of what concessions mean, that means that a lot of the benefits that the employees, the hardworking employees behind me currently enjoy, the city wants to take away and give them only 2%.

51
00:02:52,179 --> 00:03:02,207
[SPEAKER_01]: The city's inspectors, recreation department, and DPW superintendents, the second group, their last raise was January 1, 2022.

52
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:16,998
[SPEAKER_01]: We also met on January 20, and the city gave us their last and final of many concessions to the benefits and things that our members currently enjoy, and also 2% each year for three years.

53
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,923
[SPEAKER_01]: in the January 20, 2023 was the last meeting.

54
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:24,323
[SPEAKER_01]: January 20.

55
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:30,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, when they told us one of the make sure things when they made it clear that none of our groups are getting more than 2% each year.

56
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:38,410
[SPEAKER_01]: The parking department, which just came into existence in January of 2022, they've never had a race.

57
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And since you hired these people and created this department, they have suffered more than any

58
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:51,757
[SPEAKER_01]: more than most groups in the city, including but not limited to.

59
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,502
[SPEAKER_01]: You have changed their schedules from a five day work week to a six day work week.

60
00:03:56,522 --> 00:04:02,948
[SPEAKER_01]: They're now required many of them to work Monday through Saturday and that's to get 35 hours pay.

61
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:04,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to be clear when you're saying you.

62
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Council has not made that change.

63
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:07,911
[SPEAKER_04]: The city administration has.

64
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the city.

65
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:09,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

66
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:12,212
[SPEAKER_01]: The city's administration, the mayor and her people.

67
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,134
[SPEAKER_01]: They're required to work six days a week.

68
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:16,434
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not optional.

69
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:26,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's to get 35 hours, which there is no other bargaining unit in the state of Massachusetts that I'm currently aware of that is required to work six days to get 35 hours pay.

70
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:39,558
[SPEAKER_01]: They've also changed it to where now these guys have alternate schedules, meaning this week they work days, next week they work nights, the following week they work days, the following week they work nights.

71
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:41,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Call it an alternate schedule.

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these guys have families.

73
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they can plan their family life with a wife and children with those schedules.

74
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:55,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know many of you have families, so I know you can appreciate that.

75
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,861
[SPEAKER_01]: don't fall over, they put body cameras on our parking control officers.

76
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:16,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want to point out, and I love the police in Medford, they are amazing, but the police in Medford don't wear body cameras, but the parking control people that write tickets wear body cameras.

77
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:21,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never bargained with Local 25, we currently have litigation outstanding related to it.

78
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:25,906
[SPEAKER_01]: They also, when people call in sick, they will change their hours

79
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,527
[SPEAKER_01]: even on a day-to-day basis.

80
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:32,991
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone calls in sick tomorrow and you're a day person, they may make you work nights.

81
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:37,735
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys really have a tough road.

82
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,878
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the parking department.

83
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:54,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the city has indicated we're meeting with them tomorrow, but the city's attorney, not the city's attorney because we don't have any, but KP law attorney indicated that they would be offering 2% for all of our groups.

84
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:58,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five is the Medford Clerical.

85
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:04,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Their last raise was January 1 of 2019, which is over four years.

86
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:10,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly tomorrow, 49 months since they had a wage increase.

87
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:19,398
[SPEAKER_01]: We last met about three weeks ago, and the city had offered us at the previous session

88
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:25,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, mind you, other groups got $1,500 COVID bonuses.

89
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:36,667
[SPEAKER_01]: They offered us $500 COVID bonus at the previous session, and at the last session, which was our final, they went from 500 to a 0% bonus.

90
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:45,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our big issues with that group is these are some of the lowest paid employees in the city, and right here in this building.

91
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:54,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple different classifications in that group the junior clerk and senior clerk which are, I believe, the lowest paid employees in the city.

92
00:06:55,021 --> 00:07:00,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So we asked the city to do a market rate adjustment which many communities have done.

93
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:10,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And they agreed, finally, at the last session and said that they would agree to give the lowest paid workers in the city a $4 per week wage increase.

94
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:14,301
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the city's fix for their very low wages.

95
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:23,631
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean per hour, per week, $4 per week in addition to their raises, $4 per week to make it better.

96
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:26,813
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's obviously a no.

97
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the schools and the school security.

98
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:35,699
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's been a huge topic in the last month plus.

99
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:40,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Our school security personnel, their last raise was July 1 of 2020.

100
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:43,759
[SPEAKER_01]: That was three years and a month ago.

101
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,282
[SPEAKER_01]: They currently make $17.50 per hour.

102
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:54,406
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people that are reporting to fights and stabbings, a stabbing, I should say.

103
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:59,519
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a very difficult job, $1,750 per hour.

104
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, we're trying to bring that up.

105
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:12,910
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem in that negotiation is the city is offering us, again, they just settled with the teachers and gave them $1,500 per year COVID bonuses, and they're offering us half of that.

106
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:16,753
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unacceptable, and that won't happen.

107
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:21,977
[SPEAKER_01]: School custodians last raised July 1, 2020, three years and one month ago.

108
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:25,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing, they're being offered less than the teachers.

109
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:29,445
[SPEAKER_01]: that less bonuses, less raises.

110
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:42,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And number eight is the school administrators, directors, coordinators, assistant principals, outside of the superintendent and assistant superintendent, these people run Medford Public Schools.

111
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:48,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Their last raise was January 1 of 2021, a little over two years ago.

112
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:50,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city took the position at the last,

113
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:57,590
[SPEAKER_01]: negotiation we had a few weeks ago that they currently don't even have a contract because they switched to the teamsters.

114
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:04,458
[SPEAKER_01]: We filed an unfair labor practice with the Massachusetts Labor Relations Board and that's currently pending.

115
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:10,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they also notified us that they would not process any grievances because

116
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,526
[SPEAKER_01]: this group doesn't have a contract.

117
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:19,749
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, they're telling us that regardless of all that, they're not agreeing to what the teacher's got.

118
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are people that supervise teachers.

119
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,970
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number eight.

120
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:31,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know all of you, not all of you personally, some of you personally, some professionally, and I know you're all very smart people.

121
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:32,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of respect for what you all do.

122
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:36,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you're probably thinking in your mind, well, why is that?

123
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are other communities getting?

124
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,038
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are other groups getting?

125
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if that is your question, I have the answer.

126
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:47,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can provide you, and I send you guys emails.

127
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:50,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times I can provide you with these via email if you wanna see them.

128
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:54,576
[SPEAKER_01]: So I negotiate all the surrounding contracts in surrounding communities.

129
00:09:55,557 --> 00:10:01,282
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last year, a little over a year, I've negotiated in Everett, three separate collective bargaining agreements.

130
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:06,647
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a four year deal, 3% each year, three, three, three, and three, with many other improvements.

131
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:11,690
[SPEAKER_01]: In Malden, about three months ago, I settled a contract in Malden.

132
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:20,557
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 3% each year for three years, three, three, and three, with market rate adjustment raises on top of that and many other improvements.

133
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:21,477
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Malden.

134
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:27,882
[SPEAKER_01]: In Chelsea, we just settled a three-year deal with Chelsea, 4%, 3.5%, 3.5%, and market rate adjustment raises with many other improvements.

135
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:28,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Chelsea.

136
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:28,562
[SPEAKER_01]: In Newton,

137
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:45,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Little over a year ago, we settled a four-year deal, 3% each year, 3, 3, 3, and 3, and market rate adjustment raises on top of that with many other improvements.

138
00:10:45,292 --> 00:11:00,619
[SPEAKER_01]: In the city of Waltham, about 3 and 1⁄2 weeks ago, I settled a contract for 80 employees there, 3.25, 3.25, 3.25, market rate adjustments on top of that, a three-year deal, many other improvements.

139
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:01,520
[SPEAKER_01]: In North Reading,

140
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:10,148
[SPEAKER_01]: About three months ago, I settled a contract with the North Reading DPW, 3% each year, 3, 3, and 3, with many other improvements.

141
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:17,090
[SPEAKER_01]: In the town of Stowe, last year, I settled a contract for the DPW there.

142
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:22,180
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was anywhere between 15 and 21% for over three years.

143
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,802
[SPEAKER_01]: That includes market rate adjustments and many other improvements.

144
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:38,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's seven communities, six are right near here, one still is a little bit further out, but that's just in the last little over a year, myself personally negotiating with the surrounding communities.

145
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,853
[SPEAKER_01]: We're being told by the KP law lawyer that

146
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:47,475
[SPEAKER_01]: any final deal with any of our groups will be 2% each year.

147
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:52,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also insisting upon many concessions with my groups.

148
00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:01,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give you a quick update that I know that the city does not provide all of you, and I come here every month or so to provide it to you.

149
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:06,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, my members have five open federal lawsuits against the city.

150
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:08,266
[SPEAKER_01]: These are wage and hour lawsuits.

151
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:12,169
[SPEAKER_01]: These are five separate groups of employees.

152
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:21,258
[SPEAKER_01]: We have approximately 30 or a little over 30 unfair labor practice charges with the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relation.

153
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:22,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been meeting.

154
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:30,347
[SPEAKER_01]: We met with a mediator just Friday, a state mediator, to try to mediate some of these before we go to more hearings.

155
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,929
[SPEAKER_01]: We've received favorable decisions from the Labor Board.

156
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:36,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been sending them to you via email.

157
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,952
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been several of those in the last few months.

158
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:49,799
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an open complaint at the Secretary of State's office for the city refusing to provide the union with public documents, including bills for KP Law.

159
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,281
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave them to us, but they were 100% redacted.

160
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:52,901
[SPEAKER_01]: They claimed

161
00:12:54,142 --> 00:13:02,485
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney client privilege, which there's no such thing with a simple legal bill that just states the dollar amount and what the issues were.

162
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:15,630
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also filing another complaint because we've been requesting information regarding the city's use of private investigators to follow city employees.

163
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,851
[SPEAKER_01]: They've provided us a bunch of information.

164
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:26,908
[SPEAKER_01]: over the course of a year with multiple requests and labor charges, but there's still information that they're redacting.

165
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:36,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And we feel that it's important, but they have finally admitted in writing that the city is hiring these people through KP Law as a shell.

166
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:40,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So KP Law hires them and then the city reimburses.

167
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:44,445
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's how they get around giving us some of the information.

168
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:59,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So regarding the open negotiations, and I'm almost done, I apologize for the length of my report, but, and I'll use a quote that I heard last week, very similar.

169
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:04,547
[SPEAKER_01]: This union, Local 25 and our members, our couple hundred members and their families,

170
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:09,864
[SPEAKER_01]: will never ever agree to 2% in a bunch of concessions.

171
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,185
[SPEAKER_01]: That will never happen.

172
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:14,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And the quote is, not now, not ever.

173
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:16,228
[SPEAKER_01]: That is unacceptable.

174
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:21,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all of you, for the city council,

175
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:27,430
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we come up and report things to you often, but I never really ask of anything.

176
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,292
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm asking all of you to assist with this, because this is your city, too.

177
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,713
[SPEAKER_01]: You all work here and live here.

178
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:37,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just us.

179
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:47,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't speak for other unions, but I'm aware that there's other unions that are in the same boat as us, that are working without a contract, some of which are protesting with us, like last week.

180
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:50,122
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unacceptable.

181
00:14:50,282 --> 00:15:01,049
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason why all of these other communities can provide fair wages, fair contracts to their employees, but Medford can't.

182
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,830
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just wrong.

183
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:12,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And the teachers settled their contract recently, and they settled for a four-year deal, 2.5 year one, 2.5 year two, 3.5 year three, 3%.

184
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:23,356
[SPEAKER_01]: year four for 11.5% over four years, and we're being offered 2% a year in a bunch of concessions.

185
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:27,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want this to be divide and conquer.

186
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:28,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the teachers.

187
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:30,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are my friends and family.

188
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:31,586
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.

189
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:33,347
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve everything that they got.

190
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:35,288
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve more than that.

191
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:48,013
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no way that the city can give a fair contract to 500 teachers and then tell the rest of the city that they have to take things away from them just to give them 2%.

192
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:51,235
[SPEAKER_01]: When last year, the inflation rate

193
00:15:51,915 --> 00:16:02,863
[SPEAKER_01]: when anywhere from 6.5% to 9.1% and currently as of December 2022 at 6.5% and the new data comes out in a couple weeks.

194
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:14,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would ask all of you to write a letter to the mayor and her administration and demand that the employees that you all represent or

195
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:20,107
[SPEAKER_01]: that work in this city, just like you all do, that they get what they deserve.

196
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these guys aren't gonna be millionaires.

197
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:30,434
[SPEAKER_01]: We know they're not gonna buy mansions off of city salaries, but they shouldn't be living in poverty.

198
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:33,055
[SPEAKER_01]: People shouldn't be making $17 an hour.

199
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:40,200
[SPEAKER_01]: People shouldn't be having to beg just to get a small raise.

200
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:43,174
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to pay the bills.

201
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:50,338
[SPEAKER_01]: People shouldn't go 49 months and counting without a wage increase.

202
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:51,879
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just unacceptable.

203
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't a chess game.

204
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:00,604
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't some kind of game, maybe for the administration it is, but these are real

205
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:08,266
[SPEAKER_01]: people with real families and spouses and children and dogs and mortgages and lots of bills to pay.

206
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:09,607
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is unacceptable.

207
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:16,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am finally once I'm asking you all to help, not to help me, but to help

208
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:25,132
[SPEAKER_01]: your employees and my members because what is going on now is unacceptable and certainly I'm open to any and all questions.

209
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:33,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I would even encourage if one of you wants to show up or all of you show up to our contract negotiations, I will gladly send you

210
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:39,369
[SPEAKER_01]: the dates for all of our upcoming negotiations, because I know this seems unbelievable.

211
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,952
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably, I see a few of you shaking your heads, because it seems so ridiculous, and it is.

212
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:50,855
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to see it for yourself, under Mass General Law, I have the right to bring whoever I want to negotiation.

213
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:55,497
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would certainly offer an open invite to all seven of you.

214
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:59,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And Adam, if you would like to go as well, sir, you're more than welcome.

215
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So the eight of you.

216
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,785
[SPEAKER_01]: You're more than welcome to come to our bargaining and anything you can do to help.

217
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:10,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I appreciate my members appreciate and I thank you for your kind attention.

218
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:13,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

219
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:15,037
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can, Mr. South, I appreciate.

220
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:27,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the updates because I don't think people understand, you know, when you see the mayor come up and they do the state of the city address and everything's happy and, you know, skate with the mayor, that's a new one that's coming up.

221
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:29,898
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what infuriates this community.

222
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:42,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember just a few short years ago, this body, including the mayor, talking about the essential workers and how important they were during the most difficult time in our history.

223
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:54,195
[SPEAKER_08]: people that got up every single day to make sure the streets are plowed, make sure that the parks are clean, making sure that the pipes that burst are fixed.

224
00:18:54,716 --> 00:19:04,800
[SPEAKER_08]: We made sure that our municipal workers, our DPW, were applauded, and this is a true slap in the face when it comes to what I'm hearing.

225
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have a dumb question, because I can only imagine.

226
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,543
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what's going on, but I will tell you

227
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:21,409
[SPEAKER_08]: as a first member of this community, I see each and every member that's sitting behind you in their trucks every single day, working every single day.

228
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:25,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen one iota of change, and that's what I find impressive.

229
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:29,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question truly is, how is the morale of this team?

230
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:33,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know, are we filling openings?

231
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:36,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, are they still doing the job of our minimal

232
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:52,682
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to what we were looking for during negotiations when we heard the ridiculous numbers, when we talk about a city the size of Medford and the DPW team that we have and how limited it is, that hasn't changed, correct?

233
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, several questions.

234
00:19:55,603 --> 00:20:04,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, I just want to say thank you for your service, for your question, and for the fact that you've always been a champion for the working people in Medford.

235
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:05,826
[SPEAKER_01]: So we appreciate it.

236
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:12,188
[SPEAKER_01]: The morale in Medford, not just with the DPW, but with all the different groups, is very, very poor.

237
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:17,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, I've represented workers in the city since 2008, and I've never seen it like this.

238
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,411
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually depressing.

239
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:29,738
[SPEAKER_01]: The as far as being able to fill vacancies, the city's not posting all the vacancies and we are short staffed.

240
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:32,820
[SPEAKER_01]: We're extremely short staffed and we have been for many years.

241
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:48,509
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's funny that you asked because I just looked on the city's website today and saw some of the vacancies that are posted, such as the city solicitor, the assistant city solicitor, the IT director, the benefits coordinator, tree climber,

242
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:50,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on and so forth.

243
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,250
[SPEAKER_01]: The list goes on.

244
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of them that are vacant are not even posted.

245
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:59,813
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is also very problematic with our groups.

246
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:04,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year we saw people fleeing

247
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:13,670
[SPEAKER_01]: the city of Medford from working here, fleeing, not just the people that were unlawfully terminated, but people just quitting and going elsewhere.

248
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've gotten up and spoken about it previously.

249
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:22,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not just talking union members, I'm talking union management, non-union.

250
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:29,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just within the last few weeks, the assistant superintendent of Medford public schools quit to go work for Cambridge.

251
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:31,493
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that tell you?

252
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:35,380
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the number two person at Medford Public Schools, just quit.

253
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:36,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's now vacant.

254
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:38,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is problematic.

255
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:42,132
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been going on the last couple of years, three to be exact.

256
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:44,976
[SPEAKER_01]: and something has to give.

257
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:51,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that the state of the city, when addressed by one person, seems rosy, but it is not rosy.

258
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:58,219
[SPEAKER_01]: We have big problems in the city and something has to give, but I'm asking you all for your help.

259
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:06,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do appreciate everything you guys do, but I just want you to know how bad it is and how desperate your employees and our members are.

260
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:08,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate that.

261
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that this is what bothers us.

262
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:22,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, I'm hearing from from colleagues and neighbor communities that they they used to say they used to open a bottle of wine on a Tuesday night to watch Council Penter and Council Camuso go after each other.

263
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And they thought that was funny.

264
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:29,359
[SPEAKER_08]: But what you had there, you had two people that they had different views, but they both loved Medford.

265
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:30,079
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the key.

266
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:32,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And they wanted Medford to be the greatest city in the Commonwealth.

267
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:35,143
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm seeing right now is

268
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:40,523
[SPEAKER_08]: what I'm hearing, what I'm seeing right now, not getting any financial paperwork.

269
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,966
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know where the city's finances are.

270
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:53,299
[SPEAKER_08]: If this is an indication, I think this is pretty scary, that if she's only offering 2% to the most, the hottest working people in our workforce, that

271
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,721
[SPEAKER_08]: They're only offering 2% standing there.

272
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it scary to where we're going to be in June.

273
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:11,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So for one, I'll do anything and everything that I'm not afraid to stand on any soapbox if it can carry me and say whatever has to be said for the men and women that work for our city.

274
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:17,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, is that the morale in this community is terrible.

275
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:19,209
[SPEAKER_08]: The workforce just isn't there.

276
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody's being pit against each other.

277
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:30,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And what keeps coming back to me, the mayor made a comment that it's difficult to clean up city hall.

278
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:33,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still confused with that comment.

279
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:35,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know where that's coming from.

280
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:37,834
[SPEAKER_08]: She's been in office now, it's in her fourth year.

281
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:44,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what that means because all I'm seeing right now is a city that has no leadership.

282
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:50,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing a city that has no directors and no leaders in different departments.

283
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:53,485
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a city council that has no power.

284
00:23:54,085 --> 00:24:04,472
[SPEAKER_08]: We're an absolute laughingstock when I'm talking to colleagues in other communities that they can't believe what we have to do as a council when we're asking for simple documents to do our job.

285
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:06,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, are you just negotiating?

286
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:10,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this the, it's not the chief of staff, it's not the HR director anymore.

287
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:17,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we gave him a fancy name with more money, but I don't, you know, that's the other piece is when we talk about

288
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:19,162
[SPEAKER_08]: the higher level.

289
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:20,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see it.

290
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:21,526
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably have it somewhere.

291
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:27,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you could forward it to us, I'd like to see what the leadership at the school system is making.

292
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:31,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see what the leadership here at City Hall is making that are in that are

293
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:44,042
[SPEAKER_08]: are negotiating with you because I bet you they're not worrying about how they're gonna pay their sons or daughters tuitions that members behind you have kids going to school as cost of living increases or the price of gasoline.

294
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:53,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So for one council, I'll do anything, any invitation that's offered to me, I'll gladly join in and share my support.

295
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:58,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what people really have to understand out there is that we're not in very good shape in the city.

296
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:00,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a great example of it.

297
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:02,981
[SPEAKER_08]: The teachers settled, but they're not happy either.

298
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:04,808
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not happy either.

299
00:25:04,828 --> 00:25:05,411
[SPEAKER_08]: We know they're not.

300
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:07,719
[SPEAKER_08]: but they know they had to go back.

301
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:11,660
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing we're seeing from our DPW employees, they're not stopping.

302
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,541
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no threat of a strike.

303
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:17,322
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still doing the job above and beyond.

304
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:20,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So I applaud them all and I applaud you for sticking with it.

305
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:33,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've named a couple of communities that I know employees that work there and are so pleased the way you negotiated fairly with their negotiating teams in different communities and their outcomes.

306
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:35,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what's so frustrating with this community

307
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:47,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it just, it brings a fear to my heart that if she's only offering 2%, how bad are we looking financially?

308
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,755
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's telling us, no one Mr. Selk.

309
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:58,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just afraid what's gonna come in a few months because this is a scary time and method.

310
00:25:58,442 --> 00:26:01,665
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think people need to stand up and wake up because

311
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:07,869
[SPEAKER_08]: When the dust settles, the people behind you are still gonna be the ones standing up.

312
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:13,294
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still gonna be up at two in the morning plowing our streets to make sure our kids have a safe walk to school.

313
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:20,120
[SPEAKER_08]: They're gonna be the ones, when your basement's flooding, the first ones in the basement dealing with that junk in your basement.

314
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,222
[SPEAKER_08]: no question about it, and they need to be treated fairly.

315
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:29,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So for one Councilor, I'm going to stand beside you or in front of you to make sure that someone has to listen.

316
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:34,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate what you're doing, and I appreciate everybody's hard work behind you guys.

317
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:46,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sick to my stomach because I, you know, I'm, again, I hate to say it, but I work in a community that has hundreds of DPW workers that are making a lot of money, and then

318
00:26:47,665 --> 00:26:55,270
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration, they are looking at readjusting their pay scale for what their wage analysis looks like with cost of living.

319
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:03,135
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't imagine what our next negotiation looks like in my community that I work in, because it's fair.

320
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:05,296
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to keep people happy and in their community.

321
00:27:05,636 --> 00:27:07,538
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're doing here in Medford is scaring people off.

322
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,427
[SPEAKER_08]: and no one's going to want to be here.

323
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:10,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And that scares me.

324
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.

325
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Scarpelli.

326
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:16,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to point one thing out or clarify one thing.

327
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:22,722
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about us bargaining with the city officials, we really don't bargain directly with them.

328
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:27,266
[SPEAKER_01]: We bargain with a K. P. Law attorney who deals with does all the

329
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:30,910
[SPEAKER_01]: grievance hearings negotiations meetings everything.

330
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:45,126
[SPEAKER_01]: There is someone from the city that sits quietly at all the meetings, just by himself and observes but we negotiate directly with KP law, and I'm aware that you're the only community anywhere around here because we negotiate with many of them.

331
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:50,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them have three, four, five, six, seven solicitors.

332
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:55,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And Medford currently has zero for anyone that didn't know that.

333
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:03,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And those postings have been on the website for a long time for an assistant solicitor and city solicitor.

334
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:06,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously it goes just like anything else.

335
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:09,793
[SPEAKER_01]: The city's not paying enough to attract people.

336
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:11,274
[SPEAKER_01]: to come and work here?

337
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:20,201
[SPEAKER_08]: To interject, and I don't want to be rude, but I sat at a fundraiser with eight former city solicitors, and I offered them all as a joke to please come work.

338
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:22,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try to get them whatever they want to come to Medford.

339
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:24,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer was, are you kidding me?

340
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:25,765
[SPEAKER_08]: We see what's going on there.

341
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:30,709
[SPEAKER_08]: It has nothing to do with what we're hearing, that it's the climate.

342
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:32,730
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very difficult to get people.

343
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:35,712
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's getting very difficult to get people that can work here.

344
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:38,635
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're seeing firsthand.

345
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,321
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

346
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:43,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if the climate's bad at the schools, they just do studies for 50,000.

347
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:45,288
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

348
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

349
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:49,695
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for being here.

350
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:54,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And once again, providing us with such a detailed outline as to the status of the negotiations for the

351
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:58,848
[SPEAKER_10]: 200 plus families that you represent here in the city of Medford.

352
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:04,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, recently it was brought to my attention that there's a certain issue with new hires and their ability to access health insurance.

353
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:07,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, it's, I have a little bit of a background in the union as well.

354
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:14,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's my understanding that, uh, here in the city of Medford, the municipal employee is required to offer health insurance to their employees.

355
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,582
[SPEAKER_01]: If they work what more than 22 hours a week, I believe, is it?

356
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:17,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.

357
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:24,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city always have, uh, up until this year, last year, I should say back when the mayor was the city councilor,

358
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:33,403
[SPEAKER_10]: She used to have to fill out this affidavit and submit it to mayor Burke in order to get her group health insurance that she was receiving from the city when she was a city council.

359
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:39,836
[SPEAKER_10]: and she had to file an affidavit that said I work 22 hours a week and that made her eligible for the health insurance that she received through the city.

360
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:54,322
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was looking at this and I'm not understanding why exactly a new hire now in this community that would come in that's working 37 and a half hours a week wouldn't be afforded the same group health insurance benefits that every other employee here in the community is being offered.

361
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:57,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there an understanding as to what's going on with the application of this benefit?

362
00:29:58,243 --> 00:29:58,804
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not.

363
00:29:59,144 --> 00:29:59,784
[SPEAKER_01]: This is new.

364
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:11,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that a grievance was filed today by the Public Employees Committee, which is all the unions that negotiate with the city regarding health care.

365
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:12,575
[SPEAKER_01]: That was filed today.

366
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:16,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can forward that to all of you after this meeting.

367
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure.

368
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,685
[SPEAKER_01]: The city's taking the position that a new hire that starts isn't eligible for health care till open enrollment, which is

369
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:31,652
[SPEAKER_01]: the opposite of what this city has done for decades and the opposite of every other community in Massachusetts.

370
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:38,718
[SPEAKER_01]: My only guess, because no one will tell me, is the city no longer has a benefits coordinator.

371
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:39,779
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to hire one.

372
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:49,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume that just like a lot of other functions within the city of Medford, the work just isn't getting done because there's no one in that position anymore.

373
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:50,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

374
00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:51,750
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't get a straight answer.

375
00:30:52,688 --> 00:31:03,534
[SPEAKER_10]: haven't worked in insurance and haven't some experience in insurance it seems to me like the open enrollment period especially for employees in the GIC is usually what sometime around June or July is it?

376
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:05,255
[SPEAKER_10]: About then, yes.

377
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:13,940
[SPEAKER_10]: So what what they're saying is that if an employee that started now in January wouldn't be able to access health insurance while being a city employee for up to 11 months

378
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:26,601
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my understanding, and prior to the city taking that position recently, in the city of Medford and every other community, starting as a new employee is a qualifying event to become eligible for healthcare.

379
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:27,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

380
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:30,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, if I may.

381
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:35,426
[SPEAKER_13]: The letter we got said that the administration told those people to buy their own insurance.

382
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:36,999
[SPEAKER_13]: in the interim.

383
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,380
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to be clear about that too.

384
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,741
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just, we're not going to give it to you.

385
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,501
[SPEAKER_13]: They're saying, go buy some, you know?

386
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:43,923
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, it's ridiculous.

387
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:46,204
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to purchase insurance in Massachusetts.

388
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:47,804
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to be insured you get penalized.

389
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,045
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.

390
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:51,386
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, I'm just, I just want to add that to the conversation.

391
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:52,647
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just, we're not going to give it to you.

392
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:54,948
[SPEAKER_13]: It's go buy your own, even though you're entitled to a benefit.

393
00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:58,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the community I work in, I hired someone yesterday.

394
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,871
[SPEAKER_08]: That person starts with health insurance the day they start, which is February 18th.

395
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:05,513
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is, that is completely false.

396
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:07,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I deal with that every day.

397
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,364
[SPEAKER_08]: To say that they have to wait for an open enrollment is false.

398
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:11,726
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a disgrace.

399
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:12,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Seltz.

400
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:13,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

401
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:13,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

402
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,734
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, what I see, Mr. Seltz, to be honest with you, is a trend.

403
00:32:17,794 --> 00:32:18,675
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pattern, right?

404
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:22,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it has less and less to do with good government here in the community.

405
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:27,284
[SPEAKER_10]: It has less and less to do with doing what's right for the workers in this community.

406
00:32:27,324 --> 00:32:30,306
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's more to do with a vendetta, right?

407
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:41,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone that's vindictive, someone that's upset because you're speaking out, someone that's upset because you're expressing the concerns that your membership has and doing your job.

408
00:32:41,372 --> 00:32:42,513
[SPEAKER_10]: And it might be putting some

409
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,460
[SPEAKER_10]: some rust on the can of the administration.

410
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:45,920
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

411
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,802
[SPEAKER_10]: So the way I look at this is I see a lot of it is retaliatory.

412
00:32:48,822 --> 00:32:50,122
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

413
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:51,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I see no reason for this.

414
00:32:52,324 --> 00:33:04,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand why the cost of living adjustment for one group would be more so than the cost of living adjustment for another group when the cost of living is really a reflection on inflation and how far you can stretch it all.

415
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,856
[SPEAKER_10]: And ultimately, we want to keep, you know, the rank and file employees in this community working.

416
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:10,598
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a hard working group.

417
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:14,363
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I've had the opportunity to know many of these people for a very long time.

418
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:16,987
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, when

419
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:23,418
[SPEAKER_10]: You pick up the phone and you call, they always answer, they always deliver, they're always there.

420
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:37,670
[SPEAKER_10]: And like Councilor Scarpelli said, your group prides itself on showing up for work every day and doing its job, regardless of what the climate is here on City Hall, regardless of what's going on between the administration and the union, they come to work every day and they do their job.

421
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,132
[SPEAKER_10]: And that should be reflected in this wage package as well.

422
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:44,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very grateful for the work that your employees do, that your members do, and that these employees do.

423
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:48,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank you again for coming up here and sharing with us your experience.

424
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

425
00:33:50,486 --> 00:34:04,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

426
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:14,324
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the financial hit the community is going to take when all these lawsuits settle and we finally settle all these contracts between back pay and raises?

427
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:19,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a number, a guess of a number, what the city's gonna be on the hook for?

428
00:34:20,647 --> 00:34:21,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.

429
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:40,314
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a private law firm, a wage and hour law firm that files these lawsuits on behalf of your employees, my members, but I can tell you that one of the lawsuits that the city just settled last summer was for $475,000, and there's five outstanding lawsuits right now.

430
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:41,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question.

431
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:41,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

432
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:43,395
[SPEAKER_03]: This board is supposed to approve all

433
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:49,923
[SPEAKER_03]: How come we never saw that here?

434
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:51,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would tell us anything?

435
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:53,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for telling us, we never knew about that.

436
00:34:54,368 --> 00:35:00,416
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's our job, and when there's a settlement, what's over $5,000, we're supposed to approve it.

437
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:02,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Never saw an approval on that.

438
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,302
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, so that's really my question.

439
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:07,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the financial hit is.

440
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:09,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there going to be this community next year going down the line?

441
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:11,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually these contracts will settle.

442
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:15,392
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, and again, we have no idea where the lawsuits are going.

443
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:19,736
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, as you mentioned, you know, people leaving the city.

444
00:35:19,977 --> 00:35:25,162
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they do is they leave, and then we hire you part time to work here for like

445
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:28,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're a full-time city with a bunch of part-time employees.

446
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:32,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So our economic development director leaves.

447
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:34,975
[SPEAKER_03]: He's working here 10 hours a month now.

448
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:36,537
[SPEAKER_03]: We hired him for 10 hours.

449
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:37,659
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy left.

450
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:40,357
[SPEAKER_03]: The assessor left.

451
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:47,218
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a part-time assessor here, and we borrow, and she works for Lowell.

452
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:49,159
[SPEAKER_03]: So another part-time employee.

453
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:53,760
[SPEAKER_03]: The person who just left the school, took a job in Cambridge.

454
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,000
[SPEAKER_03]: They hired him to come back and do the budget, because they didn't have anybody to do the budget.

455
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So all we do is, people walk out the door, we hire them back part-time.

456
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,022
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a bunch of part-time employees here.

457
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:14,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget the IT director and the assistant IT director who were both fired, we believe, illegally in this litigation.

458
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:17,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when does this stop?

459
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,851
[SPEAKER_03]: When does this revolving door stop?

460
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:28,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody I look at, they're all life, most of them are lifetime members of this community.

461
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:31,309
[SPEAKER_03]: We've never seen a revolving door like this ever.

462
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:36,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a meeting before this, next door with somebody, and they asked me a legal question.

463
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:42,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I was embarrassed to say, I says, I can't answer because I don't have a lawyer to call to give me a legal answer.

464
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:48,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was embarrassed to tell that to five constituents in the other room when they asked me a question.

465
00:36:49,437 --> 00:37:04,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you think that makes me feel as an elected official when I can't answer a constituent's question and I don't even know where to go to get the answer to their questions because we have no lawyer and we have no access to an attorney, which is really a shame.

466
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:14,491
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would really like to know what the financial hit is going to be in this community when all these contracts settle and the guesstimate when all these lawsuits settle.

467
00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:17,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

468
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:17,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the work.

469
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:22,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I think I see these guys working every day, and they don't miss a beat.

470
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:24,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

471
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,070
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

472
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

473
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:35,693
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to try to be as brief as I can, but I think the quote that stood out to me that you said, Mr. South, is we can't get any answers.

474
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,233
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you said that directly.

475
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:40,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I think all of us behind this rail feel exactly the same way.

476
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:43,275
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not the same.

477
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:49,986
[SPEAKER_13]: It's far worse for people not to be getting raises and benefits and pay and health care that affects their families and their lives.

478
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:56,109
[SPEAKER_13]: But we do share the fact that when we ask for information, we ask for anything, we don't get it either from this administration.

479
00:37:56,129 --> 00:38:00,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Frustrated may even be a kind word.

480
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:02,191
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's days when I'm furious.

481
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:04,652
[SPEAKER_13]: We aren't getting what we need.

482
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:08,314
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to put on the table here for you, and then I have a question at the end.

483
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:22,401
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 12 items that have been sitting on our agenda table, some of them for over a year that we've been holding on because we don't get basic information on the budget there's another three items on our agenda that are asking for basic information on the budget and finances that we don't get.

484
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:29,507
[SPEAKER_13]: The only reason there was an assistant city solicitor job posting is because we made it clear that we weren't going to pass a budget unless they created the position.

485
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:42,616
[SPEAKER_13]: And we held multiple meetings to expose the budget issues last June and we haven't gotten any answers for nine months so I completely share your frustration and the frustration of every city employee that we don't have answers.

486
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:47,693
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, city employees are the lifeblood of the city, they make it run.

487
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:58,218
[SPEAKER_13]: And I completely agree with what Councilor Scarpelli said, the fact that everybody has been showing up every day and doing their job in the face of treatment that they may not have experienced in 10 or 20 years, or even two months.

488
00:38:58,238 --> 00:39:09,062
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care if you're a brand new employee, you're coming to work and you know that you're not getting a raise, or you're brand new to the city and you're being told you're not getting healthcare and you're still coming and doing your job, it's deeply appreciated.

489
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:11,343
[SPEAKER_13]: And it also shows why so many people are leaving

490
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:16,319
[SPEAKER_13]: from all the different positions that you mentioned before.

491
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:21,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had a question on the healthcare piece that was brought up.

492
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you didn't bring it up and it came up here, so no issues if you don't have the answer.

493
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know if every new hire is being told they're not getting healthcare or is it selective?

494
00:39:30,854 --> 00:39:41,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't answer for all the other unions, but I have heard from a couple other unions that have the same exact issue, but I'm not privy to the info for all of the unions, so I don't know.

495
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,670
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is affecting more than one union.

496
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:51,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and that's become very clear to me with the information that I've seen over the last few days, but I also just want to see

497
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:55,520
[SPEAKER_13]: and make sure that it's not selective, if you get what I'm saying.

498
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

499
00:39:56,701 --> 00:39:58,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I can answer that.

500
00:39:58,422 --> 00:39:58,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

501
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that would, you know, just add insult to injury.

502
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:07,851
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in terms of the bargaining sessions, hey, I'd be happy to take you up on your offer to attend one because I'd like to see what it's like.

503
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:13,736
[SPEAKER_13]: But you just want to clarify, you said the only people who talk on the city's behalf are representatives of KP law.

504
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:14,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

505
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:18,258
[SPEAKER_01]: The city doesn't say a word in the meetings.

506
00:40:18,778 --> 00:40:20,078
[SPEAKER_01]: City officials, I should say.

507
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:21,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Nett is a follow up.

508
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:21,598
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right, ma'am.

509
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:23,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Does the mayor show up at these negotiations?

510
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:23,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.

511
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:31,200
[SPEAKER_01]: We've requested, because the KP law attorney states that all of the sessions he has certain authority.

512
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, who provides the authority?

513
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,841
[SPEAKER_01]: He states the mayor.

514
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:41,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've asked on numerous occasions that the mayor show up so that the person that makes the decisions is in the room.

515
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:42,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've declined.

516
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:47,746
[SPEAKER_10]: And pursuant to a city charter, if I'm not mistaken, the mayor is the chief negotiator for the community, right?

517
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:50,349
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my understanding.

518
00:40:50,369 --> 00:41:00,638
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor is the chief negotiator, so ultimately we have five bargaining units with unsettled contracts and the chief negotiator refusing to meet with these five unions and instead sending an underling.

519
00:41:01,098 --> 00:41:05,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It's paid for outside the scope of city employment.

520
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:17,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Knight, we have eight bargaining units, five are in the city, three are on the school side, and my understanding is she's in charge there too, she's the head of the school committee.

521
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:23,643
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, the mayor's never attended any of the sessions for any of the eight bargaining units, ever.

522
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:25,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

523
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:26,606
[SPEAKER_13]: You're very welcome.

524
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:27,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

525
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:31,971
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, Mr. South, if you could just share, I appreciate you offered to share the information on the other contracts.

526
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:37,255
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could share that, and then if you have information on upcoming sessions, I'll try to find one that I could attend.

527
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:38,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate it.

528
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:38,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

529
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Collins.

530
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:42,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Morell.

531
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. South, for being here for tonight and for always keeping us updated.

532
00:41:48,123 --> 00:41:53,828
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, there's a lot that's astonishing in what you shared with us tonight and what you've shared with us over email in recent days.

533
00:41:56,052 --> 00:42:01,073
[SPEAKER_18]: It's hard to even remark on it, but I wanted to just thank the rank and file that you represent for being here.

534
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,574
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your organizing.

535
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:05,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your efforts.

536
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:21,377
[SPEAKER_18]: There's so much to really be astonished by, even though we've heard, I don't even, I'm running out of adjectives to use, you know, the scope of what's being offered to your bargaining units compared to what could be expected to be reasonable or fair.

537
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:24,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Just one thing that's ringing in my head

538
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:33,241
[SPEAKER_18]: 2% with concessions in a climate of six plus percent inflation, it puts me at a loss.

539
00:42:34,122 --> 00:42:44,029
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm glad to see that the rank and file is not willing to accept such an offer.

540
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:51,975
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that one of the exemplars of this, we're actually outsourcing or privatizing the folks who are negotiating with our collective bargaining units.

541
00:42:52,835 --> 00:42:57,858
[SPEAKER_18]: And if there's not a crystallizing example of this problem, if that's not it, I don't know what it is.

542
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:16,228
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a really frustrating time, I think, to be on the city council and have what rounds down to no power over the root causes of this, which is our inability to invest in our city employees the way that they deserve and the way that our city deserves, the way that our residents deserve.

543
00:43:16,248 --> 00:43:19,089
[SPEAKER_18]: I think,

544
00:43:21,102 --> 00:43:29,047
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, this all comes down to will, comes down to the will to invest in our city the way that it serves, and that it comes down to the ability to do that.

545
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:34,431
[SPEAKER_18]: We're talking about the budget, but all of our realm of possibility here flows from that.

546
00:43:34,451 --> 00:43:37,653
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we passed this year's budget on June 28th.

547
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:39,915
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this probably goes for all my fellow councilors.

548
00:43:39,955 --> 00:43:41,776
[SPEAKER_18]: What date did we start worry about our next budget?

549
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:42,736
[SPEAKER_18]: June 29th.

550
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:48,040
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a discouraging time to be in,

551
00:43:48,977 --> 00:44:00,519
[SPEAKER_18]: to be looking at what's going on right now and staring down the barrel of what we're ever going to be able to offer to the folks who make the city work and make the city run next year and the year after that.

552
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:12,821
[SPEAKER_18]: When it comes down to what we're able to offer the city employees, it's not just the work that they do, it's investing in the people themselves.

553
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:18,222
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know how we're going to expect to maintain, let alone improve our city and the experience of our city if we're not

554
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:22,528
[SPEAKER_18]: figuring out how to invest in the people that make that happen.

555
00:44:22,568 --> 00:44:32,315
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to share some of my disbelief over what we are hearing tonight, what we've been hearing, and thank you to all the city employees that are standing up for what you deserve.

556
00:44:32,816 --> 00:44:33,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

557
00:44:33,576 --> 00:44:40,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to point out one other thing when you talk about the city contracting out legal services.

558
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:43,964
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just mention that when we have

559
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:57,676
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere about 40 or a little over 40 separate litigations and all separate arenas and jurisdictions and federal court and the labor board and the secretary of state and all these different places.

560
00:44:58,137 --> 00:45:01,301
[SPEAKER_01]: The only winner in that game of

561
00:45:03,692 --> 00:45:10,255
[SPEAKER_01]: months and months and even years is KP Law getting paid every single day, every single meeting.

562
00:45:10,615 --> 00:45:23,860
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last year, we've had numerous arbitrations, mediations with state mediators, negotiations with all of these different units and meetings and hearings in all different jurisdictions.

563
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:28,002
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the only ones winning in

564
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:31,263
[SPEAKER_01]: in that scenario, and they are.

565
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:45,509
[SPEAKER_01]: In all the other communities that we have any kind of labor relations meetings or negotiations, most of them use their in-house attorneys, including many of the communities I mentioned earlier.

566
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:52,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So you hear the term, follow the money, you hear that a lot, follow the money and where does it lead you?

567
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:57,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only winner in this community, when all of the families of,

568
00:45:58,931 --> 00:46:06,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Your employees and my members are hurting the winners and all of this is KP law, I just wanted to reiterate that because I know all of you know that.

569
00:46:07,438 --> 00:46:07,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

570
00:46:08,238 --> 00:46:19,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go back to Councilor Tseng before that, and then Councilor Caravielloa I do just want to note that we have several items on our agenda and it's, we've been on this for about 15 minutes so I just want to know that this is for back and forth so I appreciate the information but just

571
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:25,784
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Morell, respecting that I'll try to keep it brief.

572
00:46:27,025 --> 00:46:41,896
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to thank you for the information, you know, we always do that when you come, because we, as other Councilors have said, we don't get this information from the administration, oftentimes, when you come to us that's the first time we're hearing of it when you email us that's the first time we're hearing it.

573
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:51,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And when you give us that information, it gives us at the very least a place to start to ask questions and to demand better from from the people across the hall.

574
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:53,782
[SPEAKER_19]: So I really wanted to thank you for that.

575
00:46:54,723 --> 00:47:00,606
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, what you've said is very concerning, not just for us on this side of the aisle, but all the residents at home watching as well.

576
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:04,388
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, what we've been talking about,

577
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:14,886
[SPEAKER_19]: we've been talking about tonight, like health care, like, like, legal bills, you know, fiscal response to questions of fiscal responsibility, all of this is common sense.

578
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:24,171
[SPEAKER_19]: I think all of us sitting in the room here can can can agree that, you know, we shouldn't we shouldn't hire employees and not give them health care.

579
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:24,851
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not right.

580
00:47:25,652 --> 00:47:25,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

581
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:40,491
[SPEAKER_19]: I also want to thank all the workers and the rank and file sitting behind the rail on the other side of the rail tonight for coming out I know you're taking time out of your evening to come to us, taking time out of time with family.

582
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:45,673
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to acknowledge that and to thank you for coming as well.

583
00:47:45,953 --> 00:48:01,917
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really important for members of the community and for us to see you guys as well, and it really helps, you know, show us and show the people at home watching that, you know, we're not talking about an abstract group of people, we're talking about people

584
00:48:02,557 --> 00:48:15,620
[SPEAKER_19]: If we can put faces to the people who actually are keeping our city running and, you know, when we talk about policies and makes recommendations and all of that behind the rail, you guys are the ones that have to go out and execute that, right?

585
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,321
[SPEAKER_19]: And the pressure on your job is just increasing and increasing every day.

586
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:27,763
[SPEAKER_19]: And to have all of this on top of that, you know, that's not right.

587
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:48,382
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to recognize that when we when we deal with each other I mean, even even between Councilors but at all levels in city government and government we have to treat each other like human beings, and we have to understand that you guys have families, you guys have homes to go, go back to people to feed.

588
00:48:50,786 --> 00:48:55,828
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we can talk all day about, you know, all these different concepts, but it's really helpful.

589
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:02,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Or it's, it's really important to understand that you guys are human beings too.

590
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:05,712
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope, I hope this tonight helps with that.

591
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:07,973
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really wanted to thank you for your dedication.

592
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:17,997
[SPEAKER_19]: Despite the lack of morale, all the hard work that you guys are still putting into city work, that's really meaningful and I think shows your dedication to our community.

593
00:49:21,152 --> 00:49:34,298
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a few more points written out, but I think I'll end it there because other Councilors have already pointed out a lot of our problems and a lot of the concerns that we have very eloquently.

594
00:49:34,598 --> 00:49:43,062
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll leave it there, but I just want you guys to know that this council stands with you guys and understands what you've been saying tonight.

595
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:44,523
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

596
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:45,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

597
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:47,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question.

598
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:51,126
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned a $465,000 settlement.

599
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:51,126
$475,000.

600
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:55,648
[SPEAKER_03]: $475,000.

601
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:55,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that a wage settlement for wages?

602
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:56,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

603
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:57,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

604
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And what union was that with?

605
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,751
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the custodians.

606
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Custodians, okay.

607
00:50:03,152 --> 00:50:06,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I did report on that last, I believe, June.

608
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:08,635
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we have a lot of different issues.

609
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:09,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

610
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,217
[SPEAKER_01]: And isn't it the law that we have to provide health insurance?

611
00:50:14,395 --> 00:50:15,516
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my understanding.

612
00:50:15,656 --> 00:50:16,536
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the law, correct?

613
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:17,757
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my understanding.

614
00:50:18,677 --> 00:50:21,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to make sure that I wasn't wrong.

615
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought everyone, over a certain amount of police, they're required to provide health insurance.

616
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:30,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are in violation of the law by not providing these other people with health insurance.

617
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,025
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my understanding.

618
00:50:32,085 --> 00:50:35,346
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work a certain amount of hours, you have to be provided, correct?

619
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:35,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

620
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:37,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

621
00:50:37,527 --> 00:50:37,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

622
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:43,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, I know before, I'd like to move back to the regular order of business.

623
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:44,924
[SPEAKER_08]: made a comment.

624
00:50:44,964 --> 00:50:47,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make sure council president I did talk.

625
00:50:48,226 --> 00:50:59,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we called for a meeting with the school department to work together to see what what the process is with security and how that's going and then looking to see what funding mechanism we need moving forward for support.

626
00:51:00,353 --> 00:51:03,375
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that the council president has been working hard to try to

627
00:51:04,392 --> 00:51:09,196
[SPEAKER_08]: knocked down a meeting with the superintendent, the mayor, the school committee and the city council.

628
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:13,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can work on that, at least work on that piece and to see where we are, where we need to be.

629
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,761
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to give you an update with that.

630
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:17,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm working with vice chair Graham on that.

631
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:17,923
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

632
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:18,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

633
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:21,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I do see Susan, you're on your hand up.

634
00:51:21,305 --> 00:51:24,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it about this subject or another public participation matter?

635
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:26,990
[SPEAKER_04]: You just to

636
00:51:30,575 --> 00:51:37,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm pretty horrified about the treatment of the workers in the city.

637
00:51:38,497 --> 00:51:39,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my name is Susan Gerard.

638
00:51:40,078 --> 00:51:42,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I live on Farragut Ave.

639
00:51:42,818 --> 00:51:50,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lived in Medford for 42 years, and I've also been a union organizer and stood on many picket lines.

640
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:56,582
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really pretty horrified at what's going on with your unions and how they're being treated.

641
00:51:57,842 --> 00:51:59,142
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two questions.

642
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:07,124
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, what can residents do to support you, whether it be a rally, picket line, or whatever?

643
00:52:07,144 --> 00:52:13,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, people have talked about how dedicated you are, and I know you are.

644
00:52:13,546 --> 00:52:20,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same question came up for us as teachers and the teachers union, which I was part of.

645
00:52:21,008 --> 00:52:24,909
[SPEAKER_00]: We never want to go on strike because we do not want to hurt our students.

646
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:31,412
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sometimes when push comes to shove and things are terrible enough, people do go on strike.

647
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:35,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a teacher's union on strike right now, as you know, because of the low pay of some of the workers.

648
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:42,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, A, what can we as residents of Medford do to support you?

649
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:45,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, are you considering strike?

650
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:48,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the chair, I know.

651
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:49,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I can answer that.

652
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:50,963
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could briefly.

653
00:52:51,203 --> 00:52:51,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

654
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:53,064
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't meant to be a forum.

655
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:53,845
[SPEAKER_04]: This is meant to be a

656
00:52:54,357 --> 00:52:54,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

657
00:52:54,937 --> 00:52:57,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Susan, for the questions, and I appreciate the support.

658
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:12,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, we have been engaging in legal, legal, not illegal, legal activities for the past year plus, including picketing, sign holding, leafleting, all different things.

659
00:53:12,805 --> 00:53:14,105
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll continue to do that.

660
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:18,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Month after month, we just had a protest last week with one of the other

661
00:53:20,308 --> 00:53:20,889
[SPEAKER_01]: firefighters.

662
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:27,894
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue to do that, and we would love to have community involvement, so we will put that out publicly for next one.

663
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:35,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as your second question due to legal reasons, I just would prefer not to answer that question.

664
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,643
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say that, uh, we definitely have.

665
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:44,668
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that we're looking at on that are on the table to try to resolve these issues.

666
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,770
[SPEAKER_01]: But that specific question I can't answer.

667
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

668
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:56,860
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by President Bears.

669
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,561
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

670
00:53:57,581 --> 00:53:57,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

671
00:53:58,202 --> 00:53:58,783
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

672
00:53:58,823 --> 00:53:59,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

673
00:54:01,343 --> 00:54:05,086
[SPEAKER_04]: accolades, remembrances, reports and records 23-019 offered by Councilor Knight.

674
00:54:05,147 --> 00:54:21,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it so resolved that Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of Governor's Councilor Michael J. Callahan, a dedicated public servant who passed on January 6th, 2011, following decades of public service to the people of Medford, and be it further resolved that this evening's council meeting be dedicated to his memory.

675
00:54:21,962 --> 00:54:22,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

676
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:24,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

677
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:27,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael Callahan was a dear friend of mine, someone who

678
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:32,024
[SPEAKER_10]: represented the city of Medford and its people with great pride and dignity.

679
00:54:32,744 --> 00:54:38,945
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a Vietnam War veteran, the founder of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission and past commissioner.

680
00:54:39,926 --> 00:54:56,150
[SPEAKER_10]: He was the aide to the late Senator John Bullock, an aide to the late Senator Dennis McKenna, the former assistant commissioner of racing and chief steward for the National Association of Government Employees, just to name a few roles that he helped, Madam President.

681
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:57,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael Callahan was also

682
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:05,514
[SPEAKER_10]: elected our governor's Councilor, and he served with dignity representing the people of this community for over a decade.

683
00:55:06,394 --> 00:55:09,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael passed away on the last day of his term in office.

684
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:11,277
[SPEAKER_10]: He was never able to

685
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:15,639
[SPEAKER_10]: reap the benefits of his pension reward.

686
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,946
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was someone who has some fame here in the city of Medford for saving Wrights Pond.

687
00:55:22,147 --> 00:55:30,397
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you go up to Wrights Pond now, you will see a memorial honoring Michael Callahan that Mayor McGlynn put in to recognize the work that he did.

688
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:38,381
[SPEAKER_10]: back in the late 80s when Medford was undergoing quite a development boom and the condos were being built around the city.

689
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:54,147
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a proposal to turn Wrights Pond into residential housing and Michael Callahan was the catalyst in organizing the neighborhood against this proposal and saving Wrights Pond and keeping it as the beautiful recreation destination that it is today.

690
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:54,667
[SPEAKER_10]: And

691
00:55:56,576 --> 00:56:00,979
[SPEAKER_10]: with his vision and foresight, Wrights Pond is now probably one of the city's number one assets.

692
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, I'd like to take a moment to honor my friend.

693
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:08,185
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that I've put on every year since Michael's passing.

694
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:11,247
[SPEAKER_10]: He's someone that really cared about the city.

695
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,448
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about having blue and white debates.

696
00:56:13,508 --> 00:56:18,392
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about people that step up to the plate and really put their money where their mouth is.

697
00:56:18,412 --> 00:56:19,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mike Callahan was that guy.

698
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:24,671
[SPEAKER_10]: When he ran for State Senate back in 2005, his logo was, he helps people.

699
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:28,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was no more truthful saying than that.

700
00:56:29,214 --> 00:56:30,976
[SPEAKER_10]: My county, I woke up every day to help people.

701
00:56:31,236 --> 00:56:32,757
[SPEAKER_10]: And he took great pride in it.

702
00:56:33,478 --> 00:56:37,001
[SPEAKER_10]: And he always said to me, you could measure your wealth in many ways.

703
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:41,144
[SPEAKER_10]: You could measure it monetarily, or you could measure your wealth in the number of lives that you touch.

704
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:44,347
[SPEAKER_10]: And Michael is just a great individual who touched many lives.

705
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:45,648
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was the wealthiest man.

706
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:47,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

707
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:52,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Mr. Behr.

708
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:52,788
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

709
00:56:52,948 --> 00:56:53,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

710
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:53,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

711
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:54,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

712
00:56:54,569 --> 00:57:11,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

713
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:12,840
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-020 offered by Councilor Knight.

714
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council wish John Granar a happy 80th birthday, Councilor Knight.

715
00:57:18,093 --> 00:57:33,366
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not so often that someone gets to reach the great age of 80 years old, an octogenarian, I believe they're called, Madam President, but John Grenard is someone who is very familiar to all of us who are involved in public life here in the city of Medford.

716
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:38,771
[SPEAKER_10]: John was a former member of the Medford School Committee, a former member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

717
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:43,075
[SPEAKER_10]: John served as the special sheriff

718
00:57:43,904 --> 00:57:46,908
[SPEAKER_10]: to Middlesex County under Sheriff DePaola.

719
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:50,953
[SPEAKER_10]: He has a very, very, very prestigious record

720
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:52,929
[SPEAKER_10]: of public service here in this community.

721
00:57:53,489 --> 00:57:59,931
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the most brilliant men I've ever met in my life when it comes to political analysis and the ability to look at an election.

722
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:19,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Also a great volunteer of his time, service, energy to many neighborhood and community groups here in the city, most notably the Medford Elks, for example, and the American Legion Post 45, where he'd perform countless hours of pro bono legal work for them and making sure that their assets were protected.

723
00:58:20,395 --> 00:58:21,976
[SPEAKER_10]: John's been a great friend to me.

724
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:31,161
[SPEAKER_10]: He's someone who I admire greatly and I'm glad to see that he had the opportunity to celebrate his 80th birthday surrounded by his friends and family.

725
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:39,205
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to take an opportunity just to extend a happy birthday to him and to let him know that he means a lot to the city of Medford still.

726
00:58:39,665 --> 00:58:42,607
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ask my council colleagues to join me in this celebration.

727
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:46,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for counseling.

728
00:58:46,262 --> 00:58:46,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I bring this up.

729
00:58:46,862 --> 00:58:50,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Granada is definitely someone that, um,

730
00:58:51,280 --> 00:59:02,623
[SPEAKER_08]: that anyone can go to, especially in the political field, to talk to him and get the true insight of what the energy is in our community.

731
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:09,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's someone that has that type of knowledge and that type of passion and love for the city of Medford is someone that's so vital to our community.

732
00:59:11,045 --> 00:59:12,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we haven't seen him around much, but

733
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:19,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that he's someone that we should be very proud that we can call him our friend.

734
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:23,671
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wish him a happy birthday and many more.

735
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

736
00:59:24,772 --> 00:59:25,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Fele.

737
00:59:26,553 --> 00:59:30,735
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

738
00:59:31,215 --> 00:59:31,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

739
00:59:31,395 --> 00:59:32,016
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

740
00:59:32,056 --> 00:59:32,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

741
00:59:32,756 --> 00:59:35,498
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-3-0-2-1, offered by Councilor Knight.

742
00:59:35,558 --> 00:59:40,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in honor of the late former Senate President, Thomas Birmingham.

743
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:41,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

744
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:43,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

745
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:50,643
[SPEAKER_10]: When I first got out of college, I had the opportunity to work underneath Senate President Thomas Birmingham in the Massachusetts State Senate.

746
00:59:51,303 --> 00:59:56,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was certainly a brilliant man, a great leader, former candidate for governor as well.

747
00:59:56,868 --> 01:00:05,155
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had a great opportunity to work on his gubernatorial campaign where I got to spend a significant amount of time with him and I learned about what a great person he was.

748
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:11,023
[SPEAKER_10]: raised in the community of Chelsea, representing Revere Charlestown and Chelsea.

749
01:00:11,503 --> 01:00:16,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Thomas Birmingham was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate after defeating, I believe, Reggie Volk.

750
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:20,954
[SPEAKER_10]: And he served in the State Senate admirably, rising to the rank of Senate President.

751
01:00:21,915 --> 01:00:25,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Most notably, he is remembered for the Education Reform Act of 1992.

752
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:37,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Educational Reform Act of 1992 established the standardized testing, standardized measurements of public schools so that we'd be able to identify and compare apples to apples data between school districts.

753
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:41,232
[SPEAKER_10]: It also enacted what's known as the School Building Assistance Program.

754
01:00:41,753 --> 01:00:49,019
[SPEAKER_10]: And the School Building Assistance Program was something that we here in the city of Metric were able to utilize 23 years ago for the construction of other schools in this community.

755
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:54,323
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you talk about Thomas Birmingham, you talk about a gentleman who was surrounded by great help

756
01:00:54,953 --> 01:00:59,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you talk about some of the great help that he was surrounded by, you have to mention on real world.

757
01:01:00,004 --> 01:01:03,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Who serves here on our community development board, we have to.

758
01:01:04,531 --> 01:01:07,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, CBA now, yes, yes, multiple hats.

759
01:01:07,972 --> 01:01:17,155
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about James Francis Xavier Walsh from High Street who worked under the Birmingham campaign and worked under Tom in his office.

760
01:01:17,555 --> 01:01:26,117
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a great mentor and cultivator of great talent and a great individual that really cared about his community in this state and he accomplished a great deal.

761
01:01:26,137 --> 01:01:32,939
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be sad to miss, so I ask my council colleagues to join me in honoring him and extending deepest condolences to Selma and the family.

762
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:41,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you on the motion of Council night seconded by bears all those in favor, I suppose motion passes please rise for more silence.

763
01:01:53,729 --> 01:02:02,296
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-022 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Tom Aniletto on his recent passing.

764
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:08,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom was a longtime Medford business owner, veteran, and disability advocate, being a board member for Project Triangle for over 50 years.

765
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:09,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

766
01:02:10,182 --> 01:02:11,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

767
01:02:12,944 --> 01:02:15,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you most people in the city don't even know who Tom Aniletto is.

768
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:22,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom was a silent giant in this community, especially for children that had disabilities.

769
01:02:22,608 --> 01:02:31,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom had two children that had disabilities, and he served this country as a veteran here, but he was a tireless volunteer in this community.

770
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:47,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people don't know, but back in the 60s, Tom and another person started a program called the Friday Night Program, where they took children with disabilities into their home so the parents could have a Friday night off.

771
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:50,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tom did that for probably 50 years.

772
01:02:52,628 --> 01:02:55,249
[SPEAKER_03]: until these kids got to be like 60.

773
01:02:55,529 --> 01:03:03,371
[SPEAKER_03]: They became older than us, but he was a tireless volunteer in the community, donated to everything.

774
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:06,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he was that go-to guy for whatever he needed.

775
01:03:06,932 --> 01:03:07,773
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted money with something.

776
01:03:08,513 --> 01:03:12,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom gave him money, he didn't never ever look for accolades or anything.

777
01:03:12,174 --> 01:03:15,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Councilman Scott mentioned in the past,

778
01:03:17,075 --> 01:03:21,237
[SPEAKER_03]: When guys like Tom die, nobody is stepping up to fill those shoes.

779
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:26,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tom was a friend and these are a big set of shoes in the city that are gonna need to be filled.

780
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ask for a moment of silence in this passing.

781
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:31,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Capello.

782
01:03:31,181 --> 01:03:31,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

783
01:03:32,122 --> 01:03:33,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

784
01:03:33,382 --> 01:03:36,003
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilor Capello, thanks for putting this item on the agenda.

785
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:38,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I've known Tom for probably 15 years.

786
01:03:38,784 --> 01:03:41,626
[SPEAKER_10]: His nephews, Matt and Joe, I know very well as well.

787
01:03:42,306 --> 01:03:44,607
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is the first time I ever heard that story.

788
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:46,217
[SPEAKER_10]: about the Friday nights.

789
01:03:46,237 --> 01:03:46,697
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.

790
01:03:47,177 --> 01:04:07,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Tom is a great person, a great friend and like Councilor Caraviello said, he was a gentleman, a true gentleman, someone that, um, was bigger than life, but, uh, very quiet, very quiet gentleman, uh, someone that when he spoke, uh, it was with a purpose and, uh, it was usually, uh, to give you the right piece of advice to say the right thing.

791
01:04:07,421 --> 01:04:08,201
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be sadly missed.

792
01:04:08,241 --> 01:04:09,862
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank the council for putting this resolution.

793
01:04:10,482 --> 01:04:11,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

794
01:04:12,396 --> 01:04:15,257
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

795
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:16,078
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

01:04:16,098 --> 01:04:16,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_04]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

800
01:04:30,943 --> 01:04:31,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Records.

801
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:34,805
[SPEAKER_04]: The records of the meeting of the January 17th meeting were passed to Councilor Knight.

802
01:04:34,845 --> 01:04:35,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight, how did you find them?

803
01:04:36,826 --> 01:04:39,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to ask that the records be laid on the table, Madam President.

804
01:04:40,237 --> 01:04:46,161
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to lay the records on the table to the next regular meeting seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

805
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:46,761
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

806
01:04:47,102 --> 01:04:47,862

[SPEAKER_04]: As this notice states, this is a continuation of a public hearing that was held on the 17th.

833
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:27,162
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a presentation from BJ's.

834
01:07:27,182 --> 01:07:28,803
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had it open for public comment.

835
01:07:28,863 --> 01:07:32,625
[SPEAKER_04]: We left the public hearing open for any additional comment to be submitted at that time.

[SPEAKER_04]: I do not believe we received any.

837
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,068
[SPEAKER_04]: We did not receive any additional public comment.

838
01:07:36,248 --> 01:07:42,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go to councilors first if they have any questions or discussion, and then we'll go back to the representative from BJ's.

839
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

840
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

841
01:07:46,336 --> 01:07:50,742
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the representatives BJ's and of course our neighbors.

842
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:57,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that I received multiple phone calls and and the understanding of the process and where we are today.

843
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:01,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's it's a pleasant, um,

844
01:08:02,465 --> 01:08:08,487
[SPEAKER_08]: pleasant response by the BJS team and what was asked for to really support those neighbors.

845
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:23,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was probably the biggest sticking point of what was in the past I know that it was called the flagship store but it sure wasn't shown that way by our neighbors and the

846
01:08:25,286 --> 01:08:34,433
[SPEAKER_08]: the concessions and the understanding of the commitment from BJ's and what really is being put back into our community into the plant to make it look

847
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:38,439
[SPEAKER_08]: very appealing and a welcoming site.

848
01:08:39,139 --> 01:08:57,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything that we asked for in the council, I think that we found a way to capture that, but I know that there were a couple of questions that I know usually Councilor Knight, since we don't have legal representation here, that anything that's permitted stays with the permit, Councilor Knight, is that with the permitting?

849
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:14,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so that was one of the questions I was asked, that if BJs happen to, we don't see it happening, although they'll close, but one of the questions, what happens to that site if BJs does step away?

850
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:19,218
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens to the tanks in the ground, to the environment?

851
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:27,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this permit go with the permittee or does it go with the land?

852
01:09:28,105 --> 01:09:29,186
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the questions.

853
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:37,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other question that came up and it was just passed over a few weeks ago was that back gate.

854
01:09:38,894 --> 01:09:40,155
[SPEAKER_08]: the gate on the Felsway side.

855
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:51,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there was some talk saying that back there was arrangements that that was closed at the end of the evening to stop any traffic coming in from Felsway as people use it as a cut through to come through.

856
01:09:51,704 --> 01:09:57,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So and as I recall, that was one of my jobs as a former employee.

857
01:09:58,309 --> 01:10:02,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that I had to that's when the end of the night if you bring the carts in at the end of the night,

858
01:10:03,293 --> 01:10:11,019
[SPEAKER_08]: the last person would have to go, whoever worked the tire shop, would go and just lock the gate and the first person the next morning would open the gate.

859
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:25,191
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if that's something that is, no one seems to know if it's true or the intent of it, but I know the residents had a question that it really made, whether we see it or not, they saw a big difference, not having that access after hours.

860
01:10:26,212 --> 01:10:30,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that I explained to them that when the delivery trucks come in,

861
01:10:30,855 --> 01:10:37,158
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they responded back by saying but George that question is that there are going to be delivery trucks idling in the parking lot.

862
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:46,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So that shouldn't be an issue so that might be something that just just to look at I know that we've already asked a lot and you've really come back with a lot of great responses and.

863
01:10:47,382 --> 01:11:10,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also had to explain to the residents our situation on the council and why this went to court and why it came back and really give BJs a lot of credit for opening that line of communication again so we can really get the true context back to BJs to say this is what our community really needs to make this work.

864
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:41,564
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and again, the last piece was, I'm sorry for being winded, but these are the phone calls I got, was that the idea of the trees on Woodruff, if they die, and PJ's really put in a statement that says if it's anything to do with snow, they'll replace those ones that have died as they move through, but the other piece is, it is up to the city, and this is, you saw our DPW workers here tonight, and it's gonna be tough for them to do,

865
01:11:42,234 --> 01:11:50,621
[SPEAKER_08]: they're gonna be the ones maintaining that area after BJ has planted and implemented that look.

866
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:52,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that we explained the fencing.

867
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,966
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about the fencing people asked for and the new slats that are going in.

868
01:11:57,046 --> 01:12:06,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know we're gonna see a major change, but what I like and I appreciate is that there is someone identified at BJ's that's going to be working directly for the neighbors.

869
01:12:06,374 --> 01:12:11,038
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I get a phone call from someone on 4th Street and they say, George, this is what's happening,

870
01:12:11,538 --> 01:12:20,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I can directly call to the whether it's the code enforcement officer called directly to the maintenance facilities person to be jays and they can get that response to that resident.

871
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:23,843
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can get that taken care of something that we haven't seen in the past.

872
01:12:23,883 --> 01:12:24,703
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate that.

873
01:12:25,103 --> 01:12:27,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, it's really those three things matter, President.

874
01:12:27,224 --> 01:12:27,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

875
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:28,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Constable.

876
01:12:28,704 --> 01:12:35,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get to attorney off with that question, I do just want to note that the attorney with our thoughts shift did send us another letter during that public comment period representing

877
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:38,371
[SPEAKER_04]: that group of Medford and Wellington area residents.

878
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:40,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I do want to note that I was before.

879
01:12:41,052 --> 01:12:43,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So your first question, Attorney Austin, can you speak to that?

880
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:48,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Would the permit go with the business or the site as is written currently?

881
01:12:49,767 --> 01:12:51,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Madam President.

882
01:12:51,048 --> 01:12:54,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you to members of the council for having me here this evening.

883
01:12:54,931 --> 01:13:07,621
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, Chapter 148, Section 13 does allow that if the license is granted and the property is no longer used for such purposes, then the use shall cease.

884
01:13:08,162 --> 01:13:12,706
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's set forth in the specific statutory language, which is Chapter 148, Section 13.

885
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So a new permit would be needed somewhere else to come into that?

886
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:20,139
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it would depend on the nature.

887
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:23,100
[SPEAKER_16]: A new permit would be needed depends on the nature of the use.

888
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:31,343
[SPEAKER_16]: If the use is abandoned, then essentially it would require the property to be ceased being used for a gas station.

889
01:13:32,643 --> 01:13:39,725
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there's a new individual or entity that comes in, then that would have to be transferred over to the new entity, in my opinion.

890
01:13:44,072 --> 01:13:55,555
[SPEAKER_10]: By way of history, normally what the consul would do is we'd put a restriction on the special permit or a condition on the special permit that would say that the special permit is attached to the business entity and not the address on the permit.

891
01:13:55,715 --> 01:14:01,976
[SPEAKER_10]: So that if that business entity moved on, the permit would move on with the business entity and die.

892
01:14:01,996 --> 01:14:04,177
[SPEAKER_10]: It would have to go back through the application process again.

893
01:14:09,516 --> 01:14:09,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that?

894
01:14:10,236 --> 01:14:14,917
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just explain what I think Councilor Scarpelli was getting at history.

895
01:14:14,957 --> 01:14:16,037
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way we've normally done it.

896
01:14:16,237 --> 01:14:20,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Madam President, just just a point of clarification.

897
01:14:21,738 --> 01:14:26,039
[SPEAKER_16]: There certainly can be conditions in my opinion that the council puts on this permit.

898
01:14:26,779 --> 01:14:35,801
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a slightly different permit as it's specifically designated under that fuel storage license statute chapter 148 section 13.

899
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:37,861
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to be clear about that.

900
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:53,972
[SPEAKER_16]: As you know, other city boards and commissions have already reviewed the other provisions of the BJ's application and certainly BJ's council can speak specifically to any requirements that may exist in those approvals that previously had been granted.

901
01:14:56,307 --> 01:15:04,834
[SPEAKER_08]: But the concert night again, if BJ's would leave in a hundred years, they have to go through the same process, like as we're implementing this process as a restriction.

902
01:15:05,574 --> 01:15:11,019
[SPEAKER_08]: The last piece is, what is the traditional situation when it comes to gas tanks removal?

903
01:15:11,459 --> 01:15:22,287
[SPEAKER_08]: If say BJ's would leave in a hundred years, who for environmental purposes, that was the question I got from someone, are the tanks left abandoned and what harm that would do or

904
01:15:23,556 --> 01:15:34,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something we could implement that if at any time BJ's does close their doors and abandon that site that the tanks have to be taken up?

905
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:36,602
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the question.

906
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:39,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Through you Madam President.

907
01:15:40,764 --> 01:15:40,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Please.

908
01:15:42,465 --> 01:15:52,890
[SPEAKER_16]: The holder of the license under chapter 140 section 13 has to within three weeks after they cease using the property for such purposes,

909
01:15:53,362 --> 01:15:59,566
[SPEAKER_16]: has to eliminate all hazardous conditions using incident to such cessation.

910
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:22,203
[SPEAKER_16]: So essentially, there is a process set forth in the statute, given that it involves environmental considerations and other public safety considerations specifically requiring removal, in my opinion, within three weeks after the cessation is eliminated, along with any other applicable legal requirements that may be set forth by DEP, for instance.

911
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,553
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is specifically set forth in the statute.

912
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:26,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

913
01:16:27,073 --> 01:16:27,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

914
01:16:27,974 --> 01:16:29,174
[SPEAKER_08]: That answers most of the questions.

915
01:16:29,894 --> 01:16:31,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

916
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:34,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a question about the gate, they have a gate if you know that.

917
01:16:34,396 --> 01:16:44,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean you can get back to us and just I think that was one of those are the three questions that I did get phone calls from neighbors that, and I explained, shared your information so I really appreciate that.

918
01:16:46,113 --> 01:16:55,059
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the gate for some reason, especially for the older ones that remember when it first opened, that that was part of the negotiations they sat with and keeping that open.

919
01:16:55,179 --> 01:16:57,261
[SPEAKER_08]: But after business hours, they would close that.

920
01:16:57,621 --> 01:16:58,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

921
01:16:58,482 --> 01:16:59,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the question.

922
01:16:59,322 --> 01:17:00,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing our best.

923
01:17:00,363 --> 01:17:02,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Patrick.

924
01:17:02,865 --> 01:17:03,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the director of real estate.

925
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:04,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your question.

926
01:17:05,576 --> 01:17:12,541
[SPEAKER_07]: we're doing our best to keep our facility away from the front side of the site and the residential side of the site, not having that back gate open.

927
01:17:13,002 --> 01:17:15,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't a part of that discussion back whenever it was approved.

928
01:17:16,464 --> 01:17:22,269
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my opinion, critical to keeping the service side on the service side and the residential side on the residential side.

929
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:25,311
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be if we closed it off, we'd have to bring trucks into the front.

930
01:17:25,511 --> 01:17:28,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that's just more, I think, disruption in my opinion.

931
01:17:28,814 --> 01:17:30,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was the question they had.

932
01:17:31,099 --> 01:17:31,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I told them.

933
01:17:31,959 --> 01:17:33,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I shared that with them about the trucks coming in.

934
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:42,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I also shared that you've already hired a towing company, a contract with a towing company, that any truck that's not supposed to be there is being towed out.

935
01:17:42,982 --> 01:17:49,464
[SPEAKER_08]: So we also appreciate the sweeping trucks after 11 o'clock, that that's been in place.

936
01:17:49,544 --> 01:17:51,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that was a point of contention in the past.

937
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:59,427
[SPEAKER_08]: So we see a lot of movement, but again, I think that's just clarification on the gate, was that if that's the question, if that's the concern,

938
01:17:59,847 --> 01:18:01,748
[SPEAKER_08]: at the end of the night keeping the trucks away.

939
01:18:02,948 --> 01:18:10,350
[SPEAKER_08]: The question there was, well, George, why is that a problem if it's after hours and the trucks out there coming in anyway?

940
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:26,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So that kind of makes sense in the sense if they can't, if there are no trucks coming there, why not close that for, and what they're seeing is the vehicular traffic that's coming down there and causing the speeding or using the cutthroat to get to Wendy's or

941
01:18:27,349 --> 01:18:35,030
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so that's their concern that in the middle of the night, those houses that have bought the drive on the side, that's where the hair and the, you know, the engines.

942
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:45,366
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so that's, and I think that a lot, it's going to help with those months with the race, the speed bumps that we're putting in for those months.

943
01:18:45,406 --> 01:18:50,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's going to help a lot because I know we hope there's not going to be much speeding in the winter months.

944
01:18:50,988 --> 01:18:56,411
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but if people want to be racing their cars usually during the spring and the summer.

945
01:18:56,771 --> 01:19:01,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And we understand, but I think that's what clarification with the residents and I appreciate your time.

946
01:19:02,894 --> 01:19:06,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the attorney of KP Law for answering those, Madam President.

947
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:07,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

948
01:19:07,796 --> 01:19:08,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

949
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:11,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli for answering, asking so many questions I was going to ask.

950
01:19:13,138 --> 01:19:25,743
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had one question on the landscaping condition, specifically as relates to the offering to replace landscaping if it dies of natural causes.

951
01:19:25,823 --> 01:19:26,783
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's number seven.

952
01:19:30,296 --> 01:19:35,218
[SPEAKER_13]: It says, not because of snowplow or other inflicted harm caused by the cities or other third parties.

953
01:19:35,578 --> 01:19:42,762
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to kind of determine what that means so we're all on the same page.

954
01:19:42,842 --> 01:19:52,566
[SPEAKER_13]: When I see by snowplow, are you saying that if snow or ice is put on that landscaping and it causes it to have damage, that would not be replaced?

955
01:19:52,706 --> 01:19:56,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Or are you saying that if it's hit with a snowplow, that's what would not be replaced?

956
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:01,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Your mic is also off, sorry.

957
01:20:01,378 --> 01:20:04,419
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you could get the little person talking.

958
01:20:04,579 --> 01:20:05,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

959
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:20,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a landscape architect, but just common sense would dictate to me that if the city were to unfortunately plow snow on top of the nice plants that we just planted on there, a foot or two or three of snow, that those plants will die or may die.

960
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:29,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's the case, that doesn't really seem fair to me to have that happen over and over and over again with a provision

961
01:20:29,922 --> 01:20:33,105
[SPEAKER_07]: and a stipulation of approval that we would just replace it.

962
01:20:33,565 --> 01:20:38,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's a situation, sir, of wanting to encourage good behavior on everyone's part.

963
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,373
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how I look at it in plain English.

964
01:20:42,313 --> 01:20:48,980
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I just may say, and I'm happy to, Councilor has a follow up, I'm happy to defer to him in just a second.

965
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,282
[SPEAKER_13]: We contract out snow plowing.

966
01:20:51,822 --> 01:20:53,284
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not the same person who does

967
01:20:54,231 --> 01:20:57,052
[SPEAKER_13]: that street every snowstorm, nevermind every year.

968
01:20:58,052 --> 01:20:59,752
[SPEAKER_13]: We may need some mulligans in here.

969
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,213
[SPEAKER_13]: We may need a mulligan in here.

970
01:21:02,273 --> 01:21:04,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying, you know, this is basically a one and done.

971
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:07,994
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not saying every year we'd make the same mistake and you keep replacing it.

972
01:21:08,014 --> 01:21:09,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that's fair to you.

973
01:21:09,255 --> 01:21:10,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I completely understand that.

974
01:21:10,895 --> 01:21:18,277
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, there may just be a little more communication needed there because someone could make a mistake at some point.

975
01:21:18,897 --> 01:21:22,318
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to kind of maybe, you know,

976
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:29,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I count for that in some way, but I'll defer to Councilor Knight's follow up.

977
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:32,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, what?

978
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,500
[SPEAKER_07]: This is on Woodruff.

979
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:51,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to answer your question as the drafter of this, when I drafted it, what I was envisioning was if a third party or a city truck were to knock over a bunch of trees, and it happens repetitively, there comes a point.

980
01:21:52,842 --> 01:21:53,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Trees are gonna get planted.

981
01:21:54,183 --> 01:21:56,145
[SPEAKER_07]: If they die, we're gonna replace them.

982
01:21:56,526 --> 01:22:01,310
[SPEAKER_07]: We just didn't want to, as Commissioner Travers said, encourage bad behavior.

983
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,753
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I didn't say my name, Attorney Dennis McKenna.

984
01:22:04,874 --> 01:22:10,659
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was the intent, just not to encourage repetitive behavior.

985
01:22:12,221 --> 01:22:14,844
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not suggesting that anyone's gonna do anything on purpose.

986
01:22:15,573 --> 01:22:19,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And the goal here is a beautiful screen that's going to be there, hopefully in perpetuity.

987
01:22:20,695 --> 01:22:21,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the plan.

988
01:22:21,415 --> 01:22:30,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Could we insert the word repeatedly in there somewhere just so that it's clear that it's not just a, you know, and I'm not trying to, you know, you could, no offense, but maybe the parties are completely different when this happens.

989
01:22:31,299 --> 01:22:33,440
[SPEAKER_13]: And no one has an understanding of this conversation.

990
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure our intent is met.

991
01:22:35,721 --> 01:22:39,803
[SPEAKER_07]: you've extended the arm of trust, and I think we'll do the same with you on this.

992
01:22:39,823 --> 01:22:41,304
[SPEAKER_07]: We've opened up the communication lines.

993
01:22:41,344 --> 01:22:47,526
[SPEAKER_07]: We provided you all with our regional business manager, who, again, I said, has budget authority to make decisions.

994
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:53,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can trust you that you will not destroy our plants over and over again.

995
01:22:53,789 --> 01:22:57,911
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll trust us that if you make a mistake, that we will fix it.

996
01:22:58,051 --> 01:23:01,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there's a plant or two that dies five years from now because someone happens to

997
01:23:02,361 --> 01:23:05,702
[SPEAKER_07]: put some more snow on it than it should have, then we can fix it.

998
01:23:05,922 --> 01:23:06,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

999
01:23:06,562 --> 01:23:11,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And council, we have provided the conditions in electronic form to your council.

1000
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:17,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So if that is some wording you can add it in there and we'll live by it with that understanding.

1001
01:23:17,724 --> 01:23:17,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1002
01:23:18,124 --> 01:23:18,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1003
01:23:18,264 --> 01:23:22,545
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what, you know, I'm not trying to box you into anything and I'm not saying you're trying to box us into anything.

1004
01:23:22,585 --> 01:23:24,445
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure we have a shared clear intent.

1005
01:23:25,065 --> 01:23:26,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I think reasonable minds can prevent.

1006
01:23:26,785 --> 01:23:27,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1007
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:30,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do have those conditions in front of me if we want them read at any point.

1008
01:23:31,936 --> 01:23:32,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1009
01:23:32,917 --> 01:23:34,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1010
01:23:34,317 --> 01:23:41,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, ultimately, I think it's safe to say right that this isn't a project that any of this behind the rail were crazy about from the start, right?

1011
01:23:42,262 --> 01:23:43,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, that's why we went to court.

1012
01:23:44,243 --> 01:23:44,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1013
01:23:45,223 --> 01:23:47,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, our recourse is very limited legally.

1014
01:23:48,105 --> 01:23:51,347
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's why the judge remanded the case back to us.

1015
01:23:52,187 --> 01:23:59,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, ultimately, what we're being asked to do is approve a storage tank, a flammable gas, flammable liquid storage tank, right?

1016
01:24:00,692 --> 01:24:00,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And

1017
01:24:01,612 --> 01:24:05,696
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a by right, it's a by right application.

1018
01:24:06,317 --> 01:24:07,498
[SPEAKER_10]: It just requires a special permit.

1019
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:17,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Virtually every city board that had this application before we received it, signed off on it in one way, shape or form.

1020
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:21,473
[SPEAKER_10]: So our request was very limited from the staff.

1021
01:24:23,053 --> 01:24:28,775
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we look at this, the only body here in the community that said no was the city council.

1022
01:24:29,055 --> 01:24:37,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Every other body negotiated some sort of condition or restriction or compromise solution.

1023
01:24:37,258 --> 01:24:38,778
[SPEAKER_10]: And the council dug its heels and it said no.

1024
01:24:39,499 --> 01:24:40,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And we lost.

1025
01:24:41,296 --> 01:24:55,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so now we're in the position where, although it's not necessarily a project that many of us were crazy about, it's the project that by right can be there and it's the project that by right we're going to get, in my opinion, after we take this vote this evening.

1026
01:24:56,536 --> 01:24:58,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that BJ's has come up and they've, you know,

1027
01:24:59,842 --> 01:25:02,823
[SPEAKER_10]: done a mea culpa on some of the bad neighbor issues.

1028
01:25:03,783 --> 01:25:20,788
[SPEAKER_10]: They've certainly been very forthright in their willingness to add additional conditions and restrictions and requirements that we're looking for to make us a little bit happier with the proposed use and the impacts and effects that it's going to have on the neighborhood.

1029
01:25:21,829 --> 01:25:32,236
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, I think that the process has been a long and arduous one, and I'm glad that at the end of the day, we can come to some sort of agreement that protects both parties' interests.

1030
01:25:33,377 --> 01:25:39,502
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, Madam President, I support the paper this evening, and I hope we can move for a vote, for a favorable vote in short order.

1031
01:25:40,442 --> 01:25:41,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1032
01:25:41,563 --> 01:25:42,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

1033
01:25:42,884 --> 01:25:43,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

1034
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:48,248
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could refresh my memory again on the, I think I asked you about the traffic patent.

1035
01:25:48,802 --> 01:25:50,684
[SPEAKER_03]: for when they were gassing up.

1036
01:25:51,145 --> 01:25:55,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say that there'll be no traffic going out to Middlesex Avenue?

1037
01:25:55,370 --> 01:26:01,316
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have to refresh me on your question specifically.

1038
01:26:02,258 --> 01:26:03,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Not directly.

1039
01:26:03,179 --> 01:26:05,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I think your question was on the queuing up.

1040
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:11,718
[SPEAKER_03]: The queuing up of gazeta.

1041
01:26:12,258 --> 01:26:14,700
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all inside the property.

1042
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:18,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only inside the property, it's designed to be inside the gas station area.

1043
01:26:18,824 --> 01:26:23,828
[SPEAKER_07]: The numbers that the engineer was talking about, I'll have him up again to give you the numbers.

1044
01:26:24,489 --> 01:26:28,212
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all inside the area, not even on the site drive.

1045
01:26:28,252 --> 01:26:31,915
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all designed to be held inside the gas station area.

1046
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:39,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the people turn into the property from Middlesex Avenue, they'll go down and then turn into the gas tank?

1047
01:26:40,388 --> 01:26:40,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1048
01:26:57,497 --> 01:27:21,907
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, Austin Turner with Bowler, to answer your question, it was 40 plus vehicles was our calculation on the queue, and they were entirely contained within the fueling facility itself, not queuing onto the exit driveway or the entering driveway, as the case may be, but self-contained in that fueling facility itself and not having any spillover into the driveway, left alone, so we weren't impeding operations to the rest of the facility.

1049
01:27:23,255 --> 01:27:27,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I had mentioned that, you know, I've gotten gas at the Estonian facility before.

1050
01:27:29,637 --> 01:27:34,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been times where the line goes right out onto the street.

1051
01:27:35,739 --> 01:27:44,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, and I think part of the problem is, you know, some gas station on the left, some on the right, and people get angry.

1052
01:27:44,741 --> 01:27:47,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been, I saw little scuffles there because,

1053
01:27:48,905 --> 01:27:50,146
[SPEAKER_03]: no one knows what side they're going.

1054
01:27:50,907 --> 01:28:08,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I would ask that if the queue gets too big, if the person that's in the little house there, if he can come out and help guide the cars into where there's an open spot, it would be a great help because a lot of times that's why the cars queue up so big is because

1055
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:12,240
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't know what side to go on.

1056
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, it's an excellent point in consideration of that.

1057
01:28:15,463 --> 01:28:19,306
[SPEAKER_09]: One that's part of the reason why the attendant in that kiosk is there is to help facilitate traffic.

1058
01:28:19,326 --> 01:28:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I get gas to store them, they don't do it there, and they should be doing it there too.

1059
01:28:25,371 --> 01:28:26,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.

1060
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:27,372
[SPEAKER_03]: One last question.

1061
01:28:27,753 --> 01:28:28,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about the trees.

1062
01:28:29,154 --> 01:28:30,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we buying mature trees?

1063
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:33,747
[SPEAKER_03]: The trees that are planted, are they going to be mature trees though?

1064
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:34,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to be?

1065
01:28:34,387 --> 01:28:38,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they'll still have some growth potential, but the intent is that they're not going to be.

1066
01:28:38,309 --> 01:28:39,970
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to be little twiggy trees.

1067
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:41,571
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to be little twiggy trees, no.

1068
01:28:41,631 --> 01:28:44,873
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be fairly substantial with some additional growth potential.

1069
01:28:44,893 --> 01:28:50,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So they won't be fully mature height, but the trees that we've selected are aggressively growing.

1070
01:28:50,495 --> 01:28:55,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, some of those evergreen trees have the potential to grow multiple feet a year.

1071
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:57,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1072
01:28:57,159 --> 01:28:57,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1073
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

1074
01:29:00,327 --> 01:29:01,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Morell.

1075
01:29:02,249 --> 01:29:06,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you to all BJA's representatives for joining us again in the chambers.

1076
01:29:08,133 --> 01:29:19,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to pick up on the thread that Councilor Knight was speaking to, for the benefit of residents that are observing this process, ultimately this is a permit that is allowed by right.

1077
01:29:19,703 --> 01:29:21,844
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't on the council when this process began.

1078
01:29:21,905 --> 01:29:28,470
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's, as it's been stated, it's no secret that this was a project that not everybody on this council was convinced was needed.

1079
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:30,552
[SPEAKER_18]: here in Medford but it's a by right project.

1080
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:43,502
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really grateful for this process that's allowed us to get clarity on hearing from residents, knowing exactly what neighbors want to see from this space in order to, you know, see that reciprocal relationship more fully.

1081
01:29:44,450 --> 01:30:02,315
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, through this process, I think we've been able to arrive at a package of conditions that can address specific things that the abutting neighbors need to see to get to specific outcomes that will help us be as as neighborly as possible as possible when this gas station goes into operation.

1082
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:15,736
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, and really attach that as a condition to the permit, not a handshake deal something that we can continue, make sure is followed up on and make sure that this relationship is as good as possible for the people that will affect most directly, the butters.

1083
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:29,549
[SPEAKER_18]: your willingness to engage in this process and really deeply appreciate all of the constituents that reached out to us during this process on both sides of the issue.

1084
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:33,713
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think what's before us is kind of a best case scenario for this going forward.

1085
01:30:34,173 --> 01:30:35,834
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll be supporting this this evening.

1086
01:30:35,894 --> 01:30:36,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1087
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1088
01:30:38,321 --> 01:30:38,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

1089
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:40,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Morell.

1090
01:30:40,722 --> 01:30:42,103
[SPEAKER_19]: I promise, President, I'll keep it brief.

1091
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,646
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to reiterate some points from last week.

1092
01:30:46,766 --> 01:30:54,291
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I think, as Councilor Knight said, this isn't necessarily the ideal outcome for all councilors and

1093
01:30:54,731 --> 01:31:13,639
[SPEAKER_19]: We've throughout the whole process have had our fair share of concerns about this but we really appreciate all the work that you guys have put into it, all the work that we are lawyers put into it to create a deal that, as Councilors are probably really highlighted I think has some benefits to our, to our residents.

1094
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,481
[SPEAKER_19]: And I hope that this is the start of a.

1095
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:22,723
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to make those points and to thank you guys for coming to these meetings and for negotiating good things

1096
01:31:47,023 --> 01:31:48,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1097
01:31:48,944 --> 01:31:52,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to move to approve the license with the following conditions.

1098
01:31:52,805 --> 01:31:59,027
[SPEAKER_13]: One, that BJ's will implement an advanced maintenance program, which will consist of weekly parking lot sweeping and day porter service three days a week.

1099
01:31:59,248 --> 01:31:59,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I stop you?

1100
01:31:59,788 --> 01:32:00,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you reading the email?

1101
01:32:00,988 --> 01:32:01,248
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

1102
01:32:01,468 --> 01:32:02,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1103
01:32:03,129 --> 01:32:09,051
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the conditions that were presented after our last meeting, just to make it clear that President Bears isn't just announcing his own conditions.

1104
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:11,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you want to read them.

1105
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:12,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like a fact checker.

1106
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:16,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to read over?

1107
01:32:17,277 --> 01:32:17,597
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1108
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:23,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to motion to approve based on the conditions that were presented to us from Attorney Austin based on our previous meeting?

1109
01:32:23,566 --> 01:32:24,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1110
01:32:29,485 --> 01:32:30,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to do that.

1111
01:32:30,846 --> 01:32:31,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm willing to hold off.

1112
01:32:31,806 --> 01:32:32,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so we'll hold off on that.

1113
01:32:32,986 --> 01:32:42,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to be clear as well, we did have folks speaking at the last meeting in favor and opposed to this paper, but I do want to open it up once more for any additional comments from residents.

1114
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:44,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I have just one quick question.

1115
01:32:45,331 --> 01:32:46,412
[SPEAKER_03]: When is this project going to start?

1116
01:32:46,432 --> 01:32:49,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a start date?

1117
01:32:53,354 --> 01:32:55,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And when is the landscaping going to start?

1118
01:32:58,183 --> 01:33:02,527
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thank you.

1119
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:05,511
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1120
01:33:07,433 --> 01:33:09,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's anyone else would like to speak about the.

1121
01:33:10,736 --> 01:33:13,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Position before us, please come up to the mic.

1122
01:33:15,201 --> 01:33:16,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Just name and address for the record, please.

1123
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:19,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave, Medford.

1124
01:33:21,331 --> 01:33:22,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this idea.

1125
01:33:22,552 --> 01:33:29,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a loyal BJ's customer in the fact that your gas is cheap, it works, it gets me to work back and forth.

1126
01:33:30,275 --> 01:33:33,876
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've already talked tonight about the conditions of the economy, right?

1127
01:33:33,896 --> 01:33:37,577
[SPEAKER_11]: 6% inflation is not what it really is with gas compared to last year.

1128
01:33:38,358 --> 01:33:46,881
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a parent, this is a great idea and it saves me a trip from going to Stoneham and back every time I wanna go fill up my gas tank, because you guys have the best prices in the area.

1129
01:33:47,701 --> 01:33:57,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that there's concerns for the residents in the neighborhood and at the same time, I live right in the corner of Lucas street where there was a lot of development forced down our throats.

1130
01:33:58,023 --> 01:34:02,764
[SPEAKER_11]: So the fact that you guys been able to help work out something that's mutually mutually beneficial.

1131
01:34:02,784 --> 01:34:05,525
[SPEAKER_11]: It will actually benefit the community.

1132
01:34:06,145 --> 01:34:07,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I applaud you for that.

1133
01:34:07,345 --> 01:34:11,226
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you Councilors, because we need some more commercial business in the city.

1134
01:34:12,059 --> 01:34:12,639
[SPEAKER_11]: We really do.

1135
01:34:13,259 --> 01:34:22,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Residential side is good, but anything we can do to help support commercial business and also people live in Malden, people live in surrounding communities, they will come to BJ's to go get gas.

1136
01:34:23,743 --> 01:34:26,344
[SPEAKER_11]: They will help bring money into our economy.

1137
01:34:27,384 --> 01:34:28,365
[SPEAKER_11]: So I fully support this.

1138
01:34:28,525 --> 01:34:28,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1139
01:34:30,725 --> 01:34:31,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1140
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:34,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else who wishes to speak, please come up to the mic.

1141
01:34:36,907 --> 01:34:37,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record.

1142
01:34:38,573 --> 01:34:40,074
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Mr. Wood, John Wood.

1143
01:34:40,114 --> 01:34:42,575
[SPEAKER_21]: I live at 44 Woodruff Avenue in Medford.

1144
01:34:44,336 --> 01:34:47,898
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was there when BJ's first started opened up, okay?

1145
01:34:49,459 --> 01:34:51,600
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm gonna be honest with you.

1146
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:59,404
[SPEAKER_21]: I know exactly when they put support defense is on Middlesex Avenue, okay?

1147
01:35:00,545 --> 01:35:01,365
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Fellsway.

1148
01:35:02,286 --> 01:35:07,649
[SPEAKER_21]: But every three years, there's a new management comes in

1149
01:35:10,028 --> 01:35:12,630
[SPEAKER_21]: doesn't do anything, okay?

1150
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:21,536
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I've been coming, I've been living in Medford for 41 years, and I've seen trucks pop there at nighttime.

1151
01:35:22,937 --> 01:35:23,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Used to be a fence there.

1152
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:27,901
[SPEAKER_21]: But when the first owner was there, he used to do that.

1153
01:35:28,381 --> 01:35:33,905
[SPEAKER_21]: But then when there was another management came in, it just went out, okay?

1154
01:35:34,866 --> 01:35:38,368
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, I live right across from the transportation,

1155
01:35:38,809 --> 01:35:41,250
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a transmission plant, okay?

1156
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:43,591
[SPEAKER_21]: They put trees along the bushes.

1157
01:35:45,012 --> 01:35:49,914
[SPEAKER_21]: They even put the bushes to cover the fence so that you don't see the electric plant, okay?

1158
01:35:50,594 --> 01:35:52,154
[SPEAKER_21]: On towards Middlesex Avenue.

1159
01:35:53,895 --> 01:35:56,416
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna ask you, I don't know what kind of trees you're gonna put there.

1160
01:35:56,476 --> 01:36:00,178
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope you're not gonna put the trees that are gonna cover the fence or the wall.

1161
01:36:01,038 --> 01:36:07,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the reason why I'm saying this, towards Middlesex Avenue, they had trees.

1162
01:36:08,543 --> 01:36:11,804
[SPEAKER_21]: and people were throwing tires behind the trees.

1163
01:36:13,204 --> 01:36:18,366
[SPEAKER_21]: I found a microwave oven.

1164
01:36:18,466 --> 01:36:20,486
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know who had to clean it up?

1165
01:36:20,626 --> 01:36:22,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Was the electric plant had to clean up.

1166
01:36:23,467 --> 01:36:31,229
[SPEAKER_21]: And I told a guy, Senator, can you just bring the trees up, cut the bottom, and just, and then that never happened anymore.

1167
01:36:31,249 --> 01:36:34,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Another thing too, I call this,

1168
01:36:37,733 --> 01:36:40,795
[SPEAKER_21]: I went to BJ's and I asked BJ's, can I ask you a question?

1169
01:36:41,816 --> 01:36:44,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Who owns the property on Woodruff Avenue?

1170
01:36:45,178 --> 01:36:46,739
[SPEAKER_21]: They say the city of Medford.

1171
01:36:47,519 --> 01:36:53,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so I called DPW, there was dead trees, okay.

1172
01:36:54,284 --> 01:36:58,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, you're gonna laugh at this, I never could believe this, I hate to say this.

1173
01:36:59,807 --> 01:37:02,189
[SPEAKER_21]: I called DPW, okay, we'll put you down.

1174
01:37:02,209 --> 01:37:03,810
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, okay.

1175
01:37:04,956 --> 01:37:09,098
[SPEAKER_21]: One year goes by, two years go by, three years go by.

1176
01:37:10,338 --> 01:37:13,000
[SPEAKER_21]: So then I said, I'm gonna call the mayor's office.

1177
01:37:15,081 --> 01:37:16,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Call the mayor's office, secretary call.

1178
01:37:17,101 --> 01:37:22,464
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, listen, this has been dead trees for three years now, and this is going on four years?

1179
01:37:24,185 --> 01:37:24,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Never heard nothing.

1180
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:28,066
[SPEAKER_21]: One year goes by, two years.

1181
01:37:28,086 --> 01:37:29,427
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's five years now.

1182
01:37:31,407 --> 01:37:32,628
[SPEAKER_21]: And I said, this is ridiculous.

1183
01:37:32,748 --> 01:37:35,809
[SPEAKER_21]: I says, you know, I live on this street, I'm paying taxes.

1184
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:40,691
[SPEAKER_21]: They passed a buck, BJ's passed a buck and the city of Medford passed a buck.

1185
01:37:40,811 --> 01:37:43,333
[SPEAKER_21]: So now I found out who owns the property.

1186
01:37:44,193 --> 01:37:51,356
[SPEAKER_21]: Then I'm thinking it's gotta be the city of Medford because I had the hydrant in front of my house and they put it across the street.

1187
01:37:51,396 --> 01:37:52,817
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's gotta be the city of Medford.

1188
01:37:54,478 --> 01:37:54,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1189
01:37:56,148 --> 01:37:59,711
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, every night I go by there, it's dark.

1190
01:38:00,471 --> 01:38:03,233
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like cars parked, God knows what they do.

1191
01:38:04,594 --> 01:38:08,217
[SPEAKER_21]: But I call it police, nothing happens.

1192
01:38:09,057 --> 01:38:17,724
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just hoping that you people keep the truth because I'm gonna be honest with you, even if you put the gas station,

1193
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:22,921
[SPEAKER_21]: where on towards Middlesex Avenue, you can have a lot of traffic.

1194
01:38:23,741 --> 01:38:25,703
[SPEAKER_21]: I even asked them to put a light.

1195
01:38:25,723 --> 01:38:35,670
[SPEAKER_21]: There's been accident on Middlesex Avenue because you got cars coming out of the car wash, you got car coming out of the gas station, mobile gas station, and then you got cars coming straight ahead.

1196
01:38:37,552 --> 01:38:38,693
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, this is ridiculous.

1197
01:38:38,873 --> 01:38:40,714
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there's gotta be, something's gotta happen.

1198
01:38:40,754 --> 01:38:45,458
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there's been four accidents already on that street, okay?

1199
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,882
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I even called the city of Medford.

1200
01:38:48,922 --> 01:38:50,124
[SPEAKER_21]: There was an accident there.

1201
01:38:50,204 --> 01:38:52,026
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you got to call the state police.

1202
01:38:52,106 --> 01:38:53,967
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not up the jurisdiction.

1203
01:38:54,808 --> 01:38:56,750
[SPEAKER_21]: I says, yeah, there's a guy's hurt.

1204
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:57,791
[SPEAKER_21]: I says, I understand.

1205
01:38:58,632 --> 01:38:59,893
[SPEAKER_21]: But can't you call for me?

1206
01:39:00,094 --> 01:39:01,655
[SPEAKER_21]: They finally did.

1207
01:39:02,096 --> 01:39:03,737
[SPEAKER_21]: They called the state police.

1208
01:39:04,378 --> 01:39:06,080
[SPEAKER_21]: And all of a sudden, the Medford police come.

1209
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,961
[SPEAKER_21]: And I said to the Medford police, why are you here?

1210
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:10,304
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, you told me that you don't have the jurisdiction.

1211
01:39:11,383 --> 01:39:15,405
[SPEAKER_21]: So, BJ's on Middlesex Avenue is horrendous.

1212
01:39:15,425 --> 01:39:19,948
[SPEAKER_21]: The traffic is, I don't know what I'm gonna tell you.

1213
01:39:19,988 --> 01:39:21,889
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think it's gonna work, I'll be honest with you.

1214
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:24,891
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, how, can I ask you a question?

1215
01:39:25,531 --> 01:39:32,315
[SPEAKER_21]: When you go into Middlesex Avenue, the way it is right now, you take a left, okay?

1216
01:39:32,395 --> 01:39:36,037
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you come out on Malden, you take a right.

1217
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:38,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, if you're gonna put the gas station there,

1218
01:39:39,207 --> 01:39:42,608
[SPEAKER_21]: where's the exit, where's the people gonna be going into the gas station?

1219
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:48,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1220
01:39:58,472 --> 01:39:59,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, where's the gas station gonna be?

1221
01:39:59,913 --> 01:40:04,474
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it gonna be towards to the right where that empty lot is, towards where the electric plant is?

1222
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:10,476
[SPEAKER_21]: or the windy side?

1223
01:40:11,376 --> 01:40:15,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, because I hope you're not going to put an opening on Woodruff Avenue.

1224
01:40:18,642 --> 01:40:32,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Part of the conditions is actually to narrow the size of the opening to make it safer and to make street improvements, as well as to monitor the lot to make sure that there aren't trucks and people sitting in the lot at night, and to improve the tree maintenance along all of Woodruff Avenue.

1225
01:40:32,654 --> 01:40:33,635
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, can I ask you a question?

1226
01:40:33,715 --> 01:40:37,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Can they put lights on Middlesex Avenue?

1227
01:40:39,613 --> 01:40:42,174
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I've been hearing the same thing as state police.

1228
01:40:42,674 --> 01:40:43,034
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that.

1229
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:04,599
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I live on Woodruff and I have to watch Tiki Island, gotta watch the gas station.

1230
01:41:05,652 --> 01:41:09,293
[SPEAKER_21]: and I got to watch people on VJs.

1231
01:41:10,554 --> 01:41:14,415
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm sitting there for 10 to 15 minutes and that's ridiculous.

1232
01:41:15,755 --> 01:41:18,276
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I don't know what to tell you.

1233
01:41:18,296 --> 01:41:27,839
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, to me, I really don't want the gas station because I'll tell you right, the reason why, because of electric plant.

1234
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,260
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, things do happen.

1235
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:33,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Things do happen.

1236
01:41:33,501 --> 01:41:33,721
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean,

1237
01:41:34,902 --> 01:41:39,704
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm glad you answered Matt because that one of the question I was going to ask you about what happens if BJ's closed.

1238
01:41:40,364 --> 01:41:44,946
[SPEAKER_21]: What is going to happen in that in, but, but you answered my question so that's was one of them.

1239
01:41:45,747 --> 01:41:47,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Then my next question is the trees.

1240
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:48,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1241
01:41:50,489 --> 01:41:57,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Is the city of Medford got to take care of the trees like when they get tall and they hit the wires, do they take care of that.

1242
01:42:06,567 --> 01:42:07,608
We'll work together.

1243
01:42:07,648 --> 01:42:11,231
Like I said, what I like personally is that we have an issue now.

1244
01:42:30,682 --> 01:42:36,004
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a direct line to BJ's that as a facilities person going to answer that question for us to take care of that.

1245
01:42:36,064 --> 01:42:43,267
[SPEAKER_08]: So the other piece too, is this is something that we'll add as we move forward, but making sure the DPW saw them today, we don't have enough.

1246
01:42:43,847 --> 01:42:49,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to be overseeing that land and that whole, that's going to be maintained by the city.

1247
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:54,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, on the other side that, you know, that we follow through with the police.

1248
01:42:55,292 --> 01:42:58,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to hear that we've already started a process with

1249
01:42:58,533 --> 01:43:05,737
[SPEAKER_08]: a contract that BJ's has with the tow truck company that anybody's in there idling and they don't move themselves, they're going to be hitched and they're going to go.

1250
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:08,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's big, that's big.

1251
01:43:08,139 --> 01:43:13,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there are several conditions that I can read through that address some of your questions.

1252
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:22,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I obviously can't guess the questions you're going to ask next, but there are several conditions that I can read through and this is on top of traffic considerations and things that actually came to us

1253
01:43:22,545 --> 01:43:24,025
[SPEAKER_04]: before we start adding conditions.

1254
01:43:24,045 --> 01:43:24,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to note that.

1255
01:43:25,326 --> 01:43:25,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1256
01:43:25,986 --> 01:43:30,207
[SPEAKER_21]: No, because the reason why I'm saying trucks are not allowed to go on the Fellsway.

1257
01:43:30,947 --> 01:43:31,207
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1258
01:43:31,227 --> 01:43:33,868
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what we were told when BGA was being built.

1259
01:43:33,928 --> 01:43:36,849
[SPEAKER_21]: So the trucks have to come on Middlesex Avenue.

1260
01:43:36,889 --> 01:43:43,431
[SPEAKER_21]: And if the trucks come on Middlesex Avenue, how are they going to make a left turn with the gas station there?

1261
01:43:43,471 --> 01:43:44,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I just don't understand it.

1262
01:43:44,891 --> 01:43:50,013
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, just, I still can't picture, I can picture where the gas station is going to go,

1263
01:43:52,581 --> 01:44:03,225
[SPEAKER_21]: is the way it is right now it's, it's towards the entrance is towards like with electric plan is you understand what I'm saying, just saying it to the gas station.

1264
01:44:04,045 --> 01:44:05,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm saying if the gas station is going to be there.

1265
01:44:06,867 --> 01:44:11,328
[SPEAKER_21]: And the trucks have to make a U turn there is a truck going to be going into the gas station.

1266
01:44:11,608 --> 01:44:19,431
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it's this that the parking lot is big enough that it's the truck had to make a U turn, because I know that, but the parking lots wide open.

1267
01:44:19,471 --> 01:44:19,712
[SPEAKER_14]: I think

1268
01:44:21,453 --> 01:44:27,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it safe to say, sir, that based upon the amount of questions that you have relative to the project, that you'd be opposed to this project at this point in time?

1269
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:28,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me?

1270
01:44:28,434 --> 01:44:34,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Based upon the amount of questions that you're asking this evening surrounding the project and how it's going to work, it seems like you're opposed to the project at this point in time.

1271
01:44:34,916 --> 01:44:47,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, because I've seen, I'm going to be honest with you, I've seen that they promised us, PJ has promised stuff when the first management, he was good, I liked him, but then a new one came and

1272
01:44:51,138 --> 01:44:52,458
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, well, that's not our problem.

1273
01:44:52,538 --> 01:44:53,238
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not our problem.

1274
01:44:53,258 --> 01:44:54,859
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, what do you mean it's not your problem?

1275
01:44:54,919 --> 01:45:00,380
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's what I'm saying is, if this can be written, I hope they keep that promise.

1276
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,560
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope they don't say it's not our problem.

1277
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:05,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So the conditions- When you get some of the conditions, you'll understand.

1278
01:45:05,961 --> 01:45:07,801
[SPEAKER_04]: There are conditions of the permit itself.

1279
01:45:07,841 --> 01:45:10,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they do not meet these conditions, their permit will be revoked.

1280
01:45:11,542 --> 01:45:14,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just- That's why there's more security.

1281
01:45:15,122 --> 01:45:16,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a handshake.

1282
01:45:16,162 --> 01:45:17,783
[SPEAKER_04]: These are conditions of the permit itself.

1283
01:45:17,823 --> 01:45:18,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's a legal agreement.

1284
01:45:19,903 --> 01:45:24,908
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, because Mr. Grant, he was the chairperson for the city of Medford.

1285
01:45:25,169 --> 01:45:25,930
[SPEAKER_21]: He was the lawyer.

1286
01:45:27,051 --> 01:45:28,652
[SPEAKER_21]: And he was the one that- Gene Grant?

1287
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:29,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh, Mr. Grant?

1288
01:45:30,014 --> 01:45:32,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Gene Grant?

1289
01:45:32,757 --> 01:45:33,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1290
01:45:33,378 --> 01:45:34,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1291
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:41,386
[SPEAKER_21]: And he was the lawyer for the city of Medford, and he's the one that told me a lot of stuff about BJ.

1292
01:45:43,063 --> 01:45:54,373
[SPEAKER_21]: So I want to thank you very much for, you know, I just want to give you my point of view, what I've seen of BJ's because I lived there for 41 years and it's horrendous in Middlesex Avenue.

1293
01:45:55,013 --> 01:45:55,634
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate to say that.

1294
01:45:55,734 --> 01:45:56,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's really helpful.

1295
01:45:56,615 --> 01:46:02,099
[SPEAKER_04]: And even just the, you know, people hiding stuff in the trees and the bushes over there, that's really helpful to know because we're not there all the time.

1296
01:46:02,119 --> 01:46:02,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know that.

1297
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:09,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you know, I call it the City Hall and I said, listen, somebody dumped a computer across the street from the electric.

1298
01:46:09,983 --> 01:46:10,883
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what they said?

1299
01:46:10,903 --> 01:46:11,583
[SPEAKER_21]: They laughed at me.

1300
01:46:11,923 --> 01:46:13,424
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you want me to do about it?

1301
01:46:13,984 --> 01:46:14,944
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, what do you mean?

1302
01:46:15,045 --> 01:46:15,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm asking you.

1303
01:46:17,137 --> 01:46:20,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody dumped a computer, and there's a serial number.

1304
01:46:20,078 --> 01:46:20,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't you look it up?

1305
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:22,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's not our responsibility.

1306
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:24,220
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what I had to do?

1307
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:30,823
[SPEAKER_21]: I had to pay for that, to have that somebody who dumped the computer behind the electric plant.

1308
01:46:31,323 --> 01:46:34,345
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not should be my problem, paying for somebody else's dumping.

1309
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:43,252
[SPEAKER_21]: At the time, I was being nice, so I did it.

1310
01:46:43,612 --> 01:46:50,675
[SPEAKER_21]: But then when they start putting the junk in there, tires and refrigeration, I couldn't believe the stuff that the electric plant showed.

1311
01:46:50,755 --> 01:46:51,836
[SPEAKER_21]: And then they had to pay for that.

1312
01:46:53,136 --> 01:47:02,941
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to give you that, my problem, and I've seen what I've been seeing on my street and Middlesex Avenue.

1313
01:47:03,581 --> 01:47:04,981
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's what I want to ask you, okay?

1314
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:05,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1315
01:47:13,444 --> 01:47:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: evening.

1316
01:47:13,724 --> 01:47:14,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1317
01:47:15,105 --> 01:47:16,045
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Marius.

1318
01:47:16,105 --> 01:47:16,726
[SPEAKER_17]: It's wrong.

1319
01:47:17,326 --> 01:47:18,747
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm 30 forward to a family.

1320
01:47:18,787 --> 01:47:21,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1321
01:47:21,328 --> 01:47:24,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, the country made a great presentation.

1322
01:47:25,151 --> 01:47:28,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Fantastic for all the details of everything else.

1323
01:47:29,213 --> 01:47:31,074
[SPEAKER_17]: But I went through this before 39 years ago.

1324
01:47:41,278 --> 01:47:45,079
[SPEAKER_17]: And each of them have five gates, a straight type of gate.

1325
01:47:45,700 --> 01:48:01,765
[SPEAKER_17]: We were promised 39 years ago they were going to upgrade that gate so the trucks would not be able to, the 64 trailers, they would not be able to pull in the parking lot without parking there for three, four hours at a time.

1326
01:48:03,448 --> 01:48:04,809
[SPEAKER_17]: and nothing was done.

1327
01:48:04,829 --> 01:48:11,194
[SPEAKER_17]: The cable worked for approximately a week and a half to two weeks, and it hasn't worked since in 39 years.

1328
01:48:12,215 --> 01:48:14,116
[SPEAKER_17]: They promised all the landscaping.

1329
01:48:15,177 --> 01:48:17,759
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we had there maybe 12 or 13 or 14 frames.

1330
01:48:21,711 --> 01:48:34,869
[SPEAKER_17]: So basically the point is, before we even get involved with this gas station, 64,000 gallon capacity, we should get DJs to be a little better neighbors to us.

1331
01:48:36,855 --> 01:48:39,638
[SPEAKER_17]: At this point, you can't even park there.

1332
01:48:39,678 --> 01:48:43,681
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the promise is so well, they're going to put a stocking fence, this or that.

1333
01:48:44,141 --> 01:48:46,043
[SPEAKER_17]: We end up with a chair leg fence.

1334
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:51,427
[SPEAKER_17]: When the cars are parked right there, they got the headlights on.

1335
01:48:51,467 --> 01:48:53,789
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't even watch TV across the street.

1336
01:48:53,809 --> 01:48:55,331
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to have the shades down.

1337
01:48:56,251 --> 01:49:01,055
[SPEAKER_17]: So before we discussed, give a permit for a gas station,

1338
01:49:03,901 --> 01:49:07,153
[SPEAKER_17]: We should talk about, excuse me, I just want to explain something.

1339
01:49:07,494 --> 01:49:09,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, the way this works is because of

1340
01:49:10,237 --> 01:49:14,558
[SPEAKER_10]: the zoning in the area where the gas station is going to be located.

1341
01:49:14,758 --> 01:49:16,298
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the right to do this by right.

1342
01:49:16,558 --> 01:49:21,980
[SPEAKER_10]: All they're doing is coming to us for a special permit so that we can put conditions on it to protect the neighborhood.

1343
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,480
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we've accomplished that.

1344
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:25,501
[SPEAKER_10]: But ultimately, we went to court on this.

1345
01:49:25,541 --> 01:49:26,781
[SPEAKER_10]: We said we don't want the gas station.

1346
01:49:26,801 --> 01:49:27,161
[SPEAKER_10]: We lost.

1347
01:49:27,661 --> 01:49:29,281
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why they sent it back to us.

1348
01:49:29,301 --> 01:49:30,182
[SPEAKER_05]: So now here we are today.

1349
01:49:30,202 --> 01:49:30,822
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we going to do?

1350
01:49:30,862 --> 01:49:34,663
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go and say, sorry, judge, we don't want to negotiate anymore.

1351
01:49:35,043 --> 01:49:36,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they send it back to the judge.

1352
01:49:36,483 --> 01:49:38,003
[SPEAKER_05]: The judge says, OK, Medford, you lose.

1353
01:49:38,023 --> 01:49:39,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all the restrictions go out the window.

1354
01:49:40,624 --> 01:49:41,024
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1355
01:49:41,044 --> 01:49:42,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's the alternative at this point.

1356
01:49:43,045 --> 01:49:49,648
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand that, but they have to come up with some kind of a permit to renew their license, whatever they have to do.

1357
01:49:49,688 --> 01:49:57,512
[SPEAKER_17]: So before we allow any more permits for BJs to keep in business, we should take care of a lot of the neighbors.

1358
01:49:58,272 --> 01:49:59,353
[SPEAKER_17]: We have better neighbors.

1359
01:50:00,073 --> 01:50:06,056
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a possibility they might have to put a six-foot barrier right across the whole Woodrow Fab.

1360
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:10,393
[SPEAKER_17]: to keep the headlights down, to keep the noise down.

1361
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:20,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, it's a speedway with a construction type of security, a middle six, seven, you could even be remote controlled.

1362
01:50:20,581 --> 01:50:24,464
[SPEAKER_17]: I went up to the manager myself, in regard to this gate.

1363
01:50:24,944 --> 01:50:28,266
[SPEAKER_17]: At nighttime, after the store closes,

1364
01:50:29,087 --> 01:50:30,288
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a speedway there.

1365
01:50:30,408 --> 01:50:34,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody cuts across from behind that middle six avenue to the first way.

1366
01:50:35,451 --> 01:50:38,553
[SPEAKER_17]: If they had a gate up there, that wouldn't happen.

1367
01:50:39,714 --> 01:50:51,582
[SPEAKER_17]: You got trucks, 60-foot trailers, parking there for three, four hours from 11 o'clock on until the storm ends up to make their delivery.

1368
01:50:52,163 --> 01:50:52,943
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not right.

1369
01:50:54,144 --> 01:50:58,487
[SPEAKER_17]: That's absolutely asinine for the neighbors to hear the truck running.

1370
01:51:01,345 --> 01:51:03,085
[SPEAKER_17]: So something should be done about that.

1371
01:51:03,286 --> 01:51:14,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Even put a, some type of a security gate across, or pilasters, or pillows, steel pillows, whatever they have to do so that traffic, it doesn't go through the parking lot.

1372
01:51:16,289 --> 01:51:19,330
[SPEAKER_17]: And what do we end up with all the problems from B.J.

1373
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:20,150
[SPEAKER_17]: 29 years ago?

1374
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:25,431
[SPEAKER_17]: We got a storage propane tank, a hundred feet from a residential house.

1375
01:51:26,132 --> 01:51:27,932
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what the neighborhoods are.

1376
01:51:29,873 --> 01:51:30,733
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not right.

1377
01:51:34,108 --> 01:51:35,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Home Depot carries propane.

1378
01:51:36,368 --> 01:51:39,229
[SPEAKER_17]: You go down there, you bring your tank, they'll give you a tank.

1379
01:51:39,249 --> 01:51:47,691
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's no necessity for them to have this 5,000 or 6,000 or 25,000 gallon capacity of propane tanks.

1380
01:51:48,071 --> 01:51:51,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Now they want to put a 64,000 gallon gas station.

1381
01:51:53,753 --> 01:51:55,594
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this Congress should think about this.

1382
01:51:57,074 --> 01:52:00,455
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ should be better neighbors before we approve anything.

1383
01:52:02,875 --> 01:52:05,876
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what they're gonna have to do.

1384
01:52:06,057 --> 01:52:08,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this brings us right back to the beginning, right?

1385
01:52:09,338 --> 01:52:10,699
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we voted no the first time.

1386
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:11,639
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we got sued.

1387
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:14,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we said BJ should be better neighbors.

1388
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:18,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And that brought us to where we are today with all these conditions and restrictions that we have on the permit.

1389
01:52:18,882 --> 01:52:22,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1390
01:52:22,964 --> 01:52:26,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, what we did was we did exactly what you're asking, what you asked us to do.

1391
01:52:26,706 --> 01:52:28,927
[SPEAKER_05]: We just did it a long time ago and we lost in court.

1392
01:52:30,528 --> 01:52:31,248
[SPEAKER_17]: I understood that.

1393
01:52:34,787 --> 01:52:39,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay.

1394
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:42,171
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm awesome.

1395
01:52:43,632 --> 01:52:43,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1396
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:54,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1397
01:52:55,279 --> 01:52:58,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Stephen Broadly and I was here two weeks ago from Aaron Fox shift.

1398
01:52:59,441 --> 01:53:02,423
[SPEAKER_20]: I only want to respond to one specific

1399
01:53:04,421 --> 01:53:18,655
[SPEAKER_20]: tone that I've heard, more specifically from you, Councilor Knight, and from others who are not interested really in this project, but somehow they have the feeling that because it went to court, you have to approve it.

1400
01:53:19,296 --> 01:53:21,278
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not at all what happened in court.

1401
01:53:21,458 --> 01:53:23,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Please don't speak for me, sir, because that's not what I think at all.

1402
01:53:24,761 --> 01:53:25,161
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

1403
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,785
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to speak for what happened in court because I was there.

1404
01:53:30,632 --> 01:53:35,753
[SPEAKER_20]: This matter was refused by this council in 2021.

1405
01:53:38,814 --> 01:53:51,037
[SPEAKER_20]: BJs went to court and in the court proceeding, the judge made no ruling about whether anything was right or wrong about what this city council did.

1406
01:53:51,877 --> 01:53:58,759
[SPEAKER_20]: What the judge did was to respond to an agreement between your assistant solicitor and the attorneys for BJs.

1407
01:53:59,993 --> 01:54:04,554
[SPEAKER_20]: And he said, okay, you've agreed to take it back for another vote.

1408
01:54:05,474 --> 01:54:08,055
[SPEAKER_20]: And the judge said, okay, take it back for another vote.

1409
01:54:08,375 --> 01:54:15,057
[SPEAKER_20]: The judge did not express an opinion about whether anything was rational or irrational or right or wrong.

1410
01:54:15,737 --> 01:54:22,599
[SPEAKER_20]: You have a clean slate just because there is zoning that permits this project doesn't mean that you can't refuse it.

1411
01:54:23,893 --> 01:54:26,034
[SPEAKER_20]: because of your special permit powers.

1412
01:54:26,894 --> 01:54:27,874
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what you have.

1413
01:54:28,235 --> 01:54:29,715
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not short on recourse.

1414
01:54:30,095 --> 01:54:41,079
[SPEAKER_20]: You can refuse something that even though it meets the zoning, if you don't like it for reasons that you can articulate, then you don't have to vote for it.

1415
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:53,385
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to clarify and make sure that the city council, in my view, understands that they have full powers under this special permit to refuse this if they really want to refuse it.

1416
01:54:53,825 --> 01:54:57,790
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not being forced down your throat by anything that the court did.

1417
01:54:58,852 --> 01:54:59,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1418
01:54:59,453 --> 01:54:59,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1419
01:55:00,892 --> 01:55:06,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone else who was just to that point, and I thank the gentleman for putting the words in my mouth.

1420
01:55:06,477 --> 01:55:10,100
[SPEAKER_10]: But ultimately, why would I legal counsel agree to bring it back?

1421
01:55:10,741 --> 01:55:12,222
[SPEAKER_10]: If we had such a strong case?

1422
01:55:12,763 --> 01:55:13,703
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, why?

1423
01:55:15,865 --> 01:55:19,569
[SPEAKER_10]: makes no sense to me, obviously, because we weren't negotiating from position of power.

1424
01:55:20,149 --> 01:55:23,372
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we had the opportunity to negotiate a stronger agreement than we had.

1425
01:55:23,432 --> 01:55:23,972
[SPEAKER_10]: We were going in.

1426
01:55:23,992 --> 01:55:25,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, guys.

1427
01:55:25,734 --> 01:55:25,914
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1428
01:55:25,974 --> 01:55:27,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further thoughts would like to comment?

1429
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:34,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get to the conditions, I do just want to reiterate my point from two weeks ago.

1430
01:55:35,254 --> 01:55:36,635
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not something I want to approve.

1431
01:55:36,655 --> 01:55:41,679
[SPEAKER_04]: If it were my choice, we would not be approving any more fossil fuel infrastructure.

1432
01:55:41,719 --> 01:55:42,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something we need.

1433
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:43,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the way the future is going.

1434
01:55:44,301 --> 01:55:50,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm also, to the attorney's previous point last week, I do not believe BJ's is doing this out of the goodness of their heart.

1435
01:55:50,886 --> 01:55:52,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not believe that, no offense.

1436
01:55:53,609 --> 01:55:57,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is because that, that I do believe I have to go yes for this because we have set these conditions.

1437
01:55:58,376 --> 01:56:00,217
[SPEAKER_04]: that address the issues that the neighbors have had.

1438
01:56:00,657 --> 01:56:05,058
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that if we are losing court, if we were to go back again, we're not going to get anything.

1439
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:09,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And we won't address any of those conditions because I don't believe this is a goodness of the heart issue.

1440
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:10,220
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a legal matter.

1441
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:12,621
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a agreement that we're trying to set forth.

1442
01:56:12,761 --> 01:56:14,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I'll be voting affirmatively.

1443
01:56:14,802 --> 01:56:15,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I could vote no.

1444
01:56:16,163 --> 01:56:21,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And my conscience says that to get the neighbors what they need, it has to be a yes vote.

1445
01:56:24,127 --> 01:56:25,508
[SPEAKER_04]: going to the conditions.

1446
01:56:25,608 --> 01:56:31,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a motion from Vice President Bears to approve with the conditions and the conditions are and these are from the council.

1447
01:56:31,371 --> 01:56:37,355
[SPEAKER_04]: These are in addition to the plans that came before the council, which have a number of traffic and safety changes.

1448
01:56:37,415 --> 01:56:44,659
[SPEAKER_04]: So landscaping one BJ's will implement an advance in advanced maintenance program, which will consist of weekly parking lot sweeping

1449
01:56:45,058 --> 01:56:48,742
[SPEAKER_04]: and day porter service three days a week to remove any litter in BJ's parking lot.

1450
01:56:49,122 --> 01:56:54,267
[SPEAKER_04]: BJ's will not conduct any such parking lot sweeping other than for an emergency reason between 11 p.m.

1451
01:56:54,347 --> 01:56:55,087
[SPEAKER_04]: and 6 a.m.

1452
01:56:55,788 --> 01:57:05,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Biannually, in the spring and fall, BJ's will conduct on-site landscape cleanups to remulch landscape areas and to remove leaves and to vacuum any solids present in the storm water system.

1453
01:57:05,757 --> 01:57:10,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Three, BJ's will empty exterior dumpsters on an as-needed basis, but in no event,

1454
01:57:11,181 --> 01:57:12,241
[SPEAKER_04]: less than once per week.

1455
01:57:12,521 --> 01:57:19,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Four, BJs will ensure that all onsite trash receptacles be covered with a flap lid opening to prevent trash from leaving the dumpster.

1456
01:57:20,664 --> 01:57:30,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Five, BJs will ensure that all existing landscaping and any new onsite landscaping added will be maintained such that any dead trees or shrubs will be removed and replaced.

1457
01:57:31,048 --> 01:57:38,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Six, BJs will plant additional landscaping improvements on its property consistent with the landscaping plans presented to the city council

1458
01:57:38,775 --> 01:57:41,417
[SPEAKER_04]: at the January 17th hearing adjacent to Woodruff Ave.

1459
01:57:41,838 --> 01:57:45,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Such planting will be done in the first phase of the gas station construction project.

1460
01:57:46,662 --> 01:57:59,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven, BJA's will, subject to the approval and request of the city, remove and replace any of the dead trees with new trees and shrubs in the public right of way along Woodruff Avenue, consistent with the plans discussed at the January 17th hearing.

1461
01:58:00,394 --> 01:58:03,397
[SPEAKER_04]: The new landscaping will become city property upon planting.

1462
01:58:03,966 --> 01:58:16,839
[SPEAKER_04]: If any such new landscaping dies of natural causes and not because of snowplow or other inflicted harm caused by the city or other third parties, BJs will replace each such landscaping for as long as the gas station is in operation.

1463
01:58:17,479 --> 01:58:22,684
[SPEAKER_04]: BJs will have no other duties in the right of way other than landscaping replacement if and when needed.

1464
01:58:23,991 --> 01:58:35,855
[SPEAKER_04]: 8.

1465
01:58:24,631 --> 01:58:35,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Annually, BJ's will provide the City of Medford with a written summary of maintenance activities to confirm that the conditions of its fuel storage license are satisfied to a representative of the city to be designated by the City Council.

1466
01:58:36,915 --> 01:58:38,356
[SPEAKER_04]: BJ's representative.

1467
01:58:38,376 --> 01:58:38,356
9.

1468
01:58:38,976 --> 01:58:52,680
[SPEAKER_04]: BJ's will designate a corporate representative who shall be the regional maintenance manager or his or her designee and shall provide the BJ's representative's contact information, both email and telephone number, to the City of Medford to allow for communications between the city and or

1469
01:58:53,511 --> 01:58:56,152
[SPEAKER_04]: of its residents regarding any exterior maintenance concerns.

1470
01:58:56,452 --> 01:59:06,956
[SPEAKER_04]: The city will not publicize such contact information or place the contact information on the city's website, but the city may provide such information to residents or public officials who request such information.

1471
01:59:08,216 --> 01:59:09,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Pedestrians and traffic.

1472
01:59:10,257 --> 01:59:18,040
[SPEAKER_04]: BJs will employ vehicular traffic patterns for the gas station as shown on the site plans approved by the city of Medford Community Development Board 11.

1473
01:59:19,182 --> 01:59:28,414
[SPEAKER_04]: BJ's will reconfigure the maintenance entrance drive at its property site and install new sidewalks and crosswalks consistent with the plans approved by the City of Medford Community Development Board.

1474
01:59:29,155 --> 01:59:36,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Twelve BJ's will install approximately appropriately spaced removable speed tables on an annual basis during the period from April 30th

1475
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:45,757
[SPEAKER_04]: through October 30th within the main interior site drive aisle, which connects Middlesex Avenue to the Felsway in order to address excessive speeds.

1476
01:59:46,618 --> 01:59:52,205
[SPEAKER_04]: EV charging stations, 13, BJ Salons shall install four EV charging stations in its parking lot.

1477
01:59:52,846 --> 01:59:56,410
[SPEAKER_04]: After hours trucks, 14, BJ's will install no parking signage

[SPEAKER_04]: Any discussion from the council?

1563
02:04:58,312 --> 02:05:07,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a reminder, this is a, we have the opinion from Attorney Austin with KP Law that this is in fact a zoning vote, so we require five votes for approval.

1564
02:05:07,903 --> 02:05:14,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears to approve with the condition that the permits stay with the owner and not the property, it's seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1565
02:05:14,169 --> 02:05:15,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1566
02:05:15,431 --> 02:05:18,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, I do think it's important to point out that Attorney Austin said that

1567
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:29,360
[SPEAKER_10]: The labor practices of Starbucks is not a significant or appropriate reason for the denial of the special permit and the conditions to the extent that I was.

1568
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:32,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I for one feel as though Starbucks is not a very good employer.

1569
02:05:32,862 --> 02:05:42,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel as though they've gone a little bit too far in their efforts to impede with labor organizing in their corporation.

1570
02:05:44,833 --> 02:05:45,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's shameful.

1571
02:05:46,314 --> 02:05:58,119
[SPEAKER_10]: However, based upon the slap that we just got relative to BJ's after a year long of legal haranguing, I do feel as though it would be the city's best interest financially to approve the document that's before us.

1572
02:05:58,259 --> 02:05:58,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1573
02:05:59,260 --> 02:05:59,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1574
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:10,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And just for some additional background, I did, I spoke with Rocco DiRico and he said that no one else bid for the project and that is why we have a Starbucks there as opposed to something else, perhaps with different labor practices.

1575
02:06:10,805 --> 02:06:11,125
[SPEAKER_13]: A Dunk's.

1576
02:06:13,355 --> 02:06:19,801

02:06:20,622 --> 02:06:20,922

02:06:49,706 --> 02:06:51,067

1592
02:07:11,567 --> 02:07:12,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

1593
02:07:12,748 --> 02:07:14,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

1594
02:07:15,048 --> 02:07:18,729
[SPEAKER_13]: As folks know, there's a state building code that determines the requirements for

1595
02:07:19,614 --> 02:07:21,174
[SPEAKER_13]: construction across the state.

1596
02:07:21,214 --> 02:07:26,816
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a few different versions of it that municipalities can either opt into or otherwise.

1597
02:07:29,496 --> 02:07:42,880
[SPEAKER_13]: The longer history is that there were previously two versions, and now there's a specific specialized municipal opt-in code option that's become available that would allow the city to use the state's new building code, which provides for more green energy options in new construction.

1598
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,320
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do have one amendment.

1599
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:48,081
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could just add a quotation mark to the end of the resolution.

1600
02:07:50,243 --> 02:07:50,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you.

1601
02:07:52,184 --> 02:07:53,505
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would move approval.

1602
02:07:54,266 --> 02:07:57,368

1603
02:07:58,929 --> 02:08:02,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Morell and thank you Vice President Bears for putting this on the agenda.

1604
02:08:04,524 --> 02:08:28,584
[SPEAKER_19]: This is such a pivotal way in which our city can can reach the goals of our climate action plan, and to address the concerns of our residents that in the desire from our community to make sure that we are doing as much as possible to reach our climate targets in playing our part in in in addressing the climate crisis.

1605
02:08:32,509 --> 02:08:47,766
[SPEAKER_19]: According to the presentation from OPDS to the City Council and it's stated in the Medford Climate Action and Adaptation Report, buildings account for 67% of carbon dioxide equivalents in our city.

[SPEAKER_19]: By tackling this question head on and by

1607
02:08:53,613 --> 02:09:06,776
[SPEAKER_19]: passing by opting into this program, we will be doing our part to lower that number, which is, again, makes up a very significant chunk of the emissions that we produce as a city.

1608
02:09:09,076 --> 02:09:12,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think that's the most important thing to be said.

[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1618
02:09:37,868 --> 02:09:42,232
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know some folks don't necessarily know what I'm talking about, but I'm actually from that town.

1619
02:09:42,292 --> 02:09:45,515
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the new high school that replaced the one that I went to.

1620
02:09:45,675 --> 02:09:45,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1621
02:09:46,075 --> 02:09:47,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also a taxpayer in that community.

1622
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:47,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1623
02:09:48,297 --> 02:09:54,102
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just found out that, you know, we've been getting a bill for approximately $220,000 because we couldn't turn the lights off with switches because

1624
02:09:56,904 --> 02:10:02,099
[SPEAKER_11]: good intentions for having centrally managed green buildings, but yet

1625
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:07,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Information's fuzzy, there isn't a lot out there in the public domain.

1626
02:10:07,702 --> 02:10:12,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like it might be because of a computer hacking or something, and therefore it's a centrally managed issue.

1627
02:10:12,923 --> 02:10:18,585
[SPEAKER_11]: We had teachers literally trying to unscrew light bulbs, I guess, to try to turn the lights off because there weren't local light switches.

1628
02:10:19,405 --> 02:10:32,970
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you adopt this in its current form, are you handcuffing people to build buildings like that where they don't necessarily have local control over their HVAC systems and or lighting, especially when you wanna have, even as,

1629
02:10:33,986 --> 02:10:36,150
[SPEAKER_11]: as a backup, but also just because it makes sense, right?

1630
02:10:36,190 --> 02:10:36,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Local control.

1631
02:10:36,951 --> 02:10:43,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you can turn the lights off, if you want to, and not necessarily rely on the internet and a program because it's free.

1632
02:10:43,827 --> 02:10:45,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so a couple things on that.

1633
02:10:46,068 --> 02:10:52,571
[SPEAKER_13]: First, this is just asking the office to draft the language that would be necessary to adopt it so there'd be a further discussion of whether or not it would be adopted.

1634
02:10:53,252 --> 02:11:10,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, my understanding and I'm neither a contractor nor working at the State Department of Environmental Affairs, but my understanding is it's kind of sets conditions but it doesn't require a specific system so it would actually be the designer of whatever the property is to, if they chose a system like that then they would be making that choice but it doesn't say you have to have

1635
02:11:10,941 --> 02:11:13,465
[SPEAKER_13]: XYZ system in place.

1636
02:11:13,585 --> 02:11:18,031
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, and, you know, I know there's a lot of, for example, our library

1637
02:11:19,477 --> 02:11:24,180
[SPEAKER_13]: is a very green building and it does have local lights in there so yeah.

1638
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:25,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1639
02:11:25,721 --> 02:11:30,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, good intentions right by all I'm sure that we're involved but at the same time, it's really embarrassing.

1640
02:11:31,064 --> 02:11:41,030
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've kind of shot yourself in the foot from the green objective when you've literally been just setting energy and money on fire, and yeah, the city can't afford it, quite honestly, to make that kind of mistake.

1641
02:11:41,891 --> 02:11:43,412
[SPEAKER_11]: So just making sure that

1642
02:11:44,364 --> 02:11:49,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important to point out this doesn't just apply to municipal buildings as well as private residences.

1643
02:11:49,247 --> 02:11:54,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, this would be all just municipal construction, it's all new construction.

1644
02:11:54,551 --> 02:11:55,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, sure.

1645
02:11:56,172 --> 02:11:59,414
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as you're not handcuffing even private businesses that want to, you know,

1646
02:12:00,602 --> 02:12:05,944
[SPEAKER_11]: build a building, right, that they all of a sudden have to adopt something that's remotely, you know, internet only control.

1647
02:12:05,984 --> 02:12:14,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't think there's any, it's more of a broader set of requirements around general principles of environmental, you know, climate goals.

1648
02:12:15,209 --> 02:12:16,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

1649
02:12:16,329 --> 02:12:16,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1650
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:20,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Nathan, do you know who did the project in your hometown?

1651
02:12:21,128 --> 02:12:22,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't, but you know.

1652
02:12:22,489 --> 02:12:26,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Because chances are, if you did, they'd probably end up hiring him here at Medford.

1653
02:12:26,372 --> 02:12:28,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it may have been, I'm not positive.

1654
02:12:28,694 --> 02:12:30,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's actually a separate company for whatever's running the lights.

1655
02:12:30,916 --> 02:12:31,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the.

1656
02:12:31,677 --> 02:12:32,577
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a subcontractor.

1657
02:12:32,658 --> 02:12:35,019
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a subcontractor who built the building, but.

1658
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:39,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Bring it back when we have the new high school building committee, because we're not going to want to use them.

1659
02:12:41,385 --> 02:12:42,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally agree.

1660
02:12:43,653 --> 02:12:47,916
[SPEAKER_11]: But, and just as you're doing other, you know, projects in the city, right?

1661
02:12:48,016 --> 02:12:49,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just the high school, but.

1662
02:12:49,538 --> 02:12:50,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes, no, I'm with you.

1663
02:12:50,859 --> 02:12:56,163
[SPEAKER_11]: When I find out, I'll let you all know, but as a taxpayer, yeah, we want some heads on pikes for that one.

1664
02:12:56,363 --> 02:12:56,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1665
02:12:58,405 --> 02:13:00,606
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, yes, figuratively.

1666
02:13:01,247 --> 02:13:03,589
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, Vice President Bears is seconded by.

1667
02:13:04,993 --> 02:13:06,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins, all those in favor.

1668
02:13:06,334 --> 02:13:07,554
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed.

1669
02:13:07,594 --> 02:13:08,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1670
02:13:08,355 --> 02:13:11,016
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-024 offered by Vice President Fares.

1671
02:13:11,836 --> 02:13:21,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved by the Metro City Council that the City Administration inform residents about the MBTA policy change to allow two bus trips and one subway trip on a single fare.

1672
02:13:21,521 --> 02:13:26,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The additional transfer will likely be required for some residents impacted by the MBTA bus redesign project.

1673
02:13:26,823 --> 02:13:30,747
[SPEAKER_04]: be it further resolved that the MBTA more widely communicate that policy change to riders.

1674
02:13:30,767 --> 02:13:32,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

1675
02:13:32,149 --> 02:13:32,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

1676
02:13:32,909 --> 02:13:42,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to thank Anita Nagum for bringing this to my attention, which is that there was kind of a pretty major policy change by the MBTA over the summer that didn't get a lot of fanfare.

1677
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:52,106
[SPEAKER_13]: which is that if you have you pay a single fare, you can now transfer from one subway trip to two additional bus trips, it used to be just one and one.

1678
02:13:52,867 --> 02:14:05,315
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, that's a pretty significant difference probably making a difference for a lot of folks who use the MBTA, but especially in the context of the bus redesign project and parts of the city that are now going to need to make additional transfers to get to where they're going.

1679
02:14:06,416 --> 02:14:08,537
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there may be folks who would have said in the past.

1680
02:14:09,157 --> 02:14:18,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm just going to do another route because I don't want to pay two fares, and they actually maybe wouldn't have to do that it will be able to save that money, you know, especially builds up if you're doing it every single day as anyone knows.

1681
02:14:21,765 --> 02:14:25,568
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've had a lot of communication about the bus redesign project as a city.

1682
02:14:25,628 --> 02:14:27,049
[SPEAKER_13]: The MBTA has not done its job.

1683
02:14:27,109 --> 02:14:30,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Residents have taken up that spirit and done the outreach themselves.

1684
02:14:31,091 --> 02:14:37,936
[SPEAKER_13]: But as actual routes start to change or stops start to change, I think it would be important for riders to know that this is an option for them.

1685
02:14:37,996 --> 02:14:44,760
[SPEAKER_13]: And obviously, I also included to ask the MBTA to do that communication, but that is not quite as easy for us to ask for.

1686
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:46,341
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Madam President.

1687
02:14:46,501 --> 02:14:47,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Bares.

1688
02:14:47,842 --> 02:14:48,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Any discussion?

1689
02:14:51,597 --> 02:14:52,357
[SPEAKER_04]: just for the record, please.

1690
02:14:53,578 --> 02:14:56,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I need an a gum nine Norton nails Medford Councilor bears.

1691
02:14:56,739 --> 02:14:58,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for pronouncing my name correctly.

1692
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:03,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I just wanted to address this MBTA fair policy change.

1693
02:15:04,661 --> 02:15:06,321
[SPEAKER_15]: It was apparently changed last July.

1694
02:15:06,341 --> 02:15:12,243
[SPEAKER_15]: I found out by chance because I was attending the last public meeting about the best network redesign.

1695
02:15:13,103 --> 02:15:15,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, no mention of it was made by the MBTA, but

1696
02:15:16,723 --> 02:15:24,889
[SPEAKER_15]: During the discussion, I pointed out that many Medford residents were now being told to take two buses and a subway, two buses to get to Davis Square.

1697
02:15:25,809 --> 02:15:30,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And I pointed out that that would effectively double the cost of their trip in each direction.

1698
02:15:31,773 --> 02:15:38,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, an MBTA representative responded and said, oh, we changed the fare policy last July.

1699
02:15:40,528 --> 02:15:41,469
[SPEAKER_15]: That was news to me.

1700
02:15:41,489 --> 02:15:43,729
[SPEAKER_15]: I ride the T regularly.

1701
02:15:43,929 --> 02:15:45,990
[SPEAKER_15]: My husband rides it every single day of the week.

1702
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:48,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither of us knew anything about this.

1703
02:15:49,631 --> 02:15:50,932
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no signs anywhere.

1704
02:15:52,292 --> 02:15:54,193
[SPEAKER_15]: I looked on the website, it is posted there.

1705
02:15:56,034 --> 02:15:57,834
[SPEAKER_15]: But riders need to be informed of this.

1706
02:15:59,615 --> 02:16:07,778
[SPEAKER_15]: I strongly suspect that they are waiting to announce this until the changes for the bus network redesign are implemented.

1707
02:16:08,212 --> 02:16:13,496
[SPEAKER_15]: so that they can say, oh, we're changing this and you're gonna have to take two buses now, but we're changing the fare.

1708
02:16:14,217 --> 02:16:17,420
[SPEAKER_15]: The fare policy is in effect right now, the change.

1709
02:16:20,122 --> 02:16:23,145
[SPEAKER_15]: And just a couple of other things regarding the bus network redesign.

1710
02:16:23,945 --> 02:16:34,474
[SPEAKER_15]: The city of Medford pays a substantial sum to the MBTA, yet this new plan is going to cut bus service to West Medford and North Medford significantly.

1711
02:16:35,243 --> 02:16:40,987
[SPEAKER_15]: The southeast edge of Medford is going to get much better service if you can get to this new high frequency route.

1712
02:16:41,628 --> 02:16:44,410
[SPEAKER_15]: The rest of Medford is going to be affected.

1713
02:16:45,651 --> 02:16:50,734
[SPEAKER_15]: And the city of Medford should push back more against the MBTA's plans.

1714
02:16:51,315 --> 02:16:59,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, there will be no bus to the red line between the end of Boston Avenue at High Street and the rotary at Winthrop Street.

1715
02:17:00,181 --> 02:17:01,722
[SPEAKER_15]: That is a full mile.

1716
02:17:02,743 --> 02:17:05,005
[SPEAKER_15]: When the MBTA designed this plan,

1717
02:17:05,483 --> 02:17:10,007
[SPEAKER_15]: they decided that being half a mile from a bus route was acceptable.

1718
02:17:12,309 --> 02:17:15,932
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you've noticed, but there are posters around the city of Medford.

1719
02:17:15,952 --> 02:17:26,901
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been posting signs to encourage people to continue submitting feedback because the MBTA plan did approve the plan, but told them to continue adjusting it based on feedback.

1720
02:17:29,023 --> 02:17:34,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Every person with whom I have spoken and explained this to says half a mile is ridiculous.

1721
02:17:35,338 --> 02:17:36,338
[SPEAKER_15]: What if you are elderly?

1722
02:17:36,778 --> 02:17:38,199
[SPEAKER_15]: What if you are disabled?

1723
02:17:38,579 --> 02:17:39,699
[SPEAKER_15]: What if you have children?

1724
02:17:40,099 --> 02:17:43,200
[SPEAKER_15]: What if you are carrying groceries or heavy packages?

1725
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:45,861
[SPEAKER_15]: And what if there is bad weather?

1726
02:17:47,001 --> 02:17:48,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Half a mile is ridiculous.

1727
02:17:51,722 --> 02:17:58,564
[SPEAKER_15]: My name was in the newspaper because of the petition that we did last summer presenting 2000 signatures opposing the bus network redesign.

1728
02:17:59,964 --> 02:18:02,465
[SPEAKER_15]: People have been finding out about the bus network redesign

1729
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:07,951
[SPEAKER_15]: looking up the article and calling me up and saying, what am I going to do?

1730
02:18:08,231 --> 02:18:13,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Several people on High Street have called me up saying, I'm elderly, I'm disabled, I can't do this.

1731
02:18:13,753 --> 02:18:24,896
[SPEAKER_15]: The MBTA's response at the last meeting was, well, if you can't walk down to the Rotary or High Street or Boston Avenue, you can take the 95 bus and then transfer.

1732
02:18:26,436 --> 02:18:31,318
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very nice in theory, but it adds probably at least,

1733
02:18:33,492 --> 02:18:36,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Under optimal conditions, it would add probably half an hour onto your trip.

1734
02:18:37,574 --> 02:18:40,855
[SPEAKER_15]: In worst case scenario, 45 minutes to an hour.

1735
02:18:41,796 --> 02:18:44,857
[SPEAKER_15]: That is an unfair burden to place on residents.

1736
02:18:45,477 --> 02:18:48,519
[SPEAKER_15]: And the city of Medford really should push back more against this.

1737
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:52,821
[SPEAKER_15]: One more last comment.

1738
02:18:54,342 --> 02:19:01,985
[SPEAKER_15]: As I stated, the MBTA board of directors approved the plan, but told the MBTA to continue adjusting it based on feedback.

1739
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:06,293
[SPEAKER_15]: The entire plan involves more, it involves things like electrification of buses.

1740
02:19:07,513 --> 02:19:11,195
[SPEAKER_15]: So I started putting up an additional round of posters three weeks ago.

1741
02:19:11,555 --> 02:19:18,236
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been in touch with State Senator Gellin and her chief of staff encouraged me to continue urging others to submit feedback.

1742
02:19:19,457 --> 02:19:25,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Before I started putting those posters up, I checked the MBTA website, there was a bus network redesign feedback form.

1743
02:19:26,579 --> 02:19:30,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Last weekend, I looked at the website, that feedback form had been removed.

1744
02:19:31,829 --> 02:19:33,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I do not think this is a coincidence.

1745
02:19:34,571 --> 02:19:36,172
[SPEAKER_15]: The same thing happened last summer.

1746
02:19:36,953 --> 02:19:43,658
[SPEAKER_15]: With my group, four other people, and myself, we had posters all over Medford, Somerville, and Davis Square.

1747
02:19:44,899 --> 02:19:46,180
[SPEAKER_15]: They were getting a lot of feedback.

1748
02:19:46,721 --> 02:19:49,463
[SPEAKER_15]: All the little tabs were being taken from the posters that I put up.

1749
02:19:50,624 --> 02:19:57,770
[SPEAKER_15]: The last two weeks of the comment period, the MBTA removed the email address, which was the way to submit feedback,

1750
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:03,673
[SPEAKER_15]: which was one of the ways to submit feedback from the list of ways you could submit feedback on their website.

1751
02:20:04,113 --> 02:20:07,495
[SPEAKER_15]: There was an address, a mailing address, a phone number, and the email address.

1752
02:20:08,675 --> 02:20:12,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Last two weeks, they eliminated the email address.

1753
02:20:15,219 --> 02:20:27,866
[SPEAKER_15]: The MBTA, or the people who are designing this project, clearly do not want to be inconvenienced by comments from other residents, which will upset their plans, their grand plans for this bus network redesign.

1754
02:20:28,650 --> 02:20:41,359
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would like to ask if the city council would consider contacting the MBTA and telling them to stop discouraging feedback, changing the way you can do it.

1755
02:20:43,661 --> 02:20:50,546
[SPEAKER_15]: It's artificially disturbing the chances that residents have to submit feedback.

1756
02:20:53,508 --> 02:20:56,030
[SPEAKER_15]: It really, really upsets me that they are doing this.

1757
02:20:56,090 --> 02:20:57,931
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I do not think it's a coincidence.

1758
02:20:59,149 --> 02:21:12,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Because of, I think we said this before, but because of the work that my group did, putting those flyers up with tabs all over, Medford and Somerville had the highest number of public comments of any towns in the MBTA system.

1759
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:22,407
[SPEAKER_15]: And the MBTA, I don't think was very happy with those comments because it forced a lot of changes to their overall plan.

1760
02:21:24,669 --> 02:21:27,171
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I have to say about that, but thank you.

1761
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Fair policy is in place right now.

1762
02:21:31,401 --> 02:21:35,202
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not only a subway and two buses, you can take three buses on one fare as well.

1763
02:21:35,942 --> 02:21:37,743
[SPEAKER_15]: But Medford residents should know about it.

1764
02:21:37,843 --> 02:21:41,224
[SPEAKER_15]: It could affect them right now, and they might as well take advantage of it if they can.

1765
02:21:43,885 --> 02:21:51,547
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been enough issues with the MBTA service that if they had this knowledge, again, it could certainly affect their travel plans.

1766
02:21:52,107 --> 02:21:52,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, thank you.

1767
02:21:53,288 --> 02:21:53,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1768
02:21:55,413 --> 02:22:03,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Miss Needham, for coming to speak to us and for letting Vice President Bears know about the fair change.

1769
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:07,724
[SPEAKER_19]: I use the T in the buses almost every day and I didn't even notice it.

1770
02:22:09,805 --> 02:22:12,728
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to note that thanks to efforts from people like you,

1771
02:22:13,588 --> 02:22:21,713
[SPEAKER_19]: And thanks to the work that our council's been doing to organize feedback as well and to send it to the state authorities, to the MBTA.

1772
02:22:22,054 --> 02:22:29,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Our state legislators have told me personally that Medford was the most organized municipality in the whole Commonwealth when it came to the bus network redesign plan.

1773
02:22:30,559 --> 02:22:36,363
[SPEAKER_19]: And you mentioned that we did get a lot of bus service back, not enough, but we did get a lot of bus service back.

1774
02:22:37,023 --> 02:22:38,944
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's no coincidence.

1775
02:22:40,553 --> 02:22:43,094
[SPEAKER_19]: when you look at how organized we were.

1776
02:22:43,174 --> 02:22:56,941
[SPEAKER_19]: I thank you for coming up to the podium to speak tonight because it reminds us that to send in more feedback and to keep in communication with MBTA and to keep organizing feedback as well.

1777
02:22:57,661 --> 02:23:06,545
[SPEAKER_19]: It is upsetting to hear that the feedback form is now closed and that the link is not on the website anymore.

1778
02:23:06,626 --> 02:23:08,666
[SPEAKER_19]: I know I've had,

1779
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:16,644
[SPEAKER_19]: friends and neighbors use the MBTA complaint forms and last week it was down for a few days as well.

1780
02:23:17,864 --> 02:23:28,631
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's certainly something that we should contact our state reps about and try to create more political pressure on the MBTA to get that back up and fixed.

1781
02:23:29,472 --> 02:23:33,174
[SPEAKER_19]: This council knows how frustrating it is to work with the state government.

1782
02:23:33,794 --> 02:23:37,035
[SPEAKER_19]: and with the MBTA in particular on these issues.

1783
02:23:38,156 --> 02:23:51,841
[SPEAKER_19]: For example, when the Orange Line shut down, our city government reached out to see what they needed from us when it came to traffic flows and traffic plans, and they didn't get any response from the MBTA when we reached out.

1784
02:23:52,921 --> 02:24:00,184
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's stuff like that that I think really damages the relationship between the MBTA and municipal governments in the area.

1785
02:24:01,125 --> 02:24:01,345
[SPEAKER_19]: But

1786
02:24:02,291 --> 02:24:04,972
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to say thank you for your effort.

1787
02:24:05,912 --> 02:24:13,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for bringing this up to us, and we will continue to do our best to stay the most organized municipality in Massachusetts.

1788
02:24:13,974 --> 02:24:20,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to mention, the feedback form is closed, but now the only way to submit feedback is to email it.

1789
02:24:21,716 --> 02:24:31,778
[SPEAKER_15]: And going to that activated feedback form link does tell you that you have to submit comments via the email address.

1790
02:24:32,890 --> 02:24:41,534
[SPEAKER_15]: But every step you take like that, I mean, every time people are forced to make that extra step, it decreases the number of people who are going to submit feedback.

1791
02:24:42,395 --> 02:24:43,836
[SPEAKER_15]: I had posters up all around.

1792
02:24:43,936 --> 02:24:46,357
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if any of you've noticed them on pink poster board.

1793
02:24:46,877 --> 02:24:49,799
[SPEAKER_15]: They have generated a huge response.

1794
02:24:50,399 --> 02:24:57,123
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to go around last weekend and change all of them, updating them with the new information.

1795
02:24:57,143 --> 02:25:01,445
[SPEAKER_15]: It was not, I'll just say it was a very time-consuming process.

1796
02:25:03,035 --> 02:25:07,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, the MBTA gets a considerable amount of money from Medford.

1797
02:25:07,798 --> 02:25:16,062
[SPEAKER_15]: And just regarding this overall bus network redesign, they want to have high frequency service on a small number of routes, but they don't have enough money to do it everywhere.

1798
02:25:16,562 --> 02:25:18,784
[SPEAKER_15]: So to do that, they have to cut service in other places.

1799
02:25:19,524 --> 02:25:22,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, the Southeast side of Medford is going to get the new high frequency 96.

1800
02:25:22,786 --> 02:25:27,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Initially, that was just going to stay really on the South border of Medford.

1801
02:25:27,868 --> 02:25:30,630
[SPEAKER_15]: And they claimed, oh, we're bringing high frequency service to Medford.

1802
02:25:31,075 --> 02:25:34,456
[SPEAKER_15]: where 90% of Medford would not have even been able to access it.

1803
02:25:35,676 --> 02:25:43,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Because of the petition that we did, we got the 96 back to Winthrop Street, which will help a larger segment of Medford access the bus.

1804
02:25:44,457 --> 02:25:49,998
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, a lot of West Medford and North Medford are being left with very little service.

1805
02:25:51,019 --> 02:25:54,519
[SPEAKER_15]: And generally, I mean, I'm in favor of high frequency service.

1806
02:25:55,279 --> 02:25:59,220
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they should go for it, but there should be a baseline

1807
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:05,101
[SPEAKER_15]: amount of service across the entire system before they start giving extra service to other people.

1808
02:26:06,041 --> 02:26:08,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is the issue that I have.

1809
02:26:10,263 --> 02:26:14,224
[SPEAKER_15]: You shouldn't be leaving large sections of Medford with no access.

1810
02:26:16,224 --> 02:26:20,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you, I've probably spoken with three or 400 people in the past three weeks.

1811
02:26:22,086 --> 02:26:27,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody is upset about this and still people do not know about it.

1812
02:26:27,848 --> 02:26:33,990
[SPEAKER_15]: When they announce that this is gonna start being implemented and these roots are gonna be cut, there is going to be chaos.

1813
02:26:34,730 --> 02:26:41,052
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, people have actually given me their phone number and said, if you organize a protest, call me up, I will come.

1814
02:26:41,072 --> 02:26:46,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm not at that point yet, but there may be spontaneous protests.

1815
02:26:48,855 --> 02:26:50,035
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want you to be aware of that.

1816
02:26:50,055 --> 02:26:56,457
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really hope that the city of Medford keeps pushing back against the service that is being taken away from other people and given

1817
02:26:57,846 --> 02:26:59,806
[SPEAKER_15]: to basically the southeast corner of Medford.

1818
02:27:00,207 --> 02:27:11,189
[SPEAKER_15]: As one person, she was from another town, but at one of the MBTA BNRD meetings said, some people are hitting the bus lottery and other people are being left with nothing.

1819
02:27:11,529 --> 02:27:12,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And that really is what it's like.

1820
02:27:12,910 --> 02:27:20,531
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, some people are going to be on these new high frequency routes that come every 15 minutes and other people will have no buses at all.

1821
02:27:21,432 --> 02:27:27,253
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to be distributed more equally before you start giving extra service to a small segment.

1822
02:27:28,227 --> 02:27:29,307
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you again.

1823
02:27:30,347 --> 02:27:32,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1824
02:27:32,288 --> 02:27:36,909
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate you for being your you're being so your nuance on this issue.

1825
02:27:37,029 --> 02:27:49,432
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's, it's, you're absolutely right that there are people in the city who will benefit from the plan, especially in South Medford and now metric hillside and I know they're bringing one express route back, which this council's been pushing for forever forever.

1826
02:27:51,501 --> 02:28:02,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you're right that, you know, the MBTA, I think oftentimes thinks of the subway extensions as a replacement for bus service, which it's not because they serve completely different goals.

1827
02:28:03,448 --> 02:28:06,570
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I totally hear you on West Medford, North Medford.

1828
02:28:07,190 --> 02:28:10,132
[SPEAKER_19]: They're clearly parts of the plan that are lacking.

1829
02:28:10,592 --> 02:28:13,654
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we'll keep pushing on those points as well.

1830
02:28:13,774 --> 02:28:14,074
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1831
02:28:17,376 --> 02:28:18,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

1832
02:28:19,085 --> 02:28:21,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and thank you to everyone.

1833
02:28:22,148 --> 02:28:27,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there should be further opportunities for us to address this as they ask us to change stops as well.

1834
02:28:27,893 --> 02:28:31,856
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's still more steps in the process before they move forward.

1835
02:28:31,876 --> 02:28:41,445
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to further amend this to also request that the MBTA maintain a consistent form of public comment and feedback so that they're not changing it up.

1836
02:28:44,577 --> 02:28:45,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the discussion.

1837
02:28:46,679 --> 02:28:51,103
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, as amended by Vice President Bears, name and address for the record, please.

1838
02:28:59,371 --> 02:29:00,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, your mic's off.

1839
02:29:02,073 --> 02:29:02,854
[SPEAKER_13]: The little person.

1840
02:29:04,735 --> 02:29:05,056
[SPEAKER_11]: You're good.

1841
02:29:05,296 --> 02:29:05,756
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, thanks.

1842
02:29:06,923 --> 02:29:14,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Has anyone looked into if there's a gap in service, is there something the city can do, and perhaps maybe generate some revenue while helping out the citizens.

1843
02:29:14,586 --> 02:29:15,906
[SPEAKER_14]: You have school buses.

1844
02:29:16,847 --> 02:29:30,412
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, I'm not saying compete with the MBTA but if the MBTA isn't going to move and you do have some infrastructure in place we have school buses we have drivers, perhaps there's an opportunity where the city can help the community and fill in the gap of the MBTA isn't going to cooperate.

1845
02:29:32,357 --> 02:29:32,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

1846
02:29:33,198 --> 02:29:51,236
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably not at the level that you're thinking of, but I do know PDS has been looking into it for the last few months and looking into grants that we could get from the state government to run kind of our own bus network or minivan network, something like that, that goes to different neighborhoods that are underserved, but they,

1847
02:29:52,522 --> 02:29:58,866
[SPEAKER_19]: To be completely transparent, I think they think that it'll take a few years for us to get that grant in the first place.

1848
02:29:59,306 --> 02:30:03,769
[SPEAKER_19]: But they are looking into it, and they're looking for ways to, I'm asking them for ways to expedite it.

1849
02:30:03,949 --> 02:30:04,209
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah.

1850
02:30:04,429 --> 02:30:05,130
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.

1851
02:30:05,210 --> 02:30:07,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Just point of information, Madam President.

1852
02:30:07,771 --> 02:30:13,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I also don't think it's a good idea for the city of Medford to start getting into the transportation business now.

1853
02:30:13,114 --> 02:30:15,416
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't even forget shopping pencils in City Hall.

1854
02:30:15,456 --> 02:30:17,597
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna start freaking running buses all over the city.

1855
02:30:17,637 --> 02:30:18,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, let's be honest here.

1856
02:30:19,298 --> 02:30:19,758
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1857
02:30:19,798 --> 02:30:22,880
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a parking department that we just opened up in a year, and it's been nothing but a nightmare.

1858
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:25,321
[SPEAKER_10]: If we take over a transit department, who the hell knows what's gonna happen.

1859
02:30:25,481 --> 02:30:28,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but this could actually make money instead of the parking department which is losing money.

1860
02:30:28,703 --> 02:30:40,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Given how much of the MBTA is publicly subsidized already, I doubt that it would be, you know, it's probably a loser on the profit and loss statement, but you can't always call Councilor Caraviello if you need a ride, so.

1861
02:30:44,373 --> 02:30:51,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't want to say it, but if there's other options for folks to use, even just information about what's available is probably helpful in the short term.

1862
02:30:55,025 --> 02:30:56,047
[SPEAKER_04]: New address for the record, please.

1863
02:30:56,797 --> 02:30:59,118
[SPEAKER_12]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1864
02:30:59,758 --> 02:31:03,298
[SPEAKER_12]: My main thing was actually just to reply to that last comment, which I think was really helpful.

1865
02:31:03,358 --> 02:31:05,719
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's good when people are thinking outside the box and stuff.

1866
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:09,120
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a way to make money, that's a way to spend money.

1867
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:12,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's going to be expensive to run buses all over the place.

1868
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:13,920
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a really good idea.

1869
02:31:14,601 --> 02:31:22,142
[SPEAKER_12]: You'd have to start saying, what you'd have to do is you'd have to start talking to property owners, say, hey, this is going to increase your property value.

1870
02:31:22,682 --> 02:31:24,243
[SPEAKER_12]: You're willing to raise taxes for that?

1871
02:31:24,303 --> 02:31:25,743
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're going to have to decide.

1872
02:31:28,024 --> 02:31:37,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Zach Councilor bears will approach them and this is Garpelli suggestion and hopefully they'll say yes to that.

1873
02:31:37,907 --> 02:31:45,490
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's what's gonna have to happen and I'd really be in support of that I'd be very excited to say you know if we want to improve, improve buses.

1874
02:31:46,331 --> 02:31:49,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's that we can pay for that, and the city can take it.

1875
02:31:51,252 --> 02:31:57,634
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just like to note that a lot of people have been saying yes to a lot of ideas and I believe in lately.

1876
02:32:13,728 --> 02:32:16,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say yes to this idea, absolutely, to be clear.

1877
02:32:16,991 --> 02:32:34,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's one more thing I was going to say, and that is that I do think that as we go through this idea of the high frequency transit, I think that one real benefit of that is that it's going to provide a lot of opportunities where people really can

1878
02:32:35,406 --> 02:32:38,707
[SPEAKER_12]: the practical level live in a lot more sections of Bedford without a car.

1879
02:32:38,727 --> 02:32:45,590
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we're gonna we could we could have more development going up without massive parking lots.

1880
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:50,491
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's going to help the housing crisis going to be up for businesses.

1881
02:32:50,831 --> 02:32:55,293
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll create under our tax scheme, it'll also create more tax revenue for the city.

1882
02:32:55,333 --> 02:32:59,755
[SPEAKER_12]: So as that happens, I hope the city will take advantage to do that.

1883
02:32:59,795 --> 02:33:00,435
[SPEAKER_12]: So to get so on.

1884
02:33:00,515 --> 02:33:00,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1885
02:33:00,795 --> 02:33:01,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1886
02:33:04,057 --> 02:33:05,241
[SPEAKER_04]: As you also said, thank you.

1887
02:33:05,643 --> 02:33:09,336
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Bears as amended by Vice President Bears, seconded by...

1888
02:33:12,057 --> 02:33:13,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins all those in favor.

1889
02:33:13,418 --> 02:33:29,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I was opposed motion passes to three dash 025 offered by Kansas City Council and by a member of the city administration, Neil Osborne and a representative from the Medford Fire Department to discuss issues and concerns dealing with fire trucks and human resource questions.

1890
02:33:29,569 --> 02:33:35,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President, to be just if we can call these representatives from

1891
02:33:35,973 --> 02:33:41,857
[SPEAKER_08]: These fields, I think that there's some questions that were brought up tonight that we really need to get some clarification as city councilors.

1892
02:33:42,357 --> 02:33:46,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other piece is also the fleet, dealing with the fleet.

1893
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:51,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there's a few trucks down right now, and we do have a Boston City truck.

1894
02:33:51,963 --> 02:33:54,104
[SPEAKER_08]: People have been asking me, why do we have a Boston City truck?

1895
02:33:54,584 --> 02:33:57,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I've talked to a few firefighters and they explained, so there's reasons for it.

1896
02:33:58,307 --> 02:34:05,151
[SPEAKER_08]: But it'd be nice if we get a report dealing with this with all the parties involved, meaning

1897
02:34:05,571 --> 02:34:11,213
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, city administration, the HR director and representative for the fight upon but that'd be great.

1898
02:34:11,794 --> 02:34:28,961
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I could call for that make a motion for next week, our next meeting to invite all those parties to be present the meeting, city regular city council meeting just to give us a brief update on what's going on to so we have an understanding but I don't see it happening but it's just a thought.

1899
02:34:29,221 --> 02:34:29,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1900
02:34:30,081 --> 02:34:30,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1901
02:34:31,342 --> 02:34:33,823
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm sorry, just to quickly clarify.

1902
02:34:33,843 --> 02:34:34,443
[SPEAKER_13]: So this would

1903
02:34:35,255 --> 02:34:36,795
[SPEAKER_13]: item would reappear on the agenda for 2014.

1904
02:34:59,438 --> 02:35:02,779
[SPEAKER_08]: It's distracting and devastating working in the municipality.

1905
02:35:03,059 --> 02:35:07,801
[SPEAKER_08]: What was said tonight, that you have to wait for the open enrollment, not true.

1906
02:35:07,961 --> 02:35:10,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I could tell you that working firsthand.

1907
02:35:11,422 --> 02:35:27,928
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do want all the parties in place so we can dispel any rumors and move forward to try to help our firefighters who don't have insurance, and at the same time, also ask for the representatives of the fire department here to tell us what we need to know.

1908
02:35:28,753 --> 02:35:34,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, so with those intentions, is the motion to table it until the next meeting and invite those folks?

1909
02:35:35,176 --> 02:35:35,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, if we can.

1910
02:35:35,756 --> 02:35:37,557
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the whole idea is, to approve it and then.

1911
02:35:37,577 --> 02:35:40,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Approve it, okay, and then have it, approve it and have it reappear on the next.

1912
02:35:41,138 --> 02:35:41,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1913
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:43,059
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you like?

1914
02:35:43,079 --> 02:35:53,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that the council would consult with the council to make sure that it's on the agenda for the next meeting.

1915
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:06,902
[SPEAKER_08]: If we change the wording, say we would like them to report back.

1916
02:36:07,683 --> 02:36:10,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so if we can't, just... Thanks.

1917
02:36:10,605 --> 02:36:11,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone understand that?

1918
02:36:11,305 --> 02:36:12,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, sorry about that.

1919
02:36:13,066 --> 02:36:20,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Councilor Stickler, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Perez.

1920
02:36:20,911 --> 02:36:21,572
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1921
02:36:21,752 --> 02:36:21,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1922
02:36:22,092 --> 02:36:22,852
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1923
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:23,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1924
02:36:23,893 --> 02:36:25,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Stickler.

1925
02:36:25,854 --> 02:36:27,976
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-026 offer... What?

1926
02:36:28,356 --> 02:36:29,116
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's a stickler.

1927
02:36:29,637 --> 02:36:29,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1928
02:36:30,897 --> 02:36:31,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone, I don't know.

1929
02:36:35,626 --> 02:36:38,228
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-026 offered by Vice President Bears.

1930
02:36:38,248 --> 02:36:42,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved by the Metro City Council that the Elections Department and local U.S.

1931
02:36:42,170 --> 02:36:47,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Postal Service communicate with residents about when they can expect to receive their census forms given the recent mail delays.

1932
02:36:47,614 --> 02:36:57,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that the Elections Manager and Elections Commission provide an update on the status of the 2022 Elections After Action Report requested by the City Council last fall.

1933
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:57,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

1934
02:36:59,061 --> 02:36:59,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

1935
02:37:01,828 --> 02:37:04,270
[SPEAKER_13]: It is season for city census forms.

1936
02:37:04,330 --> 02:37:11,916
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't fill out your census form, you'll be marked as an inactive voter, and you'll have to provide additional information to become an active voter again when you go to vote in November.

1937
02:37:13,518 --> 02:37:24,407
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I just want to make sure that given there's been a lot of mail disruption and delays in mail across the city, that, you know, A, that the forms are sent out and that, you know, they'll be accepted

1938
02:37:25,208 --> 02:37:31,772
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, potentially extending the deadline by which they'll be accepted or making clear to people that as long as they submit them before X date, they will be marked inactive.

1939
02:37:31,792 --> 02:37:36,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that really needs to be clarified because there are places, you know, folks have been reporting, it's spot reporting.

1940
02:37:37,155 --> 02:37:41,178
[SPEAKER_13]: My mail has been pretty good, but people have been spot reporting, not getting mail for three or four days at a time.

1941
02:37:41,898 --> 02:37:49,042
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's funny because my mail has been good every day and you live, yeah, you live like five minute walk and it's not coming to you.

1942
02:37:49,142 --> 02:37:50,843
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's been different issues.

1943
02:37:50,884 --> 02:37:54,426
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that USPS is understaffed and there's also some national issues there,

1944
02:37:55,532 --> 02:38:05,015
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, really just want to get that communicated out because I know folks, they maybe some folks expect the census to come at a certain time and then it doesn't come so they're not expecting it when it does.

1945
02:38:05,035 --> 02:38:09,617
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're not looking for whatever it may be just maybe do a little bit of additional communicating with the city.

1946
02:38:10,677 --> 02:38:22,501
[SPEAKER_13]: We also did receive the elections after action report today at 416pm so that second clause is not is not there but I do know that

1947
02:38:24,420 --> 02:38:25,080
[SPEAKER_13]: I have two questions.

1948
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:27,301
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't been able to read that report, so I don't know what it says.

1949
02:38:27,361 --> 02:38:29,161
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to put that out there.

1950
02:38:29,181 --> 02:38:31,282
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have two questions.

1951
02:38:32,922 --> 02:38:37,064
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to strike that second paragraph of the resolution.

1952
02:38:37,124 --> 02:38:39,824
[SPEAKER_13]: I propose the amendment to strike that since we did receive the report.

1953
02:38:40,545 --> 02:38:42,185
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like to replace it with two things.

1954
02:38:42,305 --> 02:38:45,126
[SPEAKER_13]: The first would be, and Mr. Clerk, let me know when you're ready.

1955
02:38:51,408 --> 02:38:52,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it further resolved

1956
02:38:53,984 --> 02:39:14,968
[SPEAKER_13]: that the elections manager and elections commission share whether postcards will be mailed to all residents before the 2023 municipal election.

1957
02:39:22,997 --> 02:39:25,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Asking them if they want.

1958
02:39:25,738 --> 02:39:27,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, go ahead.

1959
02:39:27,639 --> 02:39:28,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are we up to?

1960
02:39:28,299 --> 02:39:31,020
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 o'clock.

1961
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:32,861
[SPEAKER_06]: That too.

1962
02:39:32,881 --> 02:39:38,723
[SPEAKER_06]: If they want to vote by mail.

1963
02:39:50,623 --> 02:40:02,346
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd also like to amend it to include, you know, put in reports do that the 2023 election after action report and invite the elections manager to present that report and have a discussion with the council.

1964
02:40:05,807 --> 02:40:09,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I just like the to add to reports do the 2023 the 2022 election after action report.

1965
02:40:14,267 --> 02:40:18,351
[SPEAKER_13]: and request that the election manager come to present it and discuss it.

1966
02:40:18,431 --> 02:40:19,612
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can email that to you after.

1967
02:40:20,653 --> 02:40:25,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Just want everyone to know what I'm requesting.

1968
02:40:25,277 --> 02:40:25,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1969
02:40:25,737 --> 02:40:29,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, uh, informed just to share some information.

1970
02:40:30,021 --> 02:40:31,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1971
02:40:31,342 --> 02:40:38,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but the it is it is, uh, to the public that, um, as of January 24th that, um,

1972
02:40:41,142 --> 02:40:48,005
[SPEAKER_08]: The 2023 annual census will be arriving in your mailboxes within next week, which means it should be arriving this week or next week.

1973
02:40:48,065 --> 02:40:49,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody should look out for that.

1974
02:40:50,106 --> 02:40:59,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, just to reiterate, the importance of the census plays a lot to do with what funding we get here in the city of Medford.

1975
02:40:59,389 --> 02:41:05,911
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very important that people do their due diligence in making sure they fill out the census.

1976
02:41:05,951 --> 02:41:06,452
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1977
02:41:08,472 --> 02:41:09,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, thank you.

1978
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:21,842
[SPEAKER_03]: With the delay of mail, I think we've all been getting barraged with phone calls and emails, and I've been referring everybody to Congressman Clark and Senator Warren and Senator Maki.

1979
02:41:22,583 --> 02:41:31,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they think we have something to do with it, and when I try to explain that we don't, then don't call your state representative because they don't have anything to do with it.

1980
02:41:32,042 --> 02:41:35,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a federal issue, but you've got to barrage them and tell them.

1981
02:41:36,064 --> 02:41:41,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I get mailed every couple of days, and a couple of weeks ago, I got a mail at 10 o'clock on a Saturday night.

1982
02:41:43,246 --> 02:41:47,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my ring bell goes off, and I see this guy walking up the stairs at 10 o'clock.

1983
02:41:47,948 --> 02:41:48,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying, who's this?

1984
02:41:48,648 --> 02:41:49,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the mailman.

1985
02:41:50,229 --> 02:41:51,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I was forced to do a double route.

1986
02:41:51,810 --> 02:41:54,851
[SPEAKER_03]: But Wakeman's pays more money than the post office now.

1987
02:41:56,280 --> 02:42:05,444
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you know that they're not you know they don't want to pay anything but yeah yeah yeah you have to talk to just you know continue to call you the federal representatives to get this mail situation straighter straight away.

1988
02:42:06,704 --> 02:42:07,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1989
02:42:07,965 --> 02:42:15,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilmember bears brings up a good point and it really never was a practice is something that I experienced previously.

1990
02:42:16,504 --> 02:42:24,305
[SPEAKER_10]: where when you don't fill out the census, you get removed from the voter rolls, and it's created some significant level of confusion across the community.

1991
02:42:24,345 --> 02:42:33,787
[SPEAKER_10]: In my historic involvement in the city, up until we hired an election coordinator, we really never removed anybody from the rolls if they didn't participate in the census.

1992
02:42:34,787 --> 02:42:43,189
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get into a situation where someone gets removed from the voter rolls for not filling out the census, now they become an uninformed voter, because now they're not on the voter rolls, so they don't get mail.

1993
02:42:44,615 --> 02:42:45,716
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't get mail, right?

1994
02:42:45,736 --> 02:42:47,056
[SPEAKER_10]: So they get mail from no candidate.

1995
02:42:47,157 --> 02:42:48,537
[SPEAKER_10]: So they become an uninformed voter.

1996
02:42:48,918 --> 02:42:50,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So now you have an uninformed voter.

1997
02:42:50,218 --> 02:42:53,881
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me, for example, I haven't missed an election since I was 18 years old.

1998
02:42:53,961 --> 02:42:55,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't fill up the census this year.

1999
02:42:55,862 --> 02:42:57,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to go last year.

2000
02:42:57,182 --> 02:42:59,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to go vote and I wasn't allowed to vote.

2001
02:42:59,944 --> 02:43:00,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the ballot.

2002
02:43:04,327 --> 02:43:06,328
[SPEAKER_05]: My name was on the ballot, but I wasn't allowed to vote.

2003
02:43:08,067 --> 02:43:08,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bad practice.

2004
02:43:08,968 --> 02:43:09,368
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why?

2005
02:43:09,408 --> 02:43:18,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that person that goes into the voter booth to vote and they get told that they can't or that they're not on the list or that they're inactive is going to turn around and walk out the door and there's a chance they might not come back.

2006
02:43:18,853 --> 02:43:24,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we have someone that's become an uninformed voter because they're not getting any mail from the candidates because they're not showing up on the voter rolls.

2007
02:43:25,452 --> 02:43:29,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when they go to vote, it's actually an impediment for them to cast in their ballot.

2008
02:43:29,755 --> 02:43:31,636
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the practice needs to be looked at.

2009
02:43:32,396 --> 02:43:36,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it was never an issue up until we created this election coordinators position.

2010
02:43:36,819 --> 02:43:38,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we have an election manager.

2011
02:43:38,778 --> 02:43:40,359
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's a practice that needs to be looked at.

2012
02:43:40,399 --> 02:43:46,040
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a policy that needs to be reviewed because, you know, everybody talks about wanting to drive more people out to the polls.

2013
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:47,421
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we get more people out to the polls?

2014
02:43:47,441 --> 02:43:48,621
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have election day anymore.

2015
02:43:48,661 --> 02:43:50,441
[SPEAKER_10]: We get like election month for cry-eye, right?

2016
02:43:50,461 --> 02:43:51,162
[SPEAKER_10]: You can mail it in.

2017
02:43:51,202 --> 02:43:55,803
[SPEAKER_10]: You can come in from, you know, pretty soon we're going to be able to vote through our television or do it on the internet, right?

2018
02:43:56,363 --> 02:44:01,325
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's going to be able to be something you can vote for whoever you want, whatever you want for this month, you know what I mean?

2019
02:44:01,645 --> 02:44:07,507
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, the way that we're expanding access to voting, it doesn't make sense to me to take people off the rolls for not filling out the census.

2020
02:44:08,427 --> 02:44:13,409
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think that there's a better practice or a better way that we can look at it, especially if you look at the vote history of an individual.

2021
02:44:13,429 --> 02:44:21,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you're going to see someone that voted in 15 municipal elections in a row or 20 elections in a row and you're taking them off the rolls, but you know, they lived there, they paid the tax bill.

2022
02:44:22,332 --> 02:44:24,973
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's just something that I find very confusing when you can't, you know,

2023
02:44:25,353 --> 02:44:27,695
[SPEAKER_10]: the way the system set up, you can't register to vote in two communities.

2024
02:44:27,715 --> 02:44:28,316
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

2025
02:44:28,336 --> 02:44:30,478
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to get caught because so I don't know.

2026
02:44:30,498 --> 02:44:34,601
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, I don't think it's a great practice that's conducive to promoting participation in elections.

2027
02:44:35,722 --> 02:44:37,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2028
02:44:37,984 --> 02:44:39,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

2029
02:44:39,706 --> 02:44:40,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I had my hand up.

2030
02:44:43,089 --> 02:44:45,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to clarify one quick thing.

2031
02:44:46,177 --> 02:44:53,104
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just that you're marked inactive it's something you're taking off so you're still registered to vote, but you do have to provide additional documentation around your, around your address.

2032
02:44:53,824 --> 02:44:56,547
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is definitely a barrier that's created when you're marked inactive.

2033
02:44:57,528 --> 02:45:07,639
[SPEAKER_13]: I do believe, though, that that's actually a function of state law so I don't think it's a city policy, but I'd be definitely be interested in thought it was like one of those things where you have, you may not shout.

2034
02:45:07,979 --> 02:45:09,199
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be good to know.

2035
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:12,400
[SPEAKER_13]: My understanding is it isn't, but if it's the other way around.

2036
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:16,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still blaming you for kicking everybody off the road four years ago.

2037
02:45:16,862 --> 02:45:21,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is one reason why I've reviewed this section of the law.

2038
02:45:23,223 --> 02:45:28,565
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I just wanted to clarify that and further just state that when I bring up working with the local U.S.

2039
02:45:28,625 --> 02:45:32,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Postal Service, I mean the staff at the Medford branch of the post office.

2040
02:45:33,346 --> 02:45:35,967
[SPEAKER_13]: In the past, there has been a historic relationship between

2041
02:45:36,647 --> 02:45:45,109
[SPEAKER_13]: the registrar voters, now the Elections Commission and that office, especially as it relates to absentee ballots and vote by mail and the city census to make sure those things go out in a timely manner.

2042
02:45:45,509 --> 02:45:55,952
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to make sure that that relationship is maintained and that that continues to happen as you noted, and everyone's noted that there is just a lot more election related mail happening now with so much vote by mail.

2043
02:45:55,992 --> 02:45:57,013
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Madam President.

2044
02:45:57,173 --> 02:45:57,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2045
02:45:58,353 --> 02:46:01,714
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Bears as amended by Vice President Bears, seconded by

2046
02:46:02,626 --> 02:46:03,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

2047
02:46:04,007 --> 02:46:04,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

2048
02:46:04,327 --> 02:46:05,648
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

2049
02:46:05,828 --> 02:46:06,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

2050
02:46:07,009 --> 02:46:08,050
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-027 offered by Councilor Tseng.

2051
02:46:08,290 --> 02:46:28,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the city council ask the city administration to inform residents about 2023 tax credits they can receive through clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including but not limited to up to $1,200 in credit each year for adding insulation or installing efficient windows and doors, up to 30% of the cost of installing battery storage.

2052
02:46:28,558 --> 02:46:42,756
[SPEAKER_04]: up to $600 off the cost of a panel upgrade, up to $150 off the cost of an energy audit, 30% of the cost of buying and installing a heat pump up to $2,000, including support for any electric system upgrades needed to make the home heat pump ready.

2053
02:46:43,304 --> 02:46:49,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Residents can find a more extensive list of incentives and rebates, as well as more information about the program at cleanenergy.gov.

2054
02:46:50,047 --> 02:46:50,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

2055
02:46:50,787 --> 02:46:51,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Morell.

2056
02:46:51,967 --> 02:46:54,548
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be brief because this resolution kind of says it all.

2057
02:46:55,809 --> 02:47:05,192
[SPEAKER_19]: The Inflation Reduction Act has a lot of provisions that give financial incentives and rebates for people to make energy efficient upgrades to their homes.

2058
02:47:05,252 --> 02:47:07,553
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that's something that a lot of Medford families are looking to do.

2059
02:47:09,554 --> 02:47:12,436
[SPEAKER_19]: they might be able to take advantage of this program.

2060
02:47:13,857 --> 02:47:16,879
[SPEAKER_19]: I only recently saw on the President's Instagram account.

2061
02:47:17,320 --> 02:47:36,313
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there are tons of different ways of getting information from the government, but I know a lot of people pay attention to the city government, to the Medford government, and so this would be a good thing for our city to do, especially to meet our clean energy goals with regards to buildings.

2062
02:47:37,065 --> 02:47:37,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

2063
02:47:38,105 --> 02:47:38,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

2064
02:47:38,765 --> 02:47:39,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, ma'am.

2065
02:47:39,606 --> 02:47:44,507
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these things are included in the, every month when you get your electric bill, they're in there.

2066
02:47:45,307 --> 02:47:47,868
[SPEAKER_03]: They always, that's part of the stuff you throw away when you open it up.

2067
02:47:48,868 --> 02:47:49,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Or recycle.

2068
02:47:49,448 --> 02:47:51,128
[SPEAKER_03]: If you actually read.

2069
02:47:52,489 --> 02:47:59,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I personally have taken advantage of some of these things here, but every month they're in your bill and with all the other stuff there.

2070
02:47:59,310 --> 02:48:02,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And they encourage you to, like I just did a new energy audit.

2071
02:48:02,911 --> 02:48:04,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've got, I have two new heat pumps.

2072
02:48:07,639 --> 02:48:09,300
[SPEAKER_03]: the on the wall on demand or water.

2073
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:14,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've taken advantage of things and I find out most of the time it's through my electric bill.

2074
02:48:14,602 --> 02:48:15,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And because they're inside there.

2075
02:48:16,523 --> 02:48:20,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I say these are good things and people should take advantage of them.

2076
02:48:20,564 --> 02:48:23,646
[SPEAKER_13]: For those who have gone paperless, they may not be getting it.

2077
02:48:23,886 --> 02:48:24,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, Madam President.

2078
02:48:25,747 --> 02:48:26,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't.

2079
02:48:34,476 --> 02:48:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to vamp for you.

2080
02:48:35,857 --> 02:48:36,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm recognizing you.

2081
02:48:37,238 --> 02:48:39,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just recognizing you.

2082
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:40,100
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's fine.

2083
02:48:40,220 --> 02:48:40,841
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fine.

2084
02:48:41,041 --> 02:48:41,881
[SPEAKER_07]: You vamp.

2085
02:48:41,941 --> 02:48:43,883
[SPEAKER_07]: You vamp.

2086
02:48:43,983 --> 02:48:45,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm recognizing you.

2087
02:48:45,884 --> 02:48:48,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to offer it up if people want to talk more.

2088
02:48:48,746 --> 02:48:50,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because we can't vote right now.

2089
02:48:50,528 --> 02:48:51,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2090
02:48:52,389 --> 02:48:53,630
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, madam.

2091
02:48:54,230 --> 02:48:55,891
[SPEAKER_04]: The most disrespectful member by far.

2092
02:49:02,212 --> 02:49:06,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Since two weeks ago.

2093
02:49:07,375 --> 02:49:09,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we're not here till 1am every night, right?

2094
02:49:09,296 --> 02:49:10,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Take your time out.

2095
02:49:11,518 --> 02:49:12,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Zach's a judge.

2096
02:49:13,399 --> 02:49:14,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask Nicole.

2097
02:49:15,360 --> 02:49:17,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Just wanted to talk about paperless billing.

2098
02:49:17,581 --> 02:49:18,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Please speak.

2099
02:49:18,822 --> 02:49:20,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean to cut you off.

2100
02:49:20,202 --> 02:49:21,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I just meant to recognize you.

2101
02:49:21,263 --> 02:49:22,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love it tomorrow.

2102
02:49:22,384 --> 02:49:25,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Scarpelli's next fight.

2103
02:49:27,887 --> 02:49:28,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

2104
02:49:29,688 --> 02:49:30,428
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.

2105
02:49:32,020 --> 02:49:32,320
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm good.

2106
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:32,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

2107
02:49:32,721 --> 02:49:33,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was.

2108
02:49:33,321 --> 02:49:40,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I already forgot was famous on the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor carving out all those in favor.

2109
02:49:40,928 --> 02:49:42,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose motion passes.

2110
02:49:44,443 --> 02:49:47,044
[SPEAKER_04]: 22-028 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

2111
02:49:47,064 --> 02:49:54,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it so resolved that Medford City Council, DPW, and engineering departments have Eversource repaint the line on Winthrop Street that has faded in less than three months in the interest of public safety.

2112
02:49:55,105 --> 02:49:55,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

2113
02:49:55,865 --> 02:49:56,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

2114
02:49:56,746 --> 02:50:03,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if we went by, the lines had been repainted and the cones that have been there for the last three days are there.

2115
02:50:04,187 --> 02:50:10,969
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing you do notice, since the lines have been painted, you can notice all the valleys and all the things.

2116
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:20,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It fathomed, I'm really bothered by, in front of the high school, why you're having traffic go into each other.

2117
02:50:21,385 --> 02:50:24,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't see the safety of that.

2118
02:50:24,787 --> 02:50:27,389
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gonna be a head-on collision there, and it's gonna be our fault.

2119
02:50:27,989 --> 02:50:32,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And those lines are all, they're just not straight, they're all over the place.

2120
02:50:33,212 --> 02:50:38,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I did talk with Director Blake specifically about the high school, and there is gonna be some adjustment to that in the spring.

2121
02:50:38,516 --> 02:50:40,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, someone's gonna die.

2122
02:50:40,317 --> 02:50:40,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2123
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:46,423
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd say what it has done, point of clarification, it has, spring of 2023.

2124
02:50:46,463 --> 02:50:49,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's told this spring.

2125
02:50:49,406 --> 02:50:50,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2126
02:50:50,647 --> 02:50:55,771
[SPEAKER_02]: It has accentuated all the valleys in that great paving job that we did there.

2127
02:50:56,631 --> 02:51:00,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, can we be clear that not water-based paint this time?

2128
02:51:00,414 --> 02:51:01,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with that.

2129
02:51:01,515 --> 02:51:01,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2130
02:51:02,016 --> 02:51:02,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2131
02:51:02,336 --> 02:51:03,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you, Councilor Caraviello and Ed.

2132
02:51:04,057 --> 02:51:07,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, one more thing.

2133
02:51:08,601 --> 02:51:09,262
[SPEAKER_03]: The speed tables.

2134
02:51:10,721 --> 02:51:20,942
[SPEAKER_03]: where the speed tables if there could be a light there because at nighttime people can't see the speed table and listen people don't adhere to the law all the time uh and they fly over them and and uh

2135
02:51:22,687 --> 02:51:25,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And it said that that causes more of a safety hazard than what's there.

2136
02:51:25,949 --> 02:51:43,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did get a, seeing that we're talking about lines and things, I did get a call from a resident asking that the crosswalk at Harvard Ave and High be repainted, because that's where you get a lot of kids cross there in the interest of public safety.

2137
02:51:43,298 --> 02:51:45,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can get that done too, I'd appreciate it.

2138
02:51:45,479 --> 02:51:46,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, would you like those as amendments?

2139
02:51:47,400 --> 02:51:47,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

2140
02:51:48,668 --> 02:51:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion.

2141
02:51:50,289 --> 02:51:51,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do.

2142
02:51:51,090 --> 02:51:52,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I appreciate you bringing this forward.

2143
02:51:52,291 --> 02:51:52,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I live right there.

2144
02:51:52,852 --> 02:51:53,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So I noticed the new lines.

2145
02:51:53,813 --> 02:51:59,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I am curious as to Councilor Scarpelli's joke, but why, why was this paint in this condition in the first place?

2146
02:52:00,058 --> 02:52:02,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did we get paint that basically disappeared?

2147
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:03,161
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't see anything.

2148
02:52:03,990 --> 02:52:05,130
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if we can get an answer to that.

2149
02:52:05,310 --> 02:52:05,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I know why.

2150
02:52:05,910 --> 02:52:08,891
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because we complain that we call them up here so many times.

2151
02:52:08,931 --> 02:52:10,731
[SPEAKER_10]: So the administration said, you're making us look bad.

2152
02:52:10,751 --> 02:52:15,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you put something down and see how long it's going to last just to get the noise to go away?

2153
02:52:15,472 --> 02:52:15,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2154
02:52:15,853 --> 02:52:16,473
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

2155
02:52:16,493 --> 02:52:16,913
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why.

2156
02:52:17,493 --> 02:52:18,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2157
02:52:19,193 --> 02:52:24,334
[SPEAKER_13]: My understanding is that they had to use, they didn't use like the thermoplastic permanent paint because of the season.

2158
02:52:25,595 --> 02:52:25,835
[SPEAKER_13]: You know?

2159
02:52:25,895 --> 02:52:26,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

2160
02:52:26,155 --> 02:52:27,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I understand, but.

2161
02:52:29,417 --> 02:52:30,318
[SPEAKER_13]: It's clearly didn't last.

2162
02:52:30,378 --> 02:52:35,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not defending it, but my understanding was they were planning to go back and do a better job in the spring and they let it go too long in the winter.

2163
02:52:35,986 --> 02:52:39,631
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's probably an indication of what we were talking about around the whole scheduling thing.

2164
02:52:40,493 --> 02:52:45,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, not to blame any specific party as to why things need to be scheduled the way they need to be scheduled, but it seems that the

2165
02:52:46,218 --> 02:52:48,759
[SPEAKER_13]: reason the paint went out is that it was scheduled incorrectly.

2166
02:52:48,779 --> 02:52:54,820
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason that there did multiple passes and there are seams is because it was not scheduled in such a way that they could do a complete pour.

2167
02:52:55,360 --> 02:52:59,061
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, it goes back to this question of scheduling really at the end of the day.

2168
02:52:59,341 --> 02:53:00,461
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard they blamed the police chief.

2169
02:53:00,961 --> 02:53:01,482
[SPEAKER_13]: It's his fault.

2170
02:53:02,482 --> 02:53:04,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and again, I'm not blaming anybody.

2171
02:53:04,402 --> 02:53:04,842
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not you.

2172
02:53:04,902 --> 02:53:06,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm saying Eversource was told that.

2173
02:53:06,623 --> 02:53:08,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they said it was an issue with details.

2174
02:53:08,503 --> 02:53:10,664
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they need to come together and get a better plan, right?

2175
02:53:10,724 --> 02:53:11,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that's really the answer.

2176
02:53:11,604 --> 02:53:12,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially for the second half.

2177
02:53:12,624 --> 02:53:13,384
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's important.

2178
02:53:14,025 --> 02:53:15,225
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a resolution for next month.

2179

[SPEAKER_08]: of situation Harris Park where dogs are actually inside the basketball courts with the gates closed and people running around dogs running around and residents not being able to use those areas because there are dogs off leash.

2232
02:58:57,838 --> 02:59:00,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we just got a report back one from.

2233
02:59:02,470 --> 02:59:17,074
[SPEAKER_08]: from the mayor's office I know they talked about this pilot program that they wanted to start if that was something that if that they've started that and we just weren't informed, and then if we can, especially in the Harris Park area, if we can have.

2234
02:59:19,031 --> 02:59:29,156
[SPEAKER_08]: the health department code enforcement officer, maybe, um, request them to check that area, um, for unleashed dogs, especially with that playground area, right?

2235
02:59:29,196 --> 02:59:34,338
[SPEAKER_08]: So being so popular, I think it's important that we just look out for the safety of our Children.

2236
02:59:34,418 --> 02:59:34,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2237
02:59:35,059 --> 02:59:35,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2238
02:59:36,059 --> 02:59:42,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the previous conversation about those off leash in the parks, the mayor did respond, saying they've only sent out a survey.

2239
02:59:42,082 --> 02:59:46,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that remains true, but that was a response a few weeks ago.

2240
02:59:47,485 --> 02:59:47,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh,

2241
02:59:48,980 --> 02:59:51,988

02:59:59,295 --> 03:00:05,837
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-030 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved by the Medford City Council, whereas we are coming up on the 10th anniversary of the Marathon bombing.

2247
03:00:06,717 --> 03:00:09,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to open the Crystal Campbell Fountain that has been closed for two years?

2248
03:00:09,799 --> 03:00:11,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the funds be allocated for that part?

2249
03:00:12,079 --> 03:00:12,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

2250
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:13,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

2251
03:00:13,560 --> 03:00:15,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I put this out there last year.

2252
03:00:16,021 --> 03:00:19,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going on the second or third year that that fountain has been closed.

2253
03:00:20,202 --> 03:00:21,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep hearing there's a part.

2254
03:00:23,176 --> 03:00:25,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where this pot's coming from.

2255
03:00:25,058 --> 03:00:29,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why this fountain can't be opened.

2256
03:00:29,924 --> 03:00:32,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are coming upon the 10th anniversary of the bombing.

2257
03:00:32,567 --> 03:00:35,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to have that open, maybe have a little ceremony via that date.

2258
03:00:37,151 --> 03:00:47,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was there when this was first over and I think there should be a fund allocated for repairs and upkeep of that fountain.

2259
03:00:48,219 --> 03:00:58,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the mayor could submit a report back to us, if there is any funds and what the amount of funds are on there and why the fountain still isn't working years later.

2260
03:00:58,830 --> 03:01:03,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, you know on the appointment of President Tom I recall when we went through this process.

2261
03:01:04,652 --> 03:01:14,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe, I think, Rick and I were the only two that were on the council at the time, yeah man McGlynn was the mayor, and what man McGlynn did was he had a huge fundraiser.

2262
03:01:15,234 --> 03:01:17,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And at this fundraiser, they raised a ton of money.

2263
03:01:18,197 --> 03:01:25,905
[SPEAKER_10]: for private donors to create a maintenance and upkeep fund that would maintain the upkeep of the fountain.

2264
03:01:26,685 --> 03:01:31,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Then the fountain COVID came the phone has been shut off for at least three years right at least three years.

2265
03:01:31,530 --> 03:01:41,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, at least three years, but there's a dedicated account here in City Hall and Councilor Caraviello is on point with this we need to find out what balance is left in that account because

2266
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:48,524
[SPEAKER_10]: based upon the financial spending habits that I'm seeing with this administration, the lack of financial and fiscal transparency and responsibility.

2267
03:01:49,185 --> 03:01:55,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking to myself that we're in a very significant fiscal crisis here in this community, because they're not sharing any financial documents with us.

2268
03:01:55,970 --> 03:01:58,531
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not showing us the Warren articles where the money is getting spent.

2269
03:01:58,811 --> 03:02:03,855
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not providing us with the quarterly updates that we're asking for and what the status of our financial picture is here in the community.

2270
03:02:04,195 --> 03:02:12,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's leading me to believe that these accounts that are sitting around for a little bit of time that had a dedicated and committed purpose that people have forgotten about are going to be getting graded soon.

2271
03:02:12,497 --> 03:02:13,397
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to see that.

2272
03:02:14,437 --> 03:02:14,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2273
03:02:15,397 --> 03:02:20,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of cancer Caraviello, as amended by cancer Caraviello and cancer night.

2274
03:02:20,739 --> 03:02:24,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Second by cancer night all in favor.

2277
03:02:37,316 --> 03:02:44,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, Vice President Bears.

2278
