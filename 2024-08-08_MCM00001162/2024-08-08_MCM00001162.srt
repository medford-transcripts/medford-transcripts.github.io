1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:09,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the August 7, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Ethics Reporting Subcommittee.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,604
[SPEAKER_04]: First, did you look over the minutes from our last meeting?

3
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:18,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, move approval.

4
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:19,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

5
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:21,709
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

6
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:22,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

8
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

9
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:26,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically,

10
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,754
[SPEAKER_04]: What we have to do tonight, right?

11
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:39,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Eunice, I don't know if you have any thoughts, but we basically have to come up with, well, here's the question.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to come up with the language?

13
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:49,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we also can just come up with the parameters and then let the call-in center do the language.

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:50,747
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do that too.

15
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:58,793
[SPEAKER_04]: We can give to the call-in center, okay, this is what we want, this is how we want it to work, etc., and then they'll write it.

16
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:06,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess I'm a little, so we've established that we want an ethics commission.

17
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:13,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, technically the committee voted just for the annual financial reporting.

18
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:14,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

19
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:25,749
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also in that discussion, there didn't seem to be a great desire to use the state form.

20
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:28,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

21
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:31,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would, I would, you know, caution against using the state for right now.

22
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:33,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it needs to be more targeted.

23
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for the purpose of the charter, the only way to handle that.

24
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:41,456
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to task somebody with the creation of the form.

25
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:45,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's either going to be an ethics commission or the city council.

26
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the city council is going to write the ordinance.

27
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if the city council is writing the ordinance.

28
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:53,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Then.

29
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they not establishing the who, what, and where of the commission?

30
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:00,859
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:18,674
[SPEAKER_04]: What we can do in the charter if we want to create an ethics commission is lay out the parameters for the commission in the charter and say that the mayor will instruct the city council to create an ordinance to implement that.

32
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,337
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can say in the charter,

33
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:41,908
[SPEAKER_04]: ethics commission, the composition of that commission, the qualifications, how long they serve, who appoints, what their basic tasks are, and which at this point, it's just the annual financial reporting, right?

34
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:46,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can do that in the charter, right?

35
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:58,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I mean, Framingham doesn't do that because they basically say, they don't say that they'll use the state form, but they say something substantially similar to the state form, so they're just using the state form.

36
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:00,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, exactly.

37
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:05,900
[SPEAKER_04]: But since we don't want to do that, we have to provide for the creation of a form.

38
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:22,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm all for, and I've said it all along, telling the city council what needs to happen so that the less we leave to them, the happier I am.

39
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

40
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't think we can dictate the content.

41
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,431
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't dictate the contents of the form.

42
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:35,432
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be up to either the city council or the ethics commission if we choose.

43
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,913
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't technically vote on that with the whole committee,

44
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,932
[SPEAKER_04]: we have to have a vehicle for the creation of the form.

45
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:42,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

46
00:03:44,154 --> 00:04:04,930
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think it makes sense to have, you know, the commission and my recommendation would be, um, you know, and this is just to kind of answer your first set of questions, um, and thinking a little bit out loud here, um, uh, either three or five members, um,

47
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:12,617
[SPEAKER_02]: being a resident of Medford, a registered voter.

48
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:25,061
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that the State Ethics Commission does that is interesting, and I think they're a five-member group,

49
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:36,666
[SPEAKER_02]: but they require that no more than, uh, and we can adjust this based on our numbers, um, is no more.

50
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:42,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is, since there are five member, no more than two members shall be from the democratic party.

51
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:49,120
[SPEAKER_02]: No more than two shall be from the Republican party so that they ensure that there's some, you know, um,

52
00:04:50,193 --> 00:05:02,304
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the word I want it's been a long day variety of, you know, and I've suggested that, you know, with other boards too, which doesn't seem to go over well, not as the chip is what you're saying, right?

53
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:09,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But city politics are all nonpartisan, like the elections have to be nonpartisan.

54
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,905
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if we could put that in the charter.

55
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we'd have to ask if that's.

56
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:24,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know that the only board that operates like that, and probably because it has to, is the Elections Commission.

57
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:34,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying that the election, so is the, I'm not, do you know how the Elections Commission is, is there an ordinance creating it or is it a state law?

58
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure.

59
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know either.

60
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:47,650
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're saying that the Elections Commission is, specifies that members will be.

61
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,271
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can jump in.

62
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:50,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

63
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, Maury, you're on mute.

64
00:05:54,942 --> 00:06:05,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be that all boards, they could not be, let's say it was a three-member board, that all three members were from a declared party.

65
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:14,153
[SPEAKER_01]: It always had to be, if it was two or one, and I've never seen where that has changed.

66
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if it's,

67
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:22,906
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a difference of what it's supposed to be to how it really is, as we all know.

68
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:37,268
[SPEAKER_01]: So, because this is really like all municipalities from what I understand with the exception maybe of Boston or like Springfield or Worcester, that it's just like everybody's that large.

69
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:46,030
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are specific rules to all bodies that there can be no more than

70
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:56,010
[SPEAKER_01]: a majority of 2 to 1 or 3 to 2, but it can't be 5 to 0 or 3 to 0 and so forth.

71
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,353
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the rule of thumb, and I believe that's the rule of the law.

72
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I make myself clear enough on that?

73
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:05,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, makes sense.

74
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, like you say, you know how it's supposed to be and how it is.

75
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:14,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know that reinventing the wheel, right?

76
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're looking at our board.

77
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:24,012
[SPEAKER_02]: In and of itself, I would venture to guess that most of the group leans 1 way.

78
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

79
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:27,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I never looked at this way.

80
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:35,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at every member of this body as being concerned about the city and trying to push the city in the right direction.

81
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:42,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you look at almost any board that's active in the city, I think you'll see.

82
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:46,738
[SPEAKER_02]: leaning one way.

83
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:53,120
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell you, looking at the Elections Commission, there used to be four members on it.

84
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:59,683
[SPEAKER_02]: There are currently three, two from the Democratic Party, one from the Republican Party.

85
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,725
[SPEAKER_02]: They have been looking for- And who's the chair?

86
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:10,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't name them as the chair.

87
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:10,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

88
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:16,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the chair is generally the person that's the department head.

89
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is a one right now.

90
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:23,829
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was to guess, I'm probably wrong.

91
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:28,670
[SPEAKER_04]: They work with the elections department.

92
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that concerns us here what we're trying to do.

93
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:33,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

94
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:34,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward and go on.

95
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:36,372
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

96
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:42,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I can put my two cents in, you know, it's not to kick you in the ass or anything else like that.

97
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,058
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I think we're trying to go.

98
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:47,321
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to reinvent the wheel with this ethics thing.

99
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:51,504
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think we can put the parameters in of what we're looking to do.

100
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:55,247
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think the charter says you can dictate it.

101
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:59,050
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how right or wrong I am, Bill.

102
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, you're right.

103
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:06,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you remember, anything we put in the charter is caught, it's set in stone.

104
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it doesn't work out, it can't be changed.

105
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,800
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's one of the reasons we want to be careful.

106
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what Eunice is bringing to the forefront, and it's very important.

107
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:39,492
[SPEAKER_01]: that we know who these people are, that we're entrusting them as our representatives, whether I'm a radical or whether I'm, you know, not, and that all voices get to be heard.

108
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:47,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do we, as a body, tie this all into satisfying everything?

109
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:50,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I'm not entirely sure of.

110
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:56,464
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, let's say, do we three or five?

111
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like three is probably enough.

112
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:02,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Springfield has three.

113
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:11,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, I'm always a five, seven guy, but I mean, if you guys say three, okay, let's just say three or five.

114
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:18,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we go, when we get to talking about what they're actually going to do and we can see, okay, does this really need five people?

115
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:19,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

116
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:20,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll say three or five.

117
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:35,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I lean more towards the five because, uh, three to me is depending upon how much work there is to do and, you know, life getting in the way.

118
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:40,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, having that fourth and fifth person, I think is better.

119
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

120
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:49,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can jump, I like five too, cause it gives you the opportunity to make sure you have enough roundabout.

121
00:10:50,291 --> 00:11:10,708
[SPEAKER_04]: people okay let's say five and there have to be five volunteers you know they also have to find five volunteers that want to do it so um okay medford voter um any other qualification i mean in terms of their other qualifications

122
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:14,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say resident, not resident.

123
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:18,259
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're a voter, they have to be a resident.

124
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.

125
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:23,383
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of residents that aren't registered to vote.

126
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:26,185
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, if they're a voter, they have to be a resident.

127
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

128
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:32,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying you think you should be a resident, and whether they're registered to vote or not is immaterial.

129
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:36,772
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm saying register to vote first because they're automatically a resident.

130
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:37,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.

131
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:38,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

132
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:38,978
[SPEAKER_01]: So voter.

133
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:43,360
[SPEAKER_01]: A non-city employee.

134
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

135
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:53,024
[SPEAKER_04]: No city employees or relatives or elected officials will say that.

136
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,505
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be my next part.

137
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:02,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Or relatives of the same.

138
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:02,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

139
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:08,303
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, let's say, like, we don't get paid, right?

140
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:10,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a lot of people who are on volunteer boards.

141
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:11,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you guys aren't getting paid?

142
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:19,015
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people who are on boards or commissions don't get paid, but I think they might still be considered city employees.

143
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:23,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how that works.

144
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,402
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not being paid, you're not an employee.

145
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:33,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know though, because remember when we, even the members of the boards and the commissions have to take the ethics training and we talked about that.

146
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:35,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, but that doesn't, yeah.

147
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:40,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I don't know, I think that that could be ambiguous.

148
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,007
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a stipend on the committee, are you being paid?

149
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:51,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but I'm just saying, I think it could be ambiguous that there's certain, but you know, that just means that you can't,

150
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:53,336
[SPEAKER_04]: do both.

151
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:59,361
[SPEAKER_04]: But one question I have is, no city employees are elected officials or relatives of the same.

152
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:04,424
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that as soon as you're not an employee anymore, you can serve on this board.

153
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do we want a window of time?

154
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:08,687
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.

155
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:17,854
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a window of time, just like we're telling everybody else, you have to sit out for a year before you can run for another office or whatever the term is.

156
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

157
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the language.

158
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:21,857
[SPEAKER_01]: That's state law.

159
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,907
[SPEAKER_01]: that the state of Los Angeles.

160
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:29,609
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the charter for that, so we can just replicate it.

161
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

162
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,872
[SPEAKER_04]: How long do we want them to serve?

163
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:42,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say either a two-year or a three-year term.

164
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,400
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a most committee terms.

165
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It's three years too long.

166
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people go, that's too long.

167
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:54,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

168
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:55,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

169
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:58,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go, why don't we go two years, see where it goes.

170
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say two years.

171
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:08,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, should we say two years with the option of, you know, and, uh, terms maybe for a second term, right.

172
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:09,599
[SPEAKER_01]: For one time only.

173
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right, right.

174
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

175
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,821
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing with everything else.

176
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:14,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Renewal one time only.

177
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:15,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you good with that?

178
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:16,122
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys?

179
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:16,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

180
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:17,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

181
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:17,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

182
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:21,000
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what about the appointing?

183
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,742
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor will be the appointing authority.

184
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:27,024
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think we should mix it up?

185
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:28,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should mix it up.

186
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:52,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like we had talked earlier, forget the school committee on this one, but a council appointee, so they have it almost like the way they do, I think, the whole ML committee, that the council has a person they put in, the mayor has a person they put in, and then there's somebody like that.

187
00:14:54,354 --> 00:15:03,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I did notice that some of the other cities that have ethics commissions have the school committee appointing one member.

188
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:03,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

189
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.

190
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

191
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:15,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Paulette's brought up the point a few times where the school committee has been pushed to the side.

192
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:21,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget the mayor, two by the city council, one by the school committee.

193
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:22,849
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds fine to me.

194
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:33,418
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't forget, going back to what Eunice just said, the school committee has one specific role, one specific role only.

195
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:38,362
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of why they have their own little niche to deal with.

196
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:42,887
[SPEAKER_01]: The city council and the mayor have the whole 360 to deal with.

197
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:48,377
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, you know, and I've been very quiet on that.

198
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:48,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

199
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:51,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll do 2-2-1 for now.

200
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:53,684
[SPEAKER_04]: We can always go back and revisit this.

201
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:56,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So what about the responsibilities?

202
00:15:57,284 --> 00:16:03,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just to stay with this for a minute, I'm just Springfield's ethics commission.

203
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:16,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it says, um, no member or employee of the commissioner shall hold or be a candidate for any public office while a member or employee, or for one year thereafter.

204
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh,

205
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:22,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's in November.

206
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:24,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that kind of language.

207
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,797
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good protective language.

208
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:29,298
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's kind of what we're saying.

209
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:35,521
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't jump in from one committee and get to sit outside for a year or whatever, what we were saying a little bit before.

210
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:40,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And then no members shall hold office in any.

211
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:50,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Political party or political committee, so you can't be like, you know, the state rep for, you know, Republican state committee person.

212
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can't be, you know.

213
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:58,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Ward person for the word.

214
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:03,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's great language and maybe we should say it's covering their tail.

215
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:04,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.

216
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me find that.

217
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:08,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Springfield.

218
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:09,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Springfield.

219
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,963
[SPEAKER_02]: What page?

220
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:11,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Page seven.

221
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:13,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Top of page seven.

222
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,697
[SPEAKER_03]: 5, 6, 7.

223
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

224
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:20,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Springfield might be a pretty good model for us.

225
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:21,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

226
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:22,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

227
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,562
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a manual.

228
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:27,403
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not creating a manual.

229
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:30,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but some of the parameters are what we're looking to do.

230
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:38,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, what we're trying to say is the members of this committee have to have

231
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,277
[SPEAKER_01]: have to live under these guidelines.

232
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:50,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Their parameters are they can't be connected to this or that or associated with this and so forth.

233
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And who the individual has to be.

234
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I right of our own units?

235
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

236
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:08,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so, you know, I mean, participating in or contributing to the political campaign of any candidate for public office, that's any candidate for public office means anybody.

237
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the language in front of me.

238
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:14,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, I'll put it up on the screen.

239
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to read it.

240
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:20,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys know me?

241
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,816
[SPEAKER_04]: That means if you give $25 to the president.

242
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:30,902
[SPEAKER_01]: If I give $50 to Milva Runny for state rep, I shouldn't be locked out of it.

243
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:36,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, that means that you can't give to the presidential campaign.

244
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:36,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

245
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:37,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

246
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:37,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

247
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:40,406
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're invisible.

248
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:40,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

249
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:41,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that out.

250
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:43,167
[SPEAKER_01]: What else, Melva?

251
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:46,749
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, let's see.

252
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.

253
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:54,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold or be a candidate for any other public office while a member or employee for or for one year thereafter.

254
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:56,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to leave the one year thereafter?

255
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's reasonable.

256
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a problem one way or the other.

257
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:08,144
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you guys want to do, that's fine with me.

258
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:11,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you guys want to do on that one.

259
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:14,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like I said, this is not going to be changeable.

260
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:18,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it turns out they're not getting volunteers, I might regret that.

261
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:24,133
[SPEAKER_01]: 60,000 people, you're going to get volunteers.

262
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, we'll see.

263
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:31,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold office in any political party or political committee, which

264
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in favor of that.

265
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:41,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather keep it as neutral as we can.

266
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:44,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would stick with, I would keep that one.

267
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:55,218
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so you can't be like the state committee person or you can't be serving on the Democratic board committee.

268
00:19:55,238 --> 00:20:01,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like I said, when we start talking about what the Ethics Commission is going to do, then we'll see.

269
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:10,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if the Ethics Commission is just administering the form, and they don't, I mean, yeah, then I don't see that this is that important, but we'll talk about it.

270
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:14,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other one is the contribution, which we're not going to include.

271
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:16,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can fix that.

272
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:17,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

273
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:21,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

274
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:28,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we present it to the committee, I think we should tell them this is what we didn't include.

275
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:33,100
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, contributions, whatever.

276
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:38,683
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be kind of like showing validity of what we're doing here.

277
00:20:39,526 --> 00:20:47,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, my thought was I was gonna take what we came up with tonight, give it to the call-in center, ask them to write it up, and then give that to the committee.

278
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can talk to them about some of the other things too, but.

279
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:53,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we can wait and see if it comes up.

280
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:54,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

281
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:55,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

282
00:20:55,412 --> 00:21:00,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's composition, qualifications, appointing.

283
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:04,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what about what they're actually gonna do?

284
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, one of the things we know they're gonna do is,

285
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: create the form because that's the whole point and that's what the committee voted on is to have an annual financial reporting requirement.

286
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:18,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

287
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:32,909
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have to create the form and then they would be who the people who have to fill out the form submit the forms to.

288
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They're responsible for that, right?

289
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

290
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:37,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so.

291
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:39,366
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a pretty neutral job.

292
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:48,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Create the form, distribute the form, collect the forms.

293
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:49,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and make sure like.

294
00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:50,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Ensure compliance.

295
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:54,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, ensure compliance with the requirement.

296
00:21:55,094 --> 00:22:01,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So this section of the charter would also say that there's an annual reporting requirement.

297
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:06,045
[SPEAKER_04]: annual financial reporting requirements.

298
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the problem with us doing it this way, I think, is they can put anything they want in that form.

299
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:16,749
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be anything.

300
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:20,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no control over it.

301
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,231
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you suggesting we create the form?

302
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,692
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think the form should go in the charter.

303
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:36,608
[SPEAKER_04]: All I'm saying is, unless we, like, that's why Framingham's charter says a form substantially similar to the state.

304
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:40,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So that says, that gives an idea.

305
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:46,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we're saying... I like that.

306
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:47,671
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets you off the hook.

307
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:57,870
[SPEAKER_01]: yet it puts you within the guidelines of what the form should look like, and then that word similar should mean anything.

308
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

309
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:07,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just say if we do that, we don't necessarily need the ethics permission.

310
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:13,657
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're protecting your henhouse.

311
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:15,292
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.

312
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:19,895
[SPEAKER_01]: It just puts people on notice that, OK, we have this commission.

313
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:26,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I understand what you're saying, Nova, and you're 100% correct that we may not need that.

314
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:29,900
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like a second level.

315
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

316
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:33,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I like gloves.

317
00:23:35,362 --> 00:23:40,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of the city clerk, because that's what Framingham does.

318
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I betray you, I don't trust the city clerk.

319
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:44,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

320
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, no, no.

321
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:47,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Not this personal one.

322
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:49,334
[SPEAKER_01]: The job description.

323
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's he hired by?

324
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:52,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

325
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:53,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

326
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:54,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

327
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:56,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about Adam.

328
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about Joe.

329
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And the previous set of one, this is a framing him language and it basically gives it, it's pretty long.

330
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:05,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually.

331
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:09,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think ours is going to be this long, but I don't know.

332
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:09,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

333
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:19,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically just says that the city clerk is going to do it.

334
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:21,083
[SPEAKER_04]: See, we need to figure this out too.

335
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:24,164
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question is who's going to have to do this form?

336
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:31,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, if you stop putting this on the city clerk's office, he's going to, I won't say that word, he's going to crook.

337
00:24:32,452 --> 00:24:32,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

338
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:41,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in the council's handbook how they want to distribute it.

339
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:45,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're going to have to create the ordinance.

340
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

341
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:47,680
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.

342
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:56,865
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're telling them what the ethics commission is going to be made up of, but we also have to give an idea of what this ethics commission is going to do.

343
00:24:57,025 --> 00:25:00,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It is going to oversee the ethics reporting requirement,

344
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:07,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we do the line that Framingham uses.

345
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:19,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, are you suggesting on this document that the city clerk oversees the chairperson of the ethics?

346
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:24,324
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if we do an ethics commission, we're leaving the city clerk out of it.

347
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:33,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it would fall back on the chairperson or the chair of the ethics commission.

348
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's up to the commission.

349
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:38,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what we're saying.

350
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:39,232
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you want to do it?

351
00:25:40,212 --> 00:25:49,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was just saying if we're just going to say that they're using the state form, then we don't have to have an ethics commission.

352
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I like the idea at this commission.

353
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:58,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, let me go a step further, that the city clerk

354
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:10,245
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe works hand in hand with the chairperson of the Ethics Commission, but it's not really involved in it.

355
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:16,486
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, that's the last scenario for these two to get together and say, this is what we're doing.

356
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:16,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

357
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:18,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we should dictate that.

358
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:21,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So the city clerk can't complain that

359
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:25,950
[SPEAKER_01]: he or she is being overburdened by a ton of work.

360
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we should dictate that in the charter because again, then it has to be that way and it might not work out.

361
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:39,038
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have the Ethics Commission, then we just say the Ethics Commission shall do all this.

362
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:45,121
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it says about the form in Framingham.

363
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:45,622
[SPEAKER_04]: It says,

364
00:26:47,361 --> 00:27:03,133
[SPEAKER_04]: The statement of financial interests filed pursuant to the provisions of the section shall be on a form prescribed by the city clerk, and in our case, it would be by the Ethics Commission, that shall be substantially similar to that required by the State Ethics Commission.

365
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:10,719
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think we want something substantially similar to the state form, because I mean, it's too intrusive.

366
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:15,022
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to, but that means we have no control over what's in the form.

367
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: We just say it's a...

368
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:18,585
[SPEAKER_04]: statement of financial interest.

369
00:27:21,427 --> 00:27:22,487
[SPEAKER_04]: They can put whatever they want.

370
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:28,871
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do it however they see fit, which is fine.

371
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:33,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just making the point that we're not creating the form.

372
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:34,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

373
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:46,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hopefully, and I know Maury chuckled at this at our last meeting, but hopefully they will do the research that we've done.

374
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:57,722
[SPEAKER_02]: to find, you know, they'll find other communities that do this and realize that the state form is, you know, too over the top.

375
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:03,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as I said, I recommend the Cambridge form as being more targeted.

376
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:05,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't find the forms for the other one.

377
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:13,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right, it's right, hang on a minute, let me just find it, because I know, I know we have it.

378
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:14,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do.

379
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:19,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I think subcommittee folder.

380
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:23,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.

381
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:24,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

382
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:27,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just one.

383
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:28,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

384
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:44,188
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, and you have to figure out what you're, you know, I mean, there's all this stuff about, in which case you don't have to include it.

385
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:49,327
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, transacting business in Cambridge.

386
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

387
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:53,512
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Cambridge-centric.

388
00:28:53,552 --> 00:28:54,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just... Right.

389
00:28:54,973 --> 00:29:00,859
[SPEAKER_04]: But somebody, I think somebody at our meeting said something about, well, so if you own stock in AT&T, you have to report it.

390
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:09,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe you wouldn't have to on a Medford-centric form, but that doesn't mean that an outside, a business outside Medford wouldn't be doing business in Medford.

391
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:22,155
[SPEAKER_02]: If AT&T is doing business in Medford and you have stock in AT&T, then yes.

392
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:26,198
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have stock in AT&T and AT&T has nothing to do with Medford, no.

393
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:32,303
[SPEAKER_04]: The form has to lay it all out clearly.

394
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:35,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at this form and I was like, man, if I had to fill this out,

395
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:45,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I might hire somebody to help me figure it out, to figure out what I'm supposed to report and what I'm not supposed to report.

396
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:51,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Because some of it, it's hard to know.

397
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:54,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

398
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,855
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than the state form, in my opinion.

399
00:29:57,456 --> 00:29:58,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

400
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:05,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the committee wasn't interested in the state form either.

401
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:18,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think, unfortunately, as much as I don't like the idea, I think we're going to have to leave some of this up to the commission.

402
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:19,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

403
00:30:19,723 --> 00:30:33,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So statement of, you know, they're responsible for creating a statement of financial disclosure, administering it, ensure, you know, distributing it, ensuring compliance, all of that.

404
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:39,781
[SPEAKER_04]: However, is the, is it really only the first ethics commission that has to create the form?

405
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:50,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, but they may future commissions may choose to revise the form, right?

406
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:54,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Create and maintain.

407
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:59,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Right the form so basically that's what they're doing.

408
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:04,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we putting any details about that?

409
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:06,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what details we could put in, but.

410
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that we can I think that we just have to, you know.

411
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:17,859
[SPEAKER_02]: much as I dislike it, take a leap of faith here that they're going to do some due diligence.

412
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

413
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:30,345
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're appointed to this committee, they're going to sit around the table the first night and say, okay, we have to create a statement of financial disclosure.

414
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:34,667
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that and where do other communities must do this?

415
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:37,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find out so we're not reinventing the wheel.

416
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,310
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to create and maintain

417
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:46,527
[SPEAKER_04]: a statement of financial disclosure, and we're going to require this annually?

418
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:50,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

419
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is filling it out?

420
00:31:56,074 --> 00:32:02,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, I mean, it was talk about candidates and electeds.

421
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Somerville only does electeds.

422
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:11,549
[SPEAKER_02]: They do other, the department heads and things too, but you're talking about the political part.

423
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:18,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Somerville only does electeds and not a candidate, so I think I would go with that.

424
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:20,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

425
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:22,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm fine with that.

426
00:32:22,993 --> 00:32:30,536
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, if somebody really cared, they might want to know before they voted for somebody.

427
00:32:30,556 --> 00:32:32,457
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time,

428
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:45,073
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, this form, people are gonna fill it out and it's just gonna be information that the public can see.

429
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:52,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, you know, as we kind of talked about, it's more for transparency and optics.

430
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:58,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but what is it being transparent of other than people's financial situation?

431
00:32:59,997 --> 00:33:04,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody that might have an interest in something that might influence how they

432
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:12,438
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, manage the business of that, whether it's be voting on it, or if it's, you know.

433
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:20,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but they're not, so they're supposed to, you know, they're supposed to follow the conflict of interest law and recuse themselves or report.

434
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:29,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, you know, this maybe is going to make them more likely to do that.

435
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:37,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, you know, as I think we talked about the last time is that.

436
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:45,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Going, you know, bringing something up to the ethics commission of the conflict of, you know, or a potential conflict of interest.

437
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the honest system.

438
00:33:49,095 --> 00:34:08,823
[SPEAKER_02]: where if a big development's going up in Medford Square and I have an interest in it or it's my next-door neighbor that's pushing for this or my brother-in-law or something like that,

439
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, I should go before the ethics.

440
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:25,327
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't already know that I shouldn't be touching this, ideally, I should be going to the Ethics Commission and disclosing it and then being told whether or not I should be.

441
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:28,468
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about the State Ethics Commission.

442
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:30,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

443
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:35,631
[SPEAKER_04]: But our Ethics Commission is not going to have that power.

444
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,363
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just collecting information.

445
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:42,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

446
00:34:42,363 --> 00:35:03,695
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm saying is, if my brother-in-law has an interest in a development going up in Medford Square, ideally, I should be going to the ethics commission and disclosing that and letting them determine whether or not I should be supporting and voting on it, whatever.

447
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:15,519
[SPEAKER_02]: But if nobody knows that my brother-in-law is involved in this, then... But let's say that, you know... Right, but we don't know if the forum is going to cover brother-in-laws.

448
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:16,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

449
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:18,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming it is.

450
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:19,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

451
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:26,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Milva comes along and says, geez, I think Eunice seems to be really pushing that development in Medford Square.

452
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:30,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody told me her brother was involved in it.

453
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:36,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'll go check out the statement of ethics or statement of financial disclosure.

454
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:41,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, I have an interest in it.

455
00:35:41,688 --> 00:35:42,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's transparency.

456
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:53,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It's transparency in the sense that it's going to make people's financial situation visible to anybody in the city.

457
00:35:55,035 --> 00:36:04,782
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a connection between your financial business and Medford.

458
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:07,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

459
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:15,036
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I said, what if you don't just close your AT&T stock and then all of a sudden AT&T is doing business in Medford and you didn't know that?

460
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:20,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, figuring out.

461
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:28,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to reveal information to people who want to look at it, basically.

462
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,002
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we're talking about is,

463
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:35,646
[SPEAKER_04]: while we were talking about the powers of the commission.

464
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:50,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, the only power of the commission that we have is to create and maintain the statement of financial disclosure and to ensure that it gets filled out every year by the people who are supposed to fill it.

465
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:52,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Framingham does.

466
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:53,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

467
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,950
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all the Ethics Commission is going to do.

468
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Somerville and Springfield think it was Springfield that had lobbying and stuff in it.

469
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,374
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know how much of that is done here.

470
00:37:11,414 --> 00:37:13,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they do more because they have a casino out there.

471
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:16,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

472
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:23,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't happen to notice, I can't remember offhand what Somerville's did.

473
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:32,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's just say that we're going to mention the form and any other such duties as may be prescribed by ordinance.

474
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:34,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

475
00:37:35,757 --> 00:37:38,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

476
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So electives.

477
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,080
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want candidates.

478
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:46,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say,

479
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:51,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Electeds, department heads?

480
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,778
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of department heads.

481
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:58,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want all of them?

482
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:04,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

483
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:07,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd want to see a list of department heads before we put department heads in.

484
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:15,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I feel like some of them, it's not really necessary.

485
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,051
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not voting.

486
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:19,982
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not voting on anything.

487
00:38:20,003 --> 00:38:26,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the health department, does really the health department head have to fill this out?

488
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:34,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of the others indicate department heads.

489
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,601
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what she means.

490
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:58,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Framingham is the- I think department heads only if they're connected to maybe an individual looking for a position.

491
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:11,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Framingham says superintendent, chief financial officer, chief procurement officer, chief operating officer, public works directors, or any other municipal officers as may from time to time be designated by ordinance.

492
00:39:13,077 --> 00:39:17,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Works for me, but I think we're getting too deep into this.

493
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:22,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just, I think we're trying to reinvent the wheel here.

494
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:28,963
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to cross every single T and dot every single I of every scenario that could possibly happen.

495
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:30,164
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not our job.

496
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:33,005
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.

497
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:41,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm not going to support an action like this, that we're going to dissect every individual thing that- I agree.

498
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:44,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to support it.

499
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:49,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you right now, Eunice, you can keep going on and on and trying to dig and dig and dig.

500
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:51,794
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have my vote on this.

501
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:53,956
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone too far.

502
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:54,496
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

503
00:39:54,697 --> 00:39:56,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's look at Framingham.

504
00:39:56,558 --> 00:40:00,001
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know what a chief procurement officer is.

505
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:00,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have one?

506
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have one of those.

507
00:40:02,302 --> 00:40:02,823
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one.

508
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:03,203
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

509
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:05,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And chief operating officer?

510
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:09,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if we have one or not.

511
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:10,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we do, because that's the thing.

512
00:40:10,629 --> 00:40:11,710
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll leave that one out.

513
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:14,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Or when I give the list to the Collins.

514
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:15,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

515
00:40:16,058 --> 00:40:21,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, well, then maybe just filling it out every year.

516
00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:28,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there just a particular time of year that we should, you know, we have to say when.

517
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:42,287
[SPEAKER_01]: City Council takes office the first week of January, give them two months or three months, they get their stuff in order.

518
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:45,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's February 28th.

519
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Framingham has it due on May 1st of each year.

520
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:52,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do February 28th or March 31st, whatever you want to do.

521
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:54,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a problem with any of that.

522
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:55,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a problem.

523
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:57,199
[SPEAKER_01]: We're digging too deep here.

524
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,603
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting too finite and we're trying to reinvent the wheel here.

525
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:05,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I see your point.

526
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:07,848
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's gone too far, gone on too long.

527
00:41:08,308 --> 00:41:10,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make my statement how I feel.

528
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:10,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

529
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:13,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

530
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:15,054
[SPEAKER_04]: February 28th, we like that date.

531
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:16,335
[SPEAKER_04]: March 1st.

532
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:18,867
[SPEAKER_04]: March 1st, okay.

533
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:22,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, okay, that's fine.

534
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

535
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:30,115
[SPEAKER_01]: To be one day over every four years and you have a, what's the difference?

536
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:40,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's most of the questions that we needed to, what about the, and in terms of the actual information that's collected, the commission,

537
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:48,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeps the forms on file and makes them available to any member of the public or do we not want them to be made available to any member of the public?

538
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:58,662
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's kind of the whole point of this is that, you know, they're available to the public, you know, upon request.

539
00:41:59,762 --> 00:42:00,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

540
00:42:07,385 --> 00:42:13,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're saying that the members of the Ethics Commission will receive no compensation, right?

541
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:15,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

542
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:16,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

543
00:42:18,414 --> 00:42:19,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is what we have.

544
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:25,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Five-member Ethics Commission, no compensation, Medford voter.

545
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:31,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Ringfield member, okay.

546
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:34,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have it in front of me right now.

547
00:42:34,962 --> 00:42:42,166
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever Springfield said that we talked about, I haven't written down, but where I have to look for it.

548
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:45,688
[SPEAKER_04]: No city employees or elected officials.

549
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:55,013
[SPEAKER_04]: No current city employees or elected officials, and they have to wait a year before they can serve, and no relatives.

550
00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:59,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I got candidates who are in there also.

551
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:01,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

552
00:43:03,436 --> 00:43:04,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I wrong?

553
00:43:04,597 --> 00:43:05,378
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that's good.

554
00:43:05,438 --> 00:43:05,978
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

555
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

556
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,022
[SPEAKER_04]: They serve for two years.

557
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:16,104
[SPEAKER_04]: They can renew their term one time only.

558
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:20,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Two are appointed by the mayor, two by the city council, one by the school committee.

559
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:44,232
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't hold office with any political party or political committee Which again as we've discussed I don't really see that it makes a difference for this particular job because all they're doing is collecting the forms exactly But yeah, we could we could take that out Okay, I put a question mark there and I

560
00:43:45,802 --> 00:43:57,167
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to create and maintain a statement of financial disclosure to be filled out by elected officials and the people that we just discussed.

561
00:43:57,187 --> 00:43:59,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Not filled out, submitted to, right?

562
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:02,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Submitted to the elected officials or the committee, right?

563
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:04,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Well- Filled out.

564
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would someone else be filling out their forms?

565
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:12,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, the Ethics Commission isn't filling it out.

566
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:15,074
[SPEAKER_04]: They're filling it out and submitting it to the Ethics Commission.

567
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:17,716
[SPEAKER_04]: The Ethics Commission is just making sure they do it every year.

568
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:36,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll say, and any other duties as may be prescribed by ordinance, the forms due on March 1st of each year, and the Elections Commission keeps the forms and makes them available to anyone who wants to see them on request.

569
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:41,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it might be, it might, what if somebody else, what if the mayor wants to see him?

570
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:45,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what if, you know, somebody in another department, I mean, it's anybody, right?

571
00:44:45,832 --> 00:44:46,953
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just, yeah.

572
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:47,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

573
00:44:47,873 --> 00:44:49,934
[SPEAKER_01]: They put in a request to see it, so big deal.

574
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:51,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

575
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:53,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So does that cover it?

576
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:59,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and then what I'll do is I'll write this all in the minutes, so you guys will be able to look at it and see if anything was left out.

577
00:45:00,278 --> 00:45:00,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once I,

578
00:45:03,222 --> 00:45:25,097
[SPEAKER_04]: hear from you if there needs to be any changes or if I don't hear from you I'll assume it's okay and then I'll give all this to the call-in center and then the call-in center will write it up and then um I I don't think we need another meeting I mean we'll they'll write it up and I'll send it to the whole committee and then if anybody has changes including us we can just bring it up at the next meeting.

579
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:27,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it up at the September meeting.

580
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:28,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.

581
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:30,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound like we covered everything?

582
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:31,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

583
00:45:31,669 --> 00:45:33,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have one quick question.

584
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:39,375
[SPEAKER_02]: The who part, who is filling out these disclosure forms?

585
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:57,509
[SPEAKER_02]: What I had on my list, and I think to Maury's point, getting too much into the weeds, but I just want to make sure that if we're not getting too into the weeds that we at least leave it open

586
00:45:59,086 --> 00:46:19,371
[SPEAKER_02]: to be this way, what I would want, if it were my druthers, would be electeds, department heads, the super, and any members of a multi-member board that either were required to have by ordinance or that are responsible for any licensing and permitting.

587
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:22,793
[SPEAKER_02]: So I recognize that's getting too into the weeds.

588
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:24,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go there.

589
00:46:25,155 --> 00:46:38,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I just assume that we keep it the way it is and we present it to the committee with Eunice's recommendations right now and her recommendations and see what the whole committee wants to say.

590
00:46:38,664 --> 00:46:41,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to answer here right now for the whole committee.

591
00:46:41,046 --> 00:46:45,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll have the language and then if Eunice wants to bring up an amendment to add, she can.

592
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

593
00:46:46,490 --> 00:47:05,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, what I have is elected officials, superintendent, chief financial officer, chief procurement officer, public and public works director, and any other municipal officers as may from time to time be designated by ordinance.

594
00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:06,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

595
00:47:07,754 --> 00:47:09,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

596
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:14,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is there one in particular that you think should be there that's not there, Eunice?

597
00:47:17,018 --> 00:47:21,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much with the department heads, but more concerned with the boards.

598
00:47:22,345 --> 00:47:28,633
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start dissecting the 20 boards with 3, 4, 5, 10 people on it for Christ sakes.

599
00:47:30,736 --> 00:47:31,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

600
00:47:31,537 --> 00:47:32,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, do it if you want it.

601
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not voting for it.

602
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:34,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so close.

603
00:47:35,913 --> 00:47:36,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired of this.

604
00:47:37,194 --> 00:47:44,417
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been beating on this for months upon months, and it keeps coming back to the committee and then to the whole group.

605
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,598
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going nowhere, Eunice.

606
00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:49,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what you're trying to do, but you know something?

607
00:47:51,695 --> 00:48:02,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right, but go ahead if you want to do it if you so units will have it this way and once that once it's written up if you want to propose an amendment and and then the committee can vote on it.

608
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:03,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

609
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:04,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

610
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:07,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring it up on the 1st or the 5th whenever that we're meeting.

611
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:08,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

612
00:48:08,556 --> 00:48:08,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

613
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:09,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

614
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:16,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we good with the review of what I, I mean, I'm going to give all this to the call center and ask them to write it up.

615
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:23,189
[SPEAKER_04]: If they say, well, March 1st isn't a good date because of blah, blah, blah, it should be whatever.

616
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:26,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'll just say fine, change it and then we can.

617
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:30,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that was random anyway, right?

618
00:48:30,634 --> 00:48:31,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

619
00:48:31,854 --> 00:48:34,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what else they'll say about what.

620
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:40,436
[SPEAKER_04]: They might say, well, you should answer this question as well, or yeah, they might have some comments.

621
00:48:40,536 --> 00:48:44,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But they'll let us know just like they did with all the other stuff.

622
00:48:44,776 --> 00:48:45,917
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they do.

623
00:48:46,277 --> 00:48:51,378
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just an ad hoc committee trying to do the best thing for the city that we care about.

624
00:48:52,818 --> 00:48:54,721
[SPEAKER_01]: with the proper recommendations.

625
00:48:55,182 --> 00:49:07,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they see something that they say, tweak it like this, and what Eunice is saying, or what Milva is saying, or what anybody else is saying, you shouldn't indoctrinate, let's do it.

626
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:10,122
[SPEAKER_01]: But they know more about this than we do.

627
00:49:12,072 --> 00:49:12,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

628
00:49:12,673 --> 00:49:25,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it is, you know, I do think that it's tricky about the Statement of Financial Disclosure and how to frame that because it's not in any other charters.

629
00:49:26,824 --> 00:49:38,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only one that has it specifically references the state form just to give, you know, because otherwise you're just saying Statement of Financial Disclosure and it could mean anything, right?

630
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:50,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a little tricky, but if we don't want to use the state form, then we just have to.

631
00:49:51,709 --> 00:49:53,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

632
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,330
[SPEAKER_02]: You're taking a leap of faith.

633
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

634
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:00,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the state form is the absolute wrong way to go.

635
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:00,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

636
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:00,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

637
00:50:11,563 --> 00:50:15,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember if the Cambridge form said anything about relatives.

638
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:20,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I don't think it does.

639
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:32,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's funny because they have the elections commission overseeing the form, not the city clerk like Framingham.

640
00:50:35,723 --> 00:50:36,503
[SPEAKER_04]: They say June 1st.

641
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so maybe spring is a better time.

642
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:43,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, because Framingham said May.

643
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:51,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all depends on how their charters are, what their fiscal years are and everything.

644
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:51,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.

645
00:50:52,901 --> 00:50:54,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have to copy everybody else.

646
00:50:54,462 --> 00:50:56,583
[SPEAKER_01]: We can be our own person, too.

647
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:57,344
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know.

648
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:01,206
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just don't know if there's a reason, like with the sort of calendar.

649
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:04,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Collins Center will tell us that it's too quick or not.

650
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we just establish who we want to be?

651
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,032
[SPEAKER_04]: They do say family members in Cambridge.

652
00:51:15,192 --> 00:51:28,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I will send this out to you guys before I send it to the call-in center so that, you know, if there's any detail that I got wrong in the minutes, I can correct it before I send it to them.

653
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:29,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

654
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:30,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sounds good.

655
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, do we need to cover anything else?

656
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,894
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we answered all the questions.

657
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:38,435
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm good.

658
00:51:38,915 --> 00:51:39,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring the rest.

659
00:51:39,335 --> 00:51:39,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

660
00:51:39,635 --> 00:51:47,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring all the recommendations, what we've discussed in front of the whole committee, and let's put this in the rest, please, for Christ's sakes.

661
00:51:47,717 --> 00:51:48,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no.

662
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:54,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the Collins Center is going to write it up, and it's going to be part of our discussion.

663
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:55,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people want to amend it, they can.

664
00:51:56,938 --> 00:51:59,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to be finishing in September.

665
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:06,621
[SPEAKER_04]: We're finishing the charter and then in October, we're going to make sure we finalize the final report.

666
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:12,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a hard end date for all of our work?

667
00:52:13,624 --> 00:52:21,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I want October to be our last meeting, so October, whatever the first Thursday in October is.

668
00:52:23,235 --> 00:52:31,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so then once we button everything up, then we give it to the mayor.

669
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:37,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when does it go to the city council?

670
00:52:37,747 --> 00:52:38,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

671
00:52:39,548 --> 00:52:41,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of in the mayor's hands.

672
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:47,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, you know, we don't know what kind of role we're going to be asked to play in any of that.

673
00:52:47,715 --> 00:52:50,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

674
00:52:50,697 --> 00:52:51,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

675
00:52:52,591 --> 00:52:54,473
[SPEAKER_04]: But once we submit it to the mayor.

676
00:52:54,493 --> 00:52:57,576
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get through the call and send her in next month.

677
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we submit it to the mayor.

678
00:52:59,198 --> 00:53:01,800
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're going to be finished at that October meeting, Maury.

679
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

680
00:53:02,741 --> 00:53:02,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

681
00:53:03,682 --> 00:53:04,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

682
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final draft.

683
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:18,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it goes to the mayor, once we hand it off to her, the final report and the final draft or the final or the- Mayor has the power of the pen.

684
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:23,594
[SPEAKER_01]: She sends it to the city council, they have more of the power of the pen and we'll see how it rings out through the wash.

685
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:24,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

686
00:53:25,194 --> 00:53:30,896
[SPEAKER_02]: When does it go to the public for when are they able to view our work?

687
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:33,217
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not.

688
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:37,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure that our final report is going to be made public.

689
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:41,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine that you sat on the parking.

690
00:53:41,902 --> 00:53:43,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find a report is public.

691
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:58,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when we submit it- I mean, well, I think it probably is up to the mayor because we're just a, you know, we're the mayor's committee, we're submitting it to the mayor, but I can't imagine- Our committee report is public record.

692
00:53:59,345 --> 00:54:06,209
[SPEAKER_01]: So our final public, our final report is public record.

693
00:54:06,709 --> 00:54:10,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't imagine- What we submit to the mayor is public record.

694
00:54:10,672 --> 00:54:13,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So however it comes out of there,

695
00:54:17,276 --> 00:54:22,902
[SPEAKER_01]: change and then submit it to the city council and their changes, that's all part of it.

696
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:27,907
[SPEAKER_01]: But our original report is there, just like the parking commission, our original report.

697
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:28,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

698
00:54:28,427 --> 00:54:33,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's like all those final reports that we looked at from all those communities.

699
00:54:34,113 --> 00:54:38,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine people aren't going to be able to see that.

700
00:54:39,098 --> 00:54:39,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, exactly.

701
00:54:39,998 --> 00:54:40,499
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be.

702
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:45,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've had a few people who've asked me, when will they be able to see a work product?

703
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:49,562
[SPEAKER_02]: They can come on and watch all our work up to this point.

704
00:54:49,802 --> 00:54:50,342
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all public.

705
00:54:50,362 --> 00:54:50,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

706
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:52,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, where have you been for the last two years?

707
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:53,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the website.

708
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:57,105
[SPEAKER_04]: You can spend hours and hours watching all the meetings.

709
00:54:57,565 --> 00:54:58,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

710
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:00,426
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be bored into oblivion.

711
00:55:00,446 --> 00:55:03,267
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good restroom viewing.

712
00:55:05,456 --> 00:55:08,258
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have insomnia, watch a couple of charter meetings.

713
00:55:08,298 --> 00:55:09,860
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be asleep in a minute.

714
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:14,224
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need anatomy and watch this.

715
00:55:14,984 --> 00:55:15,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

716
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:16,346
