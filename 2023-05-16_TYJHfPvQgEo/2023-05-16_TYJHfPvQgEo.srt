[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, nope, nope.

56
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:34,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I make a motion to take item number two of the superintendent's report out of order?

57
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we have the right folks for that.

58
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:48,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, number two, special recognition of Kenneth Thompson Rodriguez, 11th grade, MHS student, Mustang Hero Award, Dr. Maurice Edouard-Vincent, our superintendent.

59
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:12,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, I am truly pleased and honored to present this Mustang hero award for special recognition to Mr. Kenneth Thompson Rodriguez, who is an 11th grade student at Medford High School.

60
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,547
[SPEAKER_19]: I am pleased to present him with this award.

61
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:28,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Last week on Tuesday, May 9th, the high school nursing office received an emergency call on the walkie-talkie during student lunches.

62
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:42,175
[SPEAKER_19]: When nurses Jennifer Silver and Sarah Kelly arrived at the scene, Kenneth had stepped up and given a fellow MPS student the Heimlich maneuver.

63
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:49,872
[SPEAKER_19]: And his fast action really helped that student who was choking.

64
00:03:50,573 --> 00:04:05,007
[SPEAKER_19]: And just an important fact for everyone to know that the nursing office shared with us that in the United States, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury death.

65
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:13,715
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are very, very proud of you, Kenneth, that you took the initiative, you stepped up and helped your fellow Mustang.

66
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:20,662
[SPEAKER_19]: So we would like to present you with this special certificate, and I will pass it on to the mayor.

67
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:22,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

68
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:24,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Kenneth, amazing.

69
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,407
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all very proud of you.

70
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for stepping up.

71
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:38,804
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Mustang hero award award we're presenting you with and speck special recognition for outstanding civic response and that's signed by Dr. Edouard-Vincent and myself and school committee.

72
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:04,402
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to say a few words, kind of tell us if you were trained to do that or how we can put it to action.

73
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:15,425
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, it was just like an instinct.

74
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:21,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen her choking, so my first thought was to help her out and make sure she was okay.

75
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:23,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that was pretty much it.

76
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:43,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

77
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you're

78
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:27,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're still under suspension, so we'll take number four as principal.

79
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,963
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still under suspension, so we'll take number four because I saw Principal Fallon pop in.

80
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:37,687
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a report to recognize and honor the Medford

81
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,850
[SPEAKER_07]: vocational technical high school robotics team.

82
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,114
[SPEAKER_07]: The team will head to the world championship mate ROV competition being hosted by St.

83
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:54,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Rain Valley School District in Longmont, Colorado on June 19th, 2023.

84
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Fallon, if you'd like to come on up, tell us more about it.

85
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I was able to hear a bit this weekend, seems pretty fabulous.

86
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:08,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little face with the speaker.

87
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:10,828
[SPEAKER_17]: There we go.

88
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:19,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening second win in two years for our students and we're very proud last year they went to California this year they'll be headed off to Colorado.

89
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:23,672
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love it if one of you could explain, please.

90
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:39,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Fallon, can we have Mr. Sam Christie, the wonderful teacher, and I know Mr. Noah Lukowitz isn't with us, but please come forward as well for your wonderful leadership and instruction of the students.

91
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,831
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love it if you all could come up to the front.

92
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,833
[SPEAKER_16]: You are the stars of the show, so.

93
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:47,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everybody, introduce yourself, too.

94
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, why don't we start by introducing ourselves?

95
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:50,655
[SPEAKER_07]: What a great job.

96
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:53,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, I'm Scott Campbell, and I'm a sophomore

97
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:58,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Ben Burtz, and I'm a sophomore.

98
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Noah Gibson, and I'm a junior.

99
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Matthew Harris, and I'm a junior.

100
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Aaron Bendaniel, and I'm a sophomore.

101
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,612
[SPEAKER_06]: underwater robot.

102
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us all about it.

103
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:22,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's an automated ROV competition.

104
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:29,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an underwater robot competition, where you basically you build a robot that's designed to compete

105
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:38,511
[SPEAKER_00]: In a to complete various different tasks that are supposed to simulate like environmental stuff.

106
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:48,340
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, you know, moving like solar floating solar panel rays or moving trash stuff designed to like help protect the ocean.

107
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:50,663
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.

108
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,764
[SPEAKER_00]: And we built an ROV.

109
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,725
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a remotely operated vehicle.

110
00:08:56,505 --> 00:09:01,447
[SPEAKER_00]: We can control it from the surface and it goes underwater and it does all of these different tasks.

111
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:10,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And in late April, we had our regional competition down in Buzzards Bay and we won that.

112
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:16,131
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we get to go to the world championship, which is hosted as mentioned in Colorado.

113
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:17,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.

114
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:17,992
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.

115
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:20,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Very rewarding work.

116
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:22,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Fabulous.

117
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:33,878
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, this wouldn't be possible without the leadership of the instructors we have in the robotics and engineering program, Mr. Sam Christie, who's here with us tonight, and Mr. Noah Lukiewicz.

118
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:34,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you want to say anything?

119
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:36,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, come on up, Mr. Christie.

120
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:37,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you do.

121
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:38,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be shy.

122
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:42,534
[SPEAKER_02]: My main job is to keep the lights on while they do all the work.

123
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:47,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am there a lot, but it's really up to them to finish this thing.

124
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:48,560
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really impressive work they've done.

125
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,443
[SPEAKER_02]: In their rookie year, they won the New England Regionals.

126
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:52,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It was impressive.

127
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:54,946
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, we beat Exeter Academy.

128
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:56,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of a nice thing for Medford to do.

129
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:59,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, really excited for them to go forward.

130
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:03,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're juniors and sophomores, so one more year with the same team.

131
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,036
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fabulous.

132
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know next year's category yet?

133
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:11,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same robot each year, actually.

134
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:14,484
[SPEAKER_02]: So teams that have been there for multiple years have more advantage.

135
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:15,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was even more impressive.

136
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they won in their first year.

137
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:19,469
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, very cool.

138
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:20,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Christie.

139
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:22,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

140
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:30,365
[SPEAKER_16]: offered to stay with him as well.

141
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:32,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And she helped, yeah, yeah.

142
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:35,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So spring break was basically at the shop.

143
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:39,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Christie, can you say who we're in competition with?

144
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,710
[SPEAKER_19]: You were mentioning.

145
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:45,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, so it's fun to see if you go on the site, you can see things like Beijing, Tokyo, Medford.

146
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,895
[SPEAKER_19]: It's fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.

147
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:50,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely fabulous.

148
00:10:51,256 --> 00:10:52,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great show.

149
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, member Ruseau.

150
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,404
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

151
00:10:56,444 --> 00:11:00,327
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't typically spend money like on the fly on the school committee.

152
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:13,519
[SPEAKER_18]: We usually do a budget, but if we could figure out how to pay for this, like we did with the ethics bowl, I think I'm assuming this committee would be supportive, although without a vote, that's quite an assumption, but I do so.

153
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,880
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't do a GoFundMe for ethics bowl.

154
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,460
[SPEAKER_07]: We paid for it.

155
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,992
[SPEAKER_18]: out of the school district's resources so I don't know why this would be different.

156
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:44,660
[SPEAKER_17]: So under normal circumstances we would be yes sure bring the money but this is the second year we've had incredible donations from partners and advisory members for the robotics and engineering program that we are we are set for this one but thank you so much the generosity of the people who have donated

157
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:47,142
[SPEAKER_17]: has really been overwhelming.

158
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:48,482
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

159
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:49,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

160
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,263
[SPEAKER_17]: I will remember that for next time.

161
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:54,566
[SPEAKER_18]: I just saw GoFundMe today up in my feed.

162
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,907
[SPEAKER_18]: It was definitely not paid for.

163
00:11:55,927 --> 00:12:00,369
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe there's a different GoFundMe or a different resource for paying for it.

164
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:01,390
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still raising money.

165
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the

166
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:07,844
[SPEAKER_02]: The opportunity for us, which has been really nice, is to be able to have an excuse to go out and actually make partnerships with large corporations.

167
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:17,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So Watts Water Technology, which is not that far from us, is a billion dollar company that now signed on last year to be a partner with us and gave us $10,000 last year and again this year.

168
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:22,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use it as a way of actually going out to raise money and create partnerships with tech firms.

169
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:26,647
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we're still raising money and there's a GoFundMe site out there.

170
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:30,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know where we stand with that, but maybe we can talk about it.

171
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:38,958
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I just don't want students and families to be writing a check to send their students to these events.

172
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:44,399
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, if somebody wants to give us free money, believe me, there's nobody here who would say no to that.

173
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,600
[SPEAKER_18]: But I just want to make sure that there's no expectation that the students will be spending any money of their own.

174
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:49,881
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

175
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:51,361
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year we raised almost $40,000.

176
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that sounds like a lot.

177
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Not through the GoFundMe, but mostly it came from corporate donations.

178
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:57,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

179
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:01,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year we're not quite there, but we're doing well again.

180
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:01,845
[SPEAKER_18]: That's exciting.

181
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:02,345
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

182
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,106
[SPEAKER_02]: But the trips are expensive, as you know.

183
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:07,949
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

184
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,331
[SPEAKER_19]: I would love for us to take a picture as well.

185
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:17,796
[SPEAKER_19]: And we will definitely get certificates to all of you as well for your wonderful accomplishment.

186
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:21,658
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm so glad you were able to make it so quickly.

187
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:24,280
[SPEAKER_19]: So do you want to come forward so we can take a picture together?

188
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:25,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

189
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:29,563
[SPEAKER_10]: We have somebody unlocking the doors now.

190
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:47,715
[SPEAKER_11]: For some reason, I'm not an iPhone person, not everybody got in.

191
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:29,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

192
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:28,206

00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:05,646
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are my announcements.

291
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:06,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

292
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:08,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

293
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:13,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's also one more school-related event on the 20th, which is this Saturday.

294
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:24,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Kremen from the McGlynn Schools volunteers will be at Oak Grove Cemetery putting flags on our veterans graves for Memorial Day.

295
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:25,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.

296
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:26,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Kremen.

297
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:27,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

298
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your comments.

299
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three, we have report on the CCSR outreach plan for 2023-2024.

300
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:49,583
[SPEAKER_07]: by Mr. Richard Trotta, director of SCCSR, in collaboration with Dr. Edward Vinson, our assistant superintendent, Dr. Peter Cushing, director Joan Bowen, and director, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli.

301
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:50,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

302
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just gonna get your mic turned on.

303
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, little person with the...

304
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

305
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:07,464
[SPEAKER_19]: So, before this presentation begins, I wanted the committee to know that we met.

306
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:12,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Trotter came and met with central office and we met as a team.

307
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:29,814
[SPEAKER_19]: We collaborated we really worked collaboratively on the presentation that you're going to hear this evening in your packets you did receive one of the beautiful flyers, which will also be shared.

308
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:37,217
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm, you know, I know they're getting the presentation up and ready to go but I do want you to know that it is a collaborative effort.

309
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:47,045
[SPEAKER_19]: And we are all working together to, you know, continue the great work that is happening and that continues to happen with CCSR.

310
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,746
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Trotter.

311
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:49,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

312
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:50,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that.

313
00:27:50,748 --> 00:27:52,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I echo those remarks.

314
00:27:52,830 --> 00:28:04,319
[SPEAKER_12]: I was really gratified that we got this work done and I believe it's a comprehensive report that covers all the areas and will improve participation in CCSR.

315
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:12,282
[SPEAKER_12]: There were a couple incidents with COVID and some other things, the loss of a key advisor, but we're coming back strong.

316
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:22,807
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the plan will improve the number of students we get and also the number of teachers who want to be advisors, because they rely on people selecting us.

317
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:26,909
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't hire people without them volunteering.

318
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,270
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a volunteer program.

319
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,911
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also a volunteer program for the students.

320
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:32,481
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to make it more attractive and efficient.

321
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:35,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's better that we work together on this.

322
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:36,722
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did, and it's an excellent report.

323
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:47,005
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to mention that the mission of the program, most of you know this, is to develop global citizens who work to make the world a better place.

324
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:48,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've done that.

325
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:57,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Over 2,000 students have gone through the program in the past few years and completed projects that did, or will, help make the world a better place.

326
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:06,331
[SPEAKER_12]: And one more point before I introduce Peter, anything in here is, we have to remember that this program is elective.

327
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:15,612
[SPEAKER_12]: So students pick, it's authentic also, so they pick the projects they want and we can encourage them, but we can't guarantee we can get certain projects done.

328
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:19,433
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so that's just where we say we'd like to have this and we do.

329
00:29:19,973 --> 00:29:27,635
[SPEAKER_12]: And we try to move students to different projects, but ultimately it's their idea that they take authentic ownership of, and we go with that.

330
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:34,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so with that, Peter, by the way, he did a great job of getting us ready, and I'm gonna let him take the stage.

331
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

332
00:29:37,095 --> 00:29:37,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

333
00:29:38,755 --> 00:29:46,196
[SPEAKER_15]: So the CCSR over the past couple of years has seen a slight decline in membership.

334
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:54,558
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had some transition in leadership at the school level, and surprisingly, we've had some challenges actively recruiting our staff.

335
00:29:55,248 --> 00:29:58,890
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we want to do is we want to move up the timeline for how we're going to do that.

336
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:07,015
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also want to start looking at this as students being members and the old line of membership has its privileges.

337
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:15,299
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure that the student membership understands the privilege and the honor to be part of a social service organization.

338
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:23,424
[SPEAKER_15]: So really going to start looking at making sure that we're actively outreaching to students, understanding how, so that they understand how this connects

339
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:32,836
[SPEAKER_15]: to both their community service obligations as well as the state's push for civic engagement on both of those pieces.

340
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:43,142
[SPEAKER_15]: We've created a monthly schedule of events that you can see in the document in front of you, adding a summer leadership academy that'll be from 9am till noon

341
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:57,618
[SPEAKER_15]: for two sessions, each session over two weeks during the summer that allows students to also maintain summer jobs and the flexibility of getting to school without it being normal school hours from 9 a.m.

342
00:30:57,918 --> 00:30:59,679
[SPEAKER_15]: till noon.

343
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,383
[SPEAKER_15]: So Leadership Academy, I'll let Mr. Trotter speak further on that.

344
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:10,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks to the City Community Fund that we got a grant for $10,000.

345
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And we designed a summer academy for any student in high school or going into high school.

346
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:20,248
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Peter mentioned, it's two two-week sessions.

347
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:27,956
[SPEAKER_12]: We're gonna plan to make it also want some online work because today's students work online.

348
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:31,279
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll have a hybrid situation and we'll have speakers.

349
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:34,462
[SPEAKER_12]: And when the students will learn the skills of being a leader.

350
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:36,296
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not going to develop a project.

351
00:31:36,316 --> 00:31:40,158
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have time for that, but we're going to try to teach them the skills of leadership.

352
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:44,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And so going forward, they can become what we call social entrepreneurs.

353
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,962
[SPEAKER_12]: And we hired a coordinator, Simone Elias, who helped us with the slides, and she's the person who's going to co-write the program.

354
00:31:52,602 --> 00:31:53,462
[SPEAKER_12]: We've done an outreach.

355
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:55,943
[SPEAKER_12]: We have some Tufts interns who are going to help us.

356
00:31:56,804 --> 00:31:59,384
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're going to the same issue with improvement.

357
00:31:59,404 --> 00:32:02,626
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to follow the same kind of plan for the Leadership Academy as well.

358
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:03,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

359
00:32:06,003 --> 00:32:26,015
[SPEAKER_15]: So over the course of the year, what we want to do is we want to make sure that we publicize well to all students, making sure that not just our traditionally represented students, but making sure that students with disabilities, students of EL backgrounds, that we are making sure that CCSR is welcome and open to all.

360
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:29,837
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're going to be doing is we're going to be visiting faculty meetings over the next month.

361
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:45,184
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to be publicizing this academy to all making sure that if we need extra support for some students that we're able to fund that and make sure that they are able to have that support in June of 2023 we want to make sure that we're hiring advisors for all schools, postings,

362
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:52,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Generally speaking, have had a challenge getting out with the regular hiring of the school district.

363
00:32:52,537 --> 00:33:07,385
[SPEAKER_15]: So we wanna make sure that we're getting our postings out earlier and that our faculty members have early options to be a part of CCSR and realize that they're a cornerstone piece of moving us forward.

364
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:11,828
[SPEAKER_15]: We wanna make sure that we're establishing expectations that they're going to be

365
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:15,974
[SPEAKER_15]: recruiting students throughout the summer and toward the end of the year.

366
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:28,339
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

367
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:41,225
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we want to do is we're going to meet with the director of EL programs, director of student services, our special education coordinators and our assistant principals as the assistant principals are usually closest to the work.

368
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:48,363
[SPEAKER_15]: and able to reach out to students to make sure that we're tapping all of our students that could be interested.

369
00:33:48,383 --> 00:34:01,387
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to run the student leadership Academy during the summer in August and September will have student membership drive continue meetings with advisors to plan a late September launch of all CCS our activities.

370
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:10,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Generally speaking, it's been delayed until October, we want to make sure that we're moving it up earlier in the year, and then we'll have meetings and activities carried throughout the year.

371
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:19,869
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we want to have a minimum of four evening events, similar to for those of you who are able to make it the stand with Ukraine vigil as as events present themselves.

372
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Sadly, to mention violence in schools.

373
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:28,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever it may be, violence around the world, those tend to be the ones that draw our attention.

374
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:37,875
[SPEAKER_15]: But what we want to do is we want to utilize our student leadership and our student voice to really come together around those events to make sure that we are moving forward.

375
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:48,057
[SPEAKER_15]: So in our slides, generally speaking, I would make sure that these get shared with the committee, talk to the specific summer leadership academy.

376
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:51,465
[SPEAKER_15]: So happy to take any questions or comments.

377
00:34:51,986 --> 00:34:52,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

378
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:53,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me.

379
00:34:53,387 --> 00:34:55,929
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to introduce Bernadette, Dr. Riccardelli.

380
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,691
[SPEAKER_12]: She's on the committee and Joan Bowen.

381
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:00,153
[SPEAKER_12]: We forgot to mention their names, but they did a great job as well.

382
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:00,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

383
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:02,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

384
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:15,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so when we when we got together, you know, maybe a little bit repetitive here but there's something, something additional that I want to point out, but you know trying to strategize increase the membership in this group student membership.

385
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:23,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I'll reiterate active student outreach so we're going to be reaching out to principals directly to students and so on.

386
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:31,910
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an option for students to fulfill that 60 hour graduation requirement for community service.

387
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't have to do this for community service.

388
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:38,314
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great option that can count for that requirement.

389
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:46,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Third, schedule the afterschool CCSR projects on days where there is afternoon transportation.

390
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,982
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that we looked at was the feedback was that

391
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:53,179
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, students couldn't, they couldn't stay after school.

392
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:59,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So to strategize those after school activities to coincide with afternoon transportation.

393
00:36:00,263 --> 00:36:16,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, but I think so importantly at the high school over the past several years, actually since 2016, we have had an elective class, a two period elective class that would meet twice, 56 minutes each out of the six day cycle.

394
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:20,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So it met one third of the total year.

395
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:25,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And the name of the elective is Diversity and Community Enrichment.

396
00:36:26,048 --> 00:36:32,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you know, Mr. Michael Skorka had been the advisor for this group and he also taught that class.

397
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:46,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only was he doing afterschool activities with other students, not in that elective, but he also had those students twice a week in front of him in which he was able to cultivate that group, really cultivate the project.

398
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:49,531
[SPEAKER_03]: That class did not occur this year.

399
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:53,414
[SPEAKER_03]: That class will run next year.

400
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:59,359
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hoping for at least, well, we're expecting at least one section, and we're hoping to have more than one section.

401
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:09,268
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think by embedding that class in the schedule in the day, that we can definitely increase excitement and membership in the CCSR.

402
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:10,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

403
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

404
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:17,858
[SPEAKER_10]: member mclaughlin.

405
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:19,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

406
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:24,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the presentation, I'm always so excited to hear about the CCS are.

407
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:27,169
[SPEAKER_05]: projects, and I love this outreach initiative.

408
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:38,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a couple of, I guess, either questions or comments that I wanted to suggest, because I think it's a really great opportunity to be thinking outside of the box.

409
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:43,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that you guys are collaborating and meeting across departments.

410
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:50,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask that, particularly with the meetings with the Director of Pupil Services and our EL Director,

411
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:55,496
[SPEAKER_05]: if there could be CPAC and ALPAC representation at those meetings as well.

412
00:37:56,156 --> 00:38:09,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a, for folks who are watching or listening, Special Ed Parent Advisory Council, whose role is to advise the district on matters pertaining to special education and to disability, and it's the same for the English Learners ALPAC.

413
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:15,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it'd be great, since those organizations sort of already exist, to be able to include them with feedback.

414
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:16,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be super helpful.

415
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:23,813
[SPEAKER_05]: For the outreach, I'm sure you guys will be doing translated material.

416
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:29,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And would you be using, well, I guess Mr. Paltasher will talk about talking points, right?

417
00:38:29,337 --> 00:38:31,439
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys using, yeah.

418
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:38,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just wanted to, is the diversity and community enrichment, the elective that you were talking about, was that the one that had the reverse inclusion model?

419
00:38:39,145 --> 00:38:40,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a great model.

420
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:43,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a great model, especially for building peer friendships.

421
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:47,091
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, those friendships were sustained even after school and through the summer

422
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:49,427
[SPEAKER_05]: students with and without disabilities.

423
00:38:49,467 --> 00:39:00,794
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a really great opportunity to the students and for them to interact with each other and really get to know each other and saw great outcomes with that for genuine friendships with, I thought was really remarkable.

424
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:12,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to that end, I think again, another just bug in people's ear to sort of be thinking about because that program was so successful is potentially a peer mentor program.

425
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:17,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that for either potentially students who have had experience with

426
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:27,164
[SPEAKER_05]: CCSR for students that haven't, particularly if you're looking at recruiting new folks, particularly LPAT, you know, students who English might not be their first language, maybe need a little extra support.

427
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:36,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Students with disability, like a peer mentor program where you're cultivating these leaders, potentially thinking about, you know, what that could look like in your leadership institute, I think could be great.

428
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:46,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to talk offline more about models that I've seen, you know, work elsewhere if folks are interested, but I think this is a really great opportunity to really enhance the diversity

429
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:49,760
[SPEAKER_05]: in the community and in the community engagement.

430
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate you guys doing that.

431
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:51,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

432
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:55,925
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Mustone.

433
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:56,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

434
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:57,246
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, everyone.

435
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,269
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just curious about the mini class.

436
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:03,812
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think the advantage of that with Mr. Skorka was that he was so accessible.

437
00:40:03,832 --> 00:40:05,874
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was such a gift to the students.

438
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:09,357
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember one student saying to me, everyone should have Mr. Skorka in their life.

439
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:11,439
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think everyone would agree.

440
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:12,179
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think

441
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,564
[SPEAKER_20]: besides that he had a gift and a vocation for that work, are you going to hire someone?

442
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:33,535
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you posting, I don't know if his title was formerly assistant director, but I think it's hard to do the work unless you're in a classroom in the hallways with kids because they're coming and going as we all know with teenagers and to pin them down, that was the advantage of the power of Mr. Skorka.

443
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:36,297
[SPEAKER_20]: He was always available for every student all the time.

444
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:41,124
[SPEAKER_12]: He was an assistant director, but he was lead teacher.

445
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:42,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Lead teacher.

446
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:47,990
[SPEAKER_12]: And he did the high school, but he also worked with the other advisors at the other schools.

447
00:40:48,751 --> 00:40:50,612
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was a broader role than just an advisor.

448
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:54,395
[SPEAKER_20]: So will you replace a lead teacher at the high school?

449
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:58,419
[SPEAKER_20]: I just think it's hard for kids to get work done when there's not an adult who's always available to them.

450
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:02,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the lead teacher was because he worked throughout the district.

451
00:41:02,782 --> 00:41:04,424
[SPEAKER_12]: He was an advisor and a lead teacher.

452
00:41:04,924 --> 00:41:06,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's a difference.

453
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:10,349
[SPEAKER_12]: The administrative things he did were, I'm the lead teacher, pat.

454
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,771
[SPEAKER_12]: But as an advisor, he still was the advisor.

455
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,975
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, theoretically, he could be an advisor again, if he wanted.

456
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:18,237
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's open to people who want to apply.

457
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:20,359
[SPEAKER_12]: So he could just do that if he'd like.

458
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,721
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the other thing got to be a problem.

459
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:27,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And to answer your question, Member Mustone, if you read, if page three, it says post

460
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:36,219
[SPEAKER_07]: advisor positions for two weeks for initial hiring that's supposed to happen on this week on May 16 tomorrow.

461
00:41:36,419 --> 00:41:38,821
[SPEAKER_20]: So will the advisor be the mini course teacher?

462
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that could be.

463
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:42,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So ideally, yes.

464
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:50,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I would say is, I mean, we'd like to expand this to more than one section more than just, you know,

465
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:52,445
[SPEAKER_03]: the class, just being one.

466
00:41:53,526 --> 00:42:13,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say it's not restricted to that, you know, so for example, if I were a teacher in the classroom, and I, you know, was a social studies teacher, I was teaching contemporary issues, but I wanted to jump into this, I think the most important thing is someone has the desire to do it, I think the skills can develop

467
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:28,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So to answer your question, I kind of stepped back because I wasn't sure exactly with regard to bringing in another lead teacher, but with regard to the course, it doesn't necessarily have to be the lead teacher for this project.

468
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:41,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be someone who is committed to this project and they are going to teach the class during the day with the understanding that there is gonna be the output of CCSR projects.

469
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that answer your question?

470
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:44,361
[SPEAKER_20]: It does.

471
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:52,666
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think it's going to be as successful with not having a lead teacher as the advisor because he was just always available.

472
00:42:52,686 --> 00:42:58,429
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I just know from my own senior who had been very involved and from her classmates.

473
00:42:58,629 --> 00:43:07,574
[SPEAKER_20]: So I guess my recommendation would be ideal if the advisor was the lead teacher because then the kids have wonderful ideas that take a lot of footwork to get them happening.

474
00:43:08,314 --> 00:43:09,294
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's my only concern.

475
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:10,215
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.

476
00:43:10,535 --> 00:43:16,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the thought of bringing this course back in, because you do need the time.

477
00:43:16,878 --> 00:43:19,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is a lot that you can do outside the class.

478
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:27,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think having that time built in during the day really stimulates the thoughts that teacher gets to know the students and so on.

479
00:43:27,143 --> 00:43:31,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So your question is a good one.

480
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:35,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it is up to whether or not we're able to

481
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:38,673
[SPEAKER_03]: attract someone to that lead position.

482
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:43,016
[SPEAKER_15]: And so one of the challenges with the lead teacher role is, generally speaking, a reduction in classes.

483
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:54,723
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that becomes challenging in certain subject areas where, if you reduce the number of sections taught, but it's something that we can definitely take under advisement and really look at.

484
00:43:54,864 --> 00:44:05,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I agree with you, having that person who is boots on the ground with the students, what we're hoping to do is by bringing together the advisors earlier, we're able to have a more cohesive approach

485
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:19,760
[SPEAKER_15]: as opposed to having a lead teacher who, I'll be honest, took on a tremendous amount of responsibility and did amazing work, but there was also just a tremendous amount heaped onto that one person.

486
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:29,767
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what we're trying to do is we're trying to really spread the work out without necessarily having it fall on that one person.

487
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:32,769
[SPEAKER_15]: for various factors.

488
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:37,953
[SPEAKER_15]: However, we would love to really, we'll take a look at the ability to do that.

489
00:44:40,415 --> 00:44:49,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're thinking of maybe two people, hopefully teachers that are interested and willing to do the outreach and be the Michael Squawker that we used to have.

490
00:44:50,002 --> 00:44:56,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think we were over 200 students at one point and now I think the numbers are in the below a hundred.

491
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:57,327
[SPEAKER_12]: At the high school.

492
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:58,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, at the high school alone.

493
00:44:58,568 --> 00:44:58,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

494
00:44:58,768 --> 00:45:00,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, on that issue.

495
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:04,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Michael is an amazing teacher and advisor.

496
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:06,165
[SPEAKER_12]: He drew on kids like the Pied Piper.

497
00:45:06,826 --> 00:45:08,807
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not there now.

498
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:13,549
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'd be great to get someone like that and have two advisors.

499
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,490
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the key thing.

500
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,911
[SPEAKER_12]: The advisors are really key every place.

501
00:45:16,971 --> 00:45:19,913
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the person who works with the students, like a teacher in a classroom.

502
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:22,294
[SPEAKER_12]: And we only get what we get.

503
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:23,675
[SPEAKER_12]: They move our plies.

504
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,817
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully we can encourage through our work as a committee to get some good candidates.

505
00:45:29,498 --> 00:45:30,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you.

506
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:31,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

507
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:35,711
[SPEAKER_07]: If there are no other questions, thank you very much for the presentation.

508
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:38,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

509
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:41,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate the work and the outreach.

510
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:41,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

511
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:48,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, superintendent has an update on the Special Olympics.

512
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:50,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I just wanted to.

513
00:45:50,731 --> 00:46:01,240
[SPEAKER_19]: I received a message just saying that on Thursday May 18 at 9am the Special Olympics will be taking place in at McDonald Stadium.

514
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:15,526
[SPEAKER_19]: So for anyone who is planning on attending the Special Olympics this year, it is taking place back in Malden at McDonald Stadium, and I believe we're gonna alternate back and forth.

515
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:17,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you.

516
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:19,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

517
00:46:20,108 --> 00:46:26,370
[SPEAKER_07]: We have number five, report on implementation of capital skills grant for metal fabrication.

518
00:46:26,991 --> 00:46:30,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Chad Fallon, principal of the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

519
00:46:32,452 --> 00:46:32,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

520
00:46:33,412 --> 00:46:34,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello again.

521
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:41,335
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also here with me tonight is one of our newest faculty members in the vocational high school, Mr. Curtis Jackson.

522
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:43,916
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought tonight would be a great opportunity to introduce you to him.

523
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:50,679
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to play a little game here where I'm going to give the name of the machine and he's going to tell you what it does.

524
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:53,520
[SPEAKER_17]: So we rehearsed this.

525
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:58,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to frame our conversation on the second slide,

526
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,693
[SPEAKER_17]: The skills capital grant has been around.

527
00:47:01,713 --> 00:47:04,978
[SPEAKER_17]: This was Governor Baker's initiative when he built his workforce cabinet.

528
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,621
[SPEAKER_17]: probably seven or eight years ago.

529
00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:11,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Just as a reminder, if we could have the next slide.

530
00:47:12,384 --> 00:47:13,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, thank you, Peter.

531
00:47:13,925 --> 00:47:20,871
[SPEAKER_17]: As a reminder, Medford has benefited close to $1.5 million in the skills grant funding, all the way back to the Bistro.

532
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:23,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we re-outfitted our engineering and robotics program.

533
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:28,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Last year was our construction, and this year went to metal fabrication.

534
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:31,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, none of this could be possible if it weren't for the help

535
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:36,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Grant writing is very difficult, and we have someone within our faculty who's still here, Mr. Sam Christie.

536
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:38,321
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank him as well.

537
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:45,684
[SPEAKER_17]: Because he has been integral to receiving this grant this time around.

538
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:53,166
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you were anywhere around the school last week, you saw big cranes in the air and kids were pretty excited, lots of wooden pallets outside of our doors.

539
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:57,408
[SPEAKER_17]: We have really upgraded the metal fabrication and welding shop to what any

540
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:00,660
[SPEAKER_17]: welder or fabricator would probably dream of.

541
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,522
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, something that Curtis said the other day was it's always been his dream to have a shop like this.

542
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,663
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you walk in, you can feel it.

543
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:17,327
[SPEAKER_17]: And just, you know, sorry to embarrass you here, but also when you walk into Mr. Jackson's classroom, you feel the connections that he's made with these students in such a short time.

544
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:25,791
[SPEAKER_17]: While teaching, while having each one of his students create a piece of furniture or a piece of artwork that they have

545
00:48:26,724 --> 00:48:28,744
[SPEAKER_17]: created from design to inception.

546
00:48:29,925 --> 00:48:32,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Pretty soon, they're gonna be sent out to be powder-coated.

547
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:35,766
[SPEAKER_17]: So some students did a table, some did a chair, some did ornamental shelving.

548
00:48:37,086 --> 00:48:42,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Jackson allows them to think with creativity, but to also learn the skills of welding.

549
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:51,909
[SPEAKER_17]: And for me, having been here, it's my sixth year now, I have never seen such enthusiasm and excitement within this program.

550
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep in mind, this is a program we were thinking might not have made it a few years ago.

551
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,310
[SPEAKER_17]: And thanks to you,

552
00:48:58,664 --> 00:49:02,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Curtis also has many years experience in the iron workers.

553
00:49:04,385 --> 00:49:10,627
[SPEAKER_17]: He was an iron worker and we're thankful that he chose to come work for us at this point.

554
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:11,947
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for that.

555
00:49:11,987 --> 00:49:12,767
[SPEAKER_17]: And now we play the game.

556
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:16,268
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Jackson, is this your, I remember you at orientation.

557
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:17,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this your first year or second year?

558
00:49:18,628 --> 00:49:19,048
[SPEAKER_07]: First year.

559
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:19,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

560
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're just completing your first year.

561
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:21,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

562
00:49:21,923 --> 00:49:22,523
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not there yet.

563
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:25,165
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of weeks, come on.

564
00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:28,307
[SPEAKER_17]: You're as bad as the seniors.

565
00:49:28,588 --> 00:49:31,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm gonna go through a few things.

566
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,611
[SPEAKER_17]: So the grant itself was $320,000.

567
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:40,276
[SPEAKER_17]: And we did get some in-kind donations and that usually takes shape in the way of training or other sources.

568
00:49:40,316 --> 00:49:43,598
[SPEAKER_17]: But luckily, Mr. Jackson has worked on these machines throughout the years.

569
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:45,979
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanna show you very quickly some of these things.

570
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:48,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Curtis will mention something that it does that maybe we can all relate to.

571
00:49:49,662 --> 00:49:50,643
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll start with the engine lathe.

572
00:49:51,263 --> 00:49:51,903
[SPEAKER_17]: What does this do?

573
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:54,644
[SPEAKER_14]: This, you can spin metal on it.

574
00:49:54,704 --> 00:49:56,165
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very similar to a wood lathe.

575
00:49:56,205 --> 00:50:00,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you see people make table legs and stuff like that, but you do it with metal.

576
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:03,967
[SPEAKER_14]: It just spins it around really fast and you can cut it to shape and size.

577
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:08,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Press break.

578
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:12,110
[SPEAKER_14]: This bends sheet metal and bar stock.

579
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:15,011
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a 33 ton pressure.

580
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:17,111
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a hydraulic pressure machine.

581
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:19,112
[SPEAKER_14]: It presses down really hard and bends the metal.

582
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:23,594
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, these are all pictures from as the equipment was coming in last week.

583
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:27,517
[SPEAKER_20]: That one's from Amazon.

584
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,480
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a sanding.

585
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:33,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a belt sander and a disc sander.

586
00:50:34,023 --> 00:50:41,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So you just put your metal on those two platforms and push against the sanding as it's spinning around to change its shape and size.

587
00:50:44,738 --> 00:50:52,481
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a heavy-duty aluminum TIG and MIG welder for welding really thick and heavy materials.

588
00:50:55,282 --> 00:50:56,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Sandblaster.

589
00:50:57,143 --> 00:51:04,766
[SPEAKER_14]: High-pressured air and sand is used to remove scale, rust, or paint off of most metal surfaces.

590
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:18,104
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a milling machine, so that long table moves back and forth, and any tooling that you put in the machine will remove or change the shape and size of metal as it passes back and forth.

591
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:28,630
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a pan break, so it's similar to the press break, but it's for lighter material, and it's just for bending small pieces of sheet metal.

592
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:35,454
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a CNC plasma cutter, so you take

593
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:58,397
[SPEAKER_14]: sheet metal up to one inch thick, and a laser type plasma cutter will come out and it's computer controlled, will cut pieces of metal out of a large plate of unmatched and indescribable shapes that you could ever program it to do.

594
00:51:59,038 --> 00:52:01,880
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my favorite.

595
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:12,032
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a tool vault, but it's also called a field office, because I can put my computer, laptop, printer, everything else in the upper area.

596
00:52:12,652 --> 00:52:18,637
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the bottom is all secure tool storage that can be locked and put away every day.

597
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:22,259
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought this was cool because it mimics what the kids would see on a job site.

598
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,320
[SPEAKER_17]: This is typical out there.

599
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,582
[SPEAKER_17]: For me, I was like, wow, this is like a fancy cubicle.

600
00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:26,222
[SPEAKER_17]: How do I get in here?

601
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:28,724
[SPEAKER_17]: But this was, right, Alice Beth knows I love my cubicles.

602
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:29,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's kind of what it is, yeah.

603
00:52:31,343 --> 00:52:33,084
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a slip roll.

604
00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:44,373
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a series of rolls, very similar to a pasta machine, except you can put a sheet of quarter inch thick material in it and gradually roll it into a cylindrical shape.

605
00:52:44,393 --> 00:52:47,176
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can make a tank, a vessel, a fire pit.

606
00:52:47,716 --> 00:52:51,219
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll just roll it into a circle or oval.

607
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,640
[SPEAKER_14]: A vessel.

608
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,481
[SPEAKER_14]: A vessel.

609
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:54,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are we going?

610
00:52:56,363 --> 00:52:56,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this one.

611
00:52:56,803 --> 00:52:57,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I mention this one?

612
00:52:57,664 --> 00:52:57,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

613
00:52:58,244 --> 00:52:58,905
[SPEAKER_17]: This is my favorite.

614
00:52:59,246 --> 00:53:04,148
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what we're going to make for the superintendent and her team have a vision for bike racks throughout the school.

615
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:10,451
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the machine that's going to do in fact I just took a picture of the one out front here because I like that with the Medford symbol in the middle.

616
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:13,512
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the machine that's going to help us make bike racks galore.

617
00:53:15,197 --> 00:53:26,661
[SPEAKER_17]: All of the outside by the MBTA buses where we've had a few minor incidents of students, we're going to build some nice barriers all along that stretch so that people aren't stepping into the bus lane.

618
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:28,222
[SPEAKER_14]: A heavy handrail.

619
00:53:28,882 --> 00:53:29,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

620
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:36,825
[SPEAKER_14]: So tubing goes in those rolls and you move them and you pass the tubing back and forth and it gradually rolls it up into different shapes.

621
00:53:38,854 --> 00:53:40,315
[SPEAKER_17]: So as always, thank you for your support.

622
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:43,237
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have to say this committee has always been very good to us.

623
00:53:43,658 --> 00:53:45,039
[SPEAKER_17]: You support us, you listen.

624
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:49,542
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you're seeing all the good things that we've been seeing for the past few years.

625
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:54,446
[SPEAKER_17]: We're having a great time, you know, and in spite of it all, we are doing stuff like this.

626
00:53:54,486 --> 00:53:58,168
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just another example of what's happening in the high school.

627
00:53:58,809 --> 00:53:59,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to Mr. Jackson.

628
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:00,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Wouldn't be possible without him.

629
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:01,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Chrissy.

630
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:04,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, Assistant Principal Director Fitzpatrick is here as well tonight.

631
00:54:04,913 --> 00:54:05,774
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you to the team.

632
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:06,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, everybody.

633
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:07,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

634
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:09,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

635
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:13,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this might be a couple of questions.

636
00:54:14,172 --> 00:54:14,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

637
00:54:15,193 --> 00:54:15,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

638
00:54:15,433 --> 00:54:17,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say thank you for that presentation.

639
00:54:17,394 --> 00:54:18,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It was excellent.

640
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:22,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know during the open house, we're able to come by and it's so exciting being in that shop.

641
00:54:23,038 --> 00:54:28,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't realize just, you know, how much artistry is involved in the work too.

642
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:37,148
[SPEAKER_05]: People think that, you know, it's labor, which it is, but it's also art and it's really great to come by and see the combination and what the kids are doing and the creativity that's involved there.

643
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:40,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I would just encourage community members and others to

644
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:54,536
[SPEAKER_05]: come by and take a look at what's happening at the vocational school, because I always just feel so positive when we go through those tours and we see what our kids are doing in the schools and what you guys are doing.

645
00:54:54,576 --> 00:54:57,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that combination of skill and art.

646
00:54:57,619 --> 00:55:01,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a special ability that's able to do that.

647
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:02,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

648
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:03,711
[SPEAKER_17]: We've only begun.

649
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:10,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Curtis has an interest also, which we're going to work on for maybe next year to open some adult evening classes.

650
00:55:10,217 --> 00:55:19,246
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, with some new teachers that we have on board now, they're, you know, the trouble with running night classes, the teachers are really tired, but we have new people who aren't tired yet.

651
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:26,893
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to take advantage and we're going to start to offer some night classes, but because just what you said, the artistic piece of it, I mean, I would love to learn how to weld myself.

652
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:27,714
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's something that

653
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:29,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there's a lot.

654
00:55:30,014 --> 00:55:34,777
[SPEAKER_17]: And this equipment, it gets used during the day, but it sits basically vacant at night.

655
00:55:34,817 --> 00:55:36,038
[SPEAKER_17]: So why not use it?

656
00:55:36,979 --> 00:55:43,844
[SPEAKER_20]: I also think Mr. Jackson sounds like a great candidate for the CCSR advisor program.

657
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:44,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

658
00:55:45,005 --> 00:55:45,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

659
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:45,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

660
00:55:47,707 --> 00:55:48,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.

661
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:50,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Great job.

662
00:55:50,169 --> 00:55:51,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the presentation.

663
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:51,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

664
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:51,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

665
00:55:59,468 --> 00:56:07,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we have no presentations of the public or continued business, but we have a few items under new business, which is number eight.

666
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:27,437
[SPEAKER_07]: First one is 2023-09 offered by member Hays and member McLaughlin, whereas up-to-date policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, and retaliation are fundamental to ensuring a safe and equitable learning environment for Redford Public Schools students and working environment for Redford Public Schools staff

667
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:43,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the Massachusetts Association of School Committees has recently updated their sample policies regarding discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, and retaliation in order to reflect the most current laws and regulations, clarify language, and add protected classes.

668
00:56:44,382 --> 00:56:55,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Subcommittee will meet to review Medford policies AC non-discrimination, Title IX, Chapter 622, ACAB harassment,

669
00:56:58,487 --> 00:57:02,811
[SPEAKER_07]: and ACABR policy prohibiting sexual harassment and violence.

670
00:57:03,331 --> 00:57:23,909
[SPEAKER_07]: The subcommittee will consider the following MASC policy updates, AC non-discrimination policy, including harassment and retaliation, ACR non-discrimination policy, including harassment and retaliation, ACA non-discrimination of the basis of sex, ACAB sexual harassment, and JICK harassment of students.

671
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:25,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Note policy ACE

672
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:34,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Non-discrimination of the basis of disability is not included in this resolution as a separate resolution addressing the policy is being written by another school committee member.

673
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:39,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion for approval or would member Hays or member McLaughlin like to speak at all?

674
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:46,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Hays.

675
00:57:46,957 --> 00:57:47,777
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

676
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:48,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

679
00:57:53,484 --> 00:58:20,355
[SPEAKER_07]: 2023-10 offered by Member Hays and Member McLaughlin, whereas the Medford Public School is committed to ensuring that all students are afforded a safe and healthy learning environment, whereas Title IX legislation is a federal civil rights law enforced by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights that provides protections for students and staff by prohibiting sex-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, in programs or activities that receive federal finance

680
00:58:20,643 --> 00:58:45,856
[SPEAKER_07]: financial assistance from the Department of Education, whereas Title IX requires public schools to take steps to prevent and remedy two forms of sex-based harassment, sexual harassment and gender-based harassment, whereas the Office of Civil Rights requires public schools to disseminate their non-discrimination policy in the Title IX coordinator's contact information to ensure accessible channels of reporting sex-based and gender-based discrimination and harassment

681
00:58:46,465 --> 00:58:50,647
[SPEAKER_07]: and to notify students, employees, parents, and others of how the school respond to the reports.

682
00:58:51,428 --> 00:59:13,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the Office of Civil Rights requires public schools to prominently display on their websites the required contact information for the Title IX coordinator, whereas all Title IX training materials must be publicly available, be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools website will be updated to include a page section that provides a full description of the Medford Public Schools

683
00:59:13,669 --> 00:59:35,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Title IX policies regarding sex-based and gender-based discrimination and harassment, and includes the Title IX coordinator's name, title, email, and phone number, procedures for reporting allegations of harassment and filing a formal complaint, description of the grievance process, and materials from Medford Public Schools Title IX trainings or information about how to access those materials.

684
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:42,383
[SPEAKER_07]: For reference, please see the Bedford Public Schools Policy or the Cambridge Public Schools Policy.

685
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:48,786
[SPEAKER_07]: We had further resolved the 2023-2024 online parent and student handbooks for each school.

686
00:59:48,826 --> 01:00:01,392
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll provide a summary description of these policies, including the Title IX coordinator's name, title, email, and phone number, and a link to the page with the full policy, printed versions of the handbooks if provided.

687
01:00:01,412 --> 01:00:10,656
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll also include a summary description of these policies, including the Title IX coordinator's name, title, email, and phone, with instructions about how to obtain a copy of the full policy.

688
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays.

689
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:16,981
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

690
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:17,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

691
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:19,022

692
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:20,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

693
01:00:21,142 --> 01:00:25,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Member Hays and Member Bestone, 2023-11.

694
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:37,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the mission of the Medford Public Schools is of a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community designed to ensure that all students are afforded a safe and healthy learning environment in which they develop the knowledgeable skills,

695
01:00:38,578 --> 01:01:03,714
[SPEAKER_07]: the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to reach their full academic and personal potential, whereas the Medford Public Schools hired Michael J. Welch of leadership advisors consulting LLC to provide an evaluation of the culture and climate at Medford High School complex with recommendations for areas of improvement, whereas Mr. Welch's report and presentation to the school committee on 5-1-23 detailed the number of areas of significant concern that warrant additional discussion.

696
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved, the Medford School Committee will convene a committee of the whole meeting

697
01:01:07,435 --> 01:01:15,741
[SPEAKER_07]: with consultant Michael J. Welch for further in-depth discussion of his safety, security, and school climate review of Medford High School and Medford Vocational High School.

698
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:19,143
[SPEAKER_07]: This meeting will be held as soon as possible, but no later than June 20th.

699
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:22,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Welch will be compensated at his hourly rate.

700
01:01:24,987 --> 01:01:34,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve, and I think we threw around the second meeting in June, prior to the second school committee meeting in June, we do have open, so potentially that could be the date.

701
01:01:34,975 --> 01:01:36,996
[SPEAKER_07]: So motion for approval by member McLaughlin,

702
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:38,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Member Hays.

703
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:39,657
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

704
01:01:39,877 --> 01:01:41,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Roll call, please.

705
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call has been requested.

706
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:47,004
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could call the roll, please.

707
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait for somebody else to do it.

708
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:51,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham?

709
01:01:51,227 --> 01:01:51,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

710
01:01:52,228 --> 01:01:52,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Hays?

711
01:01:52,669 --> 01:01:52,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

712
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:53,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Kreatz?

713
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:54,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

714
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:55,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin?

715
01:01:56,072 --> 01:01:56,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

716
01:01:56,472 --> 01:01:57,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Restone?

717
01:01:57,293 --> 01:01:57,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

718
01:01:57,713 --> 01:01:58,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Restone, no.

719
01:01:58,574 --> 01:01:59,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

720
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:01,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

721
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:02,678
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

722
01:02:03,914 --> 01:02:08,918
[SPEAKER_07]: offered by Member McLaughlin, Member Mustone, and Member Hays, 2023-12.

723
01:02:09,778 --> 01:02:29,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas Medford Public Schools have the responsibility to create a non-discrimination agreement to be shared publicly on the basis of multiple state and federal laws, and whereas Medford Public Schools has established the following non-discrimination policy, which is attached, the Medford Public Schools is a community that celebrates and respects its diversity.

724
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:33,436
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Public Schools does not discriminate in educational programs or employment

725
01:02:34,056 --> 01:02:42,663
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunities on the basis of race, color, gender, religion, citizenship, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity.

726
01:02:43,383 --> 01:02:53,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just gonna say, I'm willing to waive the reading of the non-discrimination policy currently and the Medford School Committee non-discrimination AC policy, if my colleagues agree.

727
01:02:53,891 --> 01:02:55,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, I agree.

728
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:56,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

729
01:02:58,155 --> 01:02:58,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

730
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:02,218
[SPEAKER_07]: A motion to waive the reading by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz, all those in favor?

731
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:03,868
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

732
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:05,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

733
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:08,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go right to the be it resolved.

734
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:23,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved as of September 1st, 2023, Medford Public Schools will include the following accommodation statement in all non-discrimination policies and procedures, as well as any school-based activities that occur as part of the life of the school.

735
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it further resolved, this accommodation statement will be included in all forms

736
01:03:27,915 --> 01:03:30,738
[SPEAKER_07]: for participation in school-based activities and events.

737
01:03:31,218 --> 01:03:37,144
[SPEAKER_07]: We value inclusion and access for all participants and are pleased to provide accommodations for this activity event.

738
01:03:37,624 --> 01:03:42,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Please contact your school's 504 coordinator or assistant principal to make an accommodation request.

739
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:45,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Requests must be submitted at least five days prior to this event.

740
01:03:46,513 --> 01:03:48,295
[SPEAKER_07]: This event is wheelchair accessible.

741
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:51,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

742
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:56,558
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have a question about including language that says this event is wheelchair accessible.

743
01:03:56,738 --> 01:03:59,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Is every single one of our vocational programs wheelchair accessible?

744
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:07,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Every space in our high school and all of our other schools that we allow anybody to use, are they actually all wheelchair accessible?

745
01:04:08,003 --> 01:04:16,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we're going to literally put on the forms and on the notices of these things that it's wheelchair accessible when it is not wheelchair accessible.

746
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:17,968
[SPEAKER_18]: And I find that confusing.

747
01:04:18,615 --> 01:04:19,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information.

748
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information or a question.

749
01:04:24,439 --> 01:04:26,161
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, I'll wait to respond.

750
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:26,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

751
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:28,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rossell, you- I'm sorry.

752
01:04:28,522 --> 01:04:29,823
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that was a question.

753
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:32,925
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know the answer and I'm being completely honest and I don't know the answer.

754
01:04:32,945 --> 01:04:38,690
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like the Curtis Tufts and there may be others that we probably can't think of now that may have an issue with this.

755
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:43,273
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that last line can be optional depending on if it is wheelchair accessible.

756
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:49,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, that's what I was going to propose is that that's exactly at that if the event is wheelchair accessible.

757
01:04:50,640 --> 01:05:07,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Frankly, it's just good practice for all events citywide that if the event is wheelchair accessible that folks let them let let the community know that it is wheelchair accessible because you don't want people coming to the event and in a wheelchair and not having it be accessible and not having noted that.

758
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:09,031
[SPEAKER_05]: or omitted that.

759
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:15,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's important to include it, and I can rephrase it to include it when the event is wheelchair accessible.

760
01:05:15,976 --> 01:05:27,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also just add that because we are getting federal funding, as is the city, situations are generally required to be accessible to wheelchairs as well.

761
01:05:27,325 --> 01:05:29,647
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some instances in the city I understand that are

762
01:05:30,213 --> 01:05:34,434
[SPEAKER_05]: quote unquote grandfathered based on the status of the building.

763
01:05:34,474 --> 01:05:38,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that Curtis Tufts might fall into that category, although I don't know for sure.

764
01:05:38,396 --> 01:05:44,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping that we're gonna talk more about that as a committee, as a whole, as we move forward.

765
01:05:44,118 --> 01:05:51,180
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the interim, what we want, what this was proposing is really that the community understands that accommodation requests are required.

766
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that we waived the reading, but they are required under several of the laws that are noted in the motion.

767
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:08,866
[SPEAKER_05]: including Title IX, Section 504 Rehabilitation Act, IDEA, I mean, Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

768
01:06:08,886 --> 01:06:27,016
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm fine with modifying the motion to say, you know, from we value inclusion to submit it at least five days prior to the event period with a quote, and then separate from that, please add, you know, when event is wheelchair accessible.

769
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:30,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, motion for approval by member McLaughlin as amended.

770
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:31,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second?

771
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays, second.

772
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,500
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

773
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:35,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

774
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,161
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

775
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:36,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

776
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:37,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

777
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:41,602
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have any reports requested or condolences.

778
01:06:42,142 --> 01:06:44,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next meeting is the 10th regular school committee meeting.

779
01:06:44,742 --> 01:06:52,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be held on June 5th, Monday, June 5th, 2023 here in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, as well as on Zoom.

780
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn?

781
01:06:54,923 --> 01:06:57,547
[SPEAKER_07]: by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

782
01:06:57,627 --> 01:06:58,488
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

783
01:06:58,508 --> 01:06:59,890
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

784
01:07:00,091 --> 01:07:00,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Meeting is adjourned.
