1
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:55,731
Okay.

2
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:51,264
you

3
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:40,042
you

4
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:19,075
speaking in a regular meeting of the Senate President Council in September of 2017.

5
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:26,319
Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President.

6
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,051
under God, with liberty and justice for all.

7
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:54,673
Councilor Scarbell.

8
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:57,173
Sorry, spin the rules so we can hear.

9
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:01,834
Take something off of the unfinished business.

10
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:02,514
That would be 17-734.

11
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:03,094
Motion by Councilor Scarbell

12
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:20,768
I just want to go on record as recusing myself from the conversation.

13
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:25,911
My parents live on South Street, and I spoke to state ethics today, and I'm going to recuse myself.

14
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:27,251
Thank you, Counselor.

15
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:28,672
Counselor Scarponi.

16
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,413
Thank you, Mr. President.

17
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:44,859
After extensive meetings with our friends from Eversource and a thorough review on many concerns and issues, they've been very responsive with

18
00:09:46,271 --> 00:10:02,816
Aside from all of the official approvals through the city engineer and all that need to be apprised of this daunting task of a huge project that will take us through a few different cities.

19
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:27,541
If we can have, I think that we've gone over every issue to nauseam and I appreciate everybody's effort and Eversource's responses to all of our concerns and issues and I move to accept and place it on file.

20
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:30,883
Move approval, excuse me.

21
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,070
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley.

22
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,691
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

23
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:41,592
All those in favor.

24
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:44,672
Councilor Dela Russo.

25
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:52,914
Mr. President, we've had, as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned, quite extensive meetings, and we've gotten a lot of answers.

26
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:56,535
We've gotten a lot of response.

27
00:10:57,495 --> 00:11:03,400
in thoughtful responses to the questions that we've asked on behalf of the citizens regarding this program.

28
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:16,550
We've also, I think, the representatives of Eversource and their contractor who's going to

29
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:32,862
execute the project, have listened seriously and intently to the concerns of the council regarding the citizens and what they want regarding traffic, regarding safety.

30
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:45,084
And we also delved in some of the previously negotiated items from the memorandum of agreement that was etched out between Eversource and

31
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:52,126
the city administration and various department heads who have expertise in these matters.

32
00:11:53,006 --> 00:12:10,411
And although we were able to make some inroads and renegotiate some of the aspects of the Yalta conference, Mr. President, I'm satisfied as one counselor to have heard everything satisfactorily that concerns me.

33
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:15,613
And I approve of this project of the grant.

34
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:17,035
Thank you.

35
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:18,316
Vice President Mox.

36
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:20,537
Thank you, Mr. President.

37
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:23,019
And I agree with my colleagues.

38
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:29,283
This has been a thorough and really in-depth process.

39
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:41,811
We've heard about this project for at least the past, I think, two and a half years now regarding this underground transmission line and that Eversource was going to be doing this particular work in the community.

40
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:45,233
This council had a public hearing back

41
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:53,795
I think now it's over a year ago where we opened it up to the general public to ask some preliminary questions regarding the process.

42
00:12:54,595 --> 00:13:13,159
As I stated from the beginning and as I still state, this project, in my opinion, may benefit the overall grid and may benefit communities going out north, but it has little to no benefit to the residents of this community other than 100% disruption on our streets,

43
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,801
traffic and everything else associated with this project.

44
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:34,128
With that being said, Mr. President, I have to say over the last several weeks in meeting with Eversource and the Committee of the Whole meetings and asking the important questions that we did get many of our questions answered at the meeting.

45
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:40,911
Part of the meeting tonight was to discuss some of the concerns we had from the last meeting and

46
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:56,337
We did get, I think, some of the crucial issues, in my opinion, which, as Councilor Scott Pelley brought up, regarding notification of the neighbors, and I feel very comfortable that there is going to be an exhaustive,

47
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:12,649
a notification by Eversource to reach out to the neighborhood, not only door to door, but also to have a public meeting, which I think will address many of the issues or concerns residents may have along this particular route.

48
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:17,312
And not just residents on the route, Mr. President, this impacts entire neighborhoods.

49
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:23,475
and not just people on Winthrop Street or Mystic Ave or South Street, but entire neighborhoods.

50
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:46,249
Also tonight, we requested that the city's new leak detection program, which was implemented back, I believe, roughly a year ago, that when this construction work that takes place on our roads is gonna be in the proximity of our water mains, over and above our water mains, that we as a community have to monitor and make sure that

51
00:14:47,309 --> 00:15:03,278
If there is disruption to our 100-year-old water pipes or sewer pipes, that we are safeguarded as a community to make sure that Eversource will pick up the tab when it comes to lead or cast iron pipes.

52
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:06,340
that may be disturbed during this process.

53
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:18,912
And I think we've come to an agreement with Eversource and the city engineer will sit down and do case by case analysis on what they believe is warranted for repair.

54
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:24,298
So I think that was a very positive outcome that took place.

55
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:31,143
Also, Mr. President, and this has been an issue near and dear to me, raised crosswalks in the community.

56
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:39,029
Back some years ago, Mayor McGlynn at the time implemented a pilot program to do three raised crosswalks.

57
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,393
And some four years later, we've only implemented one on Winthrop Street.

58
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,555
But this particular proposal

59
00:15:47,415 --> 00:16:03,290
calls for not only the restoration of Winthrop Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Salt Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, but also, Mr. President, calls for the implementation of raised crosswalks

60
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:18,978
at Meffitt High School on Winthrop Street, Winthrop Street at the crosswalk between Memorial Park and Meffitt Community Gardens, which we all know is a very tough place to cross, and South Street at the entrance of the pedestrian pathway to Route 16.

61
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:31,545
So I am pleased to see that Eversource has included that in the MOU that is signed with the city, and I'm also very pleased to hear that

62
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:37,129
We're not going to take a minimal standard as the city solicitor, which I don't know if he's here.

63
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,750
I think he may have gone home.

64
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:43,207
And I don't blame him, he's put a lot of work in this project.

65
00:16:44,107 --> 00:17:02,022
But we're not going to follow just a minimal standard on erecting these raised crosswalks, but we're going to put something that's tastefully done, that aesthetically is pleasing, and something that adheres to state and federal statutes when it comes to transportation and public safety.

66
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:06,386
So that is a very positive outcome also, Mr. President.

67
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:14,391
I, as one member of the council, would like to see in future agreements.

68
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:25,459
We heard from Eversource that even though they're coming to the council for a grant of location, that they already have a memorandum of understanding with the city.

69
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,664
So they already sat down with the administration and negotiated everything they'd like to see take place with this project.

70
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:35,286
However, they left out one key factor.

71
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:39,399
that this project needs approval from the City Council.

72
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:49,188
And as we all know, the City Council has its own opinion, its own ideas, and we also communicate with residents and department heads and so forth.

73
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:59,077
And I would say for future projects, it would be helpful that the City Council, if any permits are required from us, we be a part of the process.

74
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:03,882
in particular when it comes to a memorandum of understanding.

75
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:14,394
The city of Boston, which I mentioned tonight, and I won't go into it, but I will bring it up at a future council meeting, has a great process for granting of locations.

76
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,536
It's not done by the city council.

77
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,920
It's done by a public improvement commission.

78
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:32,715
And that commission is comprised of a number of members that sit on the transportation department, property management, inspectional services, water and sewer commission, and the engineering department.

79
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,959
And that body gets together and holds public meetings.

80
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:45,986
And they discuss with whoever the utility is what some of their plans are and what they'd like to see for mitigation.

81
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:52,891
And the approval process is a lengthy process which also involves a checklist.

82
00:18:54,112 --> 00:19:07,126
And I don't know, Cassandra, the city engineer is here tonight, but I don't know if our process has a thorough checklist on the process to which takes place in the community.

83
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:08,627
We may or may have not.

84
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,528
I don't know.

85
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:28,088
I can tell you for future reference, Mr. President, it may be worthwhile to look at city ordinances and maybe at some point have the city council removed from the process and create a commissioner board that has all the parties together

86
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:34,831
and collaboration that can deal with the utility companies, and it's one-stop shop.

87
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:44,034
And as Ebersource mentioned, when they deal with Boston, when they get approval from the PIC, which is Public Improvement Commission,

88
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:51,057
that when they leave there, they're done more or less with the permitting and all the process which takes place.

89
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,578
And that's not the case here in the city of Method.

90
00:19:53,878 --> 00:20:01,721
They've met with the administration, they've met with the council, and now they're gonna have to go for street openings and other permits and so forth.

91
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:11,625
And I think it would only be advantageous for this community and also beneficial to the residents of this community to have one body that looks at it with

92
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:19,936
people that their expertise is in this particular field and I am going to offer that as a future resolution.

93
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:27,147
But tonight, Mr. President, I do support this and I look forward to the continued commitment that ever

94
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:50,951
Eversource has put out there to work with the city to provide a clerk of the works that will be the direct communicator with residents in Eversource or residents in Bond Construction so that residents aren't going to feel the frustration when they need to get a hold of someone at 830 at night and unable to get anyone at Eversource, but they will have a contact that they can reach out.

95
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,672
We heard from the city engineer that there will be

96
00:20:54,672 --> 00:21:02,261
a working group within the City of contact names and numbers that residents can speak with and that will alleviate a lot of concern.

97
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:09,369
Also City Solicitor Rumley mentioned tonight and I thought it was an important subject that

98
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:32,534
anyone along this particular route that needs access in and out of their property, someone that might be confined to their home or someone that may need dialysis or other health concerns that Eversource and the city work together to locate where these people are and to communicate directly with the people on the need for access when this construction is taking place.

99
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:35,415
So I want to thank all the parties involved

100
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:41,498
in particular, the city engineer and the city solicitor for their dedication on this project, Mr. President.

101
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:42,658
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

102
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:49,501
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

103
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,162
Councilor Del Rosso?

104
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:51,602
Yes.

105
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:52,603
Councilor Falco?

106
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:52,743
Yes.

107
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:54,024
Councilor Knight?

108
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:54,364
Yes.

109
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,485
Councilor Leopold Kerr?

110
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:56,585
Yes.

111
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:58,823
Vice President Martz.

112
00:21:59,163 --> 00:21:59,423
Yes.

113
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:00,845
Councilor Scarpelli.

114
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:01,165
Yes.

115
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:02,767
President Caviello.

116
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:06,510
Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, and one abstention.

117
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,572
Is that correct?

118
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,174
Motion passes.

119
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:10,915
Mr. President.

120
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,658
While we're on the suspension, yes, Mr. Vote.

121
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:15,018
Councilor Scott Pelley.

122
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:28,625
Can we pull up paper 17-590, it's the Method Association, LLC, Middle Glen Mall, special permit extension hours, 30 day review for December 5th, if we can?

123
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:29,265
Yes, we can.

124
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:34,468
Disregards the special permit for Wegmans,

125
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:45,650
I had contacted John Babuso and he has said that there is no complaints or problems over there that have been reported to him.

126
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:58,837
I also spoke to the president of the Condo Association for 3920 Mrs. Valley Parkway and they have said they had no concerns that have been reported to them.

127
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:04,349
Do you want to make a motion to?

128
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:07,551
Yeah, if I can make the motion that we now.

129
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:08,831
60 days.

130
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:09,692
60 days, next review.

131
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:14,815
On the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Falco.

132
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:15,835
All those in favor?

133
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:16,115
Aye.

134
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:17,596
Motion passes.

135
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,998
While we're on the suspension, Councilor Lococo.

136
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,399
Thank you, President Carvalho.

137
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:29,022
If we could allow a couple minutes, a resident would like to speak with regards to the.

138
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,203
We have a resident that would like to speak.

139
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:32,619
Good evening.

140
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:33,699
Name and address of the record, please.

141
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,781
Mariana Ducey, 2 North Street, Medford.

142
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:48,491
I was before the council last week, and you people passed a resolution regarding the extension of the comment deadline for the Green Line project.

143
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:53,695
And the resolution passed, but yet there's been no reverse 911 call.

144
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:54,735
That was the resolution.

145
00:23:55,756 --> 00:23:59,499
So I'm here to question why, what happened,

146
00:24:03,272 --> 00:24:05,032
If I may, Council President.

147
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:06,813
Thank you.

148
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:08,853
Thank you for coming again.

149
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:13,714
We did pass a resolution requesting that reverse 911 call go out.

150
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:21,376
And I think that definitely should have been done before today, but we still have one week, one week left.

151
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:25,537
Comments are open and meet are due no later than 5 p.m.

152
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:27,057
on Tuesday, December 12th.

153
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:29,798
So there's one more week to comment on the

154
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:31,919
further extension of the Green Line.

155
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:46,047
And I asked, I sent an email out to the mayor today to ask if the mayor's office today to see if we could get a reverse 9-1-1 call to notify the residents, the entire city, especially those that live in the hillside in South Medford.

156
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:49,509
And I'm publicly asking that a reverse 9-1-1 call go out.

157
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:50,569
I know they

158
00:24:52,090 --> 00:25:00,092
notification hasn't been great on this project and I think that's essential that we let the public know whether they're for or against or have concerns.

159
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:11,215
They have a right to be heard and a right to know what's going on and when deadlines are and when they're extended and when meetings are and this is just one component so I hope that we can get that reverse 911 call out tomorrow.

160
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:27,809
If there's an objection from the city hall here, I'd like to know what it is, why they didn't want to send this out because, you know, I mean, the same reason that people weren't notified about the meeting to begin with still stands because the same population didn't know

161
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,031
that the deadline was extended.

162
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,073
So it's the same principle.

163
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:38,277
And they agreed to do the reverse 9-1-1 to tell people that the meeting was scheduled for Thanksgiving week.

164
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:41,879
So I really can't see why they don't want to continue this way.

165
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,623
Going forward, I hope MassDOT does a better job of communicating with people.

166
00:25:46,663 --> 00:25:56,389
I think Counselor General LaRusso last week passed an amendment to the resolution to say that he would like the MassDOT to notify people by mail.

167
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,313
So we'll see what happens in the next round.

168
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:03,515
Councilor Dela Russo.

169
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:16,766
Just briefly on that note as you remember early on in the process 13 years ago that was one of the major concerns that I think people have

170
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:35,094
who administer projects like this sometimes become, because they live in a world of email communication, sometimes lose track of the fact that not everybody lives on that planet, and that we're dealing with a bigger solar system, and so various modes of communication have to be employed.

171
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:40,498
And that's why we sent that letter out to the department.

172
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:42,044
Right, I appreciate that.

173
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:51,828
Not only that, but we, 13 years have passed, new people have moved into the neighborhood that didn't even know about this project, that couldn't even get on any kind of a list because they didn't know about it.

174
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:52,368
Exactly.

175
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:58,930
So, I appreciate your requesting the reverse 9-1-1 again and we'll hope for the best, I guess.

176
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:00,411
Thank you very much.

177
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:02,232
Thank you for your hard work.

178
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:04,633
While warrant suspension?

179
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:14,144
While we're on the suspension, some citizens on Winchester Street would like to address the council regarding a matter that we all received notice on, Mr. President.

180
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:19,486
There are some citizens here that would like to speak.

181
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,400
Good evening.

182
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:22,761
Name and address of the record, please.

183
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:24,583
My name is Fran Abola.

184
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,944
I live at 9 Alfred Street.

185
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:31,888
First of all, I'd like to thank everybody here for giving me an opportunity to listen and hear what's going on.

186
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:34,771
I've been living at this address my whole life.

187
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:38,754
I'm right next to Nardone Electric.

188
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:40,055
I still own the property.

189
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:49,526
When he came here in 1995, I never had a problem, anything that I had a problem with, I could call Steve.

190
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:50,447
I still have his number.

191
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:52,449
I'd say, hey, Steve, this is what's going on.

192
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:54,831
And everything always seemed to be resolved.

193
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:59,835
His business expanded, and he left the premises.

194
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:00,755
He moved to Woburn.

195
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:03,257
And that's when all the trouble started.

196
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,557
A company by the name of J.F.

197
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:10,359
White, which is probably one of the top ten contractors, I would say, in Boston.

198
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:19,781
They come in in this area and they totally disrupted the neighborhood with noise, banging,

199
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:26,060
loud, I've been woken up, I have all the records here.

200
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,461
I mean, I just started filming.

201
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:30,283
This is what happened since 2015, 16, when I moved in.

202
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:36,187
I didn't film any of this, because I was trying to resolve this all with Steve, who was pretty cooperative, trying to help me.

203
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,869
But it just seems we weren't getting anywhere.

204
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:43,752
But I have started taking documentation with my phone, which is, my house is literally

205
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:49,396
My bedroom was from here to where that gentleman is, Mr. Lepore, of where all the pipes are being stored.

206
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,017
They get slammed down.

207
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:55,760
They have a fork truck that's made to pick up four tons, okay?

208
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,062
They slam the pipes down, 6.30 in the morning.

209
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:01,044
I've been woken up about 20 times.

210
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,184
I have all the dates here.

211
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:05,126
Every video can back up everything I'm talking about here.

212
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:12,331
I'm talking about four o'clock in the morning, one o'clock in the morning, and it just totally disrupts the neighborhood.

213
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:14,712
I've tried to have them stopped.

214
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:24,700
I went down to the building inspector, found out, oh, I spoke to a gentleman by the name of John Bufuso, and he said, oh, you know, there's nothing we can do.

215
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,423
You know, I go, well, not doing electric's not operating the property anymore.

216
00:29:28,743 --> 00:29:30,924
He goes, well, that carries on to the new tenant.

217
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:43,728
Well, you know, looking at everything, and then I asked to go back to get a proposal in 1995 when the ordinance was changed exclusively for Nargon Electric, that they were allowed to operate there.

218
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:53,131
This building was used for storage, car storage for Knox Brothers Dodge, and before that, back in the 1900s, it was used to store army jeeps that used to come off the trains.

219
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,352
So this building was always storage.

220
00:29:55,412 --> 00:29:56,152
It's not like, you know,

221
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:58,835
You moved in the neighborhood, you knew what you were living next to.

222
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:00,437
It was always quiet, you know?

223
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:01,979
It was just cars being parked.

224
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:03,681
It wasn't anything business-disruptive.

225
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:08,386
Now it's gotten to a point where I work, you know, a demanding job.

226
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:09,487
I work a lot of hours.

227
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:11,550
I'm not even home that much, you know?

228
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,092
I work double shifts sometimes.

229
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:31,064
I get woken up at 1.30, 2.30, 4 o'clock in the morning, 6.30 in the morning, 5.30 in the morning, pipes banging, and the pipes literally have destroyed my kitchen floor, blew the tiles right up, because they bring this pipe down that's 30 feet long, about 26 inches wide, and slam it down, and boom, bang.

230
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:35,327
And it sounds like, you know, and the grinding, I have an audio clip for you.

231
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:36,948
think you want to hear it.

232
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:41,432
It'd be a great soundtrack for Guantanamo Bay because it's torturous to listen to.

233
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:43,854
And you've got to hear this at 6.30 in the morning.

234
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:51,801
And then another thing, too, I just want to, is the other day they have a flatbed truck

235
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:57,163
I mean, they're supposed to be, you know, whatever's going on, you should at least have the safety involved in whatever you do.

236
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:57,843
Okay?

237
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:10,247
Winchester Street, they come down with a flatbed truck, they block the whole street, and then they come out with a fork truck and block the whole street and block the two neighbors behind there on Winchester Street.

238
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,007
They can't even get out of their own driveway.

239
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:14,868
Not even calling a cop to come down on a detail.

240
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:19,029
And all we want is we want peace, and we just want it to stop.

241
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:21,970
We haven't got one, uh,

242
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:24,044
No one knows when they're getting out of there.

243
00:31:24,064 --> 00:31:26,646
We don't know when the lease is, no one knows anything.

244
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:30,910
We try to speak to this, you know, the building commission says we're in violation, they're in violation.

245
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,393
Well, they're in violation from the day they moved in.

246
00:31:34,713 --> 00:31:36,635
They're not Nardone Electric, they're J.F.

247
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:36,975
White.

248
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,237
Well, they're trying to find another place.

249
00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:41,278
Find another place, what about the neighbors?

250
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,741
It seems like they're more concerned on getting a place for J.F.

251
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:45,042
White.

252
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,403
And it's totally disrupted the neighborhood.

253
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:53,104
Dumpsters full of stuff, seven in the morning, throwing stuff.

254
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:57,245
And all the trash isn't even from the job that they're working at at that building.

255
00:31:57,525 --> 00:32:02,507
This trash comes in on a flatbed truck from Kendall's, because I work at MIT every day.

256
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,907
This trash comes from the work they're doing on the bridge from Kendall.

257
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:07,548
Fills up the truck with trash.

258
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,549
They used to come in at one o'clock in the morning, waking me up, slamming the door, that stopped.

259
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,010
Now they come in at seven o'clock in the morning with the truck full of trash.

260
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,854
First thing they do, boom, start emptying out, boom, start throwing everything in the dumpster.

261
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,496
The grinding, the doors are wide open.

262
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:27,400
This guy's outside grinding next to stuff, the acetylene tanks, flammable products.

263
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,701
They just do whatever they want.

264
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:29,782
There's no control.

265
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:34,365
I'm kind of upset about it, because I've been putting up this for three years.

266
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,867
And I just want your guys' help.

267
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:39,029
If you can help, just let me know, when does this end?

268
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,831
Who's going to enforce this?

269
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:42,232
Who's doing this?

270
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,774
These people are doing whatever they want.

271
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:45,856
When are they gonna get out?

272
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:49,921
I can't even find out when the lease is or when they're supposed to get out.

273
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:58,911
I just came here tonight just to address the attention to everybody here and just ask for some help and put us in the right direction on where we go with this.

274
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:01,554
for the whole neighborhood.

275
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,295
It's really gotten totally out of control.

276
00:33:04,795 --> 00:33:09,538
And if you go by there and see the pipe, how big it is, it's insane.

277
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:17,623
I get all this video and stuff, I don't want to play it for you, but if you want to hear one grind, I'll let you hear it.

278
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,825
This is at 6.30 in the morning.

279
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:26,168
I have to decline that call, sorry about that.

280
00:33:31,382 --> 00:33:32,745
This is next door to my house.

281
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:37,533
All dead.

282
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:39,878
This is next door to my house.

283
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,930
What they do is they grind it.

284
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,371
What they're doing is they're prepping the pipes for the big dig over there, whatever they're doing, I'm sorry, the Kendall Bridge.

285
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:56,233
And what they're doing is they're prepping all the big pipes, putting all the elbows on, the offset, the offsets, the heat exchangers, whatever they're putting on.

286
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,874
And then they grind it, they weld it, they're welding outside.

287
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:02,195
I get video of sparks flying all over the place.

288
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:08,296
And then they come in, it's 6.30 in the morning with a big flatbed truck, and this thing backs up.

289
00:34:08,316 --> 00:34:12,657
That's all it does is beep, beep, beep, and then they load the flatbed on and they take it out.

290
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:16,080
You know, there's guys urinating outside next to the dumpster.

291
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,162
I mean, I didn't have a camera with me every time.

292
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:19,123
But you know what?

293
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,806
I wish I had one with me, but I'm not home all the time.

294
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:24,868
So I don't know even what goes on during the day.

295
00:34:24,948 --> 00:34:28,292
She works from her house and she deals with the day stuff.

296
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,093
But I'm not even home that much.

297
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:34,197
in the morning, and I'm out early, and then I come home late at night.

298
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:35,278
I live across the street.

299
00:34:35,298 --> 00:34:36,158
My name is Mark McPartland.

300
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:39,601
I live at 8 Alfred Street, and I work a couple days a week from home.

301
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:46,066
I work for Philips Health Care, an international company, so I take a lot of early morning international phone calls and conference calls throughout the day.

302
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:52,151
And basically, from spring to fall, I can't have my windows open during the day because I can't be heard on my conference calls.

303
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:54,673
Thank you.

304
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,314
Counselor Dayton.

305
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,514
Mr. President, I think that this is a matter that's appropriate for further review from our building commissioner.

306
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:12,241
It's my understanding that in our packet here there is a letter from Mr. Mulkey to the property owner indicating that the current use is an improper use.

307
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,482
It's not in compliance with the zoning board decision.

308
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:20,246
And it's also my understanding that there was a process to relocate this tenant, Mr. President.

309
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:23,929
But if we look further in the packet, we'll also see that that process has fallen through.

310
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:29,871
So I think it would be incumbent upon us to figure out where we are in the process from our building commissioner to see what's going on.

311
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,151
Ultimately, we've had situations like this in the past.

312
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:41,854
If you recall several years back when they were doing the Winthrop Street drainage project, they were using Apostolon Mystic Ave as a layover yard, which abutted Sylvia Road, which is a residential street.

313
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,535
And many of the same complaints and same concerns came up.

314
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:49,418
you know, working with the building commissioner and the administration, we were able to get them out of there in short order.

315
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:54,961
And I think that this is a project, a similar situation, and I think that you have everybody on the same page.

316
00:35:55,001 --> 00:36:00,425
I don't think that anybody in the administration wants these people here disrupting the quality of life, and I'm certainly sure that nobody behind this rail does.

317
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,847
So with that being said, I think that the proper steps, Mr. President, would be to

318
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:20,085
Refer this to the building commissioner for response to see what's going on Ultimately, I think this is something that may have to go through the city solicitor's office at some point in time But as of right now, it's up to the code enforcement officer to issue the appropriate fines for non-compliance with the zoning act and Then go from there Thank You

319
00:36:21,398 --> 00:36:22,179
Councilor Del Rosso.

320
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:23,540
Thank you, Mr. President.

321
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:34,349
I've spoken with Mr. Vola on a couple occasions about this and spoken to the building commissioner, Mr. Moki.

322
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,672
Clearly, upon all the research you've done, Fran,

323
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:51,562
that the activity that's going on is beyond the scope allowed in the initial variance given to the property owner some 20 plus years ago.

324
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,264
The property owner is not in there.

325
00:36:54,664 --> 00:37:04,230
He leased the property out to a company that's clearly operating way beyond the scope of the restrictions placed on the use of that property.

326
00:37:07,212 --> 00:37:08,813
They are in the process from what the

327
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:15,980
Building Commissioner has told me they are in the process of finding a new location.

328
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,403
However, he doesn't have an answer on when that's going to be.

329
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:30,291
And that's what has him concerned the most, because it's too open-ended, and you folks need redress right away.

330
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:32,052
I just want peace.

331
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:32,753
That's all.

332
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:33,453
I can't.

333
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,255
And the whole thing is, is we just

334
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:38,778
We just want an answer.

335
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,418
That's the whole thing.

336
00:37:39,478 --> 00:37:41,179
It's like everything's left up in the air.

337
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:41,820
I don't know.

338
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,440
I don't know.

339
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,841
Here's what it is at this point.

340
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:49,704
First of all, I have to share my surprise with J.F.

341
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:49,924
White.

342
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:55,866
You rightly mentioned, they're one of the top construction firms in Boston.

343
00:37:56,226 --> 00:38:07,711
They do enormous projects, and you would think, given their history and their success, that they ought to know how to treat people, and they're not treating you well.

344
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:10,973
And that's sad.

345
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:23,604
Mr. Mulkey has examined this and cited the property owner for a zoning violation.

346
00:38:24,204 --> 00:38:26,365
So a citation has been issued, all right?

347
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:34,467
He goes through then a process of responding or appealing, and then they go from there.

348
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:37,787
Hopefully this will be resolved before then.

349
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:40,588
He personally met with the,

350
00:38:41,428 --> 00:38:46,111
the manager or whoever's in charge at that location for the construction company.

351
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:52,356
He explained to them and walked through the whole thing with them where they're in violation.

352
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:55,678
So they themselves have been put on notice.

353
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:06,586
He's assured us that the inspectional service director, Mr. Bavuso, is monitoring them on off hours and making spot checks

354
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:10,127
to survey the property, he wanted you to be aware of that.

355
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:14,229
And then this is going to have to follow its course.

356
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:25,674
I have to say that from what I've been told, the property owner is aware of what's going on clearly now and wants to move to get them out of there.

357
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:32,357
Because he doesn't want them, that reflects poorly, because as you recall, he was a good neighbor.

358
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:39,639
He's a great guy and I think what actually happened is I think he didn't realize that when they came in and took the space that this was all going to be going on.

359
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:41,719
I think he was probably misled himself.

360
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:42,099
Right.

361
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:45,020
He probably thought it was going to be a dump spot for trucks and that was it.

362
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,040
Like it's kind of been.

363
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,441
And he was kind of turned key when he operated out there.

364
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,602
The trucks left for the day on their projects.

365
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:52,562
Never had a problem with him.

366
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:52,982
No.

367
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:56,766
So that's where I've been updated on this.

368
00:39:57,607 --> 00:40:10,464
As far as a council resolution, that's up to the councilors if we want to refer this for action and further communication from the building inspector, but that's where he has us today.

369
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:11,285
Okay.

370
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:11,805
All right.

371
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:15,169
Well, I'm glad everybody gave me a chance to speak.

372
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,952
But this is important, too.

373
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:29,366
This work that you put together is important, because I think it helped us as counselors clarify the scope to which they're behind, and it also is clear that it's

374
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:34,034
Um, uh, I know your friend.

375
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:36,014
I mean, you're not a complainer.

376
00:40:36,715 --> 00:40:38,536
Um, I just want to sleep peacefully.

377
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:40,716
I don't sleep much as it is, you know, exactly.

378
00:40:40,997 --> 00:40:42,097
You work morning, noon and night.

379
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:44,238
Well, thank you all.

380
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,098
Thank you very much.

381
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:47,459
Vice president mocks.

382
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,660
Thank you.

383
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,700
Thank you, Mr. President.

384
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:50,341
And, um,

385
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:55,754
I think we're beyond the point of just talking, giving lip service.

386
00:40:56,695 --> 00:41:03,179
And no matter how many violations are handed out, that's not going to help Fran's problem.

387
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,260
That's not going to help the neighbor's problems.

388
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:16,287
At this particular point, it was clear when I read that document that although they're saying they have plans to relocate, but when you don't give a time frame

389
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,587
To me, that's just lip service.

390
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,848
So I don't have too much confidence.

391
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:24,329
I don't know how long their lease is, as you mentioned.

392
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,430
They could have a 10-year lease, five-year lease, who knows.

393
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:37,632
But I think at this point, and I've been on the council for a number of years, I think this calls for a cease and desist order, which could be handed out by the building commissioner.

394
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:42,653
And I think we're at that point, I shouldn't say I think, I know we're at that point.

395
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:45,334
And I think the,

396
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:49,856
building commissioner has to line up all his ducks before he does that.

397
00:41:50,336 --> 00:42:05,746
But I think we're at that point right now that I would ask the council take a vote to have the building commissioner look into a ceased immediate cease and desist order based on the fact that they're working prior to 7 a.m.

398
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:09,348
In the morning, which is a violation of zoning ordinances.

399
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,090
They're also doing work

400
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:20,377
in that particular location that is not of proper use, which I think the building commissioner already cited them based on that.

401
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:31,908
And to me, that's enough information to have in hand to go and provide a cease and desist order, which would have them close operations immediately until it goes to court.

402
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:38,094
And I'm sure any business, especially if they're doing work, like you're mentioning, are not going to want to close their operation

403
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:42,677
So it really brings them back to the table once this action's taken.

404
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:55,987
So I would ask that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we direct the building commissioner to issue a cease and desist order immediately on this particular property.

405
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:59,910
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

406
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,652
Is it a point of information?

407
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:08,084
I don't care.

408
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:10,004
Thank you, President Carvalho.

409
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:11,725
I agree with Councilor Marks.

410
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:21,308
I think from those, just listening to that one clip, that would drive me absolutely crazy, never mind while I'm sleeping, during the day while I'm trying to work.

411
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:25,930
And I think we need to get a little tougher as a city on this establishment.

412
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,851
cease and desist seems to me like it's probably the way to go.

413
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:52,236
I'd also ask that we request an opinion from the city solicitor, depending on how long it takes to actually cease and desist the operation, with regards to if the permit was given to Nardone Electric and only to them, how is JF White operating at the site?

414
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,257
I think that was an important piece of information that maybe

415
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:56,792
the building commissioner, um,

416
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:04,303
needs an opinion from the solicitor to shut down operations.

417
00:44:04,863 --> 00:44:09,164
Also, the hours of operation, it seems like it's going all through the night, all through the morning.

418
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:12,685
There is a start time and an end time that should be followed.

419
00:44:12,745 --> 00:44:15,166
So I think that's an important piece of information as well.

420
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,307
I can't imagine every night listening to that noise.

421
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:27,708
So whatever the city needs to do, I think they need to do it as if it was their home that was on 8 or 9 Alfred Street.

422
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,469
So I would second that.

423
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:31,049
resolve.

424
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:36,071
Mr. President, just to clarify the motion that I made.

425
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:42,652
The motion that I was making was to refer the paper to the Building Commissioner Enforcement of the Zoning Act, which would be all-encompassing.

426
00:44:42,672 --> 00:44:47,734
It would take into consideration any and all steps that he needs to take to make sure that there's a complying use at this location.

427
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:56,071
We have two motions on the floor.

428
00:44:56,111 --> 00:45:01,635
We have one from Councilor Marks, Vice-President Marks, and we have one from Councilor Knight.

429
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:03,537
As amended.

430
00:45:03,557 --> 00:45:04,417
As amended.

431
00:45:04,437 --> 00:45:07,400
So, which one are we gonna go with?

432
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,662
I think they're one and the same.

433
00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:11,603
I just wanted to clarify what I was saying.

434
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:17,908
We should refer to the purpose of enforcing the Seizing Act.

435
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:25,253
Councilor Marks is asking for a cease and desist.

436
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:28,856
Which is probably a step in the process of enforcing the Zoning Act.

437
00:45:29,536 --> 00:45:34,560
Right, but I think we're at the point right now where that's the highest level of council to accomplish a request.

438
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:34,700
Okay.

439
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,801
Other than the zoning, that's fine.

440
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:44,286
All right, we'll go with Councilor Marks' motion that the Building Commissioner order a cease and desist, seconded by?

441
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:45,767
Councilor Dela Russo.

442
00:45:46,147 --> 00:45:47,668
Councilor Dela Russo, all those in favor?

443
00:45:47,688 --> 00:45:48,029
Aye.

444
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:49,410
Motion passes.

445
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:52,722
Motion to revert back to.

446
00:45:52,942 --> 00:45:53,723
Thank you very much.

447
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:54,564
Thank you, Mr. Vola.

448
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:55,585
Have a good night.

449
00:45:56,846 --> 00:46:02,532
Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scott Pelley.

450
00:46:02,572 --> 00:46:03,233
All those in favor.

451
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:20,543
17785 offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the double poles on Alexander Avenue, pole number 4444 and 4443, and on Barnaround, pole number 2994, be removed in the interest of public safety.

452
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:21,524
Vice President Mox.

453
00:46:22,124 --> 00:46:23,105
Thank you, Mr. President.

454
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:28,128
I would just ask that this be sent to National Grid for immediate removal of the double poles.

455
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:30,329
And also, if we can get a report

456
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:38,575
I believe it was several months back I asked for an update on the double pole report, and I don't think we have yet to receive an update.

457
00:46:39,435 --> 00:46:42,938
I'm seeing more and more double poles throughout the community, which is good.

458
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:50,303
It means they're replacing older poles, but we also want to stay on top of the utilities to make sure they're removing the double pole, Mr. President.

459
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:52,245
Thank you.

460
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:54,987
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by

461
00:46:56,792 --> 00:47:01,433
by Councilor Scott Pelly, all those in favor?

462
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:02,373
Motion passes.

463
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:16,437
17-786, petition by Roberta Cameron, Ralph Nordstrom, Reverend Mast, to address the council for an update of the completion of the community preservation plan in the opening of the application process for the first round of funding.

464
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:23,233
Yes, Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in Medford.

465
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,537
Roberta Cameron is on her way here.

466
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:26,578
She should be here shortly.

467
00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:29,362
She's the chair of the Community Preservation Committee.

468
00:47:29,923 --> 00:47:32,267
She asked me to speak on her behalf until she gets here.

469
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,161
and to answer any questions that the Council may have.

470
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:39,885
I've been serving on the committees, the CPC, since it was formed in May of this year.

471
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:48,651
I believe you have a four-page handout that summarizes the plan in front of you that was distributed with the meeting minutes today.

472
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:56,753
And I just want to summarize a couple quick points and then take any questions you may have about the CPA and CPC.

473
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:05,519
So over the last six months, the Community Preservation Committee has undertaken to fulfill its obligation to undertake a study of the community needs across Medford.

474
00:48:06,578 --> 00:48:12,643
We coordinated with many of the boards in this building and a lot of stakeholders and committees across the entire city.

475
00:48:13,164 --> 00:48:24,033
That included things like the Friends of the Memphis Public Library, the Royal House, Friends of the Fells, really anyone who could possibly be a recipient or a stakeholder in the CPA process.

476
00:48:25,805 --> 00:48:29,086
So we've just published our final community preservation plan.

477
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:32,548
It's online, and it's soon to be available in print.

478
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:36,729
And we have also opened up the application process for the first round of funding.

479
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:40,930
There will be two rounds in 2018.

480
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:44,812
The first application process is just for determining if the project is viable.

481
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:47,533
That is due on December 15th, which is 10 days from today.

482
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:54,079
They'll be awarded, the funds will be awarded in March of next year and then the fall of next year as well.

483
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:56,421
Two rounds for fiscal year 17 and 18.

484
00:48:57,122 --> 00:49:01,466
And every other, every year following will just be in one round in the fall of each year.

485
00:49:03,448 --> 00:49:11,757
So we, again, May will be the award of the first round, October the award of the second round, and October going forward for each year.

486
00:49:13,024 --> 00:49:33,020
It's a two-stage process to determine eligibility first, which is the 12-15 date, and then a more detailed application that will obviously get into more details about how much money it costs, the project, who's going to benefit, if there's any matching funds, and how it will serve the city of Medford in terms of the most number of people.

487
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:39,507
We'll also consider some off-cycle applications on an as-needed basis.

488
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:44,489
There has to be extraordinary circumstances to do that.

489
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:53,493
We're not going to just open up the process unless there's a real need, and that could be the City of Medford, it could be somebody else, but we're not going to do that as part of our regular basis.

490
00:49:53,513 --> 00:49:56,754
We're going to have everyone compete and then evaluate all the projects.

491
00:49:56,814 --> 00:49:58,215
As the City Council knows, you are

492
00:49:59,035 --> 00:50:04,597
the final step in the process in terms of approving these projects, but the projects start really from the ground up.

493
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:09,119
They're more of a grassroots thing from non-profits and from citizens.

494
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:15,141
It could be community groups, neighborhood groups, park advocates, a whole bunch of different options, obviously.

495
00:50:16,393 --> 00:50:26,319
So we also intend to set aside $25,000 in funding for small projects, for CPA funds, up to $5,000 for projects with a total cost of up to 10.

496
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:34,184
A very simplified application process to, again, to kind of make sure we capture both big and the small and the medium-sized projects as well.

497
00:50:36,386 --> 00:50:45,852
It's important to note, as I mentioned before, the city council has the final approval for our CPA funding in order to spend community preservation committee grants.

498
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:52,080
All proposals will be vetted open to the public.

499
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,261
There'll be public hearings.

500
00:50:53,301 --> 00:51:00,406
People will have a chance to advocate for their project and evaluate and give opinions on all the projects that are being submitted.

501
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:14,618
At present, the general consensus of the Community Preservation Committee is that we basically equally distribute the funds right now until we understand what's going to be submitted between open space and recreation, affordable housing, and historic preservation.

502
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:18,599
Obviously, we don't know what's going to be submitted yet, because nothing has been submitted yet.

503
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,621
When we get the projects, we'll obviously evaluate them then.

504
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:34,766
But our thought was, after the public forms we had, the public input we had, and talking to all the stakeholders, that we wanted to kind of give ourselves flexibility, but keep generally distributed evenly amongst those three categories.

505
00:51:35,386 --> 00:51:40,468
As you all know, by statute, we'd have to have 10% minimum for each of those categories.

506
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:51,636
But that leaves 70% that is beyond the administrative needs that is discretionary in terms of which bucket of grants that they go into.

507
00:51:54,918 --> 00:52:11,147
As shown in the handout, if you look at the first page, the priorities and goals are laid out pretty clearly, and I'm obviously here to answer any questions, specific questions you may have about the process, or what the needs are, or how we're gonna evaluate these projects.

508
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:14,449
So I open up to the council to ask any questions you may have.

509
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:16,376
Council Member Kern.

510
00:52:16,757 --> 00:52:18,097
Thank you, President Carvillo.

511
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:20,799
Thank you, Doug Kerr, for coming to explain.

512
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,245
My first question just would be with regards to, I understand May and October will be, funds will be awarded, and then October, every year after that, going forward.

513
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:36,108
And I think going forward, it'll be more of a timeline known to the public.

514
00:52:36,228 --> 00:52:42,792
So my question is with regards to this December 15th eligibility determination form due date.

515
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:46,075
How have we advertised that so far?

516
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:49,558
And when did the advertisements start?

517
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:55,984
Just so we know, I just want to make sure that people are well aware of it and have known for a while.

518
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:58,006
It seems just like a very quick date.

519
00:52:58,626 --> 00:53:04,431
We do have a coordinator, as everyone knows, Danielle Evans, who was hired by the CPC.

520
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:09,014
who works three days a week in this building.

521
00:53:10,075 --> 00:53:18,040
And as part of her job is to basically distribute that information as wide as possible into the city.

522
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,963
I know she has a big email list that's been developed over the last

523
00:53:22,923 --> 00:53:25,125
six or seven months with all the people that we've met.

524
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:28,747
Obviously it's on our website as well.

525
00:53:29,187 --> 00:53:31,008
I believe there's a link on the city website as well.

526
00:53:32,029 --> 00:53:41,054
I don't know if there are any other advertisements in the paper, but picking up on what was just talked about with the Green Line extension, obviously

527
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:43,396
The more people that know about this, the better.

528
00:53:43,556 --> 00:53:48,940
And that we can't do enough in terms of trying to make sure, whether it's reverse 9-1-1, putting in a transcript.

529
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:55,244
The point is that we will do our best to let as many people know as possible through as many forums as possible.

530
00:53:55,945 --> 00:54:00,188
We've already had two public forums attended by about 100 people over the last few months.

531
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:04,351
And our meetings are obviously open to the public, as every open meeting is.

532
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:07,693
But frankly, it is quick.

533
00:54:08,053 --> 00:54:09,474
It is happening relatively fast.

534
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:13,337
It is the holiday season, so I can understand why people might miss it.

535
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:18,821
The point also I think is worth noting is that if people don't get it in by December 15th, there's still

536
00:54:20,115 --> 00:54:25,037
There's still opportunity to get it in, and there's still a second round in next year, so they don't have to rush.

537
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:29,758
There's going to be at least $1.2 million, I believe, in each of those two rounds available.

538
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,119
That's a significant amount of dollars.

539
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:36,081
If your project is $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000, that's going to go a long way.

540
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:39,762
And we obviously want to have the maximum impact on the city of Medford in terms of

541
00:54:40,442 --> 00:54:46,345
improving the quality of our city, whether it's restoring a park, whether it's restoring a historic building, creating affordable housing.

542
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:47,726
There's so many different avenues.

543
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:54,869
If you had a chance to read the document that was put together by the CPC over the last few months, the needs in Medford are great.

544
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,330
They are really profound.

545
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,812
It's a real challenge with affordable housing in this city.

546
00:55:00,352 --> 00:55:06,556
There's a lot of historic needs in this city, and there's certainly a lot of demand for open space and recreation across this city.

547
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:11,420
That is clearly, these funds are meant to fill those gaps and take the city, move the city forward.

548
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:17,424
So I can try to get as much information to you, Councilor, as I can beyond what I just described in terms of the advertising.

549
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:24,909
But I would just obviously ask people to go to our website, read the plan, and the application will take somebody 10 minutes to fill out.

550
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,521
really to get it approved.

551
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:30,463
Point of information, Joan Sierra, 40 Cedar Road North.

552
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:37,849
I believe the coordinator sent a request into the Medford transcript to have something in the paper, but I think she missed last week's deadline, so it's likely going to be in this week.

553
00:55:38,555 --> 00:55:48,581
Not a lot of time, but this is a very quick round because we had to get our process in place, and then we finally got the application done, and we're trying to get the money out as quickly as we can.

554
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:50,022
So the first round is going to be really quick.

555
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:52,903
The second round is going to be on a regular time schedule and then future rounds.

556
00:55:53,464 --> 00:55:58,727
So when did the coordinator send out a notice to her whole email list?

557
00:55:59,212 --> 00:56:09,718
I believe it was directly after we had, sorry, the initial meeting where we announced the plan and had some input from the public, which was, I believe, the last Monday.

558
00:56:09,778 --> 00:56:10,258
Last Monday.

559
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:10,919
Last Monday night.

560
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:13,100
Yeah.

561
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:13,820
So the end of November.

562
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,321
End of November, correct.

563
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,642
And about how many emails does that go out to, do you know?

564
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:20,804
I want to say over 200 people.

565
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:31,371
And then if they miss the December 15th deadline, that's for a determination form.

566
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:37,476
So do they still have till March 2nd to do a full application for the first round?

567
00:56:38,517 --> 00:56:40,359
That, I'm not sure about that.

568
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:41,300
It might be the second round.

569
00:56:43,772 --> 00:56:47,454
I think for the smaller projects, it's going to be very simple.

570
00:56:47,535 --> 00:56:52,658
So I don't think it'll be difficult to get those in by the March actual award.

571
00:56:52,698 --> 00:56:58,822
We just want to make sure that nobody spends time working on a project that will not be funded by statute.

572
00:56:58,862 --> 00:57:05,867
We want to make sure it's viable as a project, so they don't fundraise, match grants, write all these details, and then it's not viable.

573
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:07,548
We don't want to waste anyone's time, obviously.

574
00:57:08,824 --> 00:57:10,785
So it's important to get that step out of the way.

575
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:14,707
And our coordinator, I think, will be, remember, she's here to answer all these questions.

576
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:18,809
People can call her here at Medford or stop by her office three days a week.

577
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,971
I think it's Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.

578
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:26,413
To talk about the process, to answer questions.

579
00:57:26,433 --> 00:57:28,934
She's been a resource for the committee as well, because we're new at this.

580
00:57:28,974 --> 00:57:34,056
She has experience in the community preservation arena from previous jobs.

581
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:41,920
Is there a particular type of communication?

582
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,004
She'll be able to help people with the actual applications too?

583
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:45,485
Absolutely.

584
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:45,685
Yes.

585
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:50,651
And she's invited people to call her before they fill out the eligibility form to help them walk through the process.

586
00:57:51,391 --> 00:58:00,022
Is there a particular form of communication that the council thinks would be helpful for us to use when these deadlines come up besides website, Medford transcript, email?

587
00:58:01,765 --> 00:58:02,466
The loop maybe?

588
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:03,188
I'm sorry?

589
00:58:03,368 --> 00:58:05,092
The loop on cable access.

590
00:58:05,393 --> 00:58:11,125
Cable access, Facebook, any type of... I'm sure one on the Facebook page.

591
00:58:11,185 --> 00:58:11,305
Okay.

592
00:58:11,365 --> 00:58:11,907
I missed that one.

593
00:58:12,473 --> 00:58:16,054
Yeah, no, my concern, and I appreciate all the hard work you've done.

594
00:58:16,174 --> 00:58:25,676
I know the committee's worked very hard, and I attended one of the forums, which was very, you know, it was a two-hour forum, definitely learned a lot.

595
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:33,577
My concern, just with this first round, is that today is the 5th, and December 15th is when the applications are due.

596
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,998
So that is, that's just my concern for this initial round.

597
00:58:38,538 --> 00:58:43,159
There'll be many, yes, there will be many more rounds, but we're talking about a lot, you know, $1.2 million.

598
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:50,280
So I just, I feel like it's a lot of money to rush organizations when you could maybe extend it a few weeks or.

599
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:58,402
And there's no guarantee that we would award even half that if the projects aren't there or not enough people.

600
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:02,322
It will obviously just, that money just goes back into the fund for the next round.

601
00:59:02,362 --> 00:59:03,482
It becomes a much bigger round.

602
00:59:04,143 --> 00:59:06,603
We don't know that until we see what comes before us, obviously.

603
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:24,589
So I know it is quick, but we are hoping that people will at least put in, literally spend 10 minutes, put together a project name, a couple sentences description, see if it's viable, and then spend the next few months really developing the project.

604
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,591
really figuring it out.

605
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:30,053
Do you need to hire someone?

606
00:59:30,313 --> 00:59:31,053
Is it available?

607
00:59:31,494 --> 00:59:32,954
Is the property available?

608
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:36,557
Is the property got a master plan already in place?

609
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:37,717
Is it something that's shovel ready?

610
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:38,818
There's so many different factors here.

611
00:59:39,696 --> 00:59:40,256
That's just it.

612
00:59:40,296 --> 00:59:41,517
We just don't know what we're going to get.

613
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:43,738
We could get a ton of applications.

614
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:44,879
We could get no applications.

615
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:45,920
I doubt that's going to happen.

616
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,302
But if we need to change the timeline based on what we get, we'll have to do that.

617
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:53,204
It's basically what our first option out there is.

618
00:59:53,224 --> 00:59:55,045
And if we need to change that, we will.

619
00:59:55,951 --> 00:59:57,192
And they're being funded.

620
00:59:57,272 --> 01:00:00,173
It's not in the key dates, but the first round, you said, was in March.

621
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:01,714
You'll be awarding.

622
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:02,315
Right.

623
01:00:02,355 --> 01:00:09,759
So in consultation with you folks, since you're going to be approving the plan, we're trying to, on the first round, it's going to probably coincide a little bit.

624
01:00:09,959 --> 01:00:12,301
We're trying to get it ahead of your regular normal budget schedule.

625
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:17,924
So that's why we're trying to get it done in March, and then moving it to the fall to get away from your normal budget schedule.

626
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:22,967
That's it for now.

627
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:25,048
Councilor Falco.

628
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:26,289
Thank you, Mr. President.

629
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:28,611
And I'd like to thank you for all your hard work.

630
01:00:28,631 --> 01:00:32,693
I know this group has been meeting nonstop putting this program together.

631
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:36,475
And I had an opportunity to attend the forum last Monday night at the South Memphis Fire Station.

632
01:00:36,495 --> 01:00:38,056
And you did a great job.

633
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:39,917
I mean, it was explaining the program.

634
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:42,639
And there were a lot of good questions.

635
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:43,479
And it was well attended.

636
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,141
But I would definitely agree.

637
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,903
If you can put something on cable access, I think even

638
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:58,350
almost like an infomercial, just kind of describing what it's about, you know, how people can, you know, apply the process, who to contact with questions.

639
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,612
I think that would be definitely beneficial.

640
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:09,760
You know, people do, people do watch programs on that station, so I think it's something that, it's a great mode to, of communication to actually get a message out to people.

641
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,762
So I think that, I would definitely agree.

642
01:01:11,782 --> 01:01:14,944
I think that, you know, a lot of,

643
01:01:16,195 --> 01:01:18,497
successful programs, it all comes down to communication.

644
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,038
And I think that this is the key.

645
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:23,220
But I had a quick question for you.

646
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,283
Can you talk a little bit about the small projects?

647
01:01:27,303 --> 01:01:28,503
I think it was 25,000.

648
01:01:28,623 --> 01:01:29,324
You talked about that.

649
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:31,525
I know that question came up last Monday as well.

650
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,567
So if you could just shed a light on that, that would be great.

651
01:01:33,587 --> 01:01:45,695
So when Roberta and I attended a CPC forum that was run by the city of Somerville a couple months back, the other towns that have already implemented the CPA said that they had set aside a little bit of funding

652
01:01:45,975 --> 01:01:49,999
for really small projects, your gardens or that kind of thing.

653
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:59,089
And I think what we said was the request would be up to $5,000 per project if the total project was 10, so really small projects.

654
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:04,174
We just don't want the little guy feeling like they're going to get taken over by the big project that comes in.

655
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:06,797
We wanted to set something aside for them.

656
01:02:07,387 --> 01:02:08,368
So that's pretty much what it is.

657
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:09,188
It's a trial.

658
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,189
We're going to see how it works.

659
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,910
And I think it's a great idea.

660
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:16,574
So the total project has to be $10,000.

661
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,996
Is the total budget for that piece $25,000?

662
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:22,679
The total request for CPA funding would be $5,000, as long as the total project was $10,000.

663
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,921
So you put in $5,000 from some other source.

664
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:26,322
We'd put in $5,000.

665
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:33,657
If I could echo on that, one of the evaluation criteria is for matching funds as much as possible.

666
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:51,665
Not 100 percent, but it always, I think, and this is quite common in any grant application, if the applicant brings some money to the table to show that there's public support for it and that money will go further, obviously, if we can spread that money and get matching.

667
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:54,546
It could be a one-to-one, or it could be a partial match.

668
01:02:54,586 --> 01:03:03,211
I think that is one of the criteria that we evaluate, which most grant applications do, to benefit to the money to stretch as far as it can go.

669
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:17,158
We urge people, if they're looking for a $20,000 project, maybe they bring $5,000, $10,000, or even another $20,000 to the table, because it will obviously help the process and stretch the money further for the whole city.

670
01:03:17,509 --> 01:03:19,771
And again, everything is a trial for this first year.

671
01:03:20,391 --> 01:03:21,732
We've seen what other towns have done.

672
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:22,773
We're going to try it here.

673
01:03:22,813 --> 01:03:23,433
If it works, great.

674
01:03:23,473 --> 01:03:24,634
If it doesn't, we'll try something else.

675
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:33,701
And as far as in the other cities and towns that you've talked to, that small piece of the budget that was allocated to small projects, is that something that's been successful?

676
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:34,742
Very successful.

677
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:35,663
Very successful.

678
01:03:35,703 --> 01:03:36,964
That's why we wanted to implement it.

679
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:37,364
Good.

680
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:37,924
Sounds good.

681
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:38,244
I like it.

682
01:03:38,465 --> 01:03:38,725
Thank you.

683
01:03:40,129 --> 01:03:40,689
Councilor Nice.

684
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,651
Mr. President, thank you very much.

685
01:03:43,451 --> 01:03:44,832
I just want to say, keep doing what you're doing.

686
01:03:44,913 --> 01:03:46,434
You guys are doing an excellent job.

687
01:03:46,494 --> 01:03:52,898
This is a group that's been very dedicated to this initiative and endeavor since collecting the signatures for the ballot drive back in 2015.

688
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:56,201
And to date, we've seen some great progress.

689
01:03:56,221 --> 01:03:57,662
So I just want to thank you for your efforts.

690
01:03:57,682 --> 01:03:59,223
This really is a marathon, not a sprint.

691
01:03:59,744 --> 01:04:06,709
And you guys have really been holding government's feet to the fire to make sure that this is done appropriately and in a fashion that's going to be successful.

692
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:08,470
So I want to thank you for your efforts and your hard work.

693
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:12,029
Again, keep doing what you're doing, because I think it's work, and the word's getting out there.

694
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:17,253
People are talking about it, and people are excited to see the fruits of the labor that has been put into this.

695
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:18,374
So thank you very much for your work.

696
01:04:19,835 --> 01:04:21,656
Roberta Cameron, who's not here, obviously.

697
01:04:21,696 --> 01:04:22,597
She's right behind you.

698
01:04:22,617 --> 01:04:23,157
She's here.

699
01:04:23,617 --> 01:04:24,598
Who's hiding behind me.

700
01:04:24,638 --> 01:04:26,079
She's hiding behind us.

701
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:27,960
Has been the driving force of this, really.

702
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,182
The credit should go to her and the rest of the committee.

703
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:31,763
But she's been fantastic on this.

704
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:36,079
Yes, and we appreciate all the help that you are giving us because, again, we're new at this.

705
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,580
The more we communicate, the better the product is going to be at the end.

706
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,161
These progress reports will come on occasion.

707
01:04:43,181 --> 01:04:44,301
We're not going to keep you in the dark.

708
01:04:44,321 --> 01:04:46,622
We want to keep you involved as to what's happening.

709
01:04:46,962 --> 01:04:50,143
Guide us, help us, and it's going to be a collaborative effort.

710
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:55,625
I thank you, Mr. President, again.

711
01:04:55,725 --> 01:05:02,000
I thank Typical Roberta sitting in the back and sitting down, but again, this is

712
01:05:03,504 --> 01:05:05,245
what people would be doing.

713
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:06,706
She's definitely not the lazy one.

714
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:18,452
But I will tell you, if you see what's going on in neighboring communities that have implemented the Community Preservation Act, and you see the small projects that are happening, it makes such a huge impact on the community.

715
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,013
And it really makes a neighborhood a true neighborhood again.

716
01:05:21,073 --> 01:05:23,614
So I'm really excited to see that.

717
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:29,417
I think that one of the conversations I've had with different organizations, a lot of the youth organizations,

718
01:05:31,497 --> 01:05:34,120
It's something as simple as getting the word out to their organizations.

719
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,625
For instance, Little League, Babe Ruth, Girls Softball, Youth Socket.

720
01:05:40,085 --> 01:05:47,873
Those organizations talk about fields and some questions they've had because I know they've been trying to capture some funding through the city.

721
01:05:49,334 --> 01:05:56,545
But everybody that voted for the CPA had talked about, well, this could be a viable source.

722
01:05:56,605 --> 01:06:01,953
So I think this is another avenue that maybe we can tap into and reach out to those organizations.

723
01:06:04,597 --> 01:06:19,038
There's one group that contacted me and I directed them right to the site so I know that they're coming with a, it's not a huge project, but it's also a project that what I like to hear and like to see is that you have organizations that come

724
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:22,181
coming in that will be asking for something that they'll work for as well.

725
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:27,406
It's not just my hands out give it to me so we can take care of this one group and that's it.

726
01:06:27,926 --> 01:06:41,319
It's I think that what's nice to see is the the partnership to say hey listen this is what our community voted on and this is what how people have worked on to get make this happen but at the same time we want to we want to do something great for our community

727
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,181
But we're willing to put in the work with you.

728
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:51,063
So it's impressive to see the community stakeholders now as we move forward with this process.

729
01:06:51,083 --> 01:07:03,108
So I'm, for one person who worked very hard with the recreation group and this being one of the pieces that when you talked about arts and not just sports and fields but

730
01:07:03,988 --> 01:07:05,389
the whole gamut of what we can do.

731
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:07,131
I think it's really exciting to see.

732
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:09,072
So, again, I thank you for all your hard work.

733
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:12,515
I know Roberta's still sitting back there, but thank you for everything you've done.

734
01:07:12,555 --> 01:07:16,258
And I'm, for one counts, I'm very excited to see what's coming in front of us.

735
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,159
So, thank you.

736
01:07:17,919 --> 01:07:18,680
Council Member Kern.

737
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,301
Thank you.

738
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:30,289
If we could just request a copy of the email that went out to the 200 organizations and people from.

739
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:32,892
Devens, Ms.

740
01:07:32,912 --> 01:07:33,232
Devens.

741
01:07:34,977 --> 01:07:35,557
Danielle Evans.

742
01:07:35,637 --> 01:07:36,358
Oh, Danielle Evans.

743
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:37,719
If we could get that email.

744
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:48,287
And then I request that you just take another look and potentially, possibly push the first date two weeks just to get a little more, two to three weeks just to get a little more.

745
01:07:51,016 --> 01:07:52,377
let the public know a little bit more.

746
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:54,138
I feel like I get the transcript.

747
01:07:54,178 --> 01:07:55,579
I didn't know of this date.

748
01:07:55,819 --> 01:08:01,884
And I feel like I just want to make sure that it is potentially $1.2 million.

749
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:08,488
And I want to make sure that everybody and every organization is fully aware of this application date.

750
01:08:08,808 --> 01:08:10,069
That's just my only request.

751
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:10,850
Thank you.

752
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:11,410
Respectfully.

753
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:16,334
Roberta, did you want to say anything?

754
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:21,652
Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to hear everything that was said.

755
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:22,773
I kind of walked in in the middle.

756
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:36,549
But just in response to your last statement or request about the timeline is that we're squeezing the first round in because we're already a year overdue.

757
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:51,375
And we worked backwards from when we needed you to be able to approve the funds, and worked backwards to give ourselves the minimal time that we felt that we needed to be able to consider each of the applications fully.

758
01:08:51,776 --> 01:08:54,397
And that's what drove the December 15 date.

759
01:08:54,477 --> 01:09:00,919
So we worked very hard to have the plan completed in time to be able to roll out the application.

760
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:15,607
We've been doing the best that we can to get the word out about that, but as Doug mentioned earlier, the first hurdle, the eligibility determination form is a very brief form.

761
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:23,632
So if people are aware of it, if they have a project that they think is ready to go for the first round, submit the form immediately.

762
01:09:23,852 --> 01:09:28,495
If you have a project that needs a little bit more time to cook, submit for the second round.

763
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:31,757
We'll take your eligibility application form any time.

764
01:09:32,638 --> 01:09:38,484
And we can work with you to figure out which funding round you best fit into.

765
01:09:38,605 --> 01:09:42,709
But there's a second funding round coming up this coming year.

766
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:50,198
So really the deadline is, if you look at it, March is your next chance to get in line.

767
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:58,158
Also, if you submit an eligibility form, it does not commit you to doing that project immediately.

768
01:09:58,839 --> 01:10:00,421
It could be done in the second round.

769
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:01,623
You just want to know, is it eligible?

770
01:10:01,663 --> 01:10:04,066
You don't have to do it as quickly as possible.

771
01:10:04,086 --> 01:10:07,891
I can tell you that I know the Berkshire State is going to submit like seven.

772
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:10,193
They're not going to do seven in one year.

773
01:10:10,213 --> 01:10:11,674
We're going to do that over three years.

774
01:10:11,714 --> 01:10:13,796
We want to know if they're eligible just to get in line.

775
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:15,497
Might be only one or two.

776
01:10:15,537 --> 01:10:17,179
And then, of course, we don't even know if they're going to be funded.

777
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,260
And obviously, I have a conflict of interest.

778
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:25,766
And I will recuse myself, as the councilor just did right now, earlier this evening on the evaluation.

779
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:28,628
So just getting the eligibility form is just the first step.

780
01:10:28,648 --> 01:10:33,292
But it doesn't mean you're going to start building this in March of next year at all.

781
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,655
There'll be time to properly vet things.

782
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:39,362
To the chair, thank you.

783
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:41,483
Because maybe that's where I'm confused.

784
01:10:41,543 --> 01:10:46,466
So the eligibility, the way I'm looking at the key dates, I think it's different than what you're saying.

785
01:10:46,486 --> 01:10:51,709
Because December 15th, it says that simple form is due for round one.

786
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:56,452
And then it says March 2nd, full applications are due for round one.

787
01:10:56,812 --> 01:10:58,894
But I asked the question, when will they be awarded?

788
01:10:58,914 --> 01:11:00,955
And I thought you said March.

789
01:11:01,815 --> 01:11:03,857
No, they will be awarded in,

790
01:11:04,957 --> 01:11:07,719
May so okay, so that's my problem.

791
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:12,061
So may isn't on this key date, which is confusing Yeah, and that is a key date for you.

792
01:11:12,241 --> 01:11:31,091
So I should have put that on the memorandum for you This is it the key date for the public is to know that they'll be asked if they're applicants They'll be asked to present to us publicly in April so that we can vet those projects before we recommend them to you and then we would ask for your We'll give that

793
01:11:32,732 --> 01:11:35,634
the round of recommendations for your approval in May.

794
01:11:36,855 --> 01:11:49,383
Okay, so if an organization does not have the simple form done by the end of next week or December 15th, they are not eligible to fill out a full application for March 2nd?

795
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:59,529
Correct, but they will be eligible to submit the full application in September, or I'm sorry,

796
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:02,733
For round two?

797
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:04,034
For round two, yes.

798
01:12:04,094 --> 01:12:08,975
Okay, so that's where I just find it an issue with regards to this.

799
01:12:09,195 --> 01:12:13,496
This is the first we've publicly kind of learned of the December 15th date.

800
01:12:13,936 --> 01:12:20,418
Like I said, I try to stay on top of the politics on social media and the transcript.

801
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:22,519
This is the first I'm learning of the December 15th date.

802
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:29,868
which even though there's going to be a round two, a lot of organizations may want to get in on that first round.

803
01:12:29,908 --> 01:12:39,350
I mean, they're going to know there's going to be less applicants, they're going to have more ability to potentially get some part of the CPA funding.

804
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:51,173
If you don't plan on meeting, you know, the week of Christmas and New Year's, I respectfully ask, I know it's time crunch and I know how hard you work, but I just ask that we give this,

805
01:12:52,589 --> 01:12:57,233
you know, full transparency to the public and definitely publicize this a little bit more.

806
01:12:57,453 --> 01:12:59,275
That's really my only concern.

807
01:12:59,756 --> 01:12:59,956
Yeah.

808
01:13:03,739 --> 01:13:11,566
Did you mention that we also have a process where we will be willing to accept off-cycle applications?

809
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:11,987
Yes.

810
01:13:13,244 --> 01:13:36,008
So if there is an applicant who has an urgent need for funding for a high priority project that doesn't fall within our timeline that we've laid out, we are willing to work with the applicant for those urgent high priority projects to meet the timeline that they need to consider their application.

811
01:13:38,955 --> 01:13:39,215
Thank you.

812
01:13:39,475 --> 01:13:40,556
Thank you.

813
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:42,598
Councilor Falco.

814
01:13:42,658 --> 01:13:43,319
Thank you, Mr. President.

815
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:44,179
One quick question.

816
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:50,885
So as far as those projects go, those urgent projects, what will be an example of an urgent project that would be eligible for this type of funding?

817
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:53,775
A common example is property acquisition.

818
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:58,017
If there's an opportunity to make a property acquisition, it can't wait months.

819
01:13:58,778 --> 01:14:10,845
They would need to be able to line up the funding in a timely manner so that they can close on a property acquisition in the time that the market demands.

820
01:14:10,865 --> 01:14:14,027
Okay.

821
01:14:14,047 --> 01:14:15,108
So like something that was maybe

822
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:22,729
potentially gonna be developed, but the city had the option to buy it and prevent development, something like that?

823
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:23,230
Yes.

824
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:25,392
Okay, thank you very much.

825
01:14:25,572 --> 01:14:26,073
Councilor Nights?

826
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:27,735
Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

827
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:28,015
Second.

828
01:14:29,177 --> 01:14:33,101
Motion by Councilor Nights to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

829
01:14:33,141 --> 01:14:33,962
All those in favor?

830
01:14:34,222 --> 01:14:34,643
Aye.

831
01:14:35,644 --> 01:14:35,964
I'm sorry.

832
01:14:39,033 --> 01:14:39,874
Name and address of the record.

833
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:42,896
Thank you, Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford.

834
01:14:43,156 --> 01:14:44,657
Good evening, honorable counselors.

835
01:14:44,677 --> 01:14:49,781
This is Tuesday, it must be Medford City Council meeting.

836
01:14:49,981 --> 01:14:54,204
I have an idea for CPA fixed, if they could do this.

837
01:14:55,024 --> 01:15:00,889
It may seem trivial to some of you, but presentation, I believe, is everything.

838
01:15:01,569 --> 01:15:05,252
And I'm talking about the staple that's missing at 30 Salem Street.

839
01:15:05,852 --> 01:15:06,573
As you're coming in,

840
01:15:08,227 --> 01:15:14,452
from Route 93, north or south, the only Route 16 exit, through the square.

841
01:15:16,594 --> 01:15:24,580
In front of, or next door, I should say, to the Methodist Cinema, which is now Elizabeth Grady, there's a church there at 30 Salem Street.

842
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:29,224
It's been missing the steeple for many years.

843
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:32,306
And it is the gateway into the city.

844
01:15:34,768 --> 01:15:36,270
Now, I would think

845
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:43,590
It would be a good idea to place some sort of finial on there.

846
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:47,971
It doesn't have to be a full-blown, heavy-duty, original staple.

847
01:15:49,471 --> 01:15:53,832
However, anything would be better than a flat top.

848
01:15:55,352 --> 01:16:04,374
I think it would be appropriate in our downtown center as it is in most other downtowns I've been to, whether it's Chelsea, Malden, or especially Winchester.

849
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:08,035
You should contact that group and have them file with the CPA.

850
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:13,462
that you contact the church and have the church file an application.

851
01:16:13,722 --> 01:16:19,344
Just feel for at least 25 years, it seems to me that I shouldn't be the one that brings it forward.

852
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:21,404
It should have been done a long time ago.

853
01:16:21,504 --> 01:16:22,645
If it was structurally sound.

854
01:16:23,805 --> 01:16:24,625
Thank you for listening.

855
01:16:24,725 --> 01:16:25,085
Thank you.

856
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:28,326
Communications from the mayor, 17787.

857
01:16:31,519 --> 01:16:47,022
Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the appropriation of retained earnings in the amount of $268,000.00 to fund repairs to Douglas Road due to a leak in the water main line causing flooding.

858
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:51,623
The balance of retained earnings before this vote is $7,389,422.00.

859
01:16:52,983 --> 01:17:00,765
DDBW Commissioner Brian Kerins is present to answer any questions for the council regarding this matter.

860
01:17:01,762 --> 01:17:03,704
Mr. Kearns, name and address for the record, please.

861
01:17:04,525 --> 01:17:07,147
Brian Kearns, Milton Terrace Hyde Park.

862
01:17:08,408 --> 01:17:10,130
Do we have any questions for Mr. Kearns?

863
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:11,351
Councillor Falco.

864
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:12,612
Thank you, Mr. President.

865
01:17:12,632 --> 01:17:14,173
Mr. Kearns, just a couple of quick questions.

866
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:18,577
Can you just tell us a little bit about the water leak, the cause of the water leak, when it happens?

867
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:28,615
It was brought to my attention by a constituent a little over a month ago that he was getting water in his basement.

868
01:17:29,495 --> 01:17:37,320
At that point in time, I had our water and sewer department dispatched out there to see where the source was potentially coming from.

869
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:46,545
And okay, the long and short of it is we narrowed it down to the actual main itself on the street.

870
01:17:47,425 --> 01:17:50,987
All right, and we had our own leak detection equipment out there.

871
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:55,890
We also called in MWRA, all right, to come in and assist us.

872
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:57,531
They have a more elaborate setup.

873
01:17:58,291 --> 01:18:04,155
Off peak time, daytime, nighttime, to try to narrow down exactly where this leak was occurring.

874
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:18,204
And we've actually isolated it down to a 400-foot section of main that the leak is in, but we can't narrow it down any further than that because that whole area is impacted with clay.

875
01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:25,829
Clay is actually acting as an insulation around the existing pipe that's there, and we're losing the sound.

876
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:29,111
It's almost like sonar gear for a submarine.

877
01:18:29,611 --> 01:18:31,353
We can hear it, but then it stops.

878
01:18:32,053 --> 01:18:41,755
Now, we've shut off the actual main itself, all right, in both directions, and when we do that, the leak in the home stops, okay?

879
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:49,417
So, as a result of that, we know that there is a leak that has occurred and is occurring within this 400-foot section.

880
01:18:49,997 --> 01:18:56,419
Now, going back through the history, all right, obviously, this is Douglas Road, by the way, between Summer and George, all right?

881
01:18:56,999 --> 01:19:00,320
The water main that exists today was installed in 1927.

882
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:19,738
It's a six inch main and given the age factor with tuberculation has occurred, there's probably maybe only a three inch clearance going through the existing pipe as it stands today, which is not uncommon in the water and sewer business.

883
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,386
The main service is 32 homes on that street.

884
01:19:28,707 --> 01:19:37,336
Going through all the records and everything, it was just several years ago, the gas main was replaced on that entire street.

885
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:53,811
Well, as a result of the age and the condition of this pipe, the amount of pipe that we already have to replace, meeting with the mayor, we both agreed to replace the entire main on the street.

886
01:19:55,432 --> 01:20:05,918
And to do it right away, because even if we just replace that 400 foot section, through my experience in this business, once you touch something, it spreads.

887
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:10,640
And let's do it one stop shopping here.

888
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,921
Replace the entire main right away.

889
01:20:14,182 --> 01:20:17,904
We already have a contractor in the city who's actually working down on

890
01:20:19,164 --> 01:20:21,607
I think it's one of the side streets down there.

891
01:20:22,227 --> 01:20:26,231
I can have them start as early as next week, okay, to put the new main in.

892
01:20:26,751 --> 01:20:43,907
Now, we put a winter binder on the main, okay, once it's installed, all right, then return in the spring because, okay, with the money that the DPW has requested, the $268,000, that's also going to do curb-to-curb repaving in the spring.

893
01:20:44,948 --> 01:20:54,115
some casting adjustments and some new castings as needed, curbing adjustments as needed, and sidewalk replacement panels as needed.

894
01:20:54,155 --> 01:21:01,640
All right, we're gonna go full, full width down the entire length of that street, and that will, you know, to completely upgrade the street.

895
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:13,629
Actually, in addition to that, we're probably also gonna install an additional fire hydrant, okay, even though there's adequate fire suppression there, an additional one while we're installing, okay, the new main.

896
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:17,917
It sounds like there's two parts to the project.

897
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:23,008
As far as replacing the main, putting in the new hydrant, how long will that take?

898
01:21:23,898 --> 01:21:35,767
The new main, if he were to get the green light from the council this evening, he probably would be starting maybe actually a week from today, all right, or next Wednesday he'd start.

899
01:21:36,328 --> 01:21:38,349
And he could probably go within a couple of weeks.

900
01:21:38,729 --> 01:21:43,133
Again, with weather, you know, that would also have to be the concern as well.

901
01:21:44,273 --> 01:21:48,136
But, you know, we want to, you know, go right ahead and do it right away.

902
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:51,379
And, you know, within two weeks he'd have the new main in.

903
01:21:52,414 --> 01:22:02,057
So when they're actually installing the new main, what can the residents expect as far as, will they be without water periods during the day, I imagine?

904
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:20,582
No, there'd be no loss of water service, Council, because what we would do is we would install a temporary line that would be on the surface of the roadway, in the gutter line, going to the individual homes, and then at that point, we shut the main down, and then excavate and start replacing it.

905
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:27,831
So I actually took a ride down the street the other day just to kind of check out the situation and view it firsthand.

906
01:22:28,392 --> 01:22:31,176
And there's markings all over the place.

907
01:22:31,236 --> 01:22:35,621
And actually at one point the street looks like it comes up on a mound.

908
01:22:35,661 --> 01:22:37,704
It looks like something's going on underneath.

909
01:22:38,465 --> 01:22:44,947
Yeah, it's the soil, Councilor, like I said, it's heavily loaded with clay in that area.

910
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:51,148
And, you know, it's probably one of the worst types of soil you want to deal with.

911
01:22:51,889 --> 01:23:00,051
But, you know, when we come back in in the spring, all right, and we, you know, scarify and do repaving, we'd be eliminating it at that point in time.

912
01:23:00,866 --> 01:23:07,108
Is there any concern, so when you connect that main on Douglas, that's connecting then to?

913
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:08,649
Yeah, it's Summer and George.

914
01:23:09,009 --> 01:23:09,889
Summer and George, okay.

915
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:12,070
Okay, and they're okay.

916
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:12,830
Those are newer mains?

917
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:14,791
Right, yeah, no problems there.

918
01:23:15,051 --> 01:23:21,834
But this will also include new tees, valves, shutoffs, be the full gamut on that street.

919
01:23:23,095 --> 01:23:28,742
We can take advantage of it because, like I said, it was only several years ago the new gas main was installed there.

920
01:23:29,022 --> 01:23:34,249
So I'm not concerned with the utility companies coming in for an emergency at any point in time in the near future.

921
01:23:35,476 --> 01:23:41,518
I mean, it sounds like, I mean, it's almost 100 years old, so it sounds like the whole thing probably should be replaced, but thank you very much.

922
01:23:41,578 --> 01:23:42,418
Okay, thank you, sir.

923
01:23:42,738 --> 01:23:43,659
Counselor Del Rosso.

924
01:23:44,579 --> 01:23:46,840
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

925
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:56,863
If I could, through the chair, say thank you, Commissioner, for bringing this forward and taking the course of action that you're taking in repairing this.

926
01:23:57,863 --> 01:24:07,411
I think it's an appropriate use of this money, and it's going to go a long way in giving a good quality of life to the citizens there.

927
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:08,672
Thank you.

928
01:24:08,692 --> 01:24:22,083
I know your staff does excellent work in communicating to the neighbors what they're going to encounter in these projects, and I can only foresee this going well.

929
01:24:22,764 --> 01:24:23,784
So thank you very much.

930
01:24:23,944 --> 01:24:24,345
Good luck.

931
01:24:24,365 --> 01:24:26,687
Mr. President, Mr. Chairman, move approval.

932
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:29,978
On the motion of approval, Council Member Curran.

933
01:24:30,038 --> 01:24:31,259
Thank you, Vice President Marks.

934
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:40,786
If you could just explain, Commissioner Cairns, a little bit more about how you're going to potentially start the work very shortly, and then you're going to finish it in the spring.

935
01:24:40,806 --> 01:24:43,688
Will the road be closed back up and then reopened?

936
01:24:44,424 --> 01:24:51,910
Yeah, okay, right now the contractor, as a matter of fact, he's on, I think it's Linden Street, actually putting a new water main in there.

937
01:24:53,011 --> 01:25:02,038
What we would do is we would put in the temporary water lines that would go into the homes, the 32 homes in that street.

938
01:25:02,838 --> 01:25:08,003
And then at that point in time, saw, cut, and excavate a trench exposing the existing pipe.

939
01:25:09,864 --> 01:25:13,287
Excavate it, remove it, and install the new pipe.

940
01:25:14,712 --> 01:25:17,296
backfill with clean fill and not clay.

941
01:25:17,316 --> 01:25:26,872
Alright, tamper it down, put a winter patch on it, energize it, chlorinate it, and then remove the temporary pipe that we had installed in the homes.

942
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:29,431
And that will be done now?

943
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,312
Yeah, OK.

944
01:25:31,472 --> 01:25:33,472
That's the process.

945
01:25:33,912 --> 01:25:41,034
If they're going to be without water at any point in time, it's when we're going to be connecting up the temporary line from the permanent line.

946
01:25:41,374 --> 01:25:44,575
Probably an hour's job, OK, they'd be without water.

947
01:25:44,635 --> 01:25:47,255
But they would certainly get plenty of notification.

948
01:25:47,595 --> 01:25:50,436
And it would happen at an off-peak time.

949
01:25:50,476 --> 01:25:55,557
So that way, we're not concerned with people trying to get to work in the morning, lacking water for showers, and so forth.

950
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,078
At the same time, we don't want to inconvenience people at night.

951
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:03,066
You had mentioned there's going to be no loss of water, so I believe you on that one.

952
01:26:05,831 --> 01:26:11,802
Could you just clarify, could you have mentioned doing some of the work now and then doing the rest in the spring?

953
01:26:12,386 --> 01:26:14,287
so the street will remain open?

954
01:26:14,467 --> 01:26:17,188
The street will remain passable at all times.

955
01:26:18,168 --> 01:26:27,412
The only time that the street may be shut down will be in the spring when we coal plane it and repave the entire street.

956
01:26:27,892 --> 01:26:40,197
So depending on the location of the equipment at the time when they resurface it in the spring, it'll only be like a temporary shutdown till we either remove the old existing asphalt or install the new asphalt.

957
01:26:41,273 --> 01:26:44,815
and the reason we can't do the whole project now.

958
01:26:44,915 --> 01:26:48,517
The weather is coming upon us, Council, that's correct.

959
01:26:48,978 --> 01:26:50,178
So too cold to repave.

960
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:51,839
Okay, that's correct.

961
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:53,861
That's the only step that needs to be done in the spring.

962
01:26:53,881 --> 01:27:08,850
That's correct, yeah, okay, and some casting adjustments, okay, manholes, all right, is, you know, another term, manhole either adjustments or replacements, all right, and then also curbing realignment, and then possibly some sidewalk work.

963
01:27:09,885 --> 01:27:15,531
So how will Douglas Road be left from when you finish the first portion until the spring?

964
01:27:15,551 --> 01:27:23,339
It'll be a long, fresh patch, trench patch, down the center of the road.

965
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:28,264
And then in the springtime, we'll return.

966
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:30,549
and pave the whole streets.

967
01:27:30,569 --> 01:27:33,053
But the trench patch will be safe?

968
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:34,495
Or are we going to be blocking it off?

969
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:36,057
No, it will be up to street grade.

970
01:27:36,077 --> 01:27:37,940
It will be a winter hot tub.

971
01:27:38,521 --> 01:27:39,763
That's what I'm trying to get.

972
01:27:39,803 --> 01:27:40,283
Okay.

973
01:27:40,664 --> 01:27:41,385
Winter hot tub.

974
01:27:42,126 --> 01:27:44,650
DPW has its own language on some of these terms.

975
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:50,633
Okay, so there'll be a winter hot tub, everything will be safe, and then in the spring we're going to repave the whole street, do any sidewalk repair.

976
01:27:50,673 --> 01:27:51,873
That's correct, counselor.

977
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:52,814
Thank you.

978
01:27:53,274 --> 01:27:53,934
Thank you, counselor.

979
01:27:53,974 --> 01:27:54,794
Councilor Scott Pelley.

980
01:27:55,235 --> 01:27:56,275
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

981
01:27:58,076 --> 01:28:02,818
I can feel my phone blowing up already from Parris Street and Evans Street.

982
01:28:03,638 --> 01:28:06,340
This is being done because there's a major water leak.

983
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:13,221
and those projects are still on course as we've talked about for the spring, correct?

984
01:28:13,281 --> 01:28:15,122
Yeah, nothing's been compromised.

985
01:28:16,302 --> 01:28:18,083
I can just only imagine.

986
01:28:18,103 --> 01:28:22,304
So, again, this is because there's a major water leak in that area that needs to be done.

987
01:28:22,544 --> 01:28:23,684
That's correct, okay.

988
01:28:23,704 --> 01:28:33,686
Matter of fact, I have almost weekly dialogue with two of the homeowners out there, and they've been very, very patient and understanding, but they also know there's a process that we have to go through.

989
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:34,887
I can understand that.

990
01:28:34,967 --> 01:28:35,727
Thank you, Mr. Carrings.

991
01:28:35,967 --> 01:28:36,267
Thank you.

992
01:28:36,607 --> 01:28:37,788
Thank you, Councilor Scott.

993
01:28:37,808 --> 01:28:38,828
Councilor Knight.

994
01:28:38,848 --> 01:28:39,589
Thank you, Mr. President.

995
01:28:39,609 --> 01:28:43,671
Mr. Kearns, can you tell me who the contractor is that's been selected to perform the work, if the money is appropriate?

996
01:28:43,771 --> 01:28:48,873
Kaidila Construction, Councilor, who's presently in the city doing work.

997
01:28:49,794 --> 01:28:52,055
And in your experiences, do you think that this is a good idea?

998
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,881
A-plus outfit, B-minus outfit?

999
01:28:55,162 --> 01:28:56,403
An A-plus.

1000
01:28:57,023 --> 01:29:08,452
I had actually the owner, Mark Cardillo, in my office yesterday to lay out potentially this job coming up if the council were to approve it.

1001
01:29:09,092 --> 01:29:15,217
I wanted to know if he was capable of taking it on in addition to the responsibilities that he presently has on board.

1002
01:29:15,957 --> 01:29:17,738
And, you know, he was.

1003
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:19,379
I've seen his work.

1004
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,001
I've seen his equipment.

1005
01:29:21,461 --> 01:29:24,983
And, you know, I'm pretty confident we'll, you know, get it done and done right.

1006
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:25,944
Excellent.

1007
01:29:25,964 --> 01:29:26,244
Thank you.

1008
01:29:27,745 --> 01:29:30,047
Move the question, Mr. President.

1009
01:29:30,127 --> 01:29:30,967
Motion of approval.

1010
01:29:31,107 --> 01:29:31,948
All those in favor?

1011
01:29:32,508 --> 01:29:32,909
Roll call.

1012
01:29:33,009 --> 01:29:33,369
Opposed?

1013
01:29:33,389 --> 01:29:34,830
The roll call vote has been requested.

1014
01:29:40,395 --> 01:29:40,575
Yes.

1015
01:29:40,616 --> 01:29:40,796
Yes.

1016
01:29:40,836 --> 01:29:41,097
Yes.

1017
01:29:49,001 --> 01:29:49,842
Councilor Scott Kelly?

1018
01:29:49,882 --> 01:29:50,122
Yes.

1019
01:29:50,662 --> 01:29:51,423
Vice President Marks?

1020
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:51,963
Yes.

1021
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:54,184
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1022
01:29:54,204 --> 01:29:55,525
The motion is adopted.

1023
01:29:56,406 --> 01:29:58,607
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1024
01:29:58,627 --> 01:30:00,928
Suspend the rules, take the papers in the hands of the clerk.

1025
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:01,749
All those in favor?

1026
01:30:01,769 --> 01:30:02,009
Aye.

1027
01:30:02,349 --> 01:30:02,730
Opposed?

1028
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:03,370
The ayes have it.

1029
01:30:04,631 --> 01:30:06,352
Offered by Council President Caviello.

1030
01:30:06,392 --> 01:30:15,918
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Marguerite Regan, teacher of over 40 years at the Swan School.

1031
01:30:18,397 --> 01:30:19,217
Thank you, Mr. President.

1032
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:27,121
Mr. President, Mrs. Regan has been a teacher in the system for 40 years, and there's not many teachers that can make that claim.

1033
01:30:27,161 --> 01:30:37,367
And she recently passed away this week, and I'd like to send condolences to her family this week, if we could have a moment of silence, Mr. President, in memory of her.

1034
01:30:37,747 --> 01:30:38,908
All rise for a moment of silence.

1035
01:30:54,752 --> 01:31:12,227
Offered by President Caviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council have a representative from the bicycle company give the city a plan on how they are picking up the bicycles that are being left over of the city for several days at a time.

1036
01:31:12,907 --> 01:31:13,408
Councilor?

1037
01:31:14,528 --> 01:31:15,389
Thank you, Mr. President.

1038
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:24,866
We have this new company that you sort of pick up a bike anywhere you want, you leave it anywhere you want.

1039
01:31:25,707 --> 01:31:30,011
But as you're going around the city, you're seeing them left in the middle of sidewalks and all over the place.

1040
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:40,960
There's been a bicycle in particular that sat on the rotary over at Winthrop Street for the last five days, and now it's gone from the rotary over to the sidewalk on Winthrop Street.

1041
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:45,164
And I've seen them left over by the book school and all over the city.

1042
01:31:46,563 --> 01:31:58,652
I don't know, I've never seen a plan or anything how this company got into the city or even does business here.

1043
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:08,199
So if the city can have some type of, we can get some type of representative, either come to the council or somebody from the city to let us know how this company operates.

1044
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:10,861
And they say you just can't leave stuff in the middle of sidewalks.

1045
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:13,262
for days at a time and not pick them up.

1046
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,324
So that's been a concern.

1047
01:32:15,344 --> 01:32:26,133
Like I said, there's been a particular one that sat on the rotary of Winthrop Street right in the middle for five days and now somebody took it off and it's on the sidewalk on Winthrop Street.

1048
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:35,221
So again, we can have somebody from that, either have somebody come here or somebody from the city give us a plan on how this company works or some kind of contact with them.

1049
01:32:35,241 --> 01:32:36,903
I don't even know where these people are from.

1050
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:41,111
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

1051
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:41,712
Aye.

1052
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:44,234
Councilor Wango-Kern.

1053
01:32:44,814 --> 01:32:49,438
Thank you, Vice President Mox, and thanks for bringing up Councilor Caviello.

1054
01:32:49,539 --> 01:33:02,650
I actually just ran out to the DPW Commissioner to get an update on Marshall Street in issue, and also the bike left on Winthrop Rotary, because I had emailed the Mayor's office this morning to see if they had that company's contact.

1055
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,950
It's on the sidewalk.

1056
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:04,931
They actually call.

1057
01:33:05,211 --> 01:33:06,371
They didn't have a contact.

1058
01:33:06,411 --> 01:33:10,553
I don't believe because they called Mr. Karen's to try to go remove it.

1059
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:12,914
So we need definitely need a contact.

1060
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:16,635
And I think it's the Maldon's new pilot program they use it.

1061
01:33:16,736 --> 01:33:19,797
And the bikes are being left on Medford streets all over.

1062
01:33:20,237 --> 01:33:21,778
So we do need to get a handle on it.

1063
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:26,780
He said he's going to remove the one on Winthrop Street right after he takes pitches hopefully tomorrow.

1064
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:27,800
So I just wanted to.

1065
01:33:28,288 --> 01:33:29,269
Point of information on that.

1066
01:33:29,569 --> 01:33:29,869
Thank you.

1067
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:31,350
On the motion.

1068
01:33:32,271 --> 01:33:32,511
Second.

1069
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:34,452
All those in favor, seconded by Councilor Leif.

1070
01:33:35,233 --> 01:33:37,034
All those opposed, the ayes have it.

1071
01:33:37,074 --> 01:33:38,235
The motion is adopted.

1072
01:33:39,156 --> 01:33:42,138
Paper from Councilor Scott Pelly.

1073
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:49,043
Be it resolved that the Traffic Department look into illegal parking of out of state automobiles on Cherry Street.

1074
01:33:49,623 --> 01:33:50,584
Councilor Scott Pelly.

1075
01:33:51,285 --> 01:33:52,345
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1076
01:33:52,445 --> 01:33:54,587
I received a few phone calls on

1077
01:33:56,556 --> 01:34:07,199
automobiles that are being left in front of residential homes that are resided by some seniors and the cars are left there for days at a time.

1078
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:24,983
If we could just have someone from the Traffic Enforcement Office or Officer Hodden and maybe reach out and just take a few trips down there to Cherry Street and maybe do a little extra enforcement and making sure that these out of state cars aren't left here overnight for a long period of time.

1079
01:34:25,863 --> 01:34:26,163
Thank you.

1080
01:34:26,984 --> 01:34:27,644
Thank you, Councilor.

1081
01:34:27,664 --> 01:34:28,425
Councilor Felco.

1082
01:34:28,545 --> 01:34:29,386
Thank you, Mr. President.

1083
01:34:29,406 --> 01:34:36,573
I want to thank Council Colleague for bringing this forward tonight because I think this is an issue that is coming up more and more throughout our community.

1084
01:34:36,773 --> 01:34:43,720
And if I could just amend the resolution to also include Tainter Street, Everett Street, and lower Fulton Street as well between

1085
01:34:45,642 --> 01:34:47,263
Sound Street and Webster Street.

1086
01:34:48,343 --> 01:34:54,225
That whole area, that whole block, there's a lot of cars down there with out-of-state plates.

1087
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:57,766
It's an issue that really needs to be addressed.

1088
01:34:58,567 --> 01:35:02,548
I believe it's happening in other sections of the city or other neighborhoods of the city as well.

1089
01:35:04,569 --> 01:35:07,750
It's a resolution that I certainly support, so I second the resolution.

1090
01:35:11,355 --> 01:35:15,817
On the motion offered by Councilor Scott Pelley, amended further by Councilor Felco.

1091
01:35:16,378 --> 01:35:17,098
All those in favor?

1092
01:35:17,118 --> 01:35:17,538
Aye.

1093
01:35:17,799 --> 01:35:18,219
Opposed?

1094
01:35:18,859 --> 01:35:20,620
The ayes have it, the motion is adopted.

1095
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,122
Motion by Councilor Langel Kern to revert back to the regular order of business.

1096
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:24,962
All those in favor?

1097
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:25,583
Aye.

1098
01:35:25,603 --> 01:35:25,943
Opposed?

1099
01:35:25,963 --> 01:35:26,643
The ayes have it.

1100
01:35:26,703 --> 01:35:27,524
Reports of committee.

1101
01:35:27,544 --> 01:35:27,564
17-788.

1102
01:35:30,005 --> 01:35:32,267
Report of Committee of the Whole meeting on November 28th, 2017.

1103
01:35:32,847 --> 01:35:35,569
The Meffitt Square Master Plan.

1104
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:40,092
The committee met on November 28th in the Committee of the Whole.

1105
01:35:40,392 --> 01:35:57,504

01:35:58,485 --> 01:36:09,232
no last name, Fiola, Rick Orlando, Rick Sacco, Tom Lincoln, Andrew Castanetti, and Miranda Wilson from the transcript.

1107
01:36:09,412 --> 01:36:27,624
The purpose of the meeting was to review the Memphis Grandmaster Plan, recommendations made by the council, OCD director provided the council with a copy of the presentation, that the Community Development Office provide the community comments and feedback to the project, that the city do an additional packing count, and it was passed by the council.

1108
01:36:30,308 --> 01:36:33,629
Motion by Councilor Knight to accept the committee report, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

1109
01:36:34,009 --> 01:36:34,529
All in favor?

1110
01:36:34,749 --> 01:36:35,949

1111
01:36:36,149 --> 01:36:36,569

The ayes have it.

1113
01:36:37,309 --> 01:36:38,789
The motion is adopted.

1114
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:48,571
Table of records of the meeting of October 31st, 2017 were passed to Councilor Marks.

1115
01:36:49,051 --> 01:36:51,252
I find those records to be in order and move approval.

1116
01:36:52,552 --> 01:36:53,572
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1117
01:36:54,952 --> 01:36:58,853
The records of the meeting of November 28th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Felco.

1118
01:37:02,628 --> 01:37:14,059
Mr. President, I have a small edit that I could review with the clerk, but other than that minor edit, everything looks fine and I move that the records be approved.

1119
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,481
As amended.

1120
01:37:16,761 --> 01:37:17,562
Approved as amended.

1121
01:37:17,602 --> 01:37:18,123
All in favor?

1122
01:37:18,523 --> 01:37:18,803
Aye.

1123
01:37:18,823 --> 01:37:19,384
Opposed?

1124
01:37:19,404 --> 01:37:20,004
The ayes have it.

1125
01:37:21,205 --> 01:37:22,066
Motion to adjourn.

1126
01:37:23,007 --> 01:37:23,548
All in favor?

1127
01:37:23,748 --> 01:37:24,048
Aye.

1128
01:37:24,308 --> 01:37:24,869
The ayes have it.

1129
01:37:24,969 --> 01:37:26,110
Motion to adjourn.

1130
01:37:27,711 --> 01:37:27,872
Yes.

1131
01:38:54,597 --> 01:39:02,263
corporate tax havens, places like Ireland, where companies will stash lots of money that Trump would rather have repatriated here to the U.S.

1132
01:39:02,323 --> 01:39:04,045
And so that seems to be a main focus.

1133
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:12,051
And whatever focus we did have on cracking down on this kind of activity revealed in the Panama or the Paradise Papers has kind of fallen off the map a little bit.

1134
01:39:12,771 --> 01:39:33,703
Andrew, is there a case for saying that all this protest is not only pointless, but also perhaps counterproductive, and that actually tax havens are a way almost of the free market of nations, you know, if I give less tax, if I take less tax from you, you'll come and be in my country, that's my benefit, that's the game I'm playing, and any country can do this.

1135
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:41,693
I think that's an important point that you make there, Roger, and I think that that's where we sort of have to be realistic about this debate.

1136
01:39:41,733 --> 01:39:47,455
You're always going to get countries that have higher or lower tax rates for particular reasons.

1137
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:52,297
It seems to me, therefore, that the debate around tax havens has to be around

1138
01:39:53,397 --> 01:39:56,019
getting international standards around transparency.

1139
01:39:56,079 --> 01:40:03,202
So you look at a place like Hong Kong, we have tax here around 15% personal taxes, 16.5% for companies.

1140
01:40:03,242 --> 01:40:05,923
That's low, but it's not the lowest in the world.

1141
01:40:06,003 --> 01:40:10,125
What the real concern about Hong Kong is the transparency of the tax system.

1142
01:40:10,145 --> 01:40:13,466
And in particular, it's the ownership of companies here.

1143
01:40:13,506 --> 01:40:14,727
We have a lot of shell companies,

1144
01:40:15,147 --> 01:40:23,057
the allegation, the suspicion is that a lot of those are used for tax avoidance and money laundering as well.

1145
01:40:23,477 --> 01:40:33,390
Now that's where potentially you can work to get international standards of disclosure and transparency around tax and companies.

1146
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:39,412
The idea that you're going to get some sort of harmony over actual tax rates, I think, you know, that's just not realistic.

1147
01:40:39,832 --> 01:40:41,493
And also maybe not desirable.

1148
01:40:41,513 --> 01:40:42,673
Is it even right?

1149
01:40:42,693 --> 01:40:46,435
I mean, shouldn't there be an element of competition in this?

1150
01:40:46,835 --> 01:40:47,835
You know, I think there should be.

1151
01:40:47,875 --> 01:41:01,280
And I think developing nations, if part of their, sort of, the pitch they're making to international investors is we have low taxes here and that's how we're going to develop our country, that to me should be fair enough.

1152
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:20,038
But what I think you can say to developing nations and developed countries alike is we want to know more about, you know, who exactly is stashing money in your country so that we can combat tax avoidance and we can combat money laundering and all the problems that come with that.

1153
01:41:20,438 --> 01:41:30,854
Yeah, but Tony, we know, don't we, that in a place like Switzerland, the actual ability not to be seen is a big part of the attraction for a lot of countries, isn't it?

1154
01:41:30,874 --> 01:41:36,041
A lot of investors, they want to go places where whatever they're doing isn't in the public gaze.

1155
01:41:37,275 --> 01:41:37,896
Yeah, that's right.

1156
01:41:37,936 --> 01:41:39,418
It's a feature, not a bug.

1157
01:41:39,739 --> 01:41:42,242
And it's interesting.

1158
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:45,727
It makes me think back to our conversation about Deutsche Bank.

1159
01:41:46,589 --> 01:41:51,756
Right now we have a president whose finances are pretty opaque, and I don't know

1160
01:41:52,317 --> 01:42:01,603
where President Trump's money is tied up, but it's kind of a recurring problem throughout, at least here in the US, trying to manage and debate the issue of tax savings.

1161
01:42:02,304 --> 01:42:07,868
A lot of the people who are in power are a lot of the people who are squirreling money away in these countries.

1162
01:42:08,368 --> 01:42:10,530
And Tanya, we talked about Delaware and Nevada.

1163
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:17,955
Do Americans and other states resent the fact that these states use that mechanism, or do they just think that's fine, that's just the way it works?

1164
01:42:19,106 --> 01:42:19,586
I don't think so.

1165
01:42:19,626 --> 01:42:24,109
I think, you know, like you said, there's a free market between countries, between states.

1166
01:42:24,189 --> 01:42:30,013
They can really do whatever they want to remain competitive, and I think those states would tell you that.

1167
01:42:30,614 --> 01:42:43,442
I think a lot of the resentment that you've seen build up here is more, you know, when jobs move overseas, when money is stashed away overseas, or at least that's what, you know, the current political climate has gotten people riled up about.

1168
01:42:43,502 --> 01:42:44,482
Maybe there should be more resentment.

1169
01:42:44,502 --> 01:42:44,803
I don't know.

1170
01:42:45,503 --> 01:42:47,165
Andrew, let me come back to you finally on that one.

1171
01:42:47,185 --> 01:42:52,771
I mean, is there a moral case for saying actually these companies should be able to avoid tax?

1172
01:42:53,012 --> 01:42:58,498
They should just be able to, they have to pay tax at perhaps a normal standard rate wherever they are in the world.

1173
01:43:00,236 --> 01:43:05,519
Well, I just, I mean, you know, if there is a moral case for that, it's unfortunately not a realistic case.

1174
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:10,901
I mean, some people would say, in fact, the most sensible thing to do is not tax companies at all.

1175
01:43:10,961 --> 01:43:13,503
And then you, you avoid the problem altogether.

1176
01:43:13,663 --> 01:43:21,987
And you tax individuals, because, you know, at the end of the day, if you don't tax companies, that means they can pay out more in dividends and payouts to their shareholders.

1177
01:43:22,027 --> 01:43:22,447
And that should

1178
01:43:22,967 --> 01:43:24,268
increase the wealth of people.

1179
01:43:24,308 --> 01:43:39,635
Now, I think, you know, there are plenty of arguments against that as well, but the idea that you can harmonize tax across the world, I think, is slightly for the birds, and that's why I say I think that transparency and disclosure is the way forward here.

1180
01:43:39,675 --> 01:43:46,998
That's probably where, more realistically, you can get some international pressure and you can get some international cooperation.

1181
01:43:47,678 --> 01:43:52,983
Well, I guess it's an argument that's going to roll on for an awful long time in lots of places and not just in the EU.

1182
01:43:53,003 --> 01:43:55,265
Thanks very much to both of you on that.

1183
01:43:55,305 --> 01:43:59,148
Let's bring ourselves up to date with the business matters headlines with Jerry Smith.

1184
01:43:59,548 --> 01:44:09,977
Reports say that Donald Trump's account with a major investment bank is being investigated as part of an inquiry into possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 US presidential election.

1185
01:44:10,558 --> 01:44:15,042
President Trump has previously taken out a multi-million dollar loan with Deutsche Bank.

1186
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:25,096
The European Union has published its first blacklist of tax havens, naming 17 territories, including Saint Lucia, Barbados and South Korea.

1187
01:44:25,736 --> 01:44:33,241
It's also published a grey list of 47 additional countries which say they're on the way to changing to EU standard tax rules.

1188
01:44:33,702 --> 01:44:36,724
These include Hong Kong, Turkey, Bermuda and Switzerland.

1189
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:41,447
Both lists have been criticised as omitting the most notorious tax havens.

1190
01:44:42,087 --> 01:44:42,708
Jerry, thanks.

1191
01:44:42,788 --> 01:44:45,412
Now, it's that moment in the programme where we link up with one of our reporters.

1192
01:44:45,432 --> 01:44:49,256
Today, it's Rahul Tandon joining us live on the line from Kolkata.

1193
01:44:49,276 --> 01:44:52,701
Now, Rahul, smog, cricket, they don't go together, do they?

1194
01:44:54,033 --> 01:44:54,594
No, they don't.

1195
01:44:54,614 --> 01:44:58,777
I mean, an extraordinary test match that has been taking place in Delhi.

1196
01:44:58,817 --> 01:45:05,862
Really not for what was happening on the pitch, but what was happening off it, Roger, where we had play stopped but for pollution.

1197
01:45:06,363 --> 01:45:09,745
First ever, I think, in the history of cricket.

1198
01:45:10,266 --> 01:45:15,270
We had the Sri Lankans saying they couldn't continue the match because the breathing conditions were so difficult.

1199
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:36,320
you know on yesterday on the last day of the test match we had an Indian bowler vomiting on the pitch we've had Sri Lankan bowlers doing the same and I think what this is bringing into focus is a much bigger debate about the huge problem that pollution now poses not just in Delhi I'm in Kolkata this morning where there is smog around the city we have

1200
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:49,903
pollution levels that rival Delhi at this particular point in time, 15 to 20 sometimes, 25 times above the recommended levels that the World Health Organization says that we should be breathing.

1201
01:45:49,943 --> 01:46:00,726
And I think this is affecting Indians, but I think for business as well it's going to affect it in a big way, because I think a lot of people are going to think long and hard about whether they want to come and visit India's big cities.

1202
01:46:00,766 --> 01:46:06,047
To give you an idea of how big the problem is, I've been speaking to a couple of sports people in Kolkata.

1203
01:46:07,035 --> 01:46:08,717
I'm absolutely struggling to breathe today.

1204
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:12,481
I can feel, like, the pollution, like, clogging up in my throat as I'm breathing.

1205
01:46:12,521 --> 01:46:15,304
And I'm an athlete, so I'm out in the open a lot.

1206
01:46:15,825 --> 01:46:17,126
I'm finding it absolutely difficult.

1207
01:46:17,146 --> 01:46:19,950
I wake up every morning just, like, gasping for air.

1208
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:21,832
Does it make you think about going out?

1209
01:46:22,272 --> 01:46:25,373
I wish I could not, but I play golf every day and I can't help it.

1210
01:46:25,393 --> 01:46:26,714
I have to play through everything.

1211
01:46:26,854 --> 01:46:35,337
You know, whenever we travel, you know, we play outside and we can feel the difference in our performance or the amount we can run and how much easier it is to run outside.

1212
01:46:35,797 --> 01:46:39,839
You know, even with the temperature change or in higher altitudes, we still do better.

1213
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:42,380
Whereas here, it should be easier for us.

1214
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,242
And we are used to this temperature, but we still find it tougher because the pollution is increasing by the day.

1215
01:46:47,949 --> 01:46:50,073
The difficulties of sports people there.

1216
01:46:50,414 --> 01:46:51,436
Rahul, what about you?

1217
01:46:51,496 --> 01:46:53,139
In Kolkata, you say there is smog there.

1218
01:46:53,179 --> 01:46:53,920
Do you notice?

1219
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,243
Do you find yourself coughing?

1220
01:46:55,263 --> 01:46:58,970
Do you find it's a problem on a day-to-day basis?

1221
01:46:59,981 --> 01:47:01,222
It's a huge problem, Roger.

1222
01:47:01,242 --> 01:47:10,587
I mean, I would say over the last week, I, like most people in Kolkata, is the pollution has really got a lot worse because as the temperatures drop, you know, it can't basically expand.

1223
01:47:10,627 --> 01:47:14,089
It can't move up in the air and it stays and hovers around.

1224
01:47:14,109 --> 01:47:14,990
Yeah, definitely.

1225
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:19,993
I mean, sore throats all the time, coughing a lot of the time.

1226
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:21,714
You just don't feel particularly well.

1227
01:47:21,734 --> 01:47:22,574
You can taste it.

1228
01:47:22,594 --> 01:47:27,337
I mean, I'm on my balcony this morning and you can see the haze and you can sort of taste it in your

1229
01:47:27,757 --> 01:47:35,119
in your mouth and I think it is such an issue here now and it's an issue that really doesn't seem to be getting any better.

1230
01:47:35,139 --> 01:47:43,460
I was talking to doctors the other day who say you know they see a lot more children coming in with asthma, they see a lot more older people coming in now with severe lung problems.

1231
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,361
I mean some of the stats are incredible.

1232
01:47:45,381 --> 01:47:52,762
Look at an issue of premature death which in most countries as medical care you know improves is getting much better.

1233
01:47:52,822 --> 01:47:56,923
In India over the last 10 years it's almost doubled and it's worse and a lot of people are now

1234
01:47:57,403 --> 01:47:58,464
putting it down to pollution.

1235
01:47:58,484 --> 01:48:00,085
So yeah, it really does affect you.

1236
01:48:00,105 --> 01:48:04,208
And I think there is a big economic consequence that India could face.

1237
01:48:04,248 --> 01:48:09,492
I mean, a recent report last year by the World Bank said it could affect GDP by up to 8% a year.

1238
01:48:09,872 --> 01:48:14,275
Unless India tackles this, I think the economic and health consequences are going to be huge.

1239
01:48:14,616 --> 01:48:24,283
But because India needs to generate more power and people want to travel in cars and public transport systems are not good here, we don't seem to be on the verge of improving the air quality here.

1240
01:48:24,943 --> 01:48:35,450
You know Delhi at one stage recently, Roger, was I think a hundred times above what the World Health Organization recommended and it reached a point where doctors were saying you should probably evacuate the city.

1241
01:48:36,191 --> 01:48:49,180
Well let's go from finally and briefly one of the, obviously a real bad taste in the mouth, perhaps a metaphorical one, which is the Vijay Malaiya case, one of India's most high-profile businessmen, extradition question mark.

1242
01:48:50,573 --> 01:48:54,095
Yeah, well that's taking place very close to you in London at this particular point in time.

1243
01:48:54,115 --> 01:48:55,796
Getting a lot of coverage here in India.

1244
01:48:55,816 --> 01:48:58,037
India's most flamboyant businessman.

1245
01:48:58,097 --> 01:49:07,202
He's basically accused of misleading banks to loan money to his collapsed airlines and that he then wasted that basically on his own personal lifestyle.

1246
01:49:07,222 --> 01:49:12,465
A very important case, I think, because a lot of questions were being asked about how he was allowed to leave the country

1247
01:49:13,185 --> 01:49:14,025
in the first place.

1248
01:49:14,065 --> 01:49:22,228
So if the government can get Mr Malia back, and the last date of this hearing is on the 14th of December, maybe they're going to have a good Christmas, maybe not going to be such a good one for him.

1249
01:49:22,968 --> 01:49:23,748
Alright, well we'll see.

1250
01:49:23,908 --> 01:49:30,150
Just before you go there, Rahul, just very quickly, a difficult question for you, but how would you define happiness?

1251
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:35,301
Oh, how would I define happiness?

1252
01:49:35,321 --> 01:49:36,241
There's a good question.

1253
01:49:36,341 --> 01:49:36,781
I'll tell you what.

1254
01:49:37,301 --> 01:49:37,921
I'll tell you, Roger.

1255
01:49:37,941 --> 01:49:39,522
When I experience it, I'll let you know.

1256
01:49:39,942 --> 01:49:40,182
All right.

1257
01:49:40,282 --> 01:49:40,502
All right.

1258
01:49:40,522 --> 01:49:41,162
We'll let you go.

1259
01:49:41,182 --> 01:49:42,642
Thanks very much indeed, Rahul.

1260
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:52,565
Now, the reason I was asking Rahul that rather strange and fairly philosophical question is that we are interested in a case that's come up in Nigeria.

1261
01:49:52,625 --> 01:50:02,127
Now, the governor of Nigeria's Imo state, Rojas Okorocha, has appointed his sister as commissioner for happiness and couples fulfillment.

1262
01:50:02,787 --> 01:50:08,348
The governor's spokesman said there wasn't anything unusual about the appointment, as Mr Okorocha always wanted to make people happy.

1263
01:50:09,148 --> 01:50:16,030
Well, I've been speaking to Yemi Adamokolekun, who is one of the founders of the campaign called Enough is Enough Nigeria.

1264
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:20,211
It's a good governance advocacy group based in Lagos.

1265
01:50:21,091 --> 01:50:26,092
Now, she says a minister of happiness isn't perhaps as absurd as it sounds.

1266
01:50:26,715 --> 01:50:37,907
The UAE actually has one, and the role of the Minister of Happiness is a person who oversees the UAE's plans, programmes and policies to achieve a happier society.

1267
01:50:38,047 --> 01:50:40,310
So there's a clear mandate for a Minister of Happiness.

1268
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:43,313
But we need to define what happiness is, I suppose.

1269
01:50:43,373 --> 01:50:47,478
I mean, you and I might agree, we might disagree on what happiness exactly is.

1270
01:50:47,838 --> 01:50:48,418
Well, yes.

1271
01:50:48,598 --> 01:50:56,281
According to the lady who was tweeting earlier today, she's been responsible for hospitality for the Imo State government for the last six years.

1272
01:50:56,822 --> 01:51:04,585
So it was considered it was a natural fit for her to continue to make provisions for large Christmas tree, catering for statewide events.

1273
01:51:04,925 --> 01:51:10,747
So things that relate to fun occasions that the state organizes she was responsible for.

1274
01:51:10,887 --> 01:51:14,849
So in their definition, it's just fun events.

1275
01:51:15,429 --> 01:51:17,090
Fun events equals happy society.

1276
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:29,260
I mean, fun and happiness, I suppose, again, philosophically, you might not think of the same thing, but I mean, maybe if people had more money or didn't have to worry about illness, I mean, those kind of things might bring them happiness.

1277
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,522
Most definitely, especially in this context.

1278
01:51:31,582 --> 01:51:37,267
So the governor of Imo, for example, is owing pensioners, I think, either 14 or 16 months of salaries.

1279
01:51:37,987 --> 01:51:47,837
So I would agree with you that if those ones actually were able to meet their basic needs they will be quite quite happy rather than having a Christmas tree to go and look at.

1280
01:51:48,237 --> 01:51:56,745
I'm detecting you don't think this is a particularly well that this is in the end a fairly absurd thing to do to a Minister for Happiness when that kind of thing's going on.

1281
01:51:57,045 --> 01:52:02,030
Yeah in this context I mean the UAE it's quite okay for them to have a Minister of Happiness because if you have

1282
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:08,614
The GDP per capita that they do and sort of income inequality is not a major issue in the UAE.

1283
01:52:09,214 --> 01:52:18,679
In Nigeria it is a huge issue and especially in the state in question where there are evidence that the governor is not spending the state's resources judiciously.

1284
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,621
So large Christmas tree, lavish events.

1285
01:52:21,661 --> 01:52:26,284
I think for his birthday there were like 25 cakes stacked on top of each other.

1286
01:52:26,884 --> 01:52:32,869
And then in recent months, he's done a statue of Jacob Zuba, and Jacob Zuba flew in to commission the statue.

1287
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:37,473
Spending state resources on things like that, to me, are just quite absurd.

1288
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:40,456
And you don't really need a Minister of Happiness to make people happy.

1289
01:52:40,496 --> 01:52:44,820
You just need to respond to their needs to be able to meet their basic needs.

1290
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:47,182
But it's made this lady quite happy, I suppose.

1291
01:52:47,522 --> 01:52:48,023
I'm indeed.

1292
01:52:48,163 --> 01:52:51,148
She's actually the minister, the governor's biological sister.

1293
01:52:51,169 --> 01:52:58,701
So she's quite comfortable in the role that she's been given and she, according to her tweet, is looking forward to doing more to make the people of Imo happy.

1294
01:52:59,835 --> 01:53:08,841
Yemi, that set us all to thinking about whether governments or that kind of thing could actually talk about happiness in this sort of way.

1295
01:53:08,881 --> 01:53:10,022
Is it quantifiable?

1296
01:53:10,062 --> 01:53:16,947
I mean, Andrew, I do remember it was Bhutan, I think, started talking about the gross national happiness and somehow they could go towards that.

1297
01:53:16,967 --> 01:53:18,588
I mean, do you believe that's possible?

1298
01:53:19,808 --> 01:53:22,010
I'm pretty skeptical, I'm afraid, Roger.

1299
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:38,383
My concern here is, I remember a few years ago, David Cameron, former UK Prime Minister, when he was in opposition, during the years running up to the financial crisis, he would say, well, you know, we've got to start thinking beyond GDP growth, and we've got to start thinking about the happiness of people.

1300
01:53:38,783 --> 01:53:40,985
And then, of course, the financial crisis hit, and everyone was

1301
01:53:41,485 --> 01:53:44,526
thinking, crikey, we've got to sort out the economy here first.

1302
01:53:44,546 --> 01:53:59,013
And it seems to me that when people start talking about this sort of thing, it's a it's a sort of worrying counter cyclical sign that we're getting a bit complacent about things and that actually government should stick to the knitting of just running the country competently.

1303
01:53:59,633 --> 01:54:03,637
And whether I'm happy or not, I'll decide for myself.

1304
01:54:03,697 --> 01:54:07,441
But as long as the country is run well, that's what I want from my government.

1305
01:54:07,461 --> 01:54:09,142
Well, that's an interesting one, actually.

1306
01:54:09,222 --> 01:54:11,825
Tony, isn't the problem his definition?

1307
01:54:11,865 --> 01:54:12,846
I mean, what is happening?

1308
01:54:12,866 --> 01:54:15,909
Some people are happy with one thing, other people are not.

1309
01:54:16,569 --> 01:54:18,371
You can't really quantify or measure it, can you?

1310
01:54:19,737 --> 01:54:24,621
No, you can't, although I'm sure I'm not the only one who's thinking about it here at the end of the year.

1311
01:54:25,662 --> 01:54:27,824
This is a fascinating story.

1312
01:54:27,844 --> 01:54:28,284
I'm not sure.

1313
01:54:28,304 --> 01:54:31,367
I think I come down on Andy's side with this.

1314
01:54:31,407 --> 01:54:38,733
I think stability, consistency in government would make me very happy.

1315
01:54:38,793 --> 01:54:39,233
Well, there we are.

1316
01:54:39,253 --> 01:54:40,854
You see, now you have defined it a bit.

1317
01:54:40,894 --> 01:54:43,135
I mean, surely, Tony, there must be other things that make you happy.

1318
01:54:43,155 --> 01:54:43,495
For me?

1319
01:54:43,695 --> 01:54:47,217
Yeah, which perhaps, you know, you could make a list and say, right, that's fine.

1320
01:54:47,697 --> 01:54:48,618
Now I can get that.

1321
01:54:48,638 --> 01:54:50,138
I can even ask the government for it.

1322
01:54:50,178 --> 01:54:51,679
And then I shall achieve happiness.

1323
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:52,780
Isn't that the way forward?

1324
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:54,901
Yeah, I suppose.

1325
01:54:54,941 --> 01:54:58,162
I don't know if you need a commissioner for that.

1326
01:54:58,262 --> 01:54:59,123
All right, then, come on.

1327
01:54:59,143 --> 01:55:00,383
What would make you happy, Tony?

1328
01:55:01,804 --> 01:55:03,325
Just a few achievable things.

1329
01:55:03,385 --> 01:55:03,925
Come on.

1330
01:55:04,005 --> 01:55:05,466
It's getting towards the end of the year.

1331
01:55:05,846 --> 01:55:07,447
People might be thinking what to give you for Christmas.

1332
01:55:07,467 --> 01:55:07,827
You never know.

1333
01:55:08,863 --> 01:55:10,483
A giant Christmas tree sounds great.

1334
01:55:10,623 --> 01:55:15,565
I think if our government could get right on that for me or for whoever, you know, I'd appreciate it.

1335
01:55:16,425 --> 01:55:26,927
Andrew, it's an interesting, the part of the world you are, there is in some ways a more, I don't know, a mechanical attitude perhaps to some of the things that can bring happiness.

1336
01:55:26,947 --> 01:55:29,548
People think, well, we will get this and that and the government can bring it.

1337
01:55:30,328 --> 01:55:35,391
and they can make it happen and then we will have a nice utilitarian kind of paradise.

1338
01:55:35,792 --> 01:55:41,055
I mean, do you think that's particularly something that in your part of the world, in Asia, is more of a thing people think about?

1339
01:55:42,535 --> 01:55:48,819
I think people in this part of the world, particularly in Hong Kong, happiness is quite associated with wealth.

1340
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:50,661
Let's put it that way.

1341
01:55:51,902 --> 01:56:02,689
And I think certainly in Hong Kong, as long as the government kind of gets out of the way and lets people get on and make money, then that's what makes the people here generally happy.

1342
01:56:03,129 --> 01:56:19,055
I mean obviously on the mainland in China you have a slightly different approach where the government sort of is responsible for most things including the delivery of happiness to the people and I just worry that that is not exactly the way that countries are best run.

1343
01:56:19,315 --> 01:56:21,276
Is that because it's a very materialistic way?

1344
01:56:21,316 --> 01:56:32,240
I mean we think of a lot of course of philosophy coming out of Asia as well but is there a certain materialism you know that happiness is measurable as you say in wealth terms it's clear.

1345
01:56:34,528 --> 01:56:40,911
You could argue that these are quite heavy topics for a Thursday morning.

1346
01:56:41,271 --> 01:56:49,194
I think, look, I don't want to generalize too much about Hong Kongers in the sense that I don't want to tar them with just being interested in money.

1347
01:56:49,254 --> 01:56:55,276
But I do think that it is a feature of the society out here.

1348
01:56:56,757 --> 01:56:59,798
And perhaps that comes from historical background where

1349
01:57:00,258 --> 01:57:19,127
you know, people have had to work hard for a living here and in this part of the world and so the attainment of a certain level of standard of living is something that's associated with happiness and you can't blame people for that if, you know, they've come from a generally poor background and a poor historical background.

1350
01:57:19,428 --> 01:57:22,489
All right, well finally then, Andrew, what would constitute happiness for you?

1351
01:57:22,529 --> 01:57:23,770
Come on, I've put Tony through this.

1352
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:25,891
I was pretty happy over the weekend.

1353
01:57:25,911 --> 01:57:29,133
I was sat watching England play Australia in Adelaide.

1354
01:57:29,573 --> 01:57:32,495
What would have made me happier is if England had been playing a bit better.

1355
01:57:32,515 --> 01:57:33,956
I was going to say the outcome, but we didn't.

1356
01:57:34,677 --> 01:57:35,417
I'm a simple guy.

1357
01:57:36,338 --> 01:57:39,740
Good game of cricket, but England winning is what makes me happy.

1358
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:40,420
All right.

1359
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:40,660
OK.

1360
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,241
Well, we'll send you on your way happy.

1361
01:57:42,442 --> 01:57:44,743
And Tony, we hope we send you on your way too.

1362
01:57:44,763 --> 01:57:46,284
Perhaps you will get that large Christmas tree.

1363
01:57:46,784 --> 01:57:49,486
And as for me, well, it's the end of the programme and I get to go to bed.

1364
01:57:49,686 --> 01:57:50,727
What could be a better happiness?

1365
01:57:50,747 --> 01:57:51,707
Thank you very much for listening.

1366
01:57:52,028 --> 01:57:52,648
That's it from us.

1367
01:57:52,968 --> 01:57:53,769
Back same time tomorrow.

1368
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:12,364
This is the BBC World Service, where now, here's Harriet Gilbert.

1369
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:21,891
On this month's World Book Club, I'll be talking to Richard Flanagan about his Man Booker Prize winning novel, The Narrow Road to the Deep North.

1370
01:58:22,011 --> 01:58:30,779
It was something that grew in me like a boulder till it was almost choking me and I felt I had to write it.

1371
01:58:30,839 --> 01:58:36,063
World Book Club at bbcworldservice.com slash worldbookclub

1372
01:58:38,587 --> 01:58:40,989
You're listening to the BBC World Service.

1373
01:58:41,169 --> 01:58:44,671
Our diplomatic correspondent James Landale was at the court to hear.

1374
01:58:44,791 --> 01:58:47,693
As our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports from Mosul.

1375
01:58:47,953 --> 01:58:50,054
Our Africa editor Mary Harper reports.

1376
01:58:50,114 --> 01:58:51,355
Let's go to Hong Kong now.

1377
01:58:51,375 --> 01:58:52,336
Time for business news.

1378
01:58:52,396 --> 01:58:53,997
On our business desk is Andrew Wood.

1379
01:58:54,097 --> 01:58:56,538
Available on the BBC iPlayer radio app.

1380
01:58:56,799 --> 01:59:00,401
This is the BBC World Service, the world's radio station.

1381
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:12,715
BBC World Service, it's two o'clock GMT, this is Oliver Conway with the Newsroom.

1382
01:59:13,036 --> 01:59:21,507
The US President Donald Trump is expected to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later, breaking with the international consensus on the city's status.

1383
01:59:21,858 --> 01:59:25,360
I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding the president's decision on Jerusalem.

1384
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:27,701
Tomorrow the president will deliver remarks.

1385
01:59:28,281 --> 01:59:30,322
Has the president made up his mind?

1386
01:59:30,382 --> 01:59:33,543
The president is pretty solid in his thinking at this point.

1387
01:59:33,883 --> 01:59:34,944
Also on the newsroom.

1388
01:59:35,224 --> 01:59:36,524
It's a political decision.

1389
01:59:36,645 --> 01:59:37,725
Very bad decision.

1390
01:59:38,065 --> 01:59:39,446
And I disagree.

1391
01:59:40,146 --> 01:59:44,208
This position of the World Olympic Committee and so on.

1392
01:59:44,568 --> 01:59:49,370
There's been a furious reaction in Moscow after Russia was banned from next year's Winter Olympics.

1393
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:53,852
Tens of thousands of Californians have fled wildfires north of Los Angeles.

1394
01:59:54,352 --> 01:59:58,895
Good friends up the street lost their homes, and I'm just so sad for them.

1395
01:59:59,595 --> 02:00:04,417
And have investigators issued a subpoena for Donald Trump's financial records at Deutsche Bank?

1396
02:00:04,917 --> 02:00:06,118
First, our top stories.

1397
02:00:08,325 --> 02:00:10,026
BBC News with Gareth Barlow.

1398
02:00:10,647 --> 02:00:16,552
Senior US officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

1399
02:00:16,572 --> 02:00:23,418
He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

1400
02:00:23,959 --> 02:00:26,661
Arab states have warned that the decision could provoke violence.

1401
02:00:27,041 --> 02:00:28,863
From Washington, here's Barbara Pletusher.

1402
02:00:29,323 --> 02:00:33,309
The president is planning to fulfill a campaign promise made to pro-Israel voters.

1403
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:39,538
But in doing so, he's tackling one of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the status of Jerusalem.

1404
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:43,825
Senior administration officials said he would simply be acknowledging reality,

1405
02:00:44,225 --> 02:00:46,667
that Jerusalem functions as the capital of Israel.

1406
02:00:47,247 --> 02:00:55,794
Congress has called for such a move for 22 years, but previous presidents have been resistant, accepting that Jerusalem's future should be part of a negotiated agreement.

1407
02:00:56,535 --> 02:00:56,955
One U.S.

1408
02:00:56,995 --> 02:01:00,878
official said that delaying the decision had done nothing to advance peace.

1409
02:01:01,519 --> 02:01:05,502
But the U.N., Europe and Arab states have long calculated that it would prevent conflict.

1410
02:01:06,256 --> 02:01:13,583
Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban it from next February's Winter Olympics in South Korea.

1411
02:01:14,104 --> 02:01:20,710
A damning report by the IOC said there had been an unprecedented systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system.

1412
02:01:21,151 --> 02:01:22,972
From Moscow, here's Steve Rosenberg.

1413
02:01:23,553 --> 02:01:28,318
The deputy speaker of Russia's parliament said it was a humiliation and an insult to Russia.

1414
02:01:29,178 --> 02:01:40,809
In a defiant post in social media, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said Russia would survive this like it survived World War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Western sanctions.

1415
02:01:41,850 --> 02:01:51,179
Although the Russian team has been banned from competing in South Korea, Russian athletes who can prove they are clean will be permitted to participate under the Olympic flag.

1416
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,642
But will the Kremlin allow them to?

1417
02:01:54,322 --> 02:01:59,589
Vladimir Putin has in the past described such a scenario as a humiliation for his country.

1418
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:05,576
Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

1419
02:02:05,996 --> 02:02:08,620
James Cook reports from the outskirts of Los Angeles.

1420
02:02:09,075 --> 02:02:21,331
In Ventura County, to the north of Los Angeles, a wildfire which broke out on Monday intensified with terrifying speed, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by arid and gusty Santa Ana winds.

1421
02:02:21,812 --> 02:02:25,557
Scores of homes were gutted and a mental health hospital was destroyed.

1422
02:02:26,157 --> 02:02:34,221
Here, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the charred ruins of houses are still smoking, while dark, choking smoke has closed a major moat away.

1423
02:02:34,781 --> 02:02:38,643
Ash is blowing through the air, and there is a firefighting helicopter overhead.

1424
02:02:39,183 --> 02:02:46,567
And with forecasters warning that ferocious winds and low humidity will continue for several days, this could yet get a lot worse.

1425
02:02:47,408 --> 02:02:52,654
Three men in Malta have been charged with murdering the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.

1426
02:02:53,054 --> 02:02:55,377
She was killed in a car bomb attack in October.

1427
02:02:55,777 --> 02:02:59,261
The case has shocked the small Mediterranean island and the European Union.

1428
02:02:59,621 --> 02:03:02,304
The three accused men were among ten arrested on Monday.

1429
02:03:03,445 --> 02:03:05,407
World News from the BBC.

1430
02:03:09,458 --> 02:03:14,860
Fifteen thousand people a day are being forced to flee their homes in African conflict and disaster zones.

1431
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:24,163
Figures published by the Norwegian Refugee Council and the Internal Deplacement Monitoring Centre show that more than 12 million people in Africa are internally displaced.

1432
02:03:24,623 --> 02:03:30,045
Nearly four million left their homes last year, a quarter of them in the Democratic Republic of Congo alone.

1433
02:03:31,225 --> 02:03:40,970
The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favor President Juan Orlando Hernández.

1434
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:47,573
The electoral tribunal had already agreed to an earlier opposition demand to recount around one-third of the ballots.

1435
02:03:48,114 --> 02:03:56,058
The opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla, has appeared set for victory shortly after the election ten days ago, when the vote count was suddenly halted.

1436
02:03:57,385 --> 02:04:07,908
Christine Keeler, the British former model whose relationships with a British minister and a Soviet diplomat in the 1960s caused one of the most notorious political scandals of the Cold War, has died.

1437
02:04:08,369 --> 02:04:09,449
She was 75.

1438
02:04:09,989 --> 02:04:15,411
As a teenager, she had a brief affair with John Profumo, a senior Cabot member who was forced to resign.

1439
02:04:15,891 --> 02:04:17,792
The scandal rocked the British establishment.

1440
02:04:18,192 --> 02:04:21,933
Christine Keeler said she'd been too young to deal with the impact of the affair.

1441
02:04:22,715 --> 02:04:35,775
I wish that at that time I had been older so that I would have been able to have answered or spoke up for myself, but I was only a young girl.

1442
02:04:36,765 --> 02:04:44,230
Britain's most prestigious contemporary art award, the Turner Prize, has been won by an art professor who was born in Zanzibar, Lubaina Hameed.

1443
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:54,157
Judges praised her work, which explores the African diaspora and black creativity, for what they called its exuberant approach to painting and its sense of theatre and satire.

1444
02:04:54,557 --> 02:04:58,540
Professor Hameed is the first black woman and the oldest person to win the award.

1445
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:04,324
She said she would use the $33,000 prize money to help young artists get their work exhibited.

1446
02:05:04,884 --> 02:05:05,665
BBC News.

1447
02:05:08,417 --> 02:05:08,997
Thanks very much.

1448
02:05:09,017 --> 02:05:13,138
You're listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service with Oliver Conway.

1449
02:05:13,619 --> 02:05:20,881
Despite warnings from Arab leaders about the possible dangerous repercussions, it seems Donald Trump is planning to move the U.S.

1450
02:05:20,961 --> 02:05:24,102
embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

1451
02:05:24,662 --> 02:05:37,853
White House officials have briefed journalists that the president will announce in a speech at 18 Hours GMT on Wednesday that the US is recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, making it the first and only country to do so.

1452
02:05:37,873 --> 02:05:40,655
Here's his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

1453
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:45,310
Finally, I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding the President's decision on Jerusalem.

1454
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:47,651
Tomorrow, the President will deliver remarks.

1455
02:05:48,251 --> 02:05:52,453
Has the President made up his mind about this, or is this decision still in flux?

1456
02:05:53,514 --> 02:05:58,176
The President, I would say, is pretty solid in his thinking at this point.

1457
02:05:58,976 --> 02:06:05,201
Both the Palestinians and the Israelis claim Jerusalem as a capital of any current or future state.

1458
02:06:05,721 --> 02:06:15,208
President Trump has tried to ease concerns with a series of phone calls to Arab leaders in the Middle East, including the Palestinian leader, as we heard from Yolande Nel in Jerusalem.

1459
02:06:15,878 --> 02:06:21,902
In their phone call, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is said to have warned Mr Trump that moving the U.S.

1460
02:06:22,002 --> 02:06:26,946
embassy would have an impact on the peace process with Israel and regional stability.

1461
02:06:27,486 --> 02:06:34,031
Mr Abbas has since spoken to the Pope and the leaders of Russia, France and Jordan, asking them to intervene.

1462
02:06:34,671 --> 02:06:42,097
King Abdullah of Jordan was also called by Mr Trump and is said to have spoken of possible dangerous repercussions of his plan.

1463
02:06:42,877 --> 02:06:48,741
Egypt's President Sisi is reported to have told him there was no need to complicate matters in the Middle East.

1464
02:07:00,348 --> 02:07:12,976
Well yes, although with the caveat that unless until he actually delivers the speech we can't predict entirely what he's going to say and specifically his thinking behind this decision.

1465
02:07:13,416 --> 02:07:24,183
It would be highly contentious, it already is, in terms of what we have heard in moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem effectively

1466
02:07:24,603 --> 02:07:39,088
acknowledging Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the first country to do so since the foundation of the state of Israel since 1948, and it would mark a sea change in certainly US policy towards the region.

1467
02:07:39,608 --> 02:07:46,810
And the briefings we're getting from White House officials suggest though that it will take some time to move the embassy.

1468
02:07:49,174 --> 02:08:00,719
Yes, what we understand is that there will be some form of waiver written into Mr Trump's announcement that will keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for at least six months.

1469
02:08:00,799 --> 02:08:16,105
Now, my understanding is that much of this is simply logistics, the moving of staff between the two cities, which is clearly going to take some time, but perhaps also it is a little bit of breathing space to see what the reaction

1470
02:08:16,685 --> 02:08:25,293
is going to be and the policy may well change over coming months depending on how things unravel in the weeks and months to come.

1471
02:08:25,594 --> 02:08:28,857
And why, what is the attraction of doing this for President Trump?

1472
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:51,649
Well, certainly it was part of his campaign pledge that he wanted to do this and it was one of his major foreign policy planks and perhaps domestic policy comes into this a little bit in terms of the president wanting to be seen to be making good on those big promises in his first year.

1473
02:08:51,709 --> 02:08:54,832
I mentioned domestic politics because it hasn't necessarily all gone his way.

1474
02:08:55,232 --> 02:08:56,693
in terms of those big promises.

1475
02:08:56,753 --> 02:09:02,937
So I think he wants to get something done, and I think he is known as quite an impatient character in this respect.

1476
02:09:03,218 --> 02:09:10,423
But in terms of doing it now, I think there are quite a few people here who are rather mystified by the timing.

1477
02:09:10,563 --> 02:09:14,886
We know that the White House, the Trump administration, has been working on a peace plan for several months.

1478
02:09:14,966 --> 02:09:16,607
We don't know the detail of that.

1479
02:09:17,047 --> 02:09:44,260
So why to make this announcement now, perhaps ahead of a bigger plan and bigger negotiations, I think we remain to see, because it does show the US's hand, and if the US is going to play a role as a mediator in negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, it perhaps makes things rather awkward, because it's certainly not what the Palestinians wanted to hear.

1480
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:45,782
Peter, many thanks indeed.

1481
02:09:46,022 --> 02:09:53,956
Peter Bowes there and hopefully we'll get more details in that speech apparently from Donald Trump tomorrow at lunchtime in the US.

1482
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,622
While he focuses on that big change in U.S.

1483
02:09:57,762 --> 02:10:03,046
foreign policy, Donald Trump could be facing an investigation at home into his finances.

1484
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:06,669
I say could because there's some dispute over whether the U.S.

1485
02:10:06,689 --> 02:10:12,414
special counsel Robert Mueller has issued a subpoena for Mr. Trump's financial records at Deutsche Bank.

1486
02:10:13,014 --> 02:10:14,455
Many media outlets in the U.S.

1487
02:10:14,495 --> 02:10:21,361
reported that he had, but it was denied by the president's legal team, as relayed by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

1488
02:10:21,905 --> 02:10:38,273
Look, I think it's important to note, and hopefully you guys have seen this statement, that Jay Sekulow, a member of the president's legal team, has put out within the last hour that they confirmed that the news reports that the special counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are completely false.

1489
02:10:38,713 --> 02:10:40,714
No subpoena has been issued or received.

1490
02:10:41,054 --> 02:10:43,355
We've confirmed this with the bank and other sources.

1491
02:10:43,695 --> 02:10:49,758
I think that this is another example of the media going too far too fast, and we don't see it going in that direction.

1492
02:10:50,378 --> 02:10:53,540
So, do we know if a subpoena has indeed been issued?

1493
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:56,661
A question for our correspondent Anthony Zerke in Washington.

1494
02:10:57,081 --> 02:10:57,441
We don't.

1495
02:10:57,521 --> 02:11:07,286
We had multiple news outlets reporting that the documents had been subpoenaed by the special counsel Robert Mueller, subpoenaing Deutsche Bank.

1496
02:11:07,446 --> 02:11:14,189
But since then, the White House lawyers have pushed back fairly vociferously, saying there was no subpoena request.

1497
02:11:14,549 --> 02:11:18,371
They checked with Deutsche Bank and other sources that have

1498
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:25,858
said these reports are false, but the sources that these news outlets are citing are standing by their contention.

1499
02:11:25,939 --> 02:11:31,284
So it's basically up in the air whether this actually has happened or not.

1500
02:11:31,524 --> 02:11:34,828
And why would the special counsel want those records?

1501
02:11:35,228 --> 02:11:44,692
Well, that's the interesting thing here, because so far Robert Mueller has, say, looked into the foreign lobbying of Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chair.

1502
02:11:44,712 --> 02:11:56,718
He has reached a plea agreement with Michael Flynn, who was a confidant of Donald Trump's and his first national security adviser, and George Papadopoulos, who was a foreign policy adviser on the campaign.

1503
02:11:56,878 --> 02:12:05,083
Those are all kind of outside the main purview of the inspection of whether there's ties between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling.

1504
02:12:05,103 --> 02:12:18,831
Well, here you have Robert Mueller directly looking at the president himself, if it's true, and his finances, looking at Deutsche Bank, because Donald Trump owes Deutsche Bank about $300 million when he came into the presidency.

1505
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:28,556
The bank has loaned Donald Trump about $4 billion over the course of the past 20 years, so they have very close financial ties.

1506
02:12:29,096 --> 02:12:36,800
And this all raises the question of whether Robert Mueller will be allowed to continue his investigation.

1507
02:12:37,662 --> 02:12:53,537
Well, when Donald Trump was interviewed about this a few months back, they asked whether it would be a red line, whether it would be going too far beyond his mandate if Robert Mueller started looking into his business dealings prior to being a presidential candidate.

1508
02:12:54,137 --> 02:13:03,266
And Donald Trump was fairly clear that he thought that would be going too far, and perhaps this would instigate a more aggressive response from the president.

1509
02:13:03,726 --> 02:13:16,032
possibly even trying to get rid of Robert Mueller, which, as president, he could do if he orders people in his Justice Department to do so, although that would create quite a controversy.

1510
02:13:16,172 --> 02:13:27,558
But there may be some uneasiness on the part of Donald Trump to having someone poking around in his business dealings long before he was a serious candidate for political office.

1511
02:13:28,098 --> 02:13:30,039
Anthony Zerker in Washington.

1512
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:40,506
Let's go across now to Los Angeles, because since wildfires started there just over a day ago, the flames have spread across some 180 square kilometres.

1513
02:13:41,107 --> 02:13:52,654
People in California have already experienced a number of bad wildfires this year, but now 27,000 residents have suddenly been forced to evacuate, with no sign of when the fires will be put out.

1514
02:13:53,175 --> 02:13:54,556
James Cook is in LA.

1515
02:13:55,356 --> 02:14:02,221
This wildfire exploded overnight, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by ferocious Santa Ana winds.

1516
02:14:04,662 --> 02:14:07,244
Devastation, with nothing to salvage.

1517
02:14:08,064 --> 02:14:11,887
Families had just minutes to scramble their belongings together and flee.

1518
02:14:13,008 --> 02:14:18,011
Good friends up the street lost their homes, and I'm just so sad for them.

1519
02:14:18,071 --> 02:14:23,935
I'm happy for myself and those of us that kept their homes, but it's awful.

1520
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:28,222
There is, though, little hope of the winds easing.

1521
02:14:28,522 --> 02:14:32,846
They are dry, gusty and erratic, the most dangerous conditions possible.

1522
02:14:33,667 --> 02:14:42,094
Ventura is home to more than 100,000 people, and with more than 1,000 firefighters struggling to protect the city, a second blaze broke out.

1523
02:14:42,775 --> 02:14:49,341
This fire is closer to L.A., and millions of Angelenos awoke to find the skies to the north thick with smoke.

1524
02:14:51,239 --> 02:14:56,382
Helicopters have struggled to fly in the wind, making it much harder to contain the fires.

1525
02:14:57,023 --> 02:15:03,787
With forecasters warning that the dangerous weather will continue for several days, the governor of California declared an emergency.

1526
02:15:04,287 --> 02:15:11,272
And with a third fire now burning, the most devastating wildfire season on record in this state just got a lot worse.

1527
02:15:11,952 --> 02:15:14,274
James Cook reporting from Los Angeles.

1528
02:15:14,294 --> 02:15:17,257
Quick bit of breaking news from France.

1529
02:15:17,317 --> 02:15:26,446
The country's best-known rock star, Johnny Hallyday, often known as the French Elvis, has died at the age of 74 after a battle with lung cancer.

1530
02:15:26,466 --> 02:15:29,589
And we'll bring you more on that before the end of the programme.

1531
02:15:29,709 --> 02:15:32,191
This is the Newsroom from the BBC World Service.

1532
02:15:32,572 --> 02:15:33,573
Gareth has our headlines.

1533
02:15:34,191 --> 02:15:41,098
Senior officials in the Trump administration say the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

1534
02:15:41,719 --> 02:15:45,422
Tens of thousands of Californians have fled wildfires north of Los Angeles.

1535
02:15:45,903 --> 02:15:52,309
And there's been a furious reaction in Moscow after the International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the forthcoming Winter Olympics.

1536
02:15:52,689 --> 02:15:56,053
Yes, this was state TV in Russia announcing the news.

1537
02:15:56,668 --> 02:16:07,072
The International Olympic Committee announced the decision after a 17-month investigation into allegations of state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Games in the Russian city of Sochi.

1538
02:16:18,436 --> 02:16:29,021
Some Russian athletes will be able to compete in 2018 as neutral competitors under the Olympic flag, but Russia's Olympic Committee says it will appeal against the ban.

1539
02:16:29,201 --> 02:16:31,662
For reaction from Moscow, we heard from Steve Rosenberg.

1540
02:16:32,082 --> 02:16:40,746
There's a sense of deep disappointment here, a sense of injustice too, and an unwillingness to accept that Russia has committed a crime here.

1541
02:16:41,267 --> 02:16:43,808
The Deputy Speaker of the Russian Parliament, Igor Lebedev,

1542
02:16:44,228 --> 02:16:46,690
said this was a humiliation for our country.

1543
02:16:47,050 --> 02:16:49,312
I spoke to Dmitry Svishchev.

1544
02:16:49,612 --> 02:16:53,215
He's a Russian MP and the president of Russia's Curling Federation.

1545
02:16:53,255 --> 02:16:56,358
He told me this was unjust, not based on any evidence.

1546
02:16:56,758 --> 02:16:59,220
He said collective responsibility was unfair.

1547
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:04,702
He suggested this was a political decision and said sport should be outside of politics.

1548
02:17:04,722 --> 02:17:08,944
And then I went to a ski slope on the edge of Moscow, just to speak to ordinary Muscovites.

1549
02:17:09,204 --> 02:17:10,985
First of all, it's a political decision.

1550
02:17:11,325 --> 02:17:19,308
It's a very bad decision and I disagree with the position of the World Olympic Committee and so on.

1551
02:17:19,968 --> 02:17:28,415
because I think that for Russian sportsmen it will be great and very important to show their results under the Russian flag.

1552
02:17:28,796 --> 02:17:45,370
In recent weeks a number of Russian politicians have suggested that if the IOC was to take that decision and allow clean Russian sportsmen to take part under the Olympic flag that they should not do so, that this would be almost treachery on the part of the sportsmen.

1553
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:47,952
Everything will depend, I think, on what

1554
02:17:48,572 --> 02:18:01,717
Vladimir Putin says, because there is one man who will decide this question, that is the Russian president, and we expect that he will announce his decision on whether Russian sportsmen should go and take part under the neutrofag.

1555
02:18:02,077 --> 02:18:06,919
This will decide what kind of participation there will be from Russia in the Olympic Games.

1556
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:09,581
Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.

1557
02:18:10,602 --> 02:18:17,667
Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus, has faced unrelenting bombardment in the past three weeks.

1558
02:18:18,328 --> 02:18:22,211
A ceasefire announced recently didn't even hold for a full 24 hours.

1559
02:18:22,852 --> 02:18:28,876
As the death toll from airstrikes continues to rise, so does the number of children nearing starvation.

1560
02:18:29,317 --> 02:18:36,723
The UN has said that acute malnutrition among youngsters is at the highest level recorded anywhere in Syria since the war there began.

1561
02:18:37,123 --> 02:18:39,544
Martin Patience reports now from Eastern Ghouta.

1562
02:18:42,686 --> 02:18:47,368
The aftermath of the latest airstrikes is like a scene from hell.

1563
02:18:48,089 --> 02:18:54,432
The sky is dark with dust and debris as rescuers rush into buildings to scoop up children.

1564
02:18:55,493 --> 02:18:58,714
Among the injured was five-year-old Yusuf with a head wound.

1565
02:18:59,435 --> 02:19:05,098
The doctors patch him up as best they can, but they're desperately short of medical supplies.

1566
02:19:08,315 --> 02:19:15,409
A rebel stronghold, Eastern Rota, has been bombed and besieged by the Syrian government for several years.

1567
02:19:16,371 --> 02:19:19,297
Many families are now on the brink of starvation.

1568
02:19:22,186 --> 02:19:27,568
Eight-year-old Noor and his seven-year-old sister, Ghazal, sit round a wood-burning oven.

1569
02:19:28,469 --> 02:19:36,693
It's their first and only meal of the day, a thin piece of bread made from barley, which is normally fed to donkeys.

1570
02:19:37,813 --> 02:19:42,355
Their father, Abu Ahmed, was seriously injured when out gathering firewood.

1571
02:19:44,812 --> 02:19:47,835
A shell landed close to me, and I was hit by a shrapnel.

1572
02:19:47,955 --> 02:19:52,178
I was blinded in my left eye, and my knee was damaged, and I can no longer walk.

1573
02:19:52,379 --> 02:19:57,423
I'm in a pretty bad shape, and I have three kids to look after.

1574
02:19:58,444 --> 02:20:01,486
That means his children are left carrying the burden.

1575
02:20:02,027 --> 02:20:04,169
Here, they're fetching drinking water.

1576
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:11,015
It's no surprise, then, that Ghazal dreams of freeing herself from her prison, Eastern Ghouta.

1577
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:17,526
I wish I could have cookies, sweeties, or any other delicious foods.

1578
02:20:17,546 --> 02:20:23,533
And I wish someone could send me a pair of slippers and some new clothes and shoes.

1579
02:20:24,133 --> 02:20:28,639
I really miss food, like chicken, cheese, tea, and juice.

1580
02:20:34,802 --> 02:20:40,204
In another home, two-and-a-half-year-old Hamza is suffering from severe malnutrition.

1581
02:20:41,044 --> 02:20:45,905
His ribs are protruding, and he's wearing a plastic bag as a nappy.

1582
02:20:46,965 --> 02:20:49,906
He was abandoned before being taken in by a neighbour.

1583
02:20:51,187 --> 02:20:56,188
Umm Mohammed says Hamza is like one of her children.

1584
02:20:56,888 --> 02:20:58,889
He's my son now, she says.

1585
02:21:02,610 --> 02:21:05,733
There's supposed to be a ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta.

1586
02:21:06,333 --> 02:21:09,956
But almost every day, people in this area dig fresh graves.

1587
02:21:10,717 --> 02:21:13,680
For families here, there's no respite from the war.

1588
02:21:15,390 --> 02:21:18,191
Our report from eastern Utah by Martin Patience.

1589
02:21:18,391 --> 02:21:20,172
And now Gareth has some more of the day's stories.

1590
02:21:20,712 --> 02:21:27,115
One of Australia's most prominent churchmen is going on trial today accused of covering up child abuse in the 1970s.

1591
02:21:27,595 --> 02:21:33,598
The Archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Watson, is the most senior Catholic figure in the world to be charged with this type of offence.

1592
02:21:34,378 --> 02:21:38,360
A military operation in Western Cameroon has led to hundreds of people fleeing their villages.

1593
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:46,086
The exodus comes after the government pledged to retaliate against an armed group that wants independence for the country's two English-speaking regions.

1594
02:21:46,647 --> 02:21:49,449
Some of those fleeing the army have crossed into neighboring Nigeria.

1595
02:21:50,310 --> 02:21:58,998
The public prosecutor in Saudi Arabia has said that most of those detained in an unprecedented anti-corruption purge have agreed to settlements in order to avoid prosecution.

1596
02:21:59,438 --> 02:22:05,763
He said that a total of 320 people have so far been subpoenaed to provide information about alleged corruption.

1597
02:22:06,604 --> 02:22:15,169
Ukraine's prosecutor general says Georgia's former president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has 24 hours to hand himself over to the Ukrainian authorities.

1598
02:22:15,869 --> 02:22:19,551
Mr Saakashvili was invited to Ukraine by its president, Petro Poroshenko.

1599
02:22:20,012 --> 02:22:24,955
But the two men have fallen out, and Mr Saakashvili has become a prominent opposition politician.

1600
02:22:25,495 --> 02:22:34,400
On Tuesday, Mr Saakashvili's supporters helped him escape from security officers in dramatic scenes, as our correspondent in Kiev, Jonah Fisher, reports.

1601
02:22:36,965 --> 02:22:41,067
This was a remarkable day in the extraordinary career of Mikhail Saakashvili.

1602
02:22:41,547 --> 02:22:44,909
It started on the roof of his apartment block in central Kiev.

1603
02:22:45,329 --> 02:22:50,532
He spoke to his supporters below as security agents climbed up the stairs to arrest him.

1604
02:22:51,092 --> 02:23:03,818
Then, having been detained, Saakashvili's supporters first blockaded, then hours later broke open the police van he was inside, enabling the former Georgian president to escape triumphantly.

1605
02:23:05,699 --> 02:23:08,400
What happens next?

1606
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:11,282
We will go now to Parliament.

1607
02:23:11,582 --> 02:23:13,043
We will go to Parliament.

1608
02:23:13,103 --> 02:23:13,843
What happens next?

1609
02:23:13,863 --> 02:23:20,287
We will ask for impeachment of Poroshenko, who is a thief, who is mega-corrupt, who is plundering the entire Ukraine with his gang.

1610
02:23:20,387 --> 02:23:25,990
We have to stop supporting him, because it's outrageous what they are up to.

1611
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:28,851
And today it was a classical political arrest.

1612
02:23:28,891 --> 02:23:31,773
Do you think you really have the support of the people here in your bank?

1613
02:23:31,793 --> 02:23:32,593
Absolutely.

1614
02:23:32,654 --> 02:23:33,414
You saw it today.

1615
02:23:33,774 --> 02:23:42,986
Ukraine's Prosecutor General says Mr. Saakashvili should be detained for allegedly receiving funds from businessmen connected to the former President Viktor Yanukovych.

1616
02:23:43,527 --> 02:23:51,496
Mr. Saakashvili says he's being targeted for his increasingly vocal campaign against Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko.

1617
02:23:52,077 --> 02:23:57,684
It was Mr Poroshenko who granted Mr Saakashvili Ukrainian citizenship in 2015.

1618
02:23:58,144 --> 02:24:05,572
But the relationship soured as Mr Saakashvili accused his former friend of not being serious about tackling corruption.

1619
02:24:06,113 --> 02:24:07,434
Jonah Fisher in Ukraine.

1620
02:24:08,015 --> 02:24:13,921
There's been political chaos and protest in Honduras since the presidential election on November 26th.

1621
02:24:14,441 --> 02:24:27,214
The opposition has now demanded a full recount of the votes, which ended up in favour of the incumbent president, Juan Orlando Hernández, after initially looking promising for the opposition candidate and former TV star Salvador Nasralla.

1622
02:24:27,734 --> 02:24:30,197
Candace Peards, our America's editor, told me the latest.

1623
02:24:30,765 --> 02:24:38,050
They haven't declared a winner yet and now what we're seeing is the opposition are now demanding a full recount of the vote.

1624
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:39,391
Now why are they doing this?

1625
02:24:40,012 --> 02:24:53,902
Earlier the electoral tribunal had agreed to a partial recount of around a third of all the ballot papers in the elections and now it looks like the opposition have taken this opportunity to extend their demand even further.

1626
02:24:54,042 --> 02:24:55,403
They might have been emboldened by

1627
02:24:55,943 --> 02:24:58,644
very recent, quite surprising events.

1628
02:24:59,204 --> 02:25:13,349
On Monday, hundreds of members of the riot police refused to carry out orders to enforce a nighttime curfew ordered by the government to keep order after widespread street protests organized by the opposition.

1629
02:25:13,809 --> 02:25:19,551
Now, the police spokesman said they didn't want to clamp down on peaceful protest.

1630
02:25:20,091 --> 02:25:29,496
It's really unusual in Latin America to see ordinary voters out on the streets, as we saw on Tuesday, holding placards thanking the riot police.

1631
02:25:30,316 --> 02:25:46,104
And then the opposition also had support from international observers, who've been urging the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to agree to a wider recount, arguing there'd be numerous inconsistencies, including ballot boxes that arrived opened or incomplete.

1632
02:25:46,244 --> 02:25:47,465
So is it possible we could get

1633
02:25:48,205 --> 02:25:50,826
a full recount or even a rerun of the election?

1634
02:25:51,766 --> 02:25:58,929
That's certainly something that the opposition, Salvador Nasralla and the opposition coalition are calling for.

1635
02:25:58,989 --> 02:26:09,193
They're calling now for a very wide recount, 18,000 ballot boxes, and he has already been tweeting about possibly it would be better to have a full election again.

1636
02:26:09,693 --> 02:26:14,058
Candace Peart said on the news that Johnny Alliday, the French rocker, has died at the age of 74.

1637
02:26:14,098 --> 02:26:19,764
He sold more than 110 million records and made 30 films.

1638
02:26:19,784 --> 02:26:23,607
Yet outside the French-speaking world, he was virtually unknown.

1639
02:26:23,748 --> 02:26:25,770
Emma-Jane Kirby looks back at Johnny Alliday's life.

1640
02:26:31,307 --> 02:26:35,569
It was a career that spanned five decades and three generations.

1641
02:26:35,969 --> 02:26:45,532
Born as plain Jean-Philippe Smet, Johnny Halliday first hit the limelight aged 16 as an Elvis wannabe who sang rock in French.

1642
02:26:46,312 --> 02:26:57,896
His early concerts caused riots, but then French President Charles de Gaulle accused him of being a corrupter of youth who was spreading dangerous American values throughout France.

1643
02:27:01,284 --> 02:27:10,555
Yet despite having more than 900 songs under his belt and 100 live tours, his fame never really spread beyond the French-speaking world.

1644
02:27:13,086 --> 02:27:16,728
Most rock and roll stars, Johnny's life had its ups and downs.

1645
02:27:17,208 --> 02:27:28,193
For nearly 50 years, France's gossip and celebrity magazines were full of the details of his three failed marriages, his tax evasion scandals and his cocaine addiction.

1646
02:27:28,833 --> 02:27:33,115
But his fans remained loyal, and his concerts were always sellouts.

1647
02:27:38,297 --> 02:27:40,779
Johnny Halliday announced his semi-retirement in 2009.

1648
02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:58,629
France's greatest rock star said he was tired of the limelight, and he yearned to return to the days when he was just plain old Jean-Philippe Smet.

1649
02:27:59,309 --> 02:28:04,492
Johnny Halliday, who has died at the age of 74, the Lycée Palace has paid tribute.

1650
02:28:04,672 --> 02:28:05,993
That's it for now from the newsroom.

1651
02:28:07,974 --> 02:28:09,735
This is the BBC World Service.

1652
02:28:10,035 --> 02:28:12,537
Now, take a moment to listen to this.

1653
02:28:13,157 --> 02:28:14,458
What intrigues us?

1654
02:28:14,658 --> 02:28:20,362
Dogs have a really unique and special ability to read and understand us.

1655
02:28:20,702 --> 02:28:22,203
What alters our view?

1656
02:28:22,383 --> 02:28:24,945
Every time we look around we just say, it's a homeless people.

1657
02:28:25,085 --> 02:28:27,967
But they have names, they have dreams and paths and everything.

1658
02:28:28,107 --> 02:28:29,888
There are stories that make us wonder.

1659
02:28:30,148 --> 02:28:33,992
They talk about having an intimate, not just a sexual, relationship with the robot.

1660
02:28:34,112 --> 02:28:36,894
And that's hard because it's a one-way relationship.

1661
02:28:37,135 --> 02:28:38,716
The machine can't love you back.

1662
02:28:38,936 --> 02:28:41,519
And ones that defy all belief.

1663
02:28:41,839 --> 02:28:49,266
I've found members of different communities, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, stabbed, lying on the street.

1664
02:28:49,746 --> 02:28:54,107
The more we know about the world, the more we understand about ourselves.

1665
02:28:54,487 --> 02:28:57,668
Many of us didn't really think bisexuality existed.

1666
02:28:57,848 --> 02:29:00,969
Documentaries on the BBC World Service.

The Maxing stands in China are crowded with new publications every month.

1669
02:29:14,272 --> 02:29:15,992
But what are Chinese people reading?

1670
02:29:16,918 --> 02:29:22,802
Not only magazine, I think everything happening in China reflects the new China.

1671
02:29:23,002 --> 02:29:29,206
I pretty much read every single page of the magazine.

1672
02:29:29,246 --> 02:29:35,511
Join me, Xin Yuan Wang, for the face of China on the BBC World Service after the news.

1673
02:29:38,698 --> 02:29:40,519
BBC News with Gareth Barlow.

officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

1676
02:29:47,242 --> 02:29:53,685
He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

1677
02:29:54,145 --> 02:29:55,906
The decision will break with years of U.S.

1678
02:29:55,926 --> 02:30:00,368
policy on the status of the disputed city, as well as the international consensus.

1679
02:30:01,268 --> 02:30:11,533
Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban its participation in next year's Winter Olympics, following a report accusing it of systematic doping.

1680
02:30:12,033 --> 02:30:16,355
The deputy speaker of the Russian parliament called the ban a humiliation and an insult.

1681
02:30:16,896 --> 02:30:23,139
The foreign ministry spokesman said Russia would survive this as it had survived the world war and the collapse of the Soviet Union.

1682
02:30:24,099 --> 02:30:28,923
Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

1683
02:30:29,564 --> 02:30:34,929
One which broke out in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, has trebled in size in just a few hours.

1684
02:30:35,529 --> 02:30:40,413
At least 150 buildings have been destroyed and a quarter of a million homes are without power.

1685
02:30:41,454 --> 02:30:49,155
Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

1686
02:30:49,716 --> 02:30:53,736
Alfred and Georges de Georgiou and Vince Muscat were arrested on Monday.

1687
02:30:54,016 --> 02:30:55,417
They have pleaded not guilty.

1688
02:30:56,477 --> 02:31:01,878
Hundreds of people in Cameroon are fleeing their villages because of a military operation in the west of the country.

1689
02:31:02,398 --> 02:31:08,839
The government has said it will retaliate against an armed group that wants independence for the country's two English-speaking regions.

1690
02:31:10,471 --> 02:31:20,100
The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favour President Juan Orlando Hernández.

1691
02:31:20,621 --> 02:31:27,527
The opposition candidate, Salvador Nasrulla, has appeared set for victory shortly after the election, when the vote count was suddenly halted.

1692
02:31:28,228 --> 02:31:32,512
It sparked days of street violence, which have left at least three people dead.

1693
02:31:33,433 --> 02:31:35,294
World News from the BBC.

1694
02:31:39,568 --> 02:31:43,671
The magazine stands in China are crowded with new publications every month.

1695
02:31:44,411 --> 02:31:46,873
But what are Chinese people reading and why?

1696
02:31:47,814 --> 02:31:50,676
CBN Weekly, Chinese edition.

1697
02:31:50,716 --> 02:31:54,959
That's the one that I read almost from day to day.

1698
02:31:55,499 --> 02:31:56,860
Oh, I love this one.

1699
02:31:57,380 --> 02:31:58,121
Fashion magazine.

1700
02:31:58,381 --> 02:31:59,182
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1701
02:31:59,242 --> 02:31:59,622
Fashion.

1702
02:32:01,683 --> 02:32:05,306
I pretty much read every single page of the magazine.

1703
02:32:08,058 --> 02:32:14,023
Not only magazine, I think everything happening in China reflects the new China.

1704
02:32:16,405 --> 02:32:26,134
I'm Xin Yuan Wang, and for the BBC World Service, I'm out on the streets of Shanghai to find out what's between the magazine covers in The Face of China.

1705
02:32:30,971 --> 02:32:39,813
Now I'm in front of one of the magazine stands and on both sides there's a display of altogether around 100 different magazines.

1706
02:32:40,134 --> 02:32:48,536
And on my right there's all the magazines about fashion and also the news, like News Weekly and some political reports.

1707
02:32:49,496 --> 02:32:53,979
She says the best seller is always something about fashion.

1708
02:32:54,099 --> 02:32:57,061
It's actually the main customer, they come from like 30 years plus.

1709
02:33:08,969 --> 02:33:11,110
Nowadays young people don't buy newspapers, they use mobile phones.

1710
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:22,337
So she said like definitely change a lot and before people came for newspaper and things but now once you have smartphone nobody come to newspaper and magazine, especially young people.

1711
02:33:22,357 --> 02:33:26,580
Nowadays we have a lot of newspapers shut down because they can't be opened.

1712
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:36,689
So it's actually a very difficult time for those physical Maxine stands because they have to close down.

1713
02:33:36,789 --> 02:33:39,571
Many of them have to close down because there are no people.

1714
02:33:40,012 --> 02:33:48,019
She hoped that there was some way, some solution that these very traditional physical Maxine stands will exist in Shanghai.

1715
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:52,363
So is there any future for magazines in China?

1716
02:33:52,963 --> 02:34:01,129
I'm going to talk to readers of all generations as well as the editors and journalists who are facing new challenges.

1717
02:34:01,149 --> 02:34:03,731
Hello, open the door.

1718
02:34:10,225 --> 02:34:20,990
I've come to visit a couple in Shanghai with a young baby, a typical middle-class family, with both parents working and facing the issues of bringing up a child in the city.

1719
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:27,033
They're looking at the magazine, Nanfang Zhoumo, that's targeting their needs and interests.

1720
02:34:36,898 --> 02:34:42,401
So basically this is that the topic actually is very children orientated.

1721
02:34:42,661 --> 02:34:52,027
For example like this one is about second child and also the education in general and also housing is a very hot topic.

1722
02:34:52,367 --> 02:35:02,273
People are concerned about where they can buy their flat or rent their flat because then that will decide whether they can send their children to the good

1723
02:35:02,653 --> 02:35:04,735
primary school, middle school, etc.

1724
02:35:05,155 --> 02:35:08,618
So, all in all, it's all about the next generation.

1725
02:35:08,898 --> 02:35:12,021
That will be the most popular topic in Shanghai.

1726
02:35:18,446 --> 02:35:21,910
That's really interesting.

1727
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:37,988
Zizi told me that even strictly speaking in terms of a year's income, she don't think she really account as like middle class because middle class earn certain amount of money and not everybody can reach that amount of money.

1728
02:35:38,448 --> 02:35:48,953
But more and more people, including more and more her friends, regard themselves as middle class in terms of high education received and awareness of citizenship.

1729
02:35:49,334 --> 02:35:52,355
And in that perspective, they really think they are middle class.

1730
02:35:52,815 --> 02:35:59,078
And for those, Maxine actually suits that purpose very well, because they will report, again, as a topic.

1731
02:36:00,339 --> 02:36:05,620
about, for example, a marathon, like you train yourself and run for hours.

1732
02:36:05,960 --> 02:36:09,061
That kind of thing is typical middle class behavior.

1733
02:36:09,401 --> 02:36:16,403
So people would go for a run, not because they really love running, but they want to see themselves as middle class.

1734
02:36:16,523 --> 02:36:26,365
And this magazine will give very in-depth discussion about the nuance between the certain kind of behavior and being middle class.

1735
02:36:31,587 --> 02:36:34,949
But what about readers who haven't reached this stage of life?

1736
02:36:35,609 --> 02:36:43,413
I'm going to talk to a different generation, the young ambitious workers in Guangzhou, one of the top business cities in the country.

1737
02:36:43,894 --> 02:36:47,516
It's a very energetic and very rich place.

1738
02:36:49,321 --> 02:36:59,666
There are a lot of young generation to work here and want to earn a high salary to raise themselves and have a promising future here.

1739
02:37:00,207 --> 02:37:04,809
So it's a place with hope and energy.

1740
02:37:06,170 --> 02:37:10,032
Here, many of them are in their 20s and have no children.

1741
02:37:10,832 --> 02:37:16,195
Over their busy lunch break, we asked them what they think of the family-orientated magazines.

1742
02:37:17,628 --> 02:37:20,111
This is about, have a second baby, are you ready?

1743
02:37:20,131 --> 02:37:23,233
I was like, I don't even have a husband, I'm not ready.

1744
02:37:23,594 --> 02:37:24,575
So I won't read it.

1745
02:37:25,235 --> 02:37:30,460
Nowadays, young people are prefer the online magazine or online news.

1746
02:37:30,861 --> 02:37:34,524
And it's totally free, but the magazines, we need to pay for it.

1747
02:37:34,804 --> 02:37:39,989
But the information, we can get it the same with the online magazine or online paper.

1748
02:37:41,784 --> 02:37:51,068
In China, if we want to get information of some certain subject, we usually go to the cell phone.

1749
02:37:51,448 --> 02:37:54,630
So there's not much interest in printed versions here.

1750
02:37:55,290 --> 02:37:56,611
Everything is going online.

1751
02:37:57,311 --> 02:38:01,873
Clark explains how he reads Maxine's on WeChat, the social media app.

1752
02:38:03,218 --> 02:38:20,400
They have this WeChat public account where they will post, they will not post everything there, but they will select some of the key articles from that magazine on their public account and then push that for free.

1753
02:38:21,602 --> 02:38:25,327
And then I realized I don't have to buy the magazine myself, I can just read through it.

1754
02:38:25,347 --> 02:38:35,401
Because I don't really need to look at all of the magazines, I only need to just try to understand the key, like the whole topics.

1755
02:38:42,747 --> 02:38:43,669
In Shanghai, Ms.

1756
02:38:43,689 --> 02:38:51,741
Chen is the vice chief editor of CBN Weekly, a magazine that targets young business professionals like those in Guangzhou.

1757
02:38:52,902 --> 02:39:03,011
She explains that her magazine must keep pace with technology and the new ways that Chinese people want to get information.

1758
02:39:03,071 --> 02:39:15,462
Of course they will put more effort on the online part because of course it's very clear that if you only rely on the paper-based magazine the future will be

1759
02:39:15,802 --> 02:39:16,522
not so bright.

1760
02:39:16,862 --> 02:39:26,164
They think it's time to think about to keep a relationship with readers because before the main media, they just like sell the magazine and that's it.

1761
02:39:26,565 --> 02:39:32,766
But now you really have to keep some two-way communication with readers so that you can keep your readers.

1762
02:39:32,866 --> 02:39:34,346
It's not just the selling magazine.

1763
02:39:34,666 --> 02:39:38,287
So that is probably the plan, the long-term plan.

1764
02:39:40,528 --> 02:39:44,109
But anyway, it's very difficult to survive in this digital age.

1765
02:39:46,670 --> 02:39:50,152
So, how has the content of magazines changed in recent years?

1766
02:39:51,132 --> 02:39:55,675
Journalist Mandy Lee has worked on traditional magazines and new media.

1767
02:39:56,256 --> 02:40:00,578
And she's seen a move away from areas seen as controversial in China.

1768
02:40:01,719 --> 02:40:04,141
Before we graduated, it's political.

1769
02:40:04,441 --> 02:40:11,605
Most of them will be about politicals and also the sensitive subjects about economy and business.

1770
02:40:16,468 --> 02:40:20,429
I've come to see Mr. Zhang, a retired journalist in Shanghai.

1771
02:40:21,070 --> 02:40:28,251
In his career over 30 years, he told me how he had witnessed the development of the media in China.

1772
02:40:28,792 --> 02:40:37,154
He started on the magazine in a factory, which was really a propaganda for the Communist Party, as were all the publications at that time.

1773
02:40:38,186 --> 02:40:44,748
During the economic reforms, he helped to set up a new magazine, but was faced with challenges.

1774
02:40:45,549 --> 02:40:49,050
He was one of the co-founders of the magazine called The Bond.

1775
02:40:49,570 --> 02:41:02,155
So The Bond used to be, nowadays it's more like fashion magazine, but when it's first established, it's more about political editorial, so it's focused on topics.

1776
02:41:02,575 --> 02:41:04,616
And the reason he left The Bond, because

1777
02:41:05,736 --> 02:41:14,987
Some political sensitive things happened and he realized maybe it's not where he can take the full social responsibility as the journalist.

1778
02:41:15,568 --> 02:41:18,492
So that's the reason he left the bond.

1779
02:41:18,952 --> 02:41:22,877
But Mandy believes people's attitudes have changed.

1780
02:41:23,618 --> 02:41:24,238
People don't care.

1781
02:41:25,977 --> 02:41:27,538
People don't care anymore.

1782
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:30,982
So I think they are losing their voice.

1783
02:41:31,102 --> 02:41:36,328
Also, on the other hand, people still kind of respect them, but they don't read them.

1784
02:41:36,949 --> 02:41:42,655
They have a lot of types of magazines, but I don't read, like, economic magazines or political magazines.

1785
02:41:42,896 --> 02:41:43,536
I think that's...

1786
02:41:44,277 --> 02:41:46,099
a lot of things to know from them.

1787
02:41:46,479 --> 02:41:47,940
But, you know, it's all censored.

1788
02:41:48,921 --> 02:41:55,165
So I don't know how many information you can get from there or whether it's altered.

1789
02:41:55,385 --> 02:41:58,067
So you have to really find out.

1790
02:41:58,468 --> 02:42:09,135
So instead of relying on magazines, many Chinese professionals have been using VPNs, or virtual personal networks, to access the wider Internet.

1791
02:42:09,456 --> 02:42:12,298
Basically, if I want to get some information like that,

1792
02:42:13,078 --> 02:42:15,939
I will go to the Internet, I will go to Google.

1793
02:42:16,239 --> 02:42:19,240
Here they can get information that's not available in China.

1794
02:42:20,180 --> 02:42:28,383
However, the government is now trying to restrict the use of VPNs and it may become much more difficult in the future.

1795
02:42:29,196 --> 02:42:50,425
I will skip the wall, you know the wall the Chinese government set for all the internet server so I will use some app to skip the wall and get message on internet on YouTube, on Google or something like that because it's quite fresh news and magazines

1796
02:42:51,702 --> 02:42:57,627
I think it's very true because, you know, YouTube and Facebook are blocked in China, so we all have VPNs.

1797
02:42:57,927 --> 02:43:03,932
We have more opportunities to know other things, to know the real other things, which is good.

1798
02:43:03,952 --> 02:43:08,396
It's not changed or altered by Chinese government or other things.

1799
02:43:09,177 --> 02:43:10,318
It's closer to the truth.

1800
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:28,146
I'm going to meet Mr. Kuan, the chief editor and founder of the publication Urban China.

1801
02:43:28,926 --> 02:43:38,496
He's confident that his magazine can offer a valuable resource for those living in cities and give people the chance to get involved with local issues.

1802
02:43:45,503 --> 02:43:47,344
You think there must be something missing.

1803
02:43:47,704 --> 02:43:50,404
There's something between the fashion and professional.

1804
02:43:50,704 --> 02:44:04,027
So it's like some magazine allow people to care about the very severe, serious issues about urban China, but not necessarily to be too academic and very accessible language.

1805
02:44:04,428 --> 02:44:07,308
So we should take our social responsibility.

1806
02:44:07,668 --> 02:44:12,970
Let's talk about some hot issues, the hot topics in contemporary China.

1807
02:44:15,491 --> 02:44:19,036
This one is about the urban transformation.

1808
02:44:19,357 --> 02:44:21,701
And this is about social housing.

1809
02:44:21,801 --> 02:44:23,964
So they're really very open-minded.

1810
02:44:24,044 --> 02:44:29,693
They have no problem touching some sensitive problems of urban development.

1811
02:44:33,851 --> 02:44:43,856
So actually, it's not like always about political correct or not.

1812
02:44:44,216 --> 02:44:51,220
It's actually they want this magazine to represent the concern about the current problem.

1813
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:53,902
So it's always problem orientated.

1814
02:44:54,202 --> 02:45:01,386
For example, one of the issue talking about the Chinese style of building a city, and they criticize a lot

1815
02:45:01,766 --> 02:45:03,687
because the speed is too fast.

1816
02:45:04,107 --> 02:45:10,930
So as a result, many new cities become ghost cities because nobody lives there, just empty buildings.

1817
02:45:11,250 --> 02:45:15,852
So they criticize a lot of the problems in the process of urbanization.

1818
02:45:16,172 --> 02:45:19,354
And he thinks that's totally healthy because that is good for China.

1819
02:45:19,834 --> 02:45:21,995
And he thinks the atmosphere for those

1820
02:45:22,736 --> 02:45:32,769
very take the responsibility and you do your constructive criticism that is always good and is actually welcomed by the Chinese government.

1821
02:45:32,789 --> 02:45:35,753
I'm with Yiming, a typical student reader.

1822
02:45:38,577 --> 02:45:46,420
She has found that, for her studies, there are magazines in China which have a lot to offer.

1823
02:45:46,460 --> 02:45:53,223
So she just gave me a very good example of the reading experience of the magazine called South Weekly.

1824
02:45:54,783 --> 02:46:23,410
rather than just reporting the news, they will invite different specialists come from the sociology or laws to analyze the different layers of argument behind the news and actually that is very helpful for students who are interested in sociology or philosophy or laws because it shows how you can use theory and apply theory to understand the modern society.

1825
02:46:23,550 --> 02:46:30,536
But she is honest about what interests her and for so many other young Chinese people.

1826
02:46:30,556 --> 02:46:34,220
There's one topic which is really important to them.

1827
02:46:34,780 --> 02:46:47,632
So when she came to Shanghai, then it's become mainly fashion magazine because it's really the right place to read fashion magazine because Shanghai itself is regarded as the city of fashion.

1828
02:46:48,212 --> 02:46:55,796
So she think she was kind of influenced by the atmosphere of where she studied and live.

1829
02:46:56,136 --> 02:46:59,077
So fashion magazine become the main one on the reading list.

1830
02:47:00,538 --> 02:47:04,960
Mainland China, the market is several billion R&B.

1831
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:10,183
So in terms of US dollars, one or two billion, yeah, that's the market.

1832
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:15,022
Loficio is one of the leading fashion magazines in China.

1833
02:47:15,742 --> 02:47:19,464
Annie works with a young and energetic production team.

1834
02:47:20,004 --> 02:47:30,610
Ten years ago, if the magazines published stories about these big brands, readers loved to read them and they would love to buy.

1835
02:47:31,030 --> 02:47:38,014
But now, the new generation readers, they are less interested in the big brands.

1836
02:47:38,294 --> 02:47:40,095
They are more interested in

1837
02:47:40,915 --> 02:47:43,857
the individual unique brands.

1838
02:47:44,418 --> 02:47:49,901
So it's harder for us to target the right readers.

1839
02:47:50,041 --> 02:47:52,303
So it's more challenging to us.

1840
02:47:52,923 --> 02:48:01,749
I think that the whole society, the change of the culture, the change of the consumption habits all drive the big change.

1841
02:48:02,089 --> 02:48:07,331
in terms of these publications and even the fashion industry itself.

1842
02:48:07,911 --> 02:48:13,312
Also the new generation, they are from better off families.

1843
02:48:13,653 --> 02:48:16,854
They have enough money, so they are well-traveled.

1844
02:48:17,274 --> 02:48:23,596
Most of them are educated abroad, so they are very selective or picky.

1845
02:48:25,116 --> 02:48:28,038
And also they want to show their individuality.

1846
02:48:28,118 --> 02:48:30,420
They don't want to conform with others.

1847
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:38,486
So that's why they're more interested in the unique brands, not these household names.

1848
02:48:38,886 --> 02:48:49,274
So to us, we have to change our editorial style and our material to tailor to their needs.

1849
02:48:49,614 --> 02:48:52,316
The team are active in promoting their magazine online.

1850
02:48:52,957 --> 02:48:56,142
finding innovative ways of getting their material read.

1851
02:48:56,162 --> 02:49:01,030
I'm just 22, maybe I'm the youngest fashion editor.

1852
02:49:02,151 --> 02:49:05,036
I think I was born to do the job.

1853
02:49:05,056 --> 02:49:06,719
I think it's a wonderful job.

1854
02:49:08,236 --> 02:49:17,466
They stay in the front line of the fashion industry, so they pick up the trend and the news very quickly.

1855
02:49:17,646 --> 02:49:20,809
So he is the future of this business.

1856
02:49:22,972 --> 02:49:28,557
We also help the local designers, not just the luxury brands.

1857
02:49:29,318 --> 02:49:36,607
I sometimes, yeah, I will cooperate and promote their collections, their new collections, the local designers.

1858
02:49:37,368 --> 02:49:42,215
Because we are in a fashion magazine, we can do some things to help them.

1859
02:49:43,282 --> 02:49:55,532
You know that's the excitement about being in China right now because every day is different and Probably after five years there will be a big change in ten years.

1860
02:49:55,592 --> 02:49:59,135
There will be a huge dramatic change So it's very exciting

1861
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:10,392
I've traveled from Shanghai to Beijing to join a group of readers who want to talk to me about their reading habits.

1862
02:50:11,093 --> 02:50:14,198
And again, I'm finding that things are changing.

1863
02:50:15,104 --> 02:50:23,528
people have the choice of looking for all the news they need from the mobile phone.

1864
02:50:24,329 --> 02:50:29,091
By using a mobile phone, you can get a lot of information that you need.

1865
02:50:29,731 --> 02:50:40,957
So frankly, I don't know how the magazines or newspapers make a living in today's business environment if they want to make money.

1866
02:50:41,197 --> 02:50:46,201
other family members, do they into the internet magazine or what kind of magazine?

1867
02:50:46,341 --> 02:50:53,907
You know, my wife and my daughter, you know, love to buy, you know, really old fashion magazines, you know, five years ago, even 10 years ago.

1868
02:50:54,587 --> 02:51:02,954
But nowadays, they just check all the information, you know, you know, words or pictures on the mobile phone.

1869
02:51:03,494 --> 02:51:07,537
If I buy a physical magazine, I buy it for job.

1870
02:51:07,717 --> 02:51:11,520
If I read some online magazines, I read it for fun.

1871
02:51:11,960 --> 02:51:17,544
For example, I will buy the Harvard Business Review for my job because I'm an HR.

1872
02:51:17,664 --> 02:51:22,087
And there are many HR-related articles in this magazine.

1873
02:51:22,567 --> 02:51:26,630
And it will cost about 50 RMB for one magazine.

1874
02:51:27,030 --> 02:51:29,432
So these physical ones is for job.

1875
02:51:30,132 --> 02:51:39,797
And for fun, I will read some articles from WeChat, you know, such like Mimeng, the biggest wanghong in China, yeah.

1876
02:51:41,118 --> 02:51:44,980
Her article will publish about every day and there will

1877
02:51:45,700 --> 02:51:54,648
maybe more than 1 million readers to read it every day so it is quite a popular online magazine for me.

1878
02:51:54,948 --> 02:52:02,095
So she just introduced the paid magazine online so if it's like professional content people are still willing to pay even

1879
02:52:02,535 --> 02:52:08,457
the one article from the one magazine, and she also mentioned there's some very popular writers.

1880
02:52:08,757 --> 02:52:22,021
So in Chinese it's called Wang Hong, literally means Internet Red, which indicates that it's very popular among people, and people just follow them and got millions and millions readership of everyday articles.

1881
02:52:22,281 --> 02:52:24,602
So that is, I think, daily live reading.

1882
02:52:25,482 --> 02:52:32,204
Nowadays, for the young people, you know, China, we have a policy called one child only.

1883
02:52:32,884 --> 02:52:35,845
Yeah, that's why I think I'm the one of it.

1884
02:52:36,706 --> 02:52:40,647
So I think it's quite lonely for my daily life.

1885
02:52:41,607 --> 02:52:45,090
after work or after social life.

1886
02:52:45,450 --> 02:52:57,438
I think I'm quite lonely, so I will always check the WeChat and see some articles like the common things.

1887
02:52:57,818 --> 02:52:58,959
We will discuss it.

1888
02:52:59,459 --> 02:53:03,461
Yeah, and I think this is what we call the interaction.

1889
02:53:04,422 --> 02:53:07,044
So it's more about like two-way communication.

1890
02:53:07,344 --> 02:53:15,650
Traditional magazine you just read it, there's no feedback, but online you can like it or you can make your comment or even give tips.

1891
02:53:16,051 --> 02:53:25,177
So it's more welcoming, encouraging readers to participate the whole process of the re-reading experience of magazine.

1892
02:53:26,118 --> 02:53:28,201
On the internet, you will read all those articles.

1893
02:53:28,221 --> 02:53:33,266
It's more like you're self-responsible, you're self-sponsored.

1894
02:53:33,466 --> 02:53:35,989
Everybody can express what they are thinking.

1895
02:53:36,109 --> 02:53:40,013
When a magazine is printed, the writer should be more serious.

1896
02:53:40,754 --> 02:53:43,037
They will be responsible to whatever they said.

1897
02:53:43,497 --> 02:53:45,200
So that's very, very important.

1898
02:53:45,300 --> 02:53:48,845
When you open this kind of paper magazine, you read it, it's printed.

1899
02:53:48,985 --> 02:53:50,928
It cannot be cancelled.

1900
02:53:51,028 --> 02:53:52,810
It cannot be, you know, drawback.

1901
02:53:53,672 --> 02:53:57,897
So this writer will be really, really serious about whatever they say.

1902
02:53:58,298 --> 02:54:09,247
And one of the reasons why I stopped buying magazines is because I found one magazine has 20 or 30 articles, but I can't finish it in maybe three months.

1903
02:54:09,667 --> 02:54:14,971
So I want to ask the first question is, did you really read every article of every magazine?

1904
02:54:15,292 --> 02:54:16,092
Okay, that's it.

1905
02:54:17,133 --> 02:54:22,878
Okay, because I pretty much read every single page of the magazine.

1906
02:54:23,278 --> 02:54:34,369
sometimes we'll buy some fashion magazines like Vogue or really as well and I will buy maybe a huge outfit maybe yeah 2020s yeah decoration

1907
02:54:39,974 --> 02:54:40,735
It's quite useful.

1908
02:54:41,015 --> 02:54:50,081
We put it in like a stage and we use it as a desk maybe sometimes.

1909
02:54:50,141 --> 02:54:58,166
Because it's a very very nice design so it's like even it's quite cheap for something really nice decoration.

1910
02:54:58,226 --> 02:54:59,447
It costs money as well.

1911
02:55:04,033 --> 02:55:12,042
Will magazines in China become accessories left around on coffee tables to decorate the homes of well-off families?

1912
02:55:12,903 --> 02:55:15,466
Or do they have a more significant future?

1913
02:55:16,487 --> 02:55:24,857
The printed versions are certainly facing many challenges, from losing readership to close scrutiny by the Chinese government.

1914
02:55:26,446 --> 02:55:30,290
to find one place which is looking positively about the future.

1915
02:55:30,730 --> 02:55:40,340
I'm heading to a quite suburb of Beijing to visit a very specialized coffee shop where magazines from all over the world line the shelves.

1916
02:55:41,021 --> 02:55:44,224
And they are not just decoration, they are being read.

1917
02:55:51,833 --> 02:55:57,699
So Mr. Yin just told me that actually there's not many places like this.

1918
02:55:57,819 --> 02:56:05,528
It's quite a small number of the bookshops where you can find foreign magazines, the latest issues.

1919
02:56:06,729 --> 02:56:09,012
There's several challenges, for example in China

1920
02:56:09,072 --> 02:56:15,780
there's of course the limits that whether you can sell those magazines and a lot of the control of it.

1921
02:56:16,621 --> 02:56:24,611
But he comes from the background of the design and publication background, so he has been in this field for more than 10 years.

1922
02:56:25,492 --> 02:56:35,822
So he definitely has these links and networks which really help him to introduce these nice magazines or books for Chinese readers.

1923
02:56:36,202 --> 02:56:50,255
And also the idea of this bookshop is not only for the professionals that allow them to catch up the newest trend, but also for ordinary Chinese readers that you just enter this bookshop and

1924
02:56:51,236 --> 02:56:58,946
Maybe in some ways it will improve your taste, so you have some idea of the better lifestyle.

1925
02:56:59,326 --> 02:57:01,729
So that is really his wish for this workshop.

1926
02:57:07,055 --> 02:57:17,764
He just told me that actually it's become the safe place for people who love paper maxing and they will come here to read paper maxing regularly.

1927
02:57:18,224 --> 02:57:26,691
And some professionals, they saw that how wonderful maxing can be and he told me some of them even thinking about to

1928
02:57:28,073 --> 02:57:45,631
set up their own Maxine but of course it's very difficult especially nowadays China everybody go for internet and maybe it's easier to get like first or second issue and then you just can't continue but still you think people see this place of the hope.

1929
02:57:46,212 --> 02:57:48,374
Let me show you how wonderful Maxine can be.

1930
02:57:51,373 --> 02:57:58,491
For the BBC World Service in Beijing, I'm Xinyuan Wang, and today's program was produced by Mark Rickards.

1931
02:58:08,343 --> 02:58:12,544
This is the BBC World Service, where now, here's Harriet Gilbert.

1932
02:58:13,205 --> 02:58:22,007
On this month's World Book Club, I'll be talking to Richard Flanagan about his Man Booker Prize winning novel, The Narrow Road to the Deep North.

1933
02:58:22,167 --> 02:58:30,930
It was something that grew in me like a boulder till it was almost choking me and I felt I had to write it.

1934
02:58:30,970 --> 02:58:36,192
World Book Club at bbcworldservice.com slash worldbookclub.

1935
02:58:38,921 --> 02:58:41,422
And in 30 minutes, ocean stories.

1936
02:58:41,682 --> 02:58:45,004
The Arctic Ocean is warming at an extraordinary rate.

1937
02:58:45,104 --> 02:58:49,727
But what does that mean for the wildlife and the people that rely on these waters?

1938
02:58:50,207 --> 02:58:56,550
I'm Liz Bonnen, and I'll bring you ocean stories diving into the icy depths of the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

1939
02:58:57,010 --> 02:59:02,113
Next today, it's hard talk on the BBC World Service, the world's radio station.

1940
02:59:08,105 --> 02:59:13,352
Coming up after the news on the BBC World Service, it's Hard Talk with me, Stephen Sacker.

1941
02:59:13,472 --> 02:59:18,219
In this age of the internet, we've come to expect instant access to knowledge.

1942
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:23,887
But real, deep understanding takes longer to acquire and to share.

1943
02:59:24,087 --> 02:59:29,989
My guest today is one of the world's most acclaimed novelists, Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk.

1944
02:59:30,089 --> 02:59:41,252
He's lived almost all of his life in Istanbul, writing stories about Turkey, which have, over decades, painted a vivid picture of a country and society pulled between East and West.

1945
02:59:41,572 --> 02:59:43,013
past and future.

1946
02:59:43,093 --> 02:59:47,355
What is the key to understanding Orhan Pamuk's Turkey?

1947
02:59:47,515 --> 02:59:55,059
We have a lot of repression, a lot of suppression, people self-censor, but people self-censor in interviews, in political comments.

1948
02:59:55,099 --> 03:00:02,883
You'll go fast to jail if you criticize the government too much, if you attack Erdogan too much, you may end up in a jail.

1949
03:00:03,343 --> 03:00:06,425
That's Orhan Pamuk on Hard Talk after the news.

1950
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:10,402
BBC News, hello, I'm Gareth Barlow.

1951
03:00:11,082 --> 03:00:11,863
Senior U.S.

1952
03:00:11,903 --> 03:00:17,048
officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

1953
03:00:17,068 --> 03:00:23,393
He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

1954
03:00:23,893 --> 03:00:25,855
The decision will break with years of U.S.

1955
03:00:25,895 --> 03:00:30,399
policy on the status of the disputed city, as well as the international consensus.

1956
03:00:30,919 --> 03:00:32,501
Barbara Platusha is in Washington.

1957
03:00:33,003 --> 03:00:40,910
Not only is Jerusalem disputed by Israel and the Palestinians, both claim it as their capital, it's also holy to Muslims and Christians, as well as Jews.

1958
03:00:41,691 --> 03:00:48,497
Jordan and Saudi Arabia are custodians of Islam's holy sites, and have issued strong warnings that this move could inflame the Muslim world.

1959
03:00:49,278 --> 03:00:56,845
Administration officials insisted that the decision would not affect the status of the holy sites, nor determine issues like boundaries and sovereignty.

1960
03:00:57,505 --> 03:01:06,042
They said Mr Trump had had detailed discussions with Arab leaders, that he remained committed to facilitating a peace deal, and that he was optimistic it was in reach.

1961
03:01:06,925 --> 03:01:14,407
Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban it from next February's Winter Olympics in South Korea.

1962
03:01:14,947 --> 03:01:21,009
A damning report by the IOC said there had been an unprecedented systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system.

1963
03:01:21,489 --> 03:01:23,489
From Moscow, here's Steve Rosenberg.

1964
03:01:23,970 --> 03:01:28,731
The deputy speaker of Russia's parliament said it was a humiliation and an insult to Russia.

1965
03:01:29,591 --> 03:01:41,233
In a defiant post in social media, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said Russia would survive this like it survived World War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Western sanctions.

1966
03:01:42,254 --> 03:01:51,595
Although the Russian team has been banned from competing in South Korea, Russian athletes who can prove they are clean will be permitted to participate under the Olympic flag.

1967
03:01:52,316 --> 03:01:54,036
But will the Kremlin allow them to?

1968
03:01:54,756 --> 03:02:00,002
Vladimir Putin has in the past described such a scenario as a humiliation for his country.

1969
03:02:00,703 --> 03:02:05,748
Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

1970
03:02:06,308 --> 03:02:12,255
One fire, which broke out in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, has trebled in size in just a few hours.

1971
03:02:12,755 --> 03:02:17,080
At least 150 buildings, including a mental hospital, have been destroyed.

1972
03:02:18,172 --> 03:02:23,216
Three men in Malta have been charged with murdering the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.

1973
03:02:23,716 --> 03:02:25,858
She was killed in a car bomb attack in October.

1974
03:02:26,298 --> 03:02:29,941
The case has shocked the small Mediterranean island and the European Union.

1975
03:02:30,442 --> 03:02:37,747
The three accused men, Alfred and Giorgio and Vince Muscat, were among 10 arrested on Monday in connection with the killing.

1976
03:02:38,128 --> 03:02:39,529
They have pleaded not guilty.

1977
03:02:39,929 --> 03:02:42,271
Local media say all three were known to the police.

1978
03:02:43,242 --> 03:02:47,523
A military operation in Western Cameroon has led to hundreds of people fleeing their villages.

1979
03:02:48,003 --> 03:02:55,285
The exodus comes after the government pledged to retaliate against an armed group that wants independence for the country's two English-speaking regions.

1980
03:02:55,945 --> 03:03:02,366
Most people in Cameroon speak French, and many in the English-speaking minority feel they are being discriminated against.

1981
03:03:03,546 --> 03:03:05,507
World News from the BBC.

1982
03:03:07,862 --> 03:03:15,109
A new report says about 15,000 people a day are being forced to flee their homes in African conflict and disaster zones.

1983
03:03:15,890 --> 03:03:25,039
Figures published by the Norwegian Refugee Council and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre show that more than 12 million people in Africa are internally displaced.

1984
03:03:25,540 --> 03:03:27,902
Nearly 4 million left their homes last year.

1985
03:03:29,383 --> 03:03:37,032
Britain's most prestigious contemporary art award, the Turner Prize, has been won by an art professor who was born in Zanzibar, Lubaina Hameed.

1986
03:03:37,452 --> 03:03:42,758
Professor Hameed is the first black woman and, at 63, the oldest person to win the award.

1987
03:03:43,238 --> 03:03:48,444
The chair of the judges, Alex Farquharson, said Lubaina Hameed's work had particular relevance today.

1988
03:03:48,864 --> 03:04:02,647
It is a moment in time in the art world where maybe people are a little bit less obsessed with youth, and particularly interested in looking at the overlooked achievements of what is often older women artists or artists of colour, who are maybe making a different kind of work.

1989
03:04:03,548 --> 03:04:09,749
And France's biggest rock star, Johnny Alliday, has died aged 74 after a battle with lung cancer.

1990
03:04:10,109 --> 03:04:12,850
The BBC's Emma-Jane Kirby looks back at his life.

1991
03:04:18,068 --> 03:04:22,310
It was a career that spanned five decades and three generations.

1992
03:04:22,750 --> 03:04:32,315
Born as plain Jean-Philippe Smet, Johnny Halliday first hit the limelight aged 16 as an Elvis wannabe who sang rock in French.

1993
03:04:33,096 --> 03:04:35,257
His early concerts caused riots.

1994
03:04:35,757 --> 03:04:40,460
The then French president Charles de Gaulle accused him of being a corruptor of youth.

1995
03:04:43,395 --> 03:04:47,056
Most rock and roll stars, Johnny's life had its ups and downs.

1996
03:04:47,516 --> 03:04:58,498
For nearly 50 years, France's gossip and celebrity magazines were full of the details of his three failed marriages, his tax evasion scandals and his cocaine addiction.

1997
03:04:59,138 --> 03:05:03,459
But his fans remained loyal and his concerts were always sellouts.

1998
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:05,480
BBC News.

1999
03:05:08,660 --> 03:05:12,901
Welcome to Hard Talk on the BBC World Service with me, Stephen Sacker.

2000
03:05:13,061 --> 03:05:16,961
My guest today is one of the most acclaimed novelists in the world today.

2001
03:05:17,482 --> 03:05:37,585
Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk has perfected the trick of rooting his stories deep in the history, culture, and geography of his native Turkey, in particular, his beloved home city of Istanbul, but giving them a humanity, depth, and resonance which strikes a chord with readers all over the world.

2002
03:05:38,045 --> 03:05:40,726
His novels are translated into scores of languages.

2003
03:05:40,806 --> 03:05:44,768
He's been bestowed with a glittering array of international literary prizes.

2004
03:05:45,168 --> 03:05:48,790
But still he lives in the same neighborhood in which he was born.

2005
03:05:49,270 --> 03:05:52,172
But life hasn't always been easy for him in Turkey.

2006
03:05:52,592 --> 03:05:59,475
After one outburst against the government in 2005, he received death threats and he still appears in public with a bodyguard.

2007
03:05:59,935 --> 03:06:03,898
And the pressure on writers has increased in Turkey.

2008
03:06:04,258 --> 03:06:13,806
President Erdogan's government has locked up scores of writers, academics and journalists as politics has become more polarised and the state more repressive.

2009
03:06:14,106 --> 03:06:26,436
The constant tension between East and West secularism and religiosity, liberalism and authoritarianism has put enormous pressure on Turkey's most prominent creative voices.

2010
03:06:26,876 --> 03:06:29,198
So how has Orhan Pamuk responded?

2011
03:06:29,738 --> 03:06:32,260
Well, I'm delighted to say he's with me now.

2012
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:33,921
Welcome to Hard Talk.

2013
03:06:34,121 --> 03:06:34,982
Very pleased to be here.

2014
03:06:35,522 --> 03:06:42,046
I want to start with the book, the novel that's just been published in English, The Red-Haired Woman, your latest.

2015
03:06:42,107 --> 03:06:48,231
It is built around relationships between fathers and sons.

2016
03:06:48,391 --> 03:06:51,473
And I just wonder why you were so drawn to that theme.

2017
03:06:51,833 --> 03:07:03,441
In 1988, I was finishing one of my novels during summer, and in the land next to me, an oldish man and his disciple started digging a well.

2018
03:07:03,821 --> 03:07:06,223
And I was writing my novel and paying attention to them.

2019
03:07:06,603 --> 03:07:09,465
After a while, they asked, sir, can we have some water?

2020
03:07:09,805 --> 03:07:11,026
Can we have some electricity?

2021
03:07:11,246 --> 03:07:12,727
This sort of relation developed.

2022
03:07:13,307 --> 03:07:17,210
And in the end, before they left, I asked them to do an interview.

2023
03:07:17,230 --> 03:07:18,891
That's how sometimes I operate.

2024
03:07:19,151 --> 03:07:22,392
But what stayed with me was two things, actually.

2025
03:07:23,232 --> 03:07:30,335
The father-like, older, traditional verdigr, and they were digging a well with their own hands, using an axe.

2026
03:07:30,355 --> 03:07:32,575
So he was like the master well digger.

2027
03:07:32,615 --> 03:07:34,236
He was a master well digger.

2028
03:07:34,716 --> 03:07:39,118
It's something that we have in Istanbul since Byzantium.

2029
03:07:39,498 --> 03:07:43,559
Sometimes people find Byzantium coins in old wells in Istanbul.

2030
03:07:43,879 --> 03:07:46,040
So they were following this tradition.

2031
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:50,944
as the tradition was coming to an end, like many, many things I have seen in my life.

2032
03:07:51,484 --> 03:08:06,616
So, and what I observed was this, that the master, old Veldiger, was shouting and shouting at the boy, and sometimes teaching him things, ordering him things, in a very strong, I would say, authoritarian voice.

2033
03:08:06,776 --> 03:08:08,677
So, we approached the novel fast.

2034
03:08:08,978 --> 03:08:13,381
At that time, I didn't think it was, it was rough, hard, cruel, a cruel father, I thought.

2035
03:08:13,841 --> 03:08:14,061
But,

2036
03:08:14,882 --> 03:08:18,486
Contrary, I also paid attention to their daily lives.

2037
03:08:18,586 --> 03:08:30,280
They had a portable TV as in the novel, they built a tent as in the novel, but the fatherly figure was both scolding, angry, cruel, authoritarian, but

2038
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:38,986
at times, after hours, after when the work is finished, very tender, very attentive, very elegant to the son.

2039
03:08:39,407 --> 03:08:50,775
And this left a mark on me because perhaps I was raised with an absent father, a father who never scolded me, who was never a Freudian, so to speak, father to me.

2040
03:08:50,915 --> 03:08:51,736
And why was that?

2041
03:08:51,816 --> 03:09:08,688
because it did strike me from the very beginning knowing a little about your life story that when you address this issue of fathers and sons the balance between sort of being the guide and the authority figure but also the caring and loving figure and it was obvious that the son liked him in the end

2042
03:09:08,768 --> 03:09:18,440
Indeed, but you didn't have that because your father, as I understand it, he quit the family home in Istanbul for a long period to go and try and find his writer's voice.

2043
03:09:18,500 --> 03:09:19,241
He would disappear for a while.

2044
03:09:19,281 --> 03:09:19,701
He went to Paris.

2045
03:09:19,721 --> 03:09:27,090
Yes, he went to Paris following footsteps of Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris, hotels, he wrote diaries which he gave me.

2046
03:09:27,331 --> 03:09:28,232
Did you feel betrayed?

2047
03:09:28,612 --> 03:09:31,834
No, and when you're a child, you don't feel betrayed.

2048
03:09:32,134 --> 03:09:43,842
Also, since my father was not a Freudian father, a father that perhaps Baudelaire would have hated, oppressing his son, he always said, I'm your best friend.

2049
03:09:44,422 --> 03:09:50,128
And, in fact, my Freudian father may be my brother who taught me things, who was stronger.

2050
03:09:50,408 --> 03:09:58,917
My father always had fun with us, and he treated us as if we are me and my brother geniuses, and never suppressed us.

2051
03:09:59,458 --> 03:10:04,643
While, on the other hand, this other father was more attentive to the boy than my father.

2052
03:10:04,843 --> 03:10:21,644
See, your book raises this fascinating question about the way in which individuals develop, the balance between being taught and disciplined and finding your own path, your own identity and individual personality.

2053
03:10:22,384 --> 03:10:24,086
You seem to suggest that if

2054
03:10:24,927 --> 03:10:31,130
The character in the book, Jem, had had an active father throughout his life.

2055
03:10:31,651 --> 03:10:35,853
He might have been different and he might actually have struggled to find his own voice more.

2056
03:10:35,953 --> 03:10:38,194
And I wonder if you feel that about your very self.

2057
03:10:39,175 --> 03:10:52,602
I was influenced by my father first because he had a good library when he was continuously reading books but never telling me that you have to read this, you have to read that, just being an example without doing anything.

2058
03:10:53,242 --> 03:11:10,505
And also, my father's, this is more important, my father's heroes were not, as in most of the time, as in Turkey, soldiers, police, religious notables, political notables, statemen, but my father's heroes were Jean Paul Sartre and Albert Camus or others.

2059
03:11:11,025 --> 03:11:20,127
other fashionable but deep philosophical authors of the time and I thought I have to be like that but he never said to me you have to be like that.

2060
03:11:20,147 --> 03:11:34,210
It seems to me all Orhan Pamuk novels work on many different levels and many of them are somewhat allegorical and it seems to me this relationship between the well digger and his apprentice who sees him as a father figure for the absent father that he never really had

2061
03:11:34,970 --> 03:11:46,977
It is also an allegory, it seems, for Turkey and a desire in Turkey to look up to a figure of authority and the balance between individualism and authoritarianism in your country.

2062
03:11:47,057 --> 03:11:53,120
And today you have President Erdogan, who perhaps would like to see himself as the father of the nation.

2063
03:11:53,440 --> 03:11:56,562
Was that in your mind as you wrote this book about fathers?

2064
03:11:56,682 --> 03:12:04,325
At the beginning, it was not in my mind that this story of fathers and sons stayed with me many, many years.

2065
03:12:04,706 --> 03:12:09,848
Then I thought about it, and I have, I must confess, projects like that all around me.

2066
03:12:10,288 --> 03:12:17,012
I did the interview, someone typed it up, and I carried it with me as I do, even in my travels, thinking what to do with it.

2067
03:12:17,732 --> 03:12:37,045
Then, after a while, I decided to write a book comparing Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, which is about killing the father without knowing it, and Firdevsi, the famous, the most distinguished Persian classic, which also influenced the whole Ottoman Empire.

2068
03:12:37,446 --> 03:12:40,448
Firdevsi is called Book of Kings, Shahnameh.

2069
03:12:41,548 --> 03:12:54,074
which is a sea of stories, in which there is one particular story, Ruslam and Sohrab, which almost mirror images, mirror reflects Oedipus and his father.

2070
03:12:54,094 --> 03:13:01,798
You have a Western classic sort of myth, which is the son killing the father by accident, and then you have an Eastern Persian

2071
03:13:02,458 --> 03:13:08,823
similarly, a sort of mythical story in which in the end a father kills a son.

2072
03:13:08,843 --> 03:13:26,395
Would it be right to say that what you portray is, and again a lot of allegory is involved, but you use these two myths, one that comes classically from the West, one that comes from Persia and the East, you show the way that both play out in this story of the characters in your book.

2073
03:13:27,315 --> 03:13:38,503
And in essence, what you seem to be saying is that Turkey remains pulled in these different directions, Western tradition, Eastern tradition, somehow finding a path between the two.

2074
03:13:38,864 --> 03:13:52,574
But is it your feeling that right now, the Eastern tradition, to use the allegories, the father kills the son, the authority figure is the survivor, is that your feeling about Turkey today?

2075
03:13:53,694 --> 03:13:59,396
Now, to answer your previous question, where you said, is this an accident, coincidence, that you wrote this?

2076
03:13:59,496 --> 03:13:59,696
No.

2077
03:14:00,157 --> 03:14:01,297
The story stayed with me.

2078
03:14:01,577 --> 03:14:13,422
But I thought, my God, then associating the father who kills his son, then I can also write this book in such a way that alludes to what's happening in Turkey.

2079
03:14:13,762 --> 03:14:17,403
Yes, Turkey is increasingly getting authoritarian.

2080
03:14:17,883 --> 03:14:19,184
Though I had this story

2081
03:14:19,924 --> 03:14:26,511
the well-digger and his disciple, a desire to compare Sophocles and Ferdowsi.

2082
03:14:26,851 --> 03:14:42,347
But yes, in the last two years, when I was busy with this book, I was thinking also, I am alluding and writing almost a fictional inquiry into the roots of Middle Eastern, Asian, Muslim authoritarianism.

2083
03:14:42,787 --> 03:15:01,221
Orhan Pamuk, let's be honest, do you have to write in this form of allegory and almost code, because if you wrote directly about what you see happening in Turkey today, you would run the risk of, frankly, censorship, repression, and as we've seen with some writers, even imprisonment.

2084
03:15:01,361 --> 03:15:02,102
Good question.

2085
03:15:02,322 --> 03:15:09,728
I never had, even in this horrible state that we are politically in, and maybe I'll explain why horrible, I'm calling it horrible,

2086
03:15:10,709 --> 03:15:29,622
You know, everyone knows that some 15 months ago there was a horrible attempt to do a military coup, then after that came a purge, and during the purge 130,000 people were fired from their jobs, and these people cannot go back to their work, and some of them even cannot work in private business.

2087
03:15:30,082 --> 03:15:34,564
have hundreds of journalists, writers, academics locked up.

2088
03:15:35,024 --> 03:15:46,648
And 50,000 people are jailed and the government needs more prisons and they're announcing their thing and around 180 or 70 journalists are in jail.

2089
03:15:46,668 --> 03:15:50,889
This is the situation of the country and I'm writing my novel in this situation.

2090
03:15:51,129 --> 03:15:52,730
But even in this situation

2091
03:15:53,190 --> 03:15:56,573
I don't think I will ever have a problem with any novel that I want.

2092
03:15:56,833 --> 03:16:00,136
This never happened to me in Turkey, nor to anyone.

2093
03:16:00,677 --> 03:16:02,338
But you will have... Why is that?

2094
03:16:02,418 --> 03:16:03,960
Is it because you self-censor?

2095
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:05,541
Is it because you are so careful?

2096
03:16:11,306 --> 03:16:23,011
selecting your subject matter, your characters and your words with a knowledge of how to sort of send messages without upsetting the system.

2097
03:16:23,031 --> 03:16:23,571
No, it's not.

2098
03:16:23,931 --> 03:16:30,714
If I want to send messages like that, as we are going to do now, I am always outspoken in my interviews.

2099
03:16:30,774 --> 03:16:39,457
And when we said 170 journalists are in jail, some of them my friends, and they are also novelists.

2100
03:16:40,137 --> 03:16:43,518
But they are not in jail for writing their novels.

2101
03:16:43,859 --> 03:16:46,820
They're in jail for making political commentary.

2102
03:16:47,260 --> 03:17:00,005
Writing novels, say, in Stalin's time in Russia, we have a lot of repression, a lot of suppression, people self-censor, but people self-censor in interviews, in political comments.

2103
03:17:00,045 --> 03:17:07,768
You'll go fast to jail if you criticize the government too much, if you attack Erdogan too much, you may end up in a jail.

2104
03:17:08,108 --> 03:17:12,311
But I never intend to write a novel attacking a president.

2105
03:17:13,332 --> 03:17:16,094
I never wrote actuality, so to speak.

2106
03:17:16,675 --> 03:17:21,198
So in no sense do you feel creatively paralyzed by the current situation?

2107
03:17:21,298 --> 03:17:23,100
I'm paralyzed, if the word is right.

2108
03:17:23,260 --> 03:17:26,883
I'm repressed, angry, confused.

2109
03:17:26,983 --> 03:17:30,446
Sometimes I feel guilty because I'm out.

2110
03:17:30,526 --> 03:17:31,967
Sometimes I feel angry.

2111
03:17:32,007 --> 03:17:33,188
I have to do more.

2112
03:17:33,568 --> 03:17:35,950
Sometimes... Do you actually literally feel guilty that

2113
03:17:35,990 --> 03:17:39,712
that you are free when some of your writer colleagues are in prison.

2114
03:17:39,852 --> 03:17:46,837
Dostoevsky said that we are responsible for everything, you know, and I think this is the moral writerly thing.

2115
03:17:47,277 --> 03:17:48,057
And then what do you do?

2116
03:17:48,098 --> 03:17:51,059
You look at what the other writers doing in people.

2117
03:17:51,380 --> 03:17:56,523
So there, for example, going to courts, the doors of the courts, or backing, or

2118
03:17:57,143 --> 03:18:01,966
I also did, for example, there is this prominent intellectual, Murat Belget, whom I respect.

2119
03:18:02,226 --> 03:18:03,727
He had a case, so I went there.

2120
03:18:03,747 --> 03:18:06,948
You know, prominent Pamuk is there, so it makes a difference.

2121
03:18:07,229 --> 03:18:09,990
But in the end, this is... Let me tell you this.

2122
03:18:10,250 --> 03:18:18,515
The biggest Turkish newspaper, just before the referendum we had, I think in March or April, asked to do an interview with me.

2123
03:18:18,555 --> 03:18:20,255
Now, I was very happy.

2124
03:18:20,356 --> 03:18:24,478
This is the biggest Turkish newspaper, and they're going to publish my views, and I'm going to say

2125
03:18:25,178 --> 03:18:27,718
no to the referendum, no to Erdogan.

2126
03:18:27,819 --> 03:18:28,259
Very happy.

2127
03:18:28,599 --> 03:18:37,420
We did a nice interview, but then just before the interview, the editor-in-chief, who is a sort of a friend, called me to say, I'm sorry, we can't publish this.

2128
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:41,081
And really, I cannot accuse the editor too much.

2129
03:18:41,381 --> 03:18:42,581
They're pressured so much.

2130
03:18:42,801 --> 03:18:44,381
And in the end, they're all my friends.

2131
03:18:44,722 --> 03:18:46,422
We are in the same atmosphere.

2132
03:18:46,762 --> 03:18:49,542
And I couldn't address my Turkish readers.

2133
03:18:50,022 --> 03:18:52,363
Therefore, what fascinates me is that you

2134
03:18:53,283 --> 03:19:09,182
This atmosphere you talk about is so constraining when it comes to your public voice as a campaigner as a man who cares about your your national life And yet you're telling me that all of those constraints the anger that you feel the guilt that you feel doesn't affect

2135
03:19:09,582 --> 03:19:23,434
you when you go to your writing room, wherever it is, I know it's in Istanbul, it's in the building that you've occupied for a long time, you go to your writing room and you can shed all of that frustration and that anger and that feeling of constraint and write as free as a bird?

2136
03:19:23,855 --> 03:19:33,083
Not as free as a bird, but let me tell you what the products of this repressive authoritarian air to a writer who is more concerned about the beauty.

2137
03:19:33,843 --> 03:19:39,786
First, you shouldn't read newspapers till 2 o'clock because it spoils your day, you get angry.

2138
03:19:40,606 --> 03:19:46,209
Second, this kind of atmosphere of fear and repression makes me work harder.

2139
03:19:46,949 --> 03:19:55,733
I work harder, just perhaps like in my early years when my family didn't want me a writer and they all accused of me, maybe you're a bohemian, what?

2140
03:19:56,653 --> 03:20:00,955
I worked so hard in these years because I felt guilty about something.

2141
03:20:01,375 --> 03:20:06,181
Again, in the last 15, 16 months, I'm working a lot.

2142
03:20:06,361 --> 03:20:06,681
Why?

2143
03:20:06,862 --> 03:20:08,544
Perhaps to avoid these problems.

2144
03:20:08,804 --> 03:20:17,073
And also, if you write well, even if you're living in a terribly undemocratic, threatening, menacing situation, you feel happy.

2145
03:20:17,454 --> 03:20:21,078
Could you write your books anywhere else but Istanbul?

2146
03:20:21,398 --> 03:20:21,778
I can.

2147
03:20:21,959 --> 03:20:22,499
I did that.

2148
03:20:22,599 --> 03:20:25,462
I'm teaching at Columbia University one semester each year.

2149
03:20:25,662 --> 03:20:33,630
I wrote there and there was a time that I was, remember we also did an interview ten years ago, I was almost a semi-exile.

2150
03:20:33,690 --> 03:20:40,456
You ran into a lot of problems for a while because of things you'd said which were relevant to both the Armenia and Kurdish issues.

2151
03:20:41,617 --> 03:20:44,098
The Turkish government sought to charge you for a while.

2152
03:20:44,158 --> 03:20:45,039
You had to leave the country.

2153
03:20:45,359 --> 03:20:50,501
But it seems to me you always go, in the end, you always go home for creative inspiration.

2154
03:20:50,661 --> 03:20:50,841
Yes.

2155
03:20:51,041 --> 03:20:57,704
Not only that, I also don't want to go to Europe or America and criticize it from distance.

2156
03:20:57,784 --> 03:20:58,544
I don't want that.

2157
03:20:58,844 --> 03:21:00,225
And also there is a reality.

2158
03:21:00,585 --> 03:21:03,346
a reality that feeds my optimism.

2159
03:21:03,386 --> 03:21:05,807
I'll tell you about it perhaps.

2160
03:21:06,107 --> 03:21:11,629
Don't forget that Erdogan's bloc's votes are going down, and the opposition got 49%.

2161
03:21:12,489 --> 03:21:18,711
I am optimistic about the situation, not because there is so much repression, so much repression.

2162
03:21:19,191 --> 03:21:28,214
Also, in the last referendum, I think the referendum was unfair, that is, there was unfair government propaganda.

2163
03:21:28,654 --> 03:21:33,439
In a way, they were taking our tax money and making propaganda for their party.

2164
03:21:33,820 --> 03:21:36,422
But in the end, the results were objective.

2165
03:21:37,103 --> 03:21:40,527
Though it was unfair, the result was objective.

2166
03:21:40,987 --> 03:21:44,571
And if they continue to keep the voting ballot there, I'm there.

2167
03:21:44,691 --> 03:21:45,212
I'm going to come.

2168
03:21:45,432 --> 03:21:46,233
I'll be part of it.

2169
03:21:46,373 --> 03:21:47,494
This is how I think.

2170
03:21:48,497 --> 03:21:58,525
Let me get back to one aspect of this book, The Red-Haired Woman, that again just strikes me as very relevant to your own place in Turkey.

2171
03:21:59,345 --> 03:22:10,334
The key relationship really in the book is between Mahmut the welder, the master welder, and Cem, the assistant who's a student and who comes from a westernized family.

2172
03:22:10,394 --> 03:22:15,538
His father's a leftist and he goes to university and he becomes a property developer.

2173
03:22:15,798 --> 03:22:23,868
So you've got East and you've got tradition juxtaposed with a Western mentality and individualistic liberal sort of background.

2174
03:22:24,669 --> 03:22:34,102
Most people would assume that you yourself, coming from an upper middle class family, as you say, spending time in America, an acclaimed writer, a secularist and a

2175
03:22:34,923 --> 03:22:36,885
you know, a modernist in Turkey.

2176
03:22:37,186 --> 03:22:41,091
Most would assume that you identify completely with the Western tradition in Turkey.

2177
03:22:41,111 --> 03:22:41,472
I do.

2178
03:22:41,792 --> 03:22:42,093
Do you?

2179
03:22:42,213 --> 03:22:47,781
Because the implication of the book is that Turkey draws from all of its history and culture and its different traditions.

2180
03:22:47,801 --> 03:22:49,063
So I wonder what you draw

2181
03:22:49,583 --> 03:22:50,424
from tradition.

2182
03:22:50,764 --> 03:22:54,869
I identify, I believe in Western political values.

2183
03:22:54,909 --> 03:22:55,469
What are they?

2184
03:22:56,150 --> 03:23:02,697
In the end, it's represented by French Revolution slogan, Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.

2185
03:23:03,978 --> 03:23:05,980
In Turkey, we lack Liberté.

2186
03:23:06,861 --> 03:23:19,030
And some people even claim that in pro-government newspapers they are saying, well, our democracy is not European democracy, we are inventing Turkish democracy, let me add.

2187
03:23:20,231 --> 03:23:24,494
It seems that they're trying to invent a democracy without free speech.

2188
03:23:24,555 --> 03:23:26,716
I don't think it will work, but I'm there.

2189
03:23:26,936 --> 03:23:32,701
I am at least saying this to you, to other journalists in Turkey, outside of Turkey.

2190
03:23:32,961 --> 03:23:35,603
In Turkey they don't print, but they listen somehow.

2191
03:23:35,923 --> 03:23:37,303
Let me talk to you about Istanbul.

2192
03:23:38,023 --> 03:23:45,945
Again, it's almost like it's a character in the book because you describe evocatively how Istanbul changes over 40 years.

2193
03:23:45,965 --> 03:23:50,106
You know, where they dig the well in the first place is a little village outside the city.

2194
03:23:50,146 --> 03:23:51,966
By the end of the book, it's just another suburb.

2195
03:23:51,986 --> 03:23:52,867
Swallowed by the city.

2196
03:23:52,947 --> 03:23:58,608
Sucked up by the city with its industrial zones and its high-rises and its condos and everything else.

2197
03:24:00,030 --> 03:24:06,093
Has the change in Istanbul changed the people and the character of the city?

2198
03:24:06,113 --> 03:24:06,673
Good question.

2199
03:24:06,734 --> 03:24:17,659
OK, first, the change, and this is Erdogan's success, the change in last 15 years is bigger than the change in my first 50 years of my life.

2200
03:24:18,179 --> 03:24:28,325
That is, I also want to argue, especially to my Western journalist friend, key to his success, as much as religion is his success,

2201
03:24:29,185 --> 03:24:33,526
But on the other hand, this party is saying they're conservative, and they're not.

2202
03:24:33,746 --> 03:24:38,127
And besides, the religious buildings and mosques, they're not conserving anything, they're destroying everything.

2203
03:24:38,567 --> 03:24:50,430
The city had turned out to be a sea of baton, and I'd love to ask them, well, you were conservatives, and it's not only religious buildings that should be preserved.

2204
03:24:50,630 --> 03:24:53,651
Where is the old Istanbul you were so lovingly talking about?

2205
03:24:54,112 --> 03:25:07,808
There is also, this book is going into that, money and politics combined in construction businesses, and of course leading party, ruling party, people who are close around this benefit from these.

2206
03:25:09,390 --> 03:25:11,211
Do you feel it's still your city?

2207
03:25:11,231 --> 03:25:12,491
It is.

2208
03:25:12,711 --> 03:25:13,551
It's geographically.

2209
03:25:13,571 --> 03:25:14,612
It's my city.

2210
03:25:15,012 --> 03:25:16,632
I am looking at its entrance.

2211
03:25:16,752 --> 03:25:17,693
I have a great view.

2212
03:25:18,293 --> 03:25:19,393
It's changing, yes.

2213
03:25:20,273 --> 03:25:22,634
The hills overlooking Bosphorus, I see that now.

2214
03:25:22,754 --> 03:25:27,016
Behind them, they are preserving at least the hills overlooking Bosphorus, the gardens.

2215
03:25:27,256 --> 03:25:31,377
But behind them, all the high-rises are grazing there, and it's changing.

2216
03:25:31,697 --> 03:25:33,480
But I cannot say that it's not my city.

2217
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:42,232
Yes, also it's a self-imposed ethical mission that I don't want to be a nostalgic middle-class Turkish westernized secular.

2218
03:25:43,053 --> 03:25:45,697
They only look at the newcomers, immigrants.

2219
03:25:46,858 --> 03:25:47,639
you're destroying.

2220
03:25:48,379 --> 03:25:49,740
I don't want to even see you.

2221
03:25:50,141 --> 03:25:50,461
Why?

2222
03:25:50,761 --> 03:25:55,645
Just like in Germany, they need labour and also they look down upon them.

2223
03:25:56,086 --> 03:26:00,789
From the beginning, I didn't want to belong to my class.

2224
03:26:01,150 --> 03:26:07,174
I betrayed my class because I want to see the totality of the nation in an ethical way.

2225
03:26:07,234 --> 03:26:09,896
But only somebody of your class could say that sort of thing.

2226
03:26:09,917 --> 03:26:10,237
I mean,

2227
03:26:10,677 --> 03:26:18,263
That is the irony of being so full of self-awareness and education that you can talk about not wanting to be of your class.

2228
03:26:18,303 --> 03:26:19,964
You are quintessentially of your class.

2229
03:26:20,224 --> 03:26:28,630
And that's the problem, perhaps, for some people in Turkey, that however hard you try, you cannot help but be what you are, which is a member of the elite.

2230
03:26:29,531 --> 03:26:38,318
It started with Snow that, in that book, 65% of Turkey's population has not political, some kind of headgear, headscarf.

2231
03:26:39,138 --> 03:26:44,679
And even in early 2000s, they did not allow these people to universities.

2232
03:26:45,139 --> 03:26:49,260
And then they thought the secular parties, they would get votes from the people.

2233
03:26:49,681 --> 03:26:57,762
They paid way for the success of Erdogan's party, for their cruel, authoritarian attitudes.

2234
03:26:57,842 --> 03:27:01,743
Now, Erdogan is even more, getting even more authoritarian now.

2235
03:27:02,183 --> 03:27:08,445
But whenever, I sometimes argue, whenever these two sides clash, I can find a space in between

2236
03:27:08,725 --> 03:27:11,506
talk but if they're happy together I'm afraid.

2237
03:27:11,526 --> 03:27:14,788
Are you happy in Turkey today?

2238
03:27:15,248 --> 03:27:27,875
I am a happy novelist but I can first never be happy in life that when I'm too happy I begin sleeping you know I need to running around fight with some people I have ideas I have projects that to be realized

2239
03:27:28,575 --> 03:27:28,956
I am.

2240
03:27:29,276 --> 03:27:32,358
I will be even unhappier is the right answer.

2241
03:27:32,698 --> 03:27:36,961
That I may not be happy, but I will be even unhappier outside of Turkey.

2242
03:27:37,401 --> 03:27:43,926
If Turkey had a decent European democracy, I would be very happy, no matter where I am.

2243
03:27:44,306 --> 03:27:49,850
Unfortunately, it seems that we are not having it, and we are not going to have it for quite a long time.

2244
03:27:50,130 --> 03:27:59,722
because I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I persist staying in my country and be part of what's happening there now.

2245
03:28:00,903 --> 03:28:02,125
It's a great thought to end on.

2246
03:28:02,185 --> 03:28:05,028
Orhan Pamuk, thank you so much for being on Hard Talk.

2247
03:28:08,222 --> 03:28:12,125
This is the BBC World Service, where a family secret is shared.

2248
03:28:12,445 --> 03:28:16,328
I'd always believed that my father was a bureaucrat in the American State Department.

2249
03:28:16,548 --> 03:28:21,832
But one day when I was 18, he turned to me and he said, it's time I told you about the family business.

2250
03:28:22,672 --> 03:28:23,253
Espionage.

2251
03:28:28,022 --> 03:28:32,227
In the late 1960s, during the Vietnam War, the CIA sent him to Laos.

2252
03:28:32,267 --> 03:28:38,294
The troops are not regular Laotian soldiers, but members of a force trained and financed by the CIA.

2253
03:28:38,935 --> 03:28:40,536
But what was this covert mission about?

2254
03:28:40,677 --> 03:28:43,360
Bang Pao denies this success was due to America.

2255
03:28:46,207 --> 03:28:48,888
After my dad died, I decided to look for answers.

2256
03:28:48,928 --> 03:28:50,288
We weren't cold-hearted.

2257
03:28:50,588 --> 03:28:53,229
We were trying to help those folks and do anything we could for them.

2258
03:28:53,969 --> 03:28:59,370
I'm Peter Lang Stanton, and this is a very personal story, but one I feel needs to be told.

2259
03:29:08,088 --> 03:29:11,390
The Arctic Ocean is warming at an extraordinary rate.

2260
03:29:11,830 --> 03:29:16,573
But what does that mean for the wildlife and the people that rely on these waters?

2261
03:29:16,953 --> 03:29:18,714
The ice is changing.

2262
03:29:18,954 --> 03:29:20,996
It's changing so fast.

2263
03:29:21,436 --> 03:29:26,579
And it's challenging trying to go caribou hunting because of the erosion.

2264
03:29:26,979 --> 03:29:27,679
I'm Liz Bonnen.

2265
03:29:27,880 --> 03:29:36,945
And after the news, I'll bring you ocean stories for The Compass on the BBC World Service, diving into the icy depths of the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

2266
03:29:38,662 --> 03:29:40,363
BBC News with Gareth Barlow.

2267
03:29:41,003 --> 03:29:42,083
Two senior U.S.

2268
03:29:42,123 --> 03:29:47,185
officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

2269
03:29:47,205 --> 03:29:53,447
He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

2270
03:29:53,927 --> 03:29:55,707
The decision will break with years of U.S.

2271
03:29:55,767 --> 03:30:00,369
policy on the status of the disputed city, as well as the international consensus.

2272
03:30:00,969 --> 03:30:04,270
Arab states have warned the decision could provoke violence in the Muslim world.

2273
03:30:05,210 --> 03:30:15,415
Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban its participation in next year's Winter Olympics, following a report accusing it of systematic doping.

2274
03:30:15,876 --> 03:30:20,438
The deputy speaker of the Russian parliament called the ban a humiliation and an insult.

2275
03:30:21,358 --> 03:30:26,201
Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

2276
03:30:26,821 --> 03:30:31,825
One fire in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, trebled in size in just a few hours.

2277
03:30:32,365 --> 03:30:37,229
At least 150 buildings have been destroyed, and a quarter of a million homes are without power.

2278
03:30:38,290 --> 03:30:45,836
Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the campaigning journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

2279
03:30:46,336 --> 03:30:50,259
Alfred and Jorge de Georgiou and Vince Muscard were arrested on Monday.

2280
03:30:50,539 --> 03:30:52,081
They have pleaded not guilty.

2281
03:30:53,064 --> 03:31:02,668
The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favour President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

2282
03:31:03,229 --> 03:31:10,132
The opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla, had appeared on course for victory after the election, when the count was suddenly halted.

2283
03:31:11,252 --> 03:31:15,276
France's biggest rock star, Johnny Hallyday, has died from lung cancer at the age of 74.

2284
03:31:16,677 --> 03:31:22,862
In a career spanning five decades, he sold more than 100 million records and headlined 50 major tours.

2285
03:31:23,402 --> 03:31:32,790
Known as the French Elvis, he was hugely popular in the Francophone world, but less well-known elsewhere, earning him the nickname, the biggest rock star you've never heard of.

2286
03:31:33,891 --> 03:31:34,732
BBC News.

2287
03:31:38,288 --> 03:31:38,928
I'm Liz Bonnen.

2288
03:31:39,108 --> 03:31:42,969
I'm a wild animal biologist and a science and wildlife presenter.

2289
03:31:43,429 --> 03:31:47,190
In this series for The Compass, we're on a voyage through the world's oceans.

2290
03:31:47,730 --> 03:31:57,792
Now, I've spent time tracking Siberian tigers in the frozen Russian Far East, and I'm fascinated by how both animals and humans adapt to the coldest conditions on Earth.

2291
03:31:58,252 --> 03:31:59,913
Welcome to Ocean Stories.

2292
03:32:04,272 --> 03:32:07,633
The oceans cover 70% of our planet's surface.

2293
03:32:08,333 --> 03:32:16,256
The wildlife they contain is extraordinary, but so too are the people who make their living from the depths and the shallows of our seas.

2294
03:32:17,417 --> 03:32:26,780
In this special four-part series for The Compass, I'm introducing you to them, from the ice-strewn landscapes of Alaska to the coral reef coastlines of Madagascar.

2295
03:32:27,560 --> 03:32:33,744
From the BBC World Service, this is Ocean Stories, part three, the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

2296
03:32:38,286 --> 03:32:41,088
These are the extremes of marine life.

2297
03:32:42,168 --> 03:32:47,391
Two very different oceans where life has evolved to survive the intense cold.

2298
03:32:47,952 --> 03:32:55,516
Two oceans where the climate is changing rapidly, where the fish, mammals and people are learning to adapt.

2299
03:32:57,884 --> 03:33:06,410
We begin in the far north, the ocean encircled by Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and Alaska.

2300
03:33:07,331 --> 03:33:14,356
The Arctic Ocean has tempted explorers in search of a faster passage from east to west for centuries.

2301
03:33:16,235 --> 03:33:24,089
As the waters warm, the voyage becomes less dangerous and the plentiful, rich resources of the north are suddenly within reach.

2302
03:33:25,050 --> 03:33:28,617
Our marine ecologist John Copley is watching closely.

2303
03:33:30,494 --> 03:33:41,440
That whole area is very rich in oil and gas, and so there's a real bit of an underwater land grab around the Arctic at the moment for these seabed resources.

2304
03:33:42,080 --> 03:33:52,026
Russia is claiming that the Lomonosov Ridge is an extension of the Siberian continental self geologically, and therefore it should belong to Russia as seafloor territory and its resources.

2305
03:33:52,366 --> 03:33:54,427
A lot of that oil and gas should belong to Russia.

2306
03:33:54,887 --> 03:34:00,533
and other nations who ring the arctic are also simply trying to get a piece of the pie.

2307
03:34:00,593 --> 03:34:14,586
Previously we hadn't thought about those resources because the ocean is covered most of the time or most of its extent by sea ice but of course there have been such dramatic declines in arctic sea ice extent in recent years that the prospect of

2308
03:34:15,367 --> 03:34:29,560
operations that require more open water, whether that's shipping and navigation to make a shortcut across the top of the world for transport of goods or actually to start extracting oil and gas from these sorts of latitudes, that's potentially becoming more realistic.

2309
03:34:30,928 --> 03:34:33,849
Oil is already being extracted from the Arctic.

2310
03:34:34,509 --> 03:34:40,210
At Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, millions of barrels of oil have been pumped since the 1960s.

2311
03:34:41,110 --> 03:34:46,491
Operations there provide the jobs for Utqiagvik, America's most northerly town.

2312
03:34:47,311 --> 03:34:53,033
Here, 500 kilometers inside the Arctic Circle, it's completely dark for 65 long winter days.

2313
03:34:55,906 --> 03:34:59,270
But in the Arctic summer, a beach party is underway.

2314
03:34:59,830 --> 03:35:01,873
The whaling season is coming to an end.

2315
03:35:02,673 --> 03:35:09,942
As the last boat, a sealskin canoe, is pulled onto shore, the local Inupiat Inuit gather for a feast.

2316
03:35:13,385 --> 03:35:28,188
the beginning of a ceremony called the Parati where the crew is going to bring in their boat from the ice symbolizing that they're done whaling for the season and they're gonna hand out fermented whale, some soup.

2317
03:35:37,045 --> 03:35:39,527
I just said, welcome, everybody.

2318
03:35:39,547 --> 03:35:42,189
I am Naomi Asok, and I'm from Barrow.

2319
03:35:42,829 --> 03:35:43,469
Naomi is 23.

2320
03:35:44,530 --> 03:35:49,533
She hunts walrus, seal, caribou, and whale with her father, Herman.

2321
03:35:49,974 --> 03:35:53,116
When you harvest a whale, you can't sell the meat or muktak.

2322
03:35:53,816 --> 03:35:56,398
It's given away to everybody, everybody.

2323
03:35:56,939 --> 03:35:58,640
Even if you don't belong to a whaling crew,

2324
03:35:59,360 --> 03:36:01,482
and you go up and butcher the whale, you get a share.

2325
03:36:02,283 --> 03:36:09,850
You can't sell it because it's the International Whaling Commission law, because we use it as subsistence.

2326
03:36:10,607 --> 03:36:20,433
The success and safety of a hunting season here depends on the local knowledge of the ice, as it forms, solidifies and breaks up over the course of a winter.

2327
03:36:21,033 --> 03:36:28,438
Ice is siku in Inupiaq, and there's also the tuak, which is the ice that's connected to the shore.

2328
03:36:28,998 --> 03:36:32,080
And then the salvi is the main pack that travels with the current.

2329
03:36:41,749 --> 03:36:43,511
These names are important.

2330
03:36:43,931 --> 03:36:55,802
They allow the hunters to communicate, to tell each other where they can walk, where they can drive their trucks and where they can gut their prey in a landscape that merges for most of the year with the Arctic Ocean.

2331
03:36:56,543 --> 03:37:04,569
There was a lot of different changes within just my 23 years of existing at home.

2332
03:37:05,389 --> 03:37:07,111
The ice is changing.

2333
03:37:07,391 --> 03:37:09,432
It's changing so fast.

2334
03:37:10,473 --> 03:37:13,935
The coastline has eroded so fast.

2335
03:37:15,196 --> 03:37:24,658
And it's a little bit more challenging trying to go caribou hunting with the four-wheelers along the coast because of the erosion.

2336
03:37:24,678 --> 03:37:35,201
And we're trying to have to work around the thawing and around the breaking of ice.

2337
03:37:35,281 --> 03:37:37,901
And we have to be very careful.

2338
03:37:39,142 --> 03:37:40,122
We have a hammer up there?

2339
03:37:43,355 --> 03:37:48,697
The whales that are caught in the short hunting season feed the community here right through the year.

2340
03:37:49,458 --> 03:38:01,583
In a town where an omelette in a cafe costs 20 US dollars, the whale meat, traditionally kept frozen at the bottom of a four meter shaft drilled through the ice, is a vital food source.

2341
03:38:01,603 --> 03:38:02,323
Let's have a look.

2342
03:38:03,093 --> 03:38:06,454
This is our traditional ice cellar.

2343
03:38:07,154 --> 03:38:10,894
This is where we store our muktuk and our meat from the bowhead whale.

2344
03:38:11,555 --> 03:38:15,235
It's 20 feet down, and it's a natural freezer.

2345
03:38:15,815 --> 03:38:23,177
Whenever a crew is successful catching a whale, they'll put the excess meat and muktuk in here, the blubber.

2346
03:38:23,737 --> 03:38:25,117
And there's a difference, you can tell.

2347
03:38:25,137 --> 03:38:30,818
Like, if you put the meat in a traditional freezer, like in your home, you'll actually

2348
03:38:31,878 --> 03:38:35,620
You can taste where it's been sitting, but it tastes really good.

2349
03:38:35,660 --> 03:38:36,720
It's like the earth.

2350
03:38:37,480 --> 03:38:40,361
But the permafrost here is no longer reliable.

2351
03:38:41,062 --> 03:38:44,783
There's water instead of ice at the bottom of Naomi's cellar.

2352
03:38:45,603 --> 03:38:51,666
There's some that are not working anymore because of the changing weather.

2353
03:38:59,267 --> 03:39:13,692
Travel across the Arctic Ocean, over the North Pole, and you reach Svalbard, a group of islands administered by Norway, but home to research stations belonging to France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and even China.

2354
03:39:14,792 --> 03:39:21,655
With so many scientists here, the melting of the ice and the thawing of the permafrost are monitored very carefully.

2355
03:39:22,195 --> 03:39:34,700
So it was relatively cold here in Svalbard in the 60s and in the 80s and then after that for the last 35 years we have seen a more or less persistent temperature increase up here.

2356
03:39:35,020 --> 03:39:39,704
Ole Humlen is a geographer at UNIS, the university centre in Svalbard.

2357
03:39:40,424 --> 03:39:45,168
This was what we had in the beginning at UNIS, the only room where we could work on frozen samples.

2358
03:39:45,388 --> 03:39:48,430
Ole is married to geology professor Hannah Christensen.

2359
03:39:48,690 --> 03:39:51,172
It's minus 17 in the freezer today.

2360
03:39:51,332 --> 03:39:56,156
She keeps her core samples from the Svalbard permafrost in a walk-in freezer at UNIS.

2361
03:39:56,416 --> 03:40:08,540
Not only do we measure the temperature of the permafrost in Svalbard, but we're also monitoring and measuring the thickness of the thawed layer, the active layer on top of the permafrost that develops every summer when energy is provided to the ground.

2362
03:40:09,160 --> 03:40:10,941
And then we can monitor that.

2363
03:40:11,041 --> 03:40:12,561
And we've been doing that for 15, 16 years now.

2364
03:40:14,422 --> 03:40:25,806
So we know that on average over that period of time where temperatures have gone up, we see an increase in the thickness of the active layer of around half a centimeter to a centimeter, of course varies between years.

2365
03:40:26,566 --> 03:40:31,768
So that means that we're losing that amount of permafrost from this area that we are monitoring like that.

2366
03:40:32,208 --> 03:40:38,892
Thawing permafrost can release the climate-warming gas methane, which is even more damaging than carbon dioxide.

2367
03:40:39,713 --> 03:40:41,474
It also causes local problems.

2368
03:40:41,994 --> 03:40:50,239
Most of the offices, shops and homes in Svalbard are built on stilts resting on ground that used to be frozen solid all year round.

2369
03:40:51,220 --> 03:41:03,650
I'm living in a house on piles, as you have just seen, and at the moment you can't close the windows in one side of the house because the whole house is being deformed because of the ground that it's standing on.

2370
03:41:03,810 --> 03:41:07,453
It's getting maybe a thicker active layer or getting more water under there.

2371
03:41:09,140 --> 03:41:16,622
From the Norwegian Polar Institute, Christian Ledesen studies the mammals that spend their entire lives in these arctic waters.

2372
03:41:17,182 --> 03:41:24,903
Walruses is one, ring seal and bearded seals are other, and also the narwhal and the bowhead and the white whale.

2373
03:41:25,603 --> 03:41:30,044
And they are what we call ice associated, two different degrees.

2374
03:41:30,804 --> 03:41:33,505
And the one that is most dependent on sea ice is the ring seal.

2375
03:41:34,165 --> 03:41:45,177
And it's the ringed seal, a small seal with a coat of black spots surrounded by grey rings, that's having a particularly tough time coping with the warm waters around Svalbard.

2376
03:41:45,197 --> 03:41:54,426
They have this very special breathing system where they actually pop in a snow cave on top of a breathing hole in the ice.

2377
03:41:55,487 --> 03:42:01,634
And that protects the very small pup from harsh weather conditions to some degree, but also from predation.

2378
03:42:02,094 --> 03:42:10,383
Because it takes a while for a predator, which is normally a polar bear or a fox, to dig through the layer and take the pup so it has a chance to escape.

2379
03:42:10,903 --> 03:42:25,737
What the problem has been here now the last years is that first, especially on the west side of Spitsbergen, the ice forms very late, if at all, and normally it forms too late for snow, enough snow to accumulate, so they can make these layers.

2380
03:42:27,037 --> 03:42:32,678
And then they pup on the open ice, and then almost all pups are killed before they are weaned.

2381
03:42:32,998 --> 03:42:34,458
Even big gulls take them then.

2382
03:42:35,199 --> 03:42:38,519
In principle, we're not having Arctic conditions here anymore.

2383
03:42:38,539 --> 03:42:40,040
You know, they're changing to more Atlantic.

2384
03:42:41,120 --> 03:42:46,301
And we have here on the west coast of Svalbard, we have harbor seals too, not so ice adapted.

2385
03:42:46,841 --> 03:42:52,222
And it seems like they are thriving with this new Atlantic water, and they're expanding their distribution into the fjords here.

2386
03:42:53,973 --> 03:42:57,796
The oceans at both ends of the world are changing fast.

2387
03:42:58,257 --> 03:43:01,580
Some animals may adapt to warmer waters, others won't.

2388
03:43:03,031 --> 03:43:09,815
In the Arctic, the shifting climate will certainly change the lives of native people and bring more workers from the South.

2389
03:43:11,676 --> 03:43:23,043
A place like Svalbard, perfectly positioned on the Northeast Passage from Asia across Northern Europe to North America, is likely to take on newfound importance in world trade.

2390
03:43:23,883 --> 03:43:26,545
Mads Forshamer is a local biologist.

2391
03:43:27,205 --> 03:43:31,226
When the sea ice goes, it will open for transportations by ships.

2392
03:43:31,566 --> 03:43:37,807
It will open for explorations of petroleum and other natural resources.

2393
03:43:38,988 --> 03:43:41,928
So yeah, it will change the picture a lot.

2394
03:43:42,568 --> 03:43:49,330
And that could have consequences for a place like this because it could be increased in size considerably if you have ships coming in.

2395
03:43:50,831 --> 03:43:52,334
because Svalbard is positioned there.

2396
03:43:52,454 --> 03:43:57,224
They're actually the hub, the main entrance to cross polar routes.

2397
03:43:58,226 --> 03:44:00,230
So yeah, that's going to be quite interesting to watch.

2398
03:44:02,885 --> 03:44:11,191
There are a lot of people who are wondering about what will happen to Svalbard if it should be possible to sail through the Northeast Passage.

2399
03:44:12,112 --> 03:44:17,856
Tarin Sorensen is deacon at the Svalbard Kirke, the most northerly church in the world.

2400
03:44:18,517 --> 03:44:20,919
What about the spilling of oil?

2401
03:44:21,899 --> 03:44:27,604
What about the fuel effect, the Arctic?

2402
03:44:29,045 --> 03:44:30,106
There are many questions.

2403
03:44:33,495 --> 03:44:36,520
I'm Liz Bonnen and this is Ocean Stories.

2404
03:44:37,181 --> 03:44:42,689
Today we're discovering how a warming climate is changing the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

2405
03:44:48,337 --> 03:44:59,086
head south, 60 degrees south, far beyond the southern tip of South Africa, Chile and New Zealand, to the mother of the oceans, the water that brings life to the rest of the world.

2406
03:44:59,546 --> 03:45:06,753
The Antarctic is particularly important because it's where a lot of the deep oceans of the world are effectively breathing in.

2407
03:45:07,413 --> 03:45:12,296
Our guide to the deep is Southampton University's ocean explorer John Copley.

2408
03:45:12,636 --> 03:45:21,680
Deep water that fills the bottom of Marianas Trench in the Pacific actually begun its journey into the deep at the sea surface around Antarctica.

2409
03:45:22,141 --> 03:45:26,503
In winter in the Antarctic a lot more of the sea freezes around Antarctica.

2410
03:45:26,523 --> 03:45:30,625
We get this phenomenal growth of sea ice spreading out from the continent and if

2411
03:45:31,465 --> 03:45:34,226
It effectively doubles the size of the Antarctic.

2412
03:45:34,706 --> 03:45:41,128
And as the surface sea freezes to form that sea ice, it leaves behind very cold, very salty water.

2413
03:45:41,588 --> 03:45:46,929
And that very cold, very salty water is heavier than normal sea water, so it sinks.

2414
03:45:47,989 --> 03:45:52,571
And it sinks and it flows out, spills out from the Antarctic into the deep ocean basins.

2415
03:45:52,651 --> 03:45:57,192
It flows north in the Atlantic, north in the Pacific, north in the Indian Ocean.

2416
03:45:57,852 --> 03:46:07,019
And it's very important because when it's forming at the surface, that's when it's dissolving oxygen from the air into the ocean and then carrying that oxygen into the deep ocean.

2417
03:46:07,119 --> 03:46:17,126
So all of the deep sea marine life in those deep ocean basins, it gets its oxygen from that deep water formation at the surface around Antarctica.

2418
03:46:17,667 --> 03:46:24,932
Where other continents slope gently into the surrounding ocean, Antarctica stops and drops off dramatically.

2419
03:46:26,352 --> 03:46:35,198
Deep sea washes right up against the land and this far south the difference in temperature between the deep water and the shallows is greatly reduced.

2420
03:46:40,162 --> 03:46:47,007
Which means that the strange life forms of the deep can be spotted close to land and relatively close to the surface.

2421
03:46:48,158 --> 03:46:52,960
John Copley is one of the first people to take a submersible into these waters.

2422
03:46:53,560 --> 03:46:55,021
So we're 120 meters now.

2423
03:46:55,481 --> 03:47:01,964
Toby's driving us towards the point we hope to land on the seabed at to start our dive.

2424
03:47:02,625 --> 03:47:07,707
So we're heading down half a kilometer to explore this part of our planet for the first time.

2425
03:47:10,032 --> 03:47:11,253
So we just passed 100 meters.

2426
03:47:11,273 --> 03:47:13,214
All the daylight has gone now.

2427
03:47:13,894 --> 03:47:16,235
It's all been quenched by the seawater.

2428
03:47:16,395 --> 03:47:19,917
Amazing, thick soup of plankton.

2429
03:47:20,397 --> 03:47:21,638
And it's mainly animal plankton.

2430
03:47:21,938 --> 03:47:22,918
And they're tiny.

2431
03:47:23,018 --> 03:47:25,660
It's hard for me to make out what we're seeing here.

2432
03:47:25,680 --> 03:47:28,241
That's a larval fish that's just gone by the sphere there.

2433
03:47:29,101 --> 03:47:30,162
Tiny little crustaceans.

2434
03:47:30,182 --> 03:47:31,762
They're kind of like the insects of the ocean.

2435
03:47:31,883 --> 03:47:33,463
Control, control, rover.

2436
03:47:33,543 --> 03:47:34,904
Both subs off bottom.

2437
03:47:34,984 --> 03:47:36,205
Depth 4-0-0 meters, over.

2438
03:47:39,190 --> 03:47:42,792
Where we are right now, mid-water, this is a very strange place.

2439
03:47:43,052 --> 03:47:49,055
It's a world without war, so there are animals that live their whole lives here, never touching a solid, hard surface.

2440
03:47:49,256 --> 03:47:53,338
And that means they've got bodies that are like blown glass, that are sort of ethereal.

2441
03:47:53,358 --> 03:47:56,840
A lot of them are bodies very delicate, made of jelly.

2442
03:47:57,480 --> 03:47:59,721
And the only way to understand the life here is to come and see it.

2443
03:48:00,081 --> 03:48:04,604
Because if you try and fish these up with a net, all you get is a lot of snot in the bottom of the net.

2444
03:48:05,284 --> 03:48:06,545
Oh, look at that ice fish there.

2445
03:48:06,725 --> 03:48:07,705
Crocodile ice fish.

2446
03:48:07,765 --> 03:48:09,806
That's a beauty.

2447
03:48:10,507 --> 03:48:13,748
And it has a... Its snout is really like crocodile-like.

2448
03:48:14,869 --> 03:48:20,071
Just everywhere we go, there is something amazing and something different.

2449
03:48:24,648 --> 03:48:26,989
Oh, the krill are really starting to swarm around us now.

2450
03:48:27,009 --> 03:48:29,490
I mean, they're almost see-through.

2451
03:48:29,510 --> 03:48:44,055
You sometimes catch a flash of what's in their gut, a little line down the body, and they've actually got little organs like headlights dotted along their bodies as well, which when we switch out the lights later, hopefully we'll be able to see some of their firework displays.

2452
03:48:44,615 --> 03:48:48,557
Control, Rover, that's both subs finished, standing by to leave bottom hour.

2453
03:48:52,543 --> 03:48:56,066
Those krill are the foundation of life in the Antarctic.

2454
03:48:56,467 --> 03:49:01,971
Food for the seals, the whales and the penguins that live on the West Antarctic Peninsula.

2455
03:49:02,932 --> 03:49:06,095
This is one of the fastest warming areas on Earth.

2456
03:49:06,836 --> 03:49:09,378
Warming temperatures means less sea ice.

2457
03:49:09,898 --> 03:49:14,002
Less sea ice means less habitat for the algae that the krill eat.

2458
03:49:14,722 --> 03:49:19,767
And that could be catastrophic for the mammals and birds in this part of the Southern Ocean.

2459
03:49:21,080 --> 03:49:23,081
You know, really, it's amazing.

2460
03:49:23,361 --> 03:49:27,522
There are so many wandering albatrosses behind this boat now, I can't describe.

2461
03:49:28,282 --> 03:49:31,183
They're the world's largest bird in terms of wingspan.

2462
03:49:31,203 --> 03:49:33,144
They're three, three and a half meters.

2463
03:49:33,744 --> 03:49:35,505
And they come just alongside the boat.

2464
03:49:35,805 --> 03:49:39,926
And they sort of, they just float, just almost within fingertip reach of them.

2465
03:49:40,406 --> 03:49:44,828
They just look at you as they sort of glide gently up to see what you're all about.

2466
03:49:45,948 --> 03:49:51,874
and then fire off across the surface of the ocean, almost skimming the surface of the sea with their wingtips.

2467
03:49:51,914 --> 03:49:55,938
They're just extraordinarily capable birds in the air.

2468
03:49:56,119 --> 03:50:00,203
They look like they're applying no effort to the mechanism of flight whatsoever.

2469
03:50:01,232 --> 03:50:03,594
Gerard Baker is a chef and a writer.

2470
03:50:03,995 --> 03:50:12,322
He's been working in the Southern Ocean for 23 years on cruise ships, fishing boats, and in the British Antarctic Survey's research stations.

2471
03:50:13,163 --> 03:50:17,287
In a region with no permanent residents, Gerard qualifies as a local.

2472
03:50:17,728 --> 03:50:22,152
And like most of us, he cares about the future of life on his own doorstep.

2473
03:50:24,233 --> 03:50:32,797
We've been stalked by a foot and a half long, fluffy, slightly damp-looking fur seal pup with teeth about a millimetre long.

2474
03:50:32,817 --> 03:50:39,620
So although it makes a growly, aggressive kind of noise, it might nibble the end of your boot, but not much more than that.

2475
03:50:41,800 --> 03:50:44,162
This is one of the more unusual treasure hunts I've ever been on.

2476
03:50:44,202 --> 03:50:50,269
We're hunting for fur seal scats, or faeces, here on the snow at King Edward Point.

2477
03:50:50,289 --> 03:50:56,815
And I'm with the zoologist here, Kieran, who is going to show me what he does with this.

2478
03:50:56,835 --> 03:51:00,920
He's got a plastic bag on one hand and there's a dirty brown lump on the snow.

2479
03:51:00,940 --> 03:51:01,580
Kieran, you go ahead.

2480
03:51:01,600 --> 03:51:04,924
Tell me, what's the point of collecting the fur seal scats?

2481
03:51:05,584 --> 03:51:21,747
So the whole point to this is to analyse their diet, to understand exactly what they're eating, and this can indicate then how much krill and fish and potentially squid is in the waters here in South Georgia.

2482
03:51:22,407 --> 03:51:23,587
OK, well, you go ahead and pick up.

2483
03:51:24,367 --> 03:51:31,428
So there's absolutely no skill towards this, same as what you would do with your own dog.

2484
03:51:32,909 --> 03:51:34,449
And this one is basically...

2485
03:51:37,255 --> 03:51:39,596
It's nicely frozen onto the snow there.

2486
03:51:41,797 --> 03:51:43,918
Dog owners will be sympathetic to you at this point.

2487
03:51:45,399 --> 03:51:57,704
The reason Kieran, who works for the South Georgia government, is so interested in krill numbers, is that krill fishing is on the increase, as the world's human population craves new sources of omega-3 oils.

2488
03:51:58,564 --> 03:52:04,027
The warming climate means that fishing boats can work further south, deeper into the Antarctic winter.

2489
03:52:05,182 --> 03:52:11,585
Crucially, the Norwegians have developed a cunning way of catching the krill and freezing them whilst they're still completely fresh.

2490
03:52:12,385 --> 03:52:19,808
That makes them fit for human consumption, so you'll now see krill oil high in omega-3 in a lot of health food shops around the world.

2491
03:52:20,648 --> 03:52:25,450
The Chinese and South Koreans are now following the Norwegians into the southern waters.

2492
03:52:27,556 --> 03:52:35,125
Well, I've come to Nikko Harbour on the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and here it's a large Gentoo penguin colony.

2493
03:52:35,285 --> 03:52:41,632
There are adults wandering around, chicks, large chicks now, it's mid-season, and they're beginning to fledge.

2494
03:52:43,014 --> 03:52:48,100
And all around is evidence of krill and iguana on the ground in between the rocks here.

2495
03:52:49,748 --> 03:52:53,890
Oh, there's a glacier carving in the background, a little bit of wave happening.

2496
03:52:55,611 --> 03:53:04,355
It's hard not to connect the success, the breeding success of the penguins here on shore with what's happening out there on the water.

2497
03:53:06,236 --> 03:53:13,560
Here at Neco Harbour last year, along with other nearby islands like Cooverville, almost all of the Gentoo chicks died from starvation.

2498
03:53:17,411 --> 03:53:23,535
This is one of the cameras, and as you can see, there's a bunch of nests in view.

2499
03:53:25,175 --> 03:53:26,096
And this is the cool one.

2500
03:53:26,196 --> 03:53:34,701
It takes a photo every hour all year, which shows when they arrive, when they depart, and the reproductive success, so which chicks survive and which don't.

2501
03:53:35,922 --> 03:53:45,787
Using a network of cameras, Tom Hart from Oxford University monitors the three species of brushtail penguin on the Antarctic Peninsula, the chinstrap, a dayleaf, and gen2.

2502
03:53:47,208 --> 03:53:49,549
Every summer, he visits the cameras to change the batteries.

2503
03:53:50,490 --> 03:53:57,493
In the spring of 2016, he noticed a sharp decline in the number of chicks successfully fledged on Cooverville Island.

2504
03:53:59,374 --> 03:54:02,695
Cooverville Island has about 2,000 gentoo penguins on it.

2505
03:54:03,295 --> 03:54:06,557
And there was a big die-off there right at the end of the season.

2506
03:54:07,497 --> 03:54:09,498
So I'd come back, I didn't see it.

2507
03:54:10,619 --> 03:54:13,320
But we started getting all these reports of a die-off.

2508
03:54:14,492 --> 03:54:16,373
So what caused the southern penguin die-off?

2509
03:54:17,133 --> 03:54:23,395
The evidence, according to scientists at the nearby Palmer Research Station, suggests it wasn't disease, but starvation.

2510
03:54:24,475 --> 03:54:26,056
That points to a problem with the krill.

2511
03:54:27,116 --> 03:54:31,918
They could have suffered their own bad breeding year, or returning whales could have taken a larger share.

2512
03:54:33,233 --> 03:54:35,394
Climate change is another of the key suspects.

2513
03:54:36,314 --> 03:54:38,535
Mark Belsher from the British Antarctic Survey.

2514
03:54:39,155 --> 03:54:48,358
Climate change is likely to have a very large impact on all aspects of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, not least in Antarctic krill.

2515
03:54:49,399 --> 03:54:55,121
They are very much dependent for their early life history stages on the northerly extent of sea ice.

2516
03:54:55,918 --> 03:54:59,540
where their spawning and egg duration phase takes place.

2517
03:55:00,060 --> 03:55:14,807
So clearly the location of the ice edge and the timing of the extent of the ice edge will have a major impact as to where krill ultimately will end up in the Southern Ocean, which currents they get entrained in, and indeed their overall success.

2518
03:55:15,407 --> 03:55:19,709
Brent Stewart from the Hubb Seaworld Research Institute also expects an impact.

2519
03:55:20,289 --> 03:55:37,425
Well, I think the key here with all the discussion about changes in climate, which is clearly happening, local changes in climate, regional changes in climate, oceanographic climate or atmospheric climate, is the question is how quickly does it happen and do animals have the, can they respond to it?

2520
03:55:37,786 --> 03:55:41,149
Some will respond to it well and some won't if it happens very quickly.

2521
03:55:41,209 --> 03:55:45,233
So if the climate changes quickly enough that it

2522
03:55:45,953 --> 03:55:57,180
degrades the habitat for krill, which are the primary food source for a lot of things, and that just vanishes, then that's going to be a very, very sudden change for the predators.

2523
03:55:57,500 --> 03:55:59,701
They'll either move elsewhere or they won't do so well.

2524
03:56:00,402 --> 03:56:06,425
So climate change is likely to affect the krill, but it may be premature to blame it for a single bad year.

2525
03:56:07,286 --> 03:56:09,087
Another suspect is the fishing industry.

2526
03:56:09,787 --> 03:56:14,670
Large krill fishing boats were seen working close to the penguin colonies at the time of the die-off.

2527
03:56:15,150 --> 03:56:18,431
Trying to pin the blame on any one event is really hard.

2528
03:56:19,252 --> 03:56:33,418
It was possibly a bad krill year but there was also a lot of fishing going on nearby and yeah that to me absolutely highlights the problem that you can have associations and that's not evidence either way.

2529
03:56:34,685 --> 03:56:38,488
So far, there's no firm evidence that krill numbers have declined in the Southern Ocean.

2530
03:56:39,089 --> 03:56:42,872
It's very difficult to gather accurate data over such a huge area.

2531
03:56:44,033 --> 03:56:48,956
What worries Tom is that the birds and mammals are concentrated in particular parts of the ocean.

2532
03:56:49,877 --> 03:56:54,101
If fishing boats target exactly the same area, then food could run short.

2533
03:56:57,467 --> 03:57:06,715
Yeah, so all of these predators, they're land-based, raising their young on land, so they're tied to the land like an aircraft carrier.

2534
03:57:07,035 --> 03:57:13,640
They can go out and they can fish, they can go foraging, but they need to come back to land where they're young are to raise their young.

2535
03:57:14,481 --> 03:57:24,870
All different species, so this could be Adelie penguins, Chinstrap penguins and Gentoo penguins, but also Crabbeater seals, anything apart from whales, they're land-based when they're breeding.

2536
03:57:26,332 --> 03:57:29,175
and doing these little forays out to get food.

2537
03:57:29,195 --> 03:57:36,301
The penguins all around me are witnesses to what's happening in the Southern Ocean.

2538
03:57:37,202 --> 03:57:44,408
The future health of this colony and others like it is very dependent on climate change and ultimately what we as humans do.

2539
03:57:47,703 --> 03:57:53,625
I'm Liz Bonnen and you've been listening to Ocean Stories for the Compass from the BBC World Service.

2540
03:57:54,605 --> 03:57:56,646
The producer was Alistair Cross.

2541
03:57:57,646 --> 03:58:03,568
In episode four, I'll be exploring the biggest and deepest ocean of all, the Pacific.

2542
03:58:08,022 --> 03:58:11,484
This is the BBC World Service, where science lives.

2543
03:58:12,084 --> 03:58:13,145
For the creative.

2544
03:58:13,385 --> 03:58:17,827
With drones, we can get blood anywhere in the country in 15 to 20 minutes.

2545
03:58:18,108 --> 03:58:18,888
And the curious.

2546
03:58:19,128 --> 03:58:26,092
When we looked at our twins, we found there were certain microbes that were always present in the skinnier twins than in the overweight twins.

2547
03:58:26,352 --> 03:58:28,033
For our remarkable world.

2548
03:58:28,633 --> 03:58:31,095
It's like releasing the valve on a pressure cooker.

2549
03:58:31,215 --> 03:58:36,137
Science on the BBC World Service at bbcworldservice.com.

2550
03:58:39,015 --> 03:58:41,357
You're listening to the BBC World Service.

2551
03:59:08,532 --> 03:59:09,712
Hello, welcome to Outlook.

2552
03:59:09,913 --> 03:59:15,655
When Ayik Shute was 13, he joined a rebel army in Sudan, but he hated it and tried to run away.

2553
03:59:15,975 --> 03:59:18,216
When he was caught, he was horribly punished.

2554
03:59:18,656 --> 03:59:21,537
All I remember, I cried and you can't cry anymore.

2555
03:59:21,917 --> 03:59:26,639
You know, you want to, your lung is gone.

2556
03:59:26,659 --> 03:59:28,179
There's nothing that can come out of it.

2557
03:59:28,340 --> 03:59:29,100
Who would punish you?

2558
03:59:29,120 --> 03:59:33,421
There was a guy who ran the prison, the child soldiers prison.

2559
03:59:33,441 --> 03:59:34,622
His name was Anyang.

2560
03:59:35,029 --> 03:59:40,092
Anuang was just a child himself, a few years older than Ayik, and Ayik hated him with a passion.

2561
03:59:40,392 --> 03:59:45,515
Years later, Ayik got asylum in Australia, and one day in church, saw a familiar face.

2562
03:59:46,035 --> 03:59:47,916
This is the guy that used to torture me.

2563
03:59:48,357 --> 03:59:57,802
Every time we run away, he'll send the guard to go and get us, and bring us back there, and then lock us up for up to four weeks, and then release us into training again.

2564
03:59:58,282 --> 03:59:58,863
That's him.

2565
03:59:58,883 --> 04:00:02,410
Okay, I think I should kill him.

2566
04:00:02,811 --> 04:00:05,135
What happened next is truly extraordinary.

2567
04:00:05,296 --> 04:00:06,778
Find out after the news.

2568
04:00:08,503 --> 04:00:10,624
BBC News, hello, I'm Gareth Barlow.

2569
04:00:11,325 --> 04:00:12,106
Senior U.S.

2570
04:00:12,166 --> 04:00:17,289
officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

2571
04:00:17,309 --> 04:00:23,974
He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

2572
04:00:24,494 --> 04:00:28,277
Arab states have warned that the decision could provoke violence in the Muslim world.

2573
04:00:28,817 --> 04:00:29,938
Barbara Platusha reports.

2574
04:00:30,525 --> 04:00:34,509
The president is planning to fulfill a campaign promise made to pro-Israel voters.

2575
04:00:34,929 --> 04:00:40,734
But in doing so, he's tackling one of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the status of Jerusalem.

2576
04:00:41,595 --> 04:00:47,721
Senior administration officials said he would simply be acknowledging reality, that Jerusalem functions as the capital of Israel.

2577
04:00:48,422 --> 04:00:56,972
Congress has called for such a move for 22 years, but previous presidents have been resistant, accepting that Jerusalem's future should be part of a negotiated agreement.

2578
04:00:57,713 --> 04:00:58,133
One U.S.

2579
04:00:58,173 --> 04:01:02,058
official said that delaying the decision had done nothing to advance peace.

2580
04:01:02,679 --> 04:01:06,684
But the U.N., Europe and Arab states have long calculated that it would prevent conflict.

2581
04:01:07,423 --> 04:01:14,986
Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban it from next February's Winter Olympics in South Korea.

2582
04:01:15,466 --> 04:01:24,810
In a defiant post on social media, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Russia would survive this as it had survived World War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and sanctions.

2583
04:01:25,270 --> 04:01:26,451
Here is Alex Kapstik.

2584
04:01:26,911 --> 04:01:31,353
The decision was made following a damning report which confirmed there was state-sponsored doping.

2585
04:01:31,893 --> 04:01:33,914
The sports ministry has been held responsible.

2586
04:01:34,294 --> 04:01:39,095
Its former boss and the current Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has been banned for life.

2587
04:01:39,715 --> 04:01:41,916
The country's flag will not fly in Pyeongchang.

2588
04:01:42,196 --> 04:01:43,716
Its anthem will not be played.

2589
04:01:44,216 --> 04:01:50,798
Russian athletes will be free to compete as long as they prove they are clean and were not directly implicated in the doping program.

2590
04:01:51,258 --> 04:01:57,780
They will wear neutral uniforms, but in what could be a crucial concession, they will be known as Olympic athletes from Russia.

2591
04:01:58,990 --> 04:02:04,554
Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

2592
04:02:05,094 --> 04:02:08,817
The BBC's James Cook reports from the outskirts of Los Angeles.

2593
04:02:09,317 --> 04:02:21,546
In Ventura County, to the north of Los Angeles, a wildfire which broke out on Monday intensified with terrifying speed, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by arid and gusty Santa Ana winds.

2594
04:02:22,046 --> 04:02:25,769
Scores of homes were gutted, and a mental health hospital was destroyed.

2595
04:02:26,389 --> 04:02:34,455
Here on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the charred ruins of houses are still smoking while dark choking smoke has closed a major motorway.

2596
04:02:35,015 --> 04:02:38,878
Ash is blowing through the air and there is a firefighting helicopter overhead.

2597
04:02:39,398 --> 04:02:46,844
And with forecasters warning that ferocious winds and low humidity will continue for several days, this could yet get a lot worse.

2598
04:02:47,204 --> 04:02:48,225
James Cook reporting.

2599
04:02:49,045 --> 04:02:57,155
Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

2600
04:02:57,715 --> 04:03:01,740
Alfred and Giorgio De Gionio and Vince Muscat were arrested on Monday.

2601
04:03:02,040 --> 04:03:03,622
They have pleaded not guilty.

2602
04:03:04,683 --> 04:03:06,545
World News from the BBC.

2603
04:03:08,421 --> 04:03:18,323
The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favour President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

2604
04:03:18,884 --> 04:03:27,806
The opposition candidate Salvador Nasrulla had appeared set for victory shortly after the election ten days ago, when the vote count was suddenly halted.

2605
04:03:28,903 --> 04:03:35,449
A new report says about 15,000 people a day are being forced to flee their homes in African conflict and disaster zones.

2606
04:03:36,069 --> 04:03:45,157
Figures published by the Norwegian Refugee Council and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre show that more than 12 million people in Africa are internally displaced.

2607
04:03:45,638 --> 04:03:51,063
Nearly four million left their homes last year, a quarter of them in the Democratic Republic of Congo alone.

2608
04:03:52,178 --> 04:03:59,703
Britain's most prestigious contemporary art award, the Turner Prize, has been won by an art professor who was born in Zanzibar, Lubaina Himid.

2609
04:04:00,243 --> 04:04:04,586
Judges praised her work, which explores the African diaspora and black creativity.

2610
04:04:05,087 --> 04:04:06,968
Rebecca Jones has this report.

2611
04:04:07,588 --> 04:04:12,852
So, the winner of this year's Turner Prize is Lubaina Himid.

2612
04:04:14,155 --> 04:04:23,103
And with that, Lubaina Himid made Turner Prize history, the first black woman to win the prize, and at the age of 63, the oldest.

2613
04:04:23,863 --> 04:04:35,153
She's an artist who paints, makes collages and installations, but all her work focuses on the black experience in Britain, highlighting racism and the legacy of colonialism.

2614
04:04:36,113 --> 04:04:41,638
France's biggest rock star, Johnny Alliday, has died aged 74 after a battle with lung cancer.

2615
04:04:42,178 --> 04:04:48,423
In a career spanning five decades, he sold more than 100 million records and headlined 50 major tours.

2616
04:04:49,003 --> 04:04:55,529
Influenced by the music of Elvis Presley, Johnny Alliday began his career in 1960, singing rock and roll in French.

2617
04:04:56,109 --> 04:05:01,854
Known as the French Elvis, he was hugely popular in the Francophone world, but less well known elsewhere.

2618
04:05:02,374 --> 04:05:03,915
He was married five times.

2619
04:05:04,898 --> 04:05:06,569
World News from the BBC.

2620
04:05:08,793 --> 04:05:14,657
Hello, I'm Jo Fidgen and this is Outlook, taking you around the world one extraordinary story at a time.

2621
04:05:15,198 --> 04:05:21,863
Today we'll be hanging out with rebel cows in Italy and foraging for fungi in Bhutan.

2622
04:05:22,783 --> 04:05:31,370
But our first story takes place in a prison camp run by children on the border of what is now South Sudan and in a church in Brisbane, Australia.

2623
04:05:31,610 --> 04:05:36,193
It links two men in ways that are both disturbing and inspiring.

2624
04:05:36,293 --> 04:05:37,674
Both were child soldiers in the 1980s

2625
04:05:38,795 --> 04:05:40,096
in Sudan's civil war.

2626
04:05:40,616 --> 04:05:43,917
The younger of them, Ayik Shute, was just 13 when he took up arms.

2627
04:05:44,317 --> 04:05:50,200
He did it because his father, brother and grandmother had all been killed and he wanted to fight back.

2628
04:05:50,440 --> 04:05:55,422
So he joined the Sudan People's Liberation Army and was sent to a training camp in Ethiopia.

2629
04:05:56,062 --> 04:05:57,523
The first few weeks was all right.

2630
04:05:58,613 --> 04:06:00,074
And then it just got worse.

2631
04:06:00,114 --> 04:06:01,215
We're getting trained.

2632
04:06:01,896 --> 04:06:03,557
It's on, like, Ethiopian mountain.

2633
04:06:03,998 --> 04:06:05,379
So we just climb up there.

2634
04:06:05,499 --> 04:06:09,162
Even if you're thirsty, you can't go to the river by yourselves.

2635
04:06:09,202 --> 04:06:11,945
When the boss say we got to go and drink, that's when you got to go.

2636
04:06:12,325 --> 04:06:15,308
It's like the old age, the stone age, you know?

2637
04:06:16,048 --> 04:06:18,249
Everything, we used to use rocks to cut trees.

2638
04:06:18,750 --> 04:06:19,490
So it's hard work.

2639
04:06:19,690 --> 04:06:22,492
And what were you expected to do apart from that?

2640
04:06:22,892 --> 04:06:24,213
Just getting trained every day.

2641
04:06:24,233 --> 04:06:24,833
That's it.

2642
04:06:25,113 --> 04:06:26,254
Do what the boss say.

2643
04:06:26,354 --> 04:06:29,776
In the morning, wake up around 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock in the morning.

2644
04:06:30,436 --> 04:06:32,237
You go until 12 o'clock.

2645
04:06:32,597 --> 04:06:35,119
Just getting trained in the mountain with using a stick.

2646
04:06:35,780 --> 04:06:36,721
to haul it like a gun.

2647
04:06:37,341 --> 04:06:41,124
You know, how you attack when you make ambush, all that sort of thing.

2648
04:06:41,184 --> 04:06:44,066
And it was just too much running on the mountain, no water.

2649
04:06:44,686 --> 04:06:47,228
And you only eat once in the morning, and that's it.

2650
04:06:47,468 --> 04:06:48,069
What would you eat?

2651
04:06:48,409 --> 04:06:48,789
Corn.

2652
04:06:48,809 --> 04:06:50,490
We used to boil corn or rice.

2653
04:06:51,391 --> 04:06:54,473
And then we make our own soup or whatever.

2654
04:06:54,493 --> 04:06:59,977
We're going to get some tree leaves somewhere, because we're all from different part of Sudan.

2655
04:07:00,317 --> 04:07:04,580
So when I came there, you learn to eat other food from other cultures.

2656
04:07:05,504 --> 04:07:08,965
You know, other culture that were there with me, other children that were there with me.

2657
04:07:09,145 --> 04:07:13,947
When you graduated, as it were, from sticks to guns, what was expected of you?

2658
04:07:14,827 --> 04:07:15,587
Just get a fight.

2659
04:07:16,047 --> 04:07:16,427
That was it.

2660
04:07:16,747 --> 04:07:17,408
And would you fight?

2661
04:07:18,308 --> 04:07:18,688
Yeah.

2662
04:07:20,189 --> 04:07:21,589
I've been attacked so many times.

2663
04:07:21,789 --> 04:07:23,610
And I've seen people dying.

2664
04:07:23,630 --> 04:07:24,970
It's too much.

2665
04:07:24,990 --> 04:07:27,971
When I used to think of them, I used to cry.

2666
04:07:28,071 --> 04:07:31,172
And then after a while, I think it's fading.

2667
04:07:32,874 --> 04:07:37,738
The memories is there but it's not as bad as I used to think because I'm grown up now.

2668
04:07:38,059 --> 04:07:39,840
But the punishment was so bad.

2669
04:07:40,401 --> 04:07:46,566
The punishment was to be sent to a prison at the camp where another child soldier called Anyang had been put in charge.

2670
04:07:47,167 --> 04:07:50,750
He and the other young prison guards were known to torture the boys.

2671
04:07:51,490 --> 04:07:58,857
Sometimes you have to stand on one feet and every time you take the ground with the other feet you got four people around you that would just whip you

2672
04:08:00,487 --> 04:08:02,789
And sometimes you get tied up, like hogtie.

2673
04:08:03,289 --> 04:08:04,611
You're only sitting on your chest.

2674
04:08:04,631 --> 04:08:08,414
They'll just leave you there for hours, six, seven hours tied up.

2675
04:08:08,815 --> 04:08:10,897
You know, the skin does peel off a little bit.

2676
04:08:11,618 --> 04:08:15,061
And when you see the skin peel off, he'll put chili in it.

2677
04:08:15,081 --> 04:08:16,923
He'll just rub chili in it.

2678
04:08:18,395 --> 04:08:30,865
And he'd done it, he'd done it to another child, so I was there with me, and he was tired after so long, and chile was put there, and got infected, and then the doctors couldn't do anything about it, so ended up getting amputated.

2679
04:08:31,466 --> 04:08:33,447
You had chile rubbed in your wounds as well, did you?

2680
04:08:33,828 --> 04:08:35,569
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it happened to me all the time.

2681
04:08:35,629 --> 04:08:38,772
Can you even describe what that feels like?

2682
04:08:39,332 --> 04:08:42,955
All I remember, I cry, then you can't cry anymore, you know what I mean?

2683
04:08:44,512 --> 04:08:47,313
You know, you want to, and your lunk is gone.

2684
04:08:47,333 --> 04:08:48,854
There's nothing that can come out of it.

2685
04:08:49,434 --> 04:08:54,637
Anyang, Iyik's torturer, was a child himself, just a few years older than his prisoner.

2686
04:08:55,397 --> 04:08:59,679
I know that he was just bigger than me, and he had the power.

2687
04:08:59,899 --> 04:09:05,021
When you would see Anyang, what kind of emotions would come to you?

2688
04:09:05,842 --> 04:09:06,842
Back then, there's nothing.

2689
04:09:07,082 --> 04:09:10,924
I'd just stand up and just salute him, because that was it.

2690
04:09:11,084 --> 04:09:12,885
I was useless at the time, but inside,

2691
04:09:13,619 --> 04:09:15,900
I used to pray that I want to get deployed with them.

2692
04:09:16,461 --> 04:09:17,562
I want to go to war with them.

2693
04:09:18,322 --> 04:09:19,323
That was my prayer.

2694
04:09:19,363 --> 04:09:20,543
That was what I used to pray for.

2695
04:09:20,924 --> 04:09:21,144
Why?

2696
04:09:22,144 --> 04:09:23,545
Because I wanted to kill them.

2697
04:09:24,626 --> 04:09:26,207
So bad, so bad.

2698
04:09:26,227 --> 04:09:32,031
You know, no one has ever, ever, ever put me through what I went through in the rebel.

2699
04:09:32,391 --> 04:09:35,553
No one has ever, ever beat me up like Aung San Suu Kyi did.

2700
04:09:36,365 --> 04:09:44,107
Ayik kept trying to run away and each time was caught and punished by Anyang until he'd finished his training and was sent off to fight.

2701
04:09:44,127 --> 04:09:55,631
Ayik was on the front lines for four years before his older sister managed to get him away to Kenya to a refugee camp and to his joy he and his relatives were granted a visa to go and live in Australia.

2702
04:09:57,532 --> 04:09:58,652
The first night we came here

2703
04:09:59,817 --> 04:10:01,078
Oh, man, the sausages.

2704
04:10:01,458 --> 04:10:04,721
And I have never eaten so many sausages in my life until I came here.

2705
04:10:05,081 --> 04:10:05,942
I even threw up.

2706
04:10:06,623 --> 04:10:11,907
I went there, threw up, and then came and ate, because I was thinking, maybe this is just, they're doing it for tonight.

2707
04:10:12,367 --> 04:10:14,209
Tomorrow is going to be just the same.

2708
04:10:14,249 --> 04:10:15,710
We wouldn't be treated like visitors.

2709
04:10:16,210 --> 04:10:20,614
And then the next day, I wake up in the morning, there's breakfast, again, sausages.

2710
04:10:21,374 --> 04:10:22,815
I don't even eat sausages anymore.

2711
04:10:22,835 --> 04:10:23,756
I hate sausages.

2712
04:10:24,116 --> 04:10:25,117
You overdosed on them.

2713
04:10:25,597 --> 04:10:26,298
Yeah, I think.

2714
04:10:26,358 --> 04:10:27,019
I think I did.

2715
04:10:28,336 --> 04:10:30,277
What else did you like about Australia?

2716
04:10:31,138 --> 04:10:33,360
Oh, it's just that you'd be able to sleep.

2717
04:10:33,380 --> 04:10:35,202
You wouldn't hear a gun.

2718
04:10:35,762 --> 04:10:41,748
The first time I heard fireworks, being an ex-child soldier, when I hear bang, bang, I'm just scared.

2719
04:10:41,848 --> 04:10:43,209
I'm looking around, what's going on?

2720
04:10:43,569 --> 04:10:47,092
And then my brother's little nephew says, yeah, it's the fireworks.

2721
04:10:47,453 --> 04:10:49,715
They were kids, and I just get used to it.

2722
04:10:50,176 --> 04:10:52,723
If I hear a gun now, I probably wouldn't even think it's a gun.

2723
04:10:52,763 --> 04:10:53,966
I'd probably think it's a firework.

2724
04:10:54,307 --> 04:10:56,553
You have the most amazing Australian accent.

2725
04:10:56,774 --> 04:10:57,897
I mean, you really have.

2726
04:10:59,382 --> 04:11:00,343
become Australian, huh?

2727
04:11:01,043 --> 04:11:02,304
Oh, not really.

2728
04:11:02,764 --> 04:11:06,307
Maybe because you're a Pommie, that's why you think I sound like an Aussie.

2729
04:11:06,327 --> 04:11:11,691
But if you hear, if you live in Australia, you probably think, nah, I don't even know my accent.

2730
04:11:11,971 --> 04:11:14,092
You go to church in Australia, in Brisbane?

2731
04:11:14,112 --> 04:11:14,953
Yeah, I go to church.

2732
04:11:15,353 --> 04:11:18,775
Tell us about what happened in church a couple of years after you got there.

2733
04:11:19,036 --> 04:11:20,697
A few years ago, I went to church.

2734
04:11:21,557 --> 04:11:22,378
I think it was a wedding.

2735
04:11:23,232 --> 04:11:25,293
I knew a few people there, hello, how are you doing?

2736
04:11:25,353 --> 04:11:26,534
And then we just had to pray.

2737
04:11:26,854 --> 04:11:32,457
After everything was done, you know when people shake hands, okay, see you Joe, see you Michael.

2738
04:11:32,897 --> 04:11:35,858
And then I look to my right, and I saw this face.

2739
04:11:37,139 --> 04:11:38,980
And I thought, oh no, what's going on?

2740
04:11:39,500 --> 04:11:45,583
And then I look again, and then I realized the face that I was looking at, it was Anyang.

2741
04:11:46,544 --> 04:11:49,846
My mind was telling me, this guy should be dead.

2742
04:11:50,166 --> 04:11:52,587
He should have died back home because I thought

2743
04:11:53,390 --> 04:11:55,835
If someone didn't kill him, who got killed in the war?

2744
04:11:56,416 --> 04:11:57,217
But it was him.

2745
04:11:57,237 --> 04:12:01,646
The moment you saw him, you recognised him as the man who'd run the prison, did you?

2746
04:12:01,786 --> 04:12:03,169
At first I thought it was a flashback.

2747
04:12:04,456 --> 04:12:08,098
And I shook my head like that, wake up, wake up, I was like, what's going on?

2748
04:12:08,158 --> 04:12:10,239
And then I look, I said, oh yeah, that's him.

2749
04:12:10,259 --> 04:12:13,360
I said, oh, this is the guy that used to torture me.

2750
04:12:13,840 --> 04:12:24,605
And this is the guy, every time we run away, he'll send the guard to go and get us, and bring us back there, and then lock us up for up to four weeks, and then release us into training again.

2751
04:12:24,625 --> 04:12:26,346
Oh, this, that's him.

2752
04:12:26,366 --> 04:12:30,428
Okay, I think I should kill him.

2753
04:12:31,448 --> 04:12:32,068
But how?

2754
04:12:32,549 --> 04:12:33,529
And then I start thinking,

2755
04:12:34,550 --> 04:12:37,532
He's in church, and then I'm in Australia.

2756
04:12:37,872 --> 04:12:41,534
If I kill him now, I'll probably get locked up for the rest of my life.

2757
04:12:41,954 --> 04:12:43,595
All these sort of things were going on in my mind.

2758
04:12:43,995 --> 04:12:47,337
And then the time was over anyway, because it was the end of the service.

2759
04:12:47,857 --> 04:12:49,398
And then I never went to that church again.

2760
04:12:50,058 --> 04:12:51,319
Because he might be there?

2761
04:12:52,279 --> 04:12:52,820
Because of him.

2762
04:12:53,260 --> 04:12:55,101
I was very angry, very angry.

2763
04:12:55,929 --> 04:12:58,011
I wanted to kill him, but I just didn't know how to do it.

2764
04:12:58,411 --> 04:13:01,853
You know, if I found him in Africa, I think it would have been a different story.

2765
04:13:01,873 --> 04:13:07,337
If I found him where he had no power and it was in Africa, that's it.

2766
04:13:07,798 --> 04:13:12,441
Did you have anyone in Australia to talk to about it, to talk about your feelings and what you were going through?

2767
04:13:13,263 --> 04:13:15,084
No, I didn't want to talk to no one.

2768
04:13:15,744 --> 04:13:18,265
I just kept it to myself, even my own family.

2769
04:13:18,785 --> 04:13:20,546
My own family didn't even know about it.

2770
04:13:20,906 --> 04:13:25,528
Two years, I think it was, after that church sighting, you see Anyang again.

2771
04:13:25,909 --> 04:13:27,029
What were the circumstances?

2772
04:13:27,269 --> 04:13:29,110
It was at a party, a friend's place.

2773
04:13:30,118 --> 04:13:31,699
And then I was drinking.

2774
04:13:32,239 --> 04:13:34,781
And then when I'm drinking, you know, I'm a happy person.

2775
04:13:35,601 --> 04:13:37,242
I said, hey, how you doing?

2776
04:13:37,663 --> 04:13:39,184
I said, yeah, you remember me?

2777
04:13:39,204 --> 04:13:41,605
And he said, yeah, of course I remember.

2778
04:13:42,245 --> 04:13:45,948
And then I said, man, I swear to God, you're lucky.

2779
04:13:46,428 --> 04:13:47,989
You know, Australia saved your life.

2780
04:13:48,889 --> 04:13:50,951
From there, I went, I left.

2781
04:13:51,411 --> 04:13:52,091
And that was it.

2782
04:13:53,072 --> 04:13:54,453
That was the second time I saw him.

2783
04:13:55,213 --> 04:13:58,215
Ayat, can you introduce the man sitting next to you right now?

2784
04:14:00,223 --> 04:14:01,164
Okay.

2785
04:14:02,386 --> 04:14:09,616
Joe, meet Anyang, Anyang Rang, my ex-boss when I was a child soldier.

2786
04:14:09,636 --> 04:14:11,318
He's here sitting next to me.

2787
04:14:12,159 --> 04:14:12,780
Anyang, hello.

2788
04:14:12,800 --> 04:14:13,982
Hello.

2789
04:14:16,526 --> 04:14:23,710
What can you tell us about seeing Ayik at that party, talking to him, saying you remembered him?

2790
04:14:24,390 --> 04:14:26,231
What went through your head?

2791
04:14:26,832 --> 04:14:32,594
That was not a good meeting at all, to be honest, because you can judge somebody by their look.

2792
04:14:34,235 --> 04:14:39,498
Ayik was coming near to me while he's really, really angry.

2793
04:14:40,913 --> 04:14:44,183
So when I see that way, I didn't wait.

2794
04:14:44,604 --> 04:14:46,168
I walked away from him.

2795
04:14:46,928 --> 04:14:48,529
Well, Ayik couldn't forget about it.

2796
04:14:48,549 --> 04:14:50,049
It preyed on his mind.

2797
04:14:50,269 --> 04:14:56,171
And then he saw an advert for a new television programme on the Australian channel SBS, Look Me In The Eye.

2798
04:14:56,591 --> 04:15:07,075
They were trying to find people who were estranged or had an issue to meet and try to solve their differences through a mediation technique where the parties stare at each other but don't talk, at least at first.

2799
04:15:07,655 --> 04:15:10,516
Ayik applied and was invited onto the show.

2800
04:15:10,536 --> 04:15:12,477
It's like a warehouse.

2801
04:15:12,937 --> 04:15:14,757
There's two seats and that's it.

2802
04:15:15,078 --> 04:15:16,138
So I was sitting there

2803
04:15:16,910 --> 04:15:19,292
And then I can hear footsteps.

2804
04:15:19,392 --> 04:15:20,452
There was someone coming.

2805
04:15:21,393 --> 04:15:23,955
And that person came and sat opposite to me.

2806
04:15:24,135 --> 04:15:28,197
And I had to raise my head and look straight into his eye.

2807
04:15:28,818 --> 04:15:29,818
And that's where we began.

2808
04:15:30,239 --> 04:15:32,260
And then from there, the tears start coming.

2809
04:15:32,280 --> 04:15:35,862
Because I went back to when I was in my younger age, 13.

2810
04:15:37,323 --> 04:15:38,684
I went back to that age.

2811
04:15:39,125 --> 04:15:44,188
And all I can remember was, it was that face that used to beat me up.

2812
04:15:45,200 --> 04:15:47,841
The phase that I suffer under, I didn't see any change.

2813
04:15:48,461 --> 04:15:51,522
Then I just break down, tears start coming, and that's it.

2814
04:15:52,042 --> 04:15:54,323
And then what did you do when you were staring at Ayik?

2815
04:15:55,163 --> 04:15:56,264
I was really shaking.

2816
04:15:57,204 --> 04:16:03,946
I was thinking, if I go and sit next to Ayik, I was not sure what reaction Ayik will have.

2817
04:16:04,706 --> 04:16:12,729
And in the beginning, to be honest, Ayik's reaction was not good either to me, because he was crying, upset.

2818
04:16:13,383 --> 04:16:16,606
I was even scared that Ayik can do something to me.

2819
04:16:17,446 --> 04:16:23,351
So that was a really hard time for me to sit with Ayik and look face to face.

2820
04:16:24,351 --> 04:16:26,933
That was really a scary moment for me.

2821
04:16:27,053 --> 04:16:28,114
So you were afraid of him?

2822
04:16:28,775 --> 04:16:29,015
Yes.

2823
04:16:29,695 --> 04:16:31,577
Were you sorry for what you had done to him?

2824
04:16:32,197 --> 04:16:35,800
I was sorry, but I didn't did it intention to Ayik.

2825
04:16:36,631 --> 04:16:40,354
That's the order given to me, and I have to implement the order.

2826
04:16:40,654 --> 04:16:42,015
Did you have to be so cruel?

2827
04:16:42,656 --> 04:16:51,002
All I say, if my big boss told me, Nyang, your soldiers have to do this, I have to make sure that they done what I was told.

2828
04:16:51,562 --> 04:16:57,407
And you didn't have any doubts about the kind of pain, torture you were inflicting on those boys?

2829
04:16:58,027 --> 04:17:01,410
To be honest to you, I asked for the forgiveness.

2830
04:17:02,070 --> 04:17:05,813
And I told him that what I did, I knew is wrong.

2831
04:17:06,808 --> 04:17:09,269
But I was having a big boss ahead of me.

2832
04:17:10,329 --> 04:17:16,592
When you heard that from Anyang, when he said, look, you know, I had a boss who was giving me orders, how did you respond to that?

2833
04:17:17,252 --> 04:17:19,093
I think maybe he had his own problem.

2834
04:17:19,213 --> 04:17:20,213
I really don't understand.

2835
04:17:20,233 --> 04:17:29,177
You know, I realize now he's a good person, but there is something that I think that down the track Anyang needs to look into.

2836
04:17:29,437 --> 04:17:32,498
Treatment, because he's never been treated with anything at all.

2837
04:17:33,128 --> 04:17:39,995
It's clear that there are still many issues between you and yet, Ayik, you said, I realise he is a good person.

2838
04:17:40,676 --> 04:17:41,557
Where has that come from?

2839
04:17:41,577 --> 04:17:42,998
I forgive him.

2840
04:17:43,058 --> 04:17:45,721
I forgive him because he's got two grandkids.

2841
04:17:46,342 --> 04:17:47,523
I have one little boy.

2842
04:17:48,420 --> 04:17:50,701
And I know how much I love my little boy now.

2843
04:17:50,821 --> 04:17:52,302
So I just think the same with Anyang.

2844
04:17:52,362 --> 04:17:55,423
I know how much he loves his kids, how much he loves his grandkids.

2845
04:17:56,203 --> 04:18:00,685
And if I hold all the grudges for the rest of my life, it's me hurting myself.

2846
04:18:01,186 --> 04:18:04,747
Because everywhere I'm going to go here in Brisbane, I'm going to see him and I get angry.

2847
04:18:05,067 --> 04:18:07,808
That means that I'm the one hurting myself every time.

2848
04:18:08,289 --> 04:18:09,209
That's why I forgive him.

2849
04:18:10,009 --> 04:18:13,351
And after I've forgiven him, you know, we become good friends.

2850
04:18:14,283 --> 04:18:15,504
I go to his house now.

2851
04:18:15,524 --> 04:18:17,026
I sleep there.

2852
04:18:17,366 --> 04:18:19,268
Every time I go to his house, there's no spare bed.

2853
04:18:19,328 --> 04:18:20,469
I try to sleep on the couch.

2854
04:18:20,489 --> 04:18:22,210
He says, no, you sleep in the bed.

2855
04:18:22,230 --> 04:18:24,312
I say, all right, I'll sleep in the bed.

2856
04:18:24,693 --> 04:18:25,553
They'll give me food.

2857
04:18:25,613 --> 04:18:26,454
They give me anything.

2858
04:18:26,634 --> 04:18:30,058
If I get into any problem now, I think Anyang will stand up for me, I swear to God.

2859
04:18:30,138 --> 04:18:31,939
And if he get in trouble, I'll stand up for him.

2860
04:18:32,360 --> 04:18:39,586
Do you think that there is somehow a special bond between you, an element of your friendship which is rooted in this

2861
04:18:40,627 --> 04:18:42,709
shared experience you had all those years ago?

2862
04:18:43,069 --> 04:18:51,035
Yeah, that's the only one I can relate to in a way that this guy understands me as a child because my own family don't even know me.

2863
04:18:54,138 --> 04:19:00,542
It's because... Sorry.

2864
04:19:01,103 --> 04:19:04,125
Honestly, I've got the best family in the whole world.

2865
04:19:04,165 --> 04:19:07,328
My family will look after you before they look after me.

2866
04:19:07,488 --> 04:19:10,190
Not because they don't love me, that's how much they care.

2867
04:19:11,687 --> 04:19:13,068
They're a very caring family.

2868
04:19:13,469 --> 04:19:14,269
They're better than me.

2869
04:19:16,151 --> 04:19:17,352
All of them are better than me.

2870
04:19:18,633 --> 04:19:22,035
But the thing is, the bad thing is, I don't have a bond with them.

2871
04:19:22,776 --> 04:19:25,538
I can go to my mum's house now, just stay there.

2872
04:19:26,499 --> 04:19:28,520
After an hour, I want to get out of the house.

2873
04:19:29,161 --> 04:19:35,806
Not because I don't love them, but something just takes me out.

2874
04:19:36,627 --> 04:19:38,968
There's no bond because I grew away from them.

2875
04:19:39,569 --> 04:19:40,950
The best moment of my life.

2876
04:19:41,584 --> 04:19:42,745
that I should have spent with them.

2877
04:19:43,786 --> 04:19:45,067
I spent it in the rebel.

2878
04:19:47,208 --> 04:19:48,910
That's the only sad thing about this.

2879
04:19:49,330 --> 04:19:52,112
But apart from that, I forgive Anyang.

2880
04:19:53,533 --> 04:19:55,955
And I have so much to achieve, you know.

2881
04:19:55,975 --> 04:19:59,978
I want to just move on and try to build a bond with my family now.

2882
04:20:00,358 --> 04:20:01,219
That's the next one.

2883
04:20:01,679 --> 04:20:05,302
You have a son now, and you can be there with him.

2884
04:20:05,422 --> 04:20:06,843
You can be a father to him.

2885
04:20:07,970 --> 04:20:10,252
Yeah, I have my son's name Freeman.

2886
04:20:10,672 --> 04:20:11,073
Freeman?

2887
04:20:11,813 --> 04:20:15,436
Yeah, Freeman, like just Freeman, like a free man, you know, that's when he was born.

2888
04:20:15,496 --> 04:20:21,721
I thought, okay, I talked to his mama, said, I think the only name will make me happy after what I went through.

2889
04:20:21,901 --> 04:20:24,684
And I think Freeman is a free man.

2890
04:20:24,724 --> 04:20:27,106
And I'm a free man now, because I'm in a free country.

2891
04:20:27,326 --> 04:20:28,487
So I named him Freeman.

2892
04:20:29,548 --> 04:20:31,089
And he's one of the best kid I know.

2893
04:20:31,309 --> 04:20:31,830
How old is he?

2894
04:20:32,170 --> 04:20:32,330
He's 11.

2895
04:20:33,891 --> 04:20:34,632
What kind of boy is he?

2896
04:20:36,007 --> 04:20:39,930
Oh, he's a funny boy, you know, he's got that sense of humor, you know.

2897
04:20:39,970 --> 04:20:50,018
For example, sometime when I pick him up, we're driving down the street, and then I stop at the light, and I saw this one day we're driving, and there's these two girls looking at us.

2898
04:20:50,458 --> 04:20:52,440
I said, Freeman, look at them girls, they're checking me out.

2899
04:20:52,940 --> 04:20:56,163
And he said, Dad, because you're ugly.

2900
04:20:56,963 --> 04:20:57,523
You know what I mean?

2901
04:20:57,563 --> 04:20:58,664
All these little things.

2902
04:20:59,184 --> 04:21:01,084
I say no for him because I'm good looking.

2903
04:21:01,324 --> 04:21:03,325
I tell him if I was ugly, your mum wouldn't pick me.

2904
04:21:03,525 --> 04:21:05,205
So he's got that humour, you know?

2905
04:21:05,225 --> 04:21:06,245
He makes me laugh.

2906
04:21:06,266 --> 04:21:08,926
Ayik and Anyang meet up often now.

2907
04:21:08,986 --> 04:21:12,347
They talk about their past and they started writing a book together.

2908
04:21:12,747 --> 04:21:14,128
It means a lot to Anyang.

2909
04:21:14,668 --> 04:21:19,149
Now I'm working hard to build a good relationship between me and Ayik.

2910
04:21:20,306 --> 04:21:29,870
Because I ignored what I did, and he's the one who forgave me, so it's now my turn to do something to convince him that I was not that bad.

2911
04:21:30,550 --> 04:21:32,711
And what did you do to convince him that you're not that bad?

2912
04:21:32,731 --> 04:21:36,012
Yeah, like I have to talk with him every single day.

2913
04:21:36,753 --> 04:21:42,875
I have to come and see his child, and he does come and see my kid too.

2914
04:21:44,104 --> 04:21:50,488
So, and we just discuss the life, what should we achieve in the life ahead of us.

2915
04:21:50,869 --> 04:21:53,190
I wish we didn't go through what we went through.

2916
04:21:53,210 --> 04:21:55,652
I wish we started on a good foot.

2917
04:21:55,852 --> 04:22:00,836
It would have been better, but my world number one enemy become a good friend to me now.

2918
04:22:01,316 --> 04:22:02,497
I think the ending

2919
04:22:03,609 --> 04:22:05,470
It's really good.

2920
04:22:06,210 --> 04:22:12,733
A remarkable story of two child soldiers from Sudan and their reconciliation in Australia many years later.

2921
04:22:12,753 --> 04:22:18,056
Ayik Shute and Anyang Rang, and you can see a photo of them together on our Facebook page.

2922
04:22:19,116 --> 04:22:26,220
You're listening to Outlook on the BBC World Service.

2923
04:22:26,400 --> 04:22:31,422
To get in touch with any comments, our email address outlook at bbc.com.

2924
04:22:36,915 --> 04:22:42,199
Now up in the highest mountains of Bhutan, there's an underground fungus that's very rare and very valuable.

2925
04:22:42,660 --> 04:22:47,343
Cordyceps are a group of parasitic fungi that grow mainly on the bodies of insects.

2926
04:22:47,704 --> 04:22:52,828
Some of them are worth twice their weight in gold, and people sometimes risk their lives to find them.

2927
04:22:53,528 --> 04:22:59,733
Not everyone going foraging is doing so legally, but Outlook's Canada Beverage has been to meet someone who is above board.

2928
04:23:00,294 --> 04:23:01,034
He's called Chawton.

2929
04:23:07,523 --> 04:23:13,307
Chawton lives in Nashville, a tiny, picturesque village in Bumthang Valley in central Bhutan.

2930
04:23:13,987 --> 04:23:18,510
It's as remote a place as you can imagine, with towering mountains all around.

2931
04:23:23,114 --> 04:23:28,737
He and his family have just returned from a month's camping, up where the snow line starts and the air is thin.

2932
04:23:29,378 --> 04:23:34,381
He's been collecting this year's harvest of cordyceps and invites me to join him for lunch.

2933
04:23:36,906 --> 04:23:44,300
taking our shoes off and going up some large wooden steps hello nice to meet you

2934
04:23:46,348 --> 04:23:48,470
So everyone's cooking.

2935
04:23:48,750 --> 04:23:49,550
Local dish, ma'am.

2936
04:23:49,750 --> 04:23:50,211
Local dish.

2937
04:23:50,231 --> 04:23:50,771
What is it?

2938
04:23:50,851 --> 04:23:51,712
Flat noodles.

2939
04:23:52,412 --> 04:23:53,073
Flat noodles.

2940
04:23:53,153 --> 04:23:54,173
Oh, they look delicious.

2941
04:23:54,233 --> 04:23:55,374
Is that what we're having for lunch?

2942
04:23:55,794 --> 04:23:57,195
Yes.

2943
04:23:57,335 --> 04:24:01,278
Chorten's daughter and wife bring out an incredible array of sumptuous food.

2944
04:24:01,298 --> 04:24:06,982
A meal like this would once have been impossible for this family, says Chorten.

2945
04:24:07,542 --> 04:24:09,984
That was until he discovered cordyceps.

2946
04:24:13,387 --> 04:24:20,656
When I was young and herding cattle, I knew about codices, but I didn't realize them, that they were so valuable.

2947
04:24:21,677 --> 04:24:25,561
The demand for them was started by the Chinese, who used them medicinally.

2948
04:24:26,462 --> 04:24:30,983
Cordyceps grow in the fertile high plateaus and mountains of Tibet and Bhutan.

2949
04:24:31,643 --> 04:24:33,704
They're antioxidant and antiviral.

2950
04:24:34,124 --> 04:24:41,906
It's for this reason and their scarcity that they fetch such high sums of money, sometimes priced at twice their weight in gold.

2951
04:24:43,706 --> 04:24:45,427
We've got some cordyceps in front of us.

2952
04:24:45,667 --> 04:24:46,867
They're very strange looking.

2953
04:24:46,927 --> 04:24:52,109
It's sort of like a caterpillar with a long strangled root coming out of it.

2954
04:24:53,629 --> 04:24:57,192
The odd appearance of the cordyceps is due to its unique nature.

2955
04:24:58,152 --> 04:25:03,877
It starts life as an underground dwelling caterpillar that becomes infected by a parasitic fungus.

2956
04:25:04,717 --> 04:25:09,601
The fungus engulfs the body of the caterpillar, leaving only its exoskeleton intact.

2957
04:25:10,161 --> 04:25:16,346
Then, at the start of spring, the fungus explodes through the caterpillar's head, poking a stalk up through the grass.

2958
04:25:19,909 --> 04:25:24,412
By looking at the top of the fungus, I can tell whether or not it is cordyceps.

2959
04:25:24,653 --> 04:25:28,875
It has a thing that looks like a black blade of grass poking out of the soil.

2960
04:25:29,876 --> 04:25:35,680
You have to be very close to the ground and be on your hands and knees with your face about a foot from the ground.

2961
04:25:36,561 --> 04:25:38,262
They are very difficult to spot.

2962
04:25:38,762 --> 04:25:44,526
I remember the first one I found, I was so happy because I was thinking how much money I would get.

2963
04:25:45,507 --> 04:25:46,988
They literally are like gold.

2964
04:25:47,008 --> 04:25:50,189
But nowadays, I don't think so much about the money.

2965
04:25:50,629 --> 04:25:55,650
I just feel immense happiness just to see one cordyceps because they are precious to me.

2966
04:25:56,311 --> 04:26:01,772
Searching for cordyceps takes place from early May until late June, up where the snow line starts.

2967
04:26:02,333 --> 04:26:05,454
Chawton shows me the track he takes up to the mountain pass.

2968
04:26:05,994 --> 04:26:06,814
Wow, look at that.

2969
04:26:06,874 --> 04:26:07,734
That's so steep.

2970
04:26:07,794 --> 04:26:12,316
How long does it take you to get up to where we can see just the top of the mountain?

2971
04:26:13,317 --> 04:26:18,881
To reach the summit where the snow line is, it takes three nights and four days.

2972
04:26:19,522 --> 04:26:28,469
I pack enough food to eat and drink, and a raincoat and heavy woolen clothes to protect against the cold if it snows.

2973
04:26:29,770 --> 04:26:32,032
We also need a tent and a sleeping bag.

2974
04:26:33,277 --> 04:26:34,498
We have to take horses.

2975
04:26:35,339 --> 04:26:39,603
When we camp, it can be hard to get wood for the fire and to pitch our tent.

2976
04:26:40,264 --> 04:26:42,546
Sometimes I'll be going with 20 people.

2977
04:26:43,286 --> 04:26:46,209
Sometimes it can be as many as 200 to 300 people.

2978
04:26:46,489 --> 04:26:48,932
Looking for cordyceps is not an easy task.

2979
04:26:49,452 --> 04:26:56,654
The altitude and vertiginous terrain means even the most experienced locals may lose their lives, and many do.

2980
04:26:57,314 --> 04:27:04,377
Once Chawton has collected all his cordyceps, he brings them down the mountain and waits for the auction date to be set, when he can sell them.

2981
04:27:05,037 --> 04:27:15,060
When he first started selling them, he was making around US$4,000 a year, but in recent years his profits have been far less because the fungus is getting harder to find.

2982
04:27:15,800 --> 04:27:18,621
This year's crop was even smaller than usual.

2983
04:27:22,522 --> 04:27:25,025
This must be around 130 grams.

2984
04:27:25,386 --> 04:27:28,330
This would be worth around 1000 US dollars.

2985
04:27:28,470 --> 04:27:31,153
And how has it changed your life, finding these cordyceps?

2986
04:27:31,433 --> 04:27:38,843
I paid for my house, the car parked outside, the TV, and the education of my children with money from cordyceps.

2987
04:27:39,734 --> 04:27:43,516
It has improved everybody's living standard so much.

2988
04:27:43,836 --> 04:27:47,037
We have everything we need because of this amazing fungus.

2989
04:27:48,077 --> 04:27:57,621
I'm hopeful that I'll be able to continue for the next five years, and then I'm not sure whether my body will endure the challenges of walking up to the mountains.

2990
04:27:58,081 --> 04:28:00,562
If my children are going to carry on, it is good.

2991
04:28:01,203 --> 04:28:03,544
If not, I guess that will be the end of cordyceps.

2992
04:28:04,204 --> 04:28:06,665
Chawton, speaking to Outlook's Canada Beverage.

2993
04:28:08,095 --> 04:28:11,557
This is the BBC World Service, where science lives.

2994
04:28:12,157 --> 04:28:13,238
For the creative.

2995
04:28:13,458 --> 04:28:17,900
With drones, we can get blood anywhere in the country in 15 to 20 minutes.

2996
04:28:18,160 --> 04:28:19,021
The curious.

2997
04:28:19,101 --> 04:28:26,164
When we looked at our twins, we found there were certain microbes that were always present in the skinnier twins than in the overweight twins.

2998
04:28:26,305 --> 04:28:27,405
For nature lovers.

2999
04:28:27,685 --> 04:28:32,908
With our extensive agriculture, our use of pesticides, this could become a really big problem.

3000
04:28:32,968 --> 04:28:34,669
And forward thinkers.

3001
04:28:34,909 --> 04:28:39,592
It demonstrates what I think robotics is for, which is helping us to understand ourselves.

3002
04:28:40,032 --> 04:28:40,892
The thoughtful.

3003
04:28:41,292 --> 04:28:47,636
Everything that's already happened has happened, and everything that's going to happen has already taken place, and we're just a little piece of it now.

3004
04:28:47,996 --> 04:28:49,297
And the adventurous.

3005
04:28:49,337 --> 04:28:56,281
We keep finding ever more compelling evidence for not only water on Mars, but now even the potential for life.

3006
04:28:56,741 --> 04:28:58,442

3008
04:29:08,195 --> 04:29:13,938
Coming up on Outlook, what happens when a herd of cattle run away from their owners and live wild for years?

3009
04:29:16,339 --> 04:29:20,141
The most interesting thing about the rebel cows is that their behaviour changed.

3010
04:29:20,662 --> 04:29:22,643
They turn into a wild herd.

3011
04:29:22,963 --> 04:29:26,965
They hide in the forest during the day and only come out to graze at night.

3012
04:29:27,345 --> 04:29:28,986
They are extremely agile.

3013
04:29:29,327 --> 04:29:31,528
They run and jump around like deer.

3014
04:29:33,465 --> 04:29:36,941
more about the rebel cows still at large after the news.

3015

officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

3018
04:29:47,578 --> 04:29:53,141
He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

3019
04:29:53,581 --> 04:29:55,442
The decision will break with years of U.S.

3020
04:29:55,482 --> 04:30:00,024
policy on the status of the disputed city, as well as the international consensus.

3021
04:30:00,585 --> 04:30:04,027
Arab states have warned the decision could provoke violence in the Muslim world.

3022
04:30:05,047 --> 04:30:15,600
Russia has reacted angrily to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban its participation in next year's Winter Olympics, following a report accusing it of systematic doping.

3023
04:30:16,121 --> 04:30:20,306
The deputy speaker of the Russian parliament called the ban a humiliation and an insult.

3024
04:30:21,347 --> 04:30:26,451
Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

3025
04:30:27,052 --> 04:30:32,036
One fire in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, trebled in size in just a few hours.

3026
04:30:32,536 --> 04:30:37,800
At least 150 buildings have been destroyed, and a quarter of a million homes are without power.

3027
04:30:38,821 --> 04:30:46,746
Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the campaigning journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

3028
04:30:47,267 --> 04:30:51,109
Alfred and Giorgio De Giorgio and Vince Muscat were arrested on Monday.

3029
04:30:51,470 --> 04:30:52,931
They have pleaded not guilty.

3030
04:30:54,027 --> 04:31:03,653
The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of the presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favour President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

3031
04:31:04,213 --> 04:31:11,117
The opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla, had appeared on course for victory after the election, when the count was suddenly halted.

3032
04:31:12,336 --> 04:31:16,379
France's biggest rock star, Johnny Allardy, has died from lung cancer at the age of 74.

3033
04:31:17,739 --> 04:31:23,983
In a career spanning five decades, he'd sold more than 100 million records and headlined 50 major concerts.

3034
04:31:24,624 --> 04:31:33,789
Known as the French Elvis, he was hugely popular in the Francophone world, but less well-known elsewhere, earning him the nickname, the biggest rock star you've never heard of.

3035
04:31:34,450 --> 04:31:36,091
World News from the BBC.

3036
04:31:38,500 --> 04:31:40,681
Hello, I'm Jo Fidgen, and you're tuned to Outlook.

3037
04:31:41,201 --> 04:31:48,924
So, Russia is finding out today whether its athletes will be allowed to compete in next year's Winter Olympics in South Korea after a doping scandal.

3038
04:31:49,505 --> 04:31:56,428
If you're listening to the live edition of Outlook at 12 hours GMT, we're still in the dark about the decision by the International Olympic Committee.

3039
04:31:56,928 --> 04:32:01,490
If you're listening to the rebroadcast later in the day, then you'll probably know what happened.

3040
04:32:02,190 --> 04:32:05,331
But we thought we'd take you back to how the whole scandal broke.

3041
04:32:05,511 --> 04:32:11,212
Last year, we spoke to the couple who helped blow the whistle on what was happening, Yulia and Vitaly Stepanov.

3042
04:32:11,712 --> 04:32:13,252
Yulia is a Russian runner.

3043
04:32:13,312 --> 04:32:14,512
She does the 800 meters.

3044
04:32:15,092 --> 04:32:20,593
And when they met eight years ago, Vitaly worked for the country's anti-doping agency, Rosada.

3045
04:32:20,993 --> 04:32:22,354
They fell in love, got married.

3046
04:32:22,974 --> 04:32:29,735
But the complicating factor in their relationship was that Yulia was on a regular drug-taking regime to enhance her running.

3047
04:32:30,995 --> 04:32:33,897
I took steroids and EPO.

3048
04:32:35,739 --> 04:32:46,567
Steroids helped me to build up my muscles and be quicker, faster, stronger, and EPO helped me to be stronger as well.

3049
04:32:48,708 --> 04:32:57,152
that coaches always, always told us that actually it's not only us who take illegal drugs and doping, that everyone does it.

3050
04:32:57,892 --> 04:33:04,735
And when you hear these things from them, obviously you don't think that it's a lie.

3051
04:33:04,876 --> 04:33:14,880
You trust them because you see all the achievements, previous achievements of Russian sportsmen, Russian champions, and you sort of think that should be okay.

3052
04:33:19,422 --> 04:33:29,167
I guess I somewhat preferred to close my eyes to this, because I was not doing doping controls at that point that much.

3053
04:33:29,387 --> 04:33:31,748
I was mainly involved with educational programs.

3054
04:33:32,508 --> 04:33:40,892
So I thought, well, maybe I'll just try to continue doing my job, knowing what's really happening, and see what happens.

3055
04:33:43,233 --> 04:33:54,665
Obviously, as we got married with Julie and we had the honeymoon and we had our first real fight where we started to talk about her preparation for the winter season.

3056
04:33:56,367 --> 04:34:01,993
And I said, well, maybe we can try to prepare a different way without doping.

3057
04:34:03,283 --> 04:34:04,404
And she was completely right.

3058
04:34:04,424 --> 04:34:05,745
She said, well, are you a coach?

3059
04:34:05,865 --> 04:34:06,845
Do you know any other way?

3060
04:34:07,406 --> 04:34:08,486
And I had no answer.

3061
04:34:09,007 --> 04:34:11,128
We had to change the topic of the conversation.

3062
04:34:11,288 --> 04:34:16,992
But from that point on, we kind of knew that within the family, we have different opinions.

3063
04:34:17,812 --> 04:34:24,156
Our relations were based on Vitaly's loyalty.

3064
04:34:24,216 --> 04:34:26,078
He really didn't want to divorce.

3065
04:34:26,178 --> 04:34:28,019
He really wanted to save our marriage.

3066
04:34:28,619 --> 04:34:29,520
It was difficult.

3067
04:34:29,620 --> 04:34:37,347
This part of the relationship was really difficult, and both of us still don't understand how we were able to get through those years without getting divorced.

3068
04:34:37,827 --> 04:34:41,891
All the while Vitaly was struggling with what to do with the information Yulia had given him.

3069
04:34:42,051 --> 04:34:47,976
He had some contacts at the World Anti-Daping Agency, WADA, and was considering becoming a whistleblower.

3070
04:34:48,456 --> 04:34:50,978
I had to make up my own mind, what do I do?

3071
04:34:52,239 --> 04:34:59,285
Do I go against, I guess you can say against even my own home country and do I share the information with WADA?

3072
04:34:59,966 --> 04:35:12,857
And in the end I was invited to Vancouver to the Olympic Games and I spoke to one of the persons from WADA and I said I'm concerned about some things that I'm seeing and I think I should share it with you.

3073
04:35:14,158 --> 04:35:16,219
From that moment on I started telling

3074
04:35:17,412 --> 04:35:20,054
to my point of context, at what I was seeing.

3075
04:35:20,074 --> 04:35:27,921
I have to tell how I know things, and yeah, I said that my wife is involved in it as well, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

3076
04:35:28,021 --> 04:35:31,603
I mean, that's completely against the code, but this is the Russian reality.

3077
04:35:32,304 --> 04:35:38,789
Ever since I came back from Vancouver, I openly started to complain about the things that Rosada was not doing correctly.

3078
04:35:39,770 --> 04:35:45,655
Obviously, my bosses did not like that, and at some point, they openly started to try to get rid of me.

3079
04:35:46,547 --> 04:35:51,676
And finally, in February 2011, there was a reorganization, restructure.

3080
04:35:52,718 --> 04:35:57,487
It was kind of expected that I will not be kept in the newly restructured organization.

3081
04:35:58,343 --> 04:36:05,953
After Vitaly lost his job in February 2013, Yulia failed a drugs test and was banned from competing for two years.

3082
04:36:06,414 --> 04:36:16,747
It turned out that Yulia is going to become a scapegoat, even though the officials in Russia were saying that if you follow the system, you will never be sanctioned and we'll protect you.

3083
04:36:18,375 --> 04:36:24,779
But then it turned out that it's just not true.

3084
04:36:24,799 --> 04:36:28,422
Disqualification changed everything.

3085
04:36:29,302 --> 04:36:31,063
It actually saved our marriage.

3086
04:36:31,724 --> 04:36:35,406
Because after I was disqualified, I had three choices.

3087
04:36:35,686 --> 04:36:44,052
First, to continue and to keep silent and to continue taking drugs and be a part of this existing system.

3088
04:36:44,853 --> 04:36:51,361
The second choice was just to end up my career and just leave this big sport.

3089
04:36:51,841 --> 04:36:58,730
And the third one was actually to tell the truth to everyone about what's happening in the Russian sport with the doping.

3090
04:36:59,852 --> 04:37:08,935
I've decided to choose a third way to tell the truth and actually to find the system.

3091
04:37:09,155 --> 04:37:23,740
We've decided that our marriage is the main thing and we should be together, we should fight together all this illegal stuff and I had enough

3092
04:37:25,160 --> 04:37:28,141
strength to see the world in real terms.

3093
04:37:29,002 --> 04:37:31,062
So, for our family it was a blessing.

3094
04:37:31,082 --> 04:37:32,423
This crisis was a blessing.

3095
04:37:32,923 --> 04:37:42,887
Yulia started making secret recordings of her meetings with people involved in Russian doping.

3096
04:37:42,987 --> 04:37:47,409
The couple then approached a German investigative journalist, Hajo Seppelt, with their evidence.

3097
04:37:48,009 --> 04:37:52,751
They agreed to take part in a documentary which was to be aired on German television.

3098
04:37:53,251 --> 04:37:55,812
We could never imagine that we would actually go public with it.

3099
04:37:56,832 --> 04:38:04,856
It was in the beginning of 2014, more than a year after officially Yulei was providing statements, providing audio recordings.

3100
04:38:06,436 --> 04:38:14,540
We met Hajo Zeppelt, and we spoke to him, and he was actually the one who said, we got to try to fight this.

3101
04:38:15,220 --> 04:38:17,261
The more evidence we have, the better it would be.

3102
04:38:18,141 --> 04:38:20,482
Unfortunately, you know, as a journalist, he cannot

3103
04:38:21,670 --> 04:38:23,231
help us with getting the evidence.

3104
04:38:24,212 --> 04:38:36,980
So Julia was just talking to different athletes, coaches, and officials, just having normal conversations, only the difference was she always had her phone voice recording program on all the time.

3105
04:38:37,701 --> 04:38:40,383
We left the country, Russia, right before the documentary.

3106
04:38:40,723 --> 04:38:50,690
We knew that the reaction will be negative because protecting at least systematic doping in Russia, it's called being a patriot in Russia.

3107
04:38:51,801 --> 04:38:59,747
And even though I do not share this point of view, I could understand that as soon as this information is out, we will be called traitors and liars.

3108
04:39:00,508 --> 04:39:02,069
And that's exactly what happened.

3109
04:39:02,349 --> 04:39:07,013
So I had to make sure that we go public, but that our family feels safe.

3110
04:39:07,133 --> 04:39:09,775
And I knew that we wouldn't feel safe in Russia.

3111
04:39:10,580 --> 04:39:15,166
Yulia and Vitaly watched the story break from their temporary home in Germany.

3112
04:39:15,687 --> 04:39:21,715
Soon the World Anti-Doping Agency commissioned an independent commission to investigate the claims made in that documentary.

3113
04:39:21,895 --> 04:39:26,301
The report confirmed the existence of widespread cheating in Russia through doping.

3114
04:39:27,202 --> 04:39:36,428
The aftermath has been bittersweet for the couple, as Yulia has since been banned from competing at the Rio Olympics because of her own doping charge in 2013.

3115
04:39:40,931 --> 04:39:43,933
I don't want to whitewash my own past.

3116
04:39:44,013 --> 04:39:52,599
Obviously, I know what I did was wrong, and I want to apologize before all the clean athletes for what I did.

3117
04:39:53,319 --> 04:39:54,119
But you know what?

3118
04:39:54,460 --> 04:39:55,781
I cannot change my past.

3119
04:39:56,601 --> 04:40:08,612
The only thing I can do is actually try to change the current situation and the future and to be just another person.

3120
04:40:08,972 --> 04:40:16,659
Right from the beginning, I understood that, unfortunately, the best supporters in doping fighting are investigative journalists.

3121
04:40:18,153 --> 04:40:24,075
If a journalist approaches us and wants to talk to us and wants to hear us, we will tell our story.

3122
04:40:25,036 --> 04:40:29,518
It's not a pretty story, but it's a real story and we are telling the truth.

3123
04:40:29,578 --> 04:40:37,461
We will keep apologizing for our own mistakes and we are trying to change and at least as a family I am sure that we are doing a good job.

3124
04:40:38,221 --> 04:40:42,943
A new relationship is not easy to build, but we are working on it and it's improving.

3125
04:40:44,030 --> 04:40:47,132
We have a two-year-old son, and we try to be good parents now.

3126
04:40:50,134 --> 04:40:54,677
Even I was banned from the Rio Olympic Games.

3127
04:40:55,358 --> 04:41:02,662
I think that we made the right choice, because it didn't affect our marriage, it didn't affect our relations.

3128
04:41:06,317 --> 04:41:09,620
young athletes will help sport in future.

3129
04:41:09,640 --> 04:41:12,922
Yulia and Vitaly Stepanov speaking in 2016.

3130
04:41:12,962 --> 04:41:13,803
They're still in hiding.

3131
04:41:21,268 --> 04:41:29,833
Now, we're off to the north of Italy, to the valleys around the city of Genoa, where a herd of cattle has been making the headlines after running away from their owner.

3132
04:41:29,853 --> 04:41:32,335
They've been dubbed the rebel cows.

3133
04:41:33,015 --> 04:41:39,940
Let's get the story from local scientist and documentary maker Alessandro Ghigi, who's been following the rebel cows deep into the woods.

3134
04:41:40,320 --> 04:41:41,921
It's a territory he knows well.

3135
04:41:42,741 --> 04:41:50,845
I grew up in a city, but I've always been passionate about science and nature.

3136
04:41:51,446 --> 04:41:55,088
My dad is a hunter and we would always go hiking in the countryside.

3137
04:41:55,548 --> 04:41:59,570
He would be killing animals, while I was more interested in taking pictures of them.

3138
04:42:00,630 --> 04:42:03,192
I soon became a keen bird watcher.

3139
04:42:03,732 --> 04:42:09,375
I got used to hide in the bushes, completely still, waiting for hours for a bird to approach.

3140
04:42:12,458 --> 04:42:17,640
Throughout the years, I became very familiar with the mountains and woods surrounding Genoa.

3141
04:42:18,000 --> 04:42:21,961
It's a very harsh place, with narrow valleys and steep slopes.

3142
04:42:22,741 --> 04:42:24,442
It's also a wild place.

3143
04:42:24,602 --> 04:42:27,303
Wolves and wild boars inhabit these forests.

3144
04:42:30,593 --> 04:42:34,499
I normally go hiking there with some friends looking for wild animals to photograph.

3145
04:42:35,039 --> 04:42:38,985
One day we heard a story from a local that caught our attention.

3146
04:42:39,506 --> 04:42:41,989
It's the story of the rebel cows.

3147
04:42:50,504 --> 04:42:53,709
The rebel cows are a mysterious presence in these valleys.

3148
04:42:54,149 --> 04:42:57,334
It's a herd that has been living in the wild for almost seven years.

3149
04:42:57,974 --> 04:43:02,441
They're a very elusive bunch and they're surrounded by an aura of mystery.

3150
04:43:03,142 --> 04:43:06,286
Everybody who lives in the villages up here has a story to tell about them.

3151
04:43:08,507 --> 04:43:14,510
This group of cows must have had something special to begin with, to be able to break free in the way they did.

3152
04:43:14,530 --> 04:43:16,091
It's just unbelievable.

3153
04:43:16,551 --> 04:43:19,713
I don't know much about how they managed to escape in the first place.

3154
04:43:20,393 --> 04:43:21,294
It must have been around 2010.

3155
04:43:22,915 --> 04:43:25,596
People told us that they belonged to a local farmer.

3156
04:43:25,856 --> 04:43:28,597
They had been sold and they had to be driven away.

3157
04:43:29,258 --> 04:43:37,102
But as the farmer was trying to get them into a lorry, a small group of them broke free and they simply disappeared in the bushes.

3158
04:43:38,240 --> 04:43:41,221
Since then, the rebel cows have been living in the woods.

3159
04:43:57,847 --> 04:44:00,888
Local authorities tried everything they could to catch them.

3160
04:44:01,595 --> 04:44:05,017
They even brought in expert cowboys, but nothing worked.

3161
04:44:05,878 --> 04:44:10,820
And because of the nature of these wild valleys, it's incredibly difficult to build traps.

3162
04:44:11,301 --> 04:44:17,004
The rebel cows are still at large.

3163
04:44:17,044 --> 04:44:23,127
My friends and I were immediately captivated by the story of the rebel cows and by their indomitable spirit.

3164
04:44:23,327 --> 04:44:24,808
We don't know how big the herd is.

3165
04:44:25,249 --> 04:44:26,870
A few years ago, it was of about 15.

3166
04:44:28,387 --> 04:44:31,429
We know there's a bull among them, and calves have been born.

3167
04:44:32,250 --> 04:44:37,013
But throughout the years, the herd was decimated by diseases and natural deaths.

3168
04:44:37,653 --> 04:44:44,378
Some of them have been found dead in ditches, horribly wounded, because, unfortunately, poachers are operating in the area.

3169
04:44:45,062 --> 04:44:46,802
and they are looking for the cows too.

3170
04:44:47,383 --> 04:44:49,663
Now we think there are only six cows left.

3171
04:44:54,104 --> 04:44:58,265
But I mean, you have to give them credit.

3172
04:44:58,305 --> 04:45:04,746
The rebel cows have been living in the wild for seven years and survived several attempts of capturing or killing them.

3173
04:45:05,186 --> 04:45:06,347
It's a unique case.

3174
04:45:08,567 --> 04:45:12,348
The most interesting thing about the rebel cows is that their behavior changed.

3175
04:45:12,888 --> 04:45:14,851
They turned into a wild herd.

3176
04:45:18,054 --> 04:45:21,939
Because of their elusive attitude, it's almost impossible to study them.

3177
04:45:22,840 --> 04:45:27,124
So my friends and I decided to put together a little documentary about them.

3178
04:45:27,885 --> 04:45:33,271
We positioned several hidden cameras in the woods, in places where we thought they might roam around.

3179
04:45:35,911 --> 04:45:38,313
We didn't have to wait long to get our first footage.

3180
04:45:38,854 --> 04:45:43,398
One day, my friend Paolo went to collect the SD card from the camera, and he called me.

3181
04:45:43,679 --> 04:45:46,201
He was so excited, he screamed, we have the cows!

3182
04:45:46,782 --> 04:45:50,866
Oh, he was so happy.

3183
04:45:51,446 --> 04:45:56,231
I still remember seeing them appearing in the footage, walking around, then fleeing from something.

3184
04:45:58,597 --> 04:46:03,043
I'm sure you're all familiar with the video of a cow, and that's usually boring.

3185
04:46:03,483 --> 04:46:05,486
But this is nothing like that.

3186
04:46:06,006 --> 04:46:13,816
The footage is shot at night with an infrared camera, so the rebel cows look like extraordinary and mysterious creatures.

3187
04:46:18,108 --> 04:46:18,909
They're crossbred.

3188
04:46:19,410 --> 04:46:27,299
The females are light brown, almost gingerish, while the calves are darker, mainly black, and they behave like wild animals.

3189
04:46:27,840 --> 04:46:31,825
They hide in the forest during the day and only come out to graze at night.

3190
04:46:32,425 --> 04:46:34,468
They move in perfect silence.

3191
04:46:34,928 --> 04:46:43,072
Locals who saw them noticed that there is what we would call a sentinel in the group.

3192
04:46:43,633 --> 04:46:53,278
While the others eat, she stays on the side, her back to the group, nose in the air, sniffing the potential dangers, ready to tell the other cows to run and hide.

3193
04:46:53,978 --> 04:46:56,961
And from what we know, they are extremely agile.

3194
04:46:57,341 --> 04:47:04,546
They run and jump around like deer.

3195
04:47:04,586 --> 04:47:10,731
While filming our doc, we tried to remain impartial, but we're obviously biased because we cheer for the cows.

3196
04:47:11,352 --> 04:47:14,814
Of course, not everybody is excited as we are about the rebel cows.

3197
04:47:15,194 --> 04:47:19,618
The villages in these valleys are very small, and people rely mostly on agriculture.

3198
04:47:20,225 --> 04:47:25,169
During the winter, the rebel cows come down the mountains and they break into gardens and allotments.

3199
04:47:25,609 --> 04:47:34,877
You have to understand, these animals weigh 500 or 600 kilos, so if they spot a cabbage they are really interested in, be sure they will do everything they can to get it.

3200
04:47:35,617 --> 04:47:39,138
And that often means trampling down fences and damaging fields.

3201
04:47:41,559 --> 04:47:44,200
Lots of people around here would like to capture or kill them.

3202
04:47:44,700 --> 04:47:50,302
But some scientists would like to let them be, because it would be very interesting to do more research on them.

3203
04:47:50,882 --> 04:47:54,664
And our documentary created a lot of hype around the rebel cows.

3204
04:47:55,604 --> 04:47:58,345
They have become resistance icons in Italy.

3205
04:47:58,365 --> 04:48:09,346
People are fascinated by their rebel spirit, and that's what I love about them too.

3206
04:48:09,747 --> 04:48:20,308
When you think about the fact that these animals have been tamed thousands of years ago, and for all this time they have lived with humans, the idea that they can break free and run away is just extraordinary.

3207
04:48:20,988 --> 04:48:23,509
I never had a face-to-face encounter with one of them,

3208
04:48:24,189 --> 04:48:27,131
But in a way, this is what keeps my interest going.

3209
04:48:27,672 --> 04:48:29,893
It keeps the mystery intact.

3210
04:48:32,215 --> 04:48:33,316
Long live the cows.

3211
04:48:37,899 --> 04:48:41,982
Alessandro Ghigi on the trail of the rebel cows in northern Italy.

3212
04:48:42,923 --> 04:48:52,867
Now a witness, and today we're going back 50 years to 1967, the British withdrawal from the port city of Aden, and the creation of the People's Republic of South Yemen.

3213
04:48:53,287 --> 04:49:03,572
Farhana Haider has been speaking to a former British diplomat, Oliver Miles, who was instrumental in Britain's departure, and Tugarsun Lukman, who as a teenager lived through that time.

3214
04:49:04,752 --> 04:49:15,676
With torchlight processions and dancing in the streets, the people are celebrating independence, although they're still awaiting the arrival of the National Liberation Front leaders from Geneva.

3215
04:49:16,196 --> 04:49:22,478
Britain had colonised the port city of Aden in 1839, one of the longest inhabited places on earth.

3216
04:49:23,039 --> 04:49:32,482
The colony consisted of Aden and the British protectorates of South Arabia, desert hinterlands which surrounded the city, controlled by tribal leaders.

3217
04:49:33,182 --> 04:49:38,744
But by the 1950s, Britain's retreat from empire around the world was well underway.

3218
04:49:38,764 --> 04:49:43,046
And in the Middle East, there was a rising wave of Arab nationalism.

3219
04:49:46,748 --> 04:49:48,409
There were definitely celebrations.

3220
04:49:48,949 --> 04:49:50,950
It was a happy day for many people.

3221
04:49:50,970 --> 04:49:58,713
And for many others, it was a day of reflection of what happened in the past and what could have the effect on the future.

3222
04:49:59,465 --> 04:50:05,407
Ghazan Luqman was 14 years old in November 1967, and from a prominent Adeny family.

3223
04:50:05,967 --> 04:50:11,268
While he remembers jubilation on the day of independence, there was also a sense of uncertainty.

3224
04:50:11,288 --> 04:50:13,009
I think the mood was somber.

3225
04:50:13,309 --> 04:50:16,110
People were apprehensive as to what would come next.

3226
04:50:16,130 --> 04:50:17,170
Yes, exactly.

3227
04:50:17,530 --> 04:50:19,391
And their apprehension proved to be right.

3228
04:50:19,611 --> 04:50:22,591
It was good to see the colonial power was gone, but then what's next?

3229
04:50:23,192 --> 04:50:27,813
The people of Aden, I would say, probably the majority was very scared of the future.

3230
04:50:28,398 --> 04:50:31,443
Aden was at the centre of the British colonial trading system.

3231
04:50:31,823 --> 04:50:36,911
Ships stopped there to refuel en route between Europe and India, the Far East and Australia.

3232
04:50:37,311 --> 04:50:39,294
It was one of the busiest ports in the world.

3233
04:50:39,675 --> 04:50:43,641
Growing up in the city, Gazan Lukman remembers it being prosperous and modern.

3234
04:50:44,081 --> 04:50:47,123
As a teenager growing in Eden, life was good.

3235
04:50:47,324 --> 04:50:50,906
The majority of people were enjoying their progress at that time.

3236
04:50:51,147 --> 04:50:53,548
Electronics were available at that time.

3237
04:50:53,568 --> 04:50:56,831
Eden was actually a hub or a center because of tourism.

3238
04:50:57,051 --> 04:51:00,414
You could buy the best watches of the time, fancy clothing.

3239
04:51:00,754 --> 04:51:05,678
The big passenger ships bring swarms of tourists to the famous duty-free crescent of shops ashore.

3240
04:51:05,938 --> 04:51:13,620
Life was good, and it was a paradise lost from textile to perfumes to consumer goods.

3241
04:51:13,940 --> 04:51:16,061
Aden had great beaches.

3242
04:51:16,661 --> 04:51:19,882
Aden had great airport, great port.

3243
04:51:20,282 --> 04:51:23,022
Aden was the Dubai of the 1960s.

3244
04:51:23,623 --> 04:51:25,083
It was a liberal city.

3245
04:51:25,463 --> 04:51:33,508
There was, however, growing resentment at the British presence, and although they had announced they were withdrawing from Aden, they hadn't fixed the date.

3246
04:51:33,928 --> 04:51:38,350
We've said we'll quit by 1968, yet the terrorist attacks become more frequent.

3247
04:51:38,691 --> 04:51:40,652
We can't be allowed to just pack up and go.

3248
04:51:41,092 --> 04:51:48,395
Oliver Miles was posted to Yemen in 1966 and appointed private secretary to the British High Commissioner in Aden.

3249
04:51:48,595 --> 04:51:56,679
And as private secretary, of course, I was in a position of absolutely in the centre of everything that happened in the last six, nine months before independence.

3250
04:51:57,079 --> 04:51:59,760
And by 1967, there was growing violence.

3251
04:52:00,100 --> 04:52:04,082
Two armed movements were vying to lead a new post-independent government.

3252
04:52:04,482 --> 04:52:11,925
FLOSSI, the Front for the Liberation of South Yemen, who was supported by Egypt, and the NLF, a Marxist movement.

3253
04:52:12,165 --> 04:52:20,629
The people who were fighting us, we called them terrorists, the Front for the Liberation of South Yemen and the National Liberation Front, the two rival groups.

3254
04:52:21,329 --> 04:52:27,077
They didn't really believe that they were going to go because they thought that Aden was too important to the British Empire and there was no way we were going to go.

3255
04:52:27,158 --> 04:52:37,251
So although the first of those two groups, the Front for Liberation of South Yemen, was moderately prepared to see themselves as a future government and therefore be ready to talk to us about the process,

3256
04:52:37,952 --> 04:52:40,874
the National Liberation Front were absolutely not willing to talk to us.

3257
04:52:41,254 --> 04:52:51,480
And as the time of independence drew closer, the two fought each other, literally fought each other in the streets with a good deal of bloodshed, and the NLF won.

3258
04:52:51,641 --> 04:53:01,727
This is the flag of the terrorists of Aden, the red, white and black tricolour of the National Liberation Front, a symbol of the NLF's triumph over its rivals Flossie.

3259
04:53:01,847 --> 04:53:05,529
Events leading to independence were not great.

3260
04:53:05,809 --> 04:53:06,690
There was a civil war.

3261
04:53:07,050 --> 04:53:10,733
Do you remember feeling scared because of the war happening around you?

3262
04:53:11,174 --> 04:53:20,562
Very scared, especially during night time, because if you are perceived to be from the other group, the other group will come and drag you in the middle of the night, and many people disappear.

3263
04:53:20,983 --> 04:53:22,124
One of them was my brother.

3264
04:53:22,904 --> 04:53:26,267
And so we were very, very scared.

3265
04:53:26,467 --> 04:53:29,030
To actually see a civil war was very sad.

3266
04:53:29,450 --> 04:53:34,712
Having won the civil war, the NLF now sat down for talks with the British to negotiate the withdrawal.

3267
04:53:34,972 --> 04:53:42,215
Geneva and the lakeside setting for the first political confrontation between the terrorists of Aden and the British government.

3268
04:53:42,415 --> 04:53:49,718
It became clear in the last month or so before independence that we were going to hand over to people we'd never met, literally never met.

3269
04:53:50,158 --> 04:53:53,700
In that building over there, that Britain will meet the National Liberation Front

3270
04:53:54,541 --> 04:54:07,572
To our surprise, we found one or two faces on the other side of the table were familiar, but they were familiar in different guises, if you like, because there was one senior police officer from the Aden police who we thought was on our side, but it turned out he was a senior NLF man.

3271
04:54:08,092 --> 04:54:14,298
There was an army officer, similarly, and at that time, of course, the British Empire was shedding its colonies like autumn leaves.

3272
04:54:14,898 --> 04:54:21,406
Normally, it's a long process where a lot of people spend a lot of time in each other's offices, getting to know how systems work.

3273
04:54:21,726 --> 04:54:26,592
But because the NLF were our enemy, we didn't have time to do that, and it was all done in a terrible rush.

3274
04:54:26,772 --> 04:54:31,517
I could see that my friends, the Adenese and the Yemenis, were in for a hell of a time after we left.

3275
04:54:31,698 --> 04:54:32,759
That was perfectly obvious.

3276
04:54:32,999 --> 04:54:46,892
If only because Aden City, Aden Town, was to some extent a creation of the British Empire, and the fact that the British were leaving, in particular the British military base was closing down, meant that they were losing half the source of their income.

3277
04:54:47,613 --> 04:54:53,839
And the other half they'd lost already because the Suez Canal had been closed following the 1967 war, so the trade was off.

3278
04:54:54,019 --> 04:54:55,641
So they were left with nothing to live on.

3279
04:54:56,321 --> 04:54:59,623
Aden was clearly going to nosedive as we left, we could see that.

3280
04:54:59,763 --> 04:55:09,948
The government was resorting to more and more repressive measures, but that was not immediately after amendments, that was when the situation deteriorated maybe a year later or two years later.

3281
04:55:10,329 --> 04:55:14,451
Do you feel that the British had let down the people of Aden?

3282
04:55:15,457 --> 04:55:16,819
I don't think that it was our fault.

3283
04:55:17,039 --> 04:55:19,401
I think we did the best we could in the circumstances.

3284
04:55:19,761 --> 04:55:31,012
You can argue that we let the people of Yemen or of South Yemen down more broadly, that they weren't ready for independence, that they didn't really want independence, most of them, many of them, and that we got out in a rush.

3285
04:55:31,632 --> 04:55:41,462
Britain left behind deep divisions between those who'd worked for the colonial government and those that had fought against it, and between supporters of the different independence movements.

3286
04:55:42,083 --> 04:55:49,430
Guzun Lukman found that many of his friends and family were targeted by the repressive and pro-Soviet state that later emerged.

3287
04:55:49,771 --> 04:55:50,772
He soon left Aden.

3288
04:55:51,962 --> 04:55:55,504
Many Adenese felt that they were betrayed by Britain, unfortunately.

3289
04:55:55,544 --> 04:56:01,227
The withdrawal from Aden was abrupt, it was fast, just gone, just overnight.

3290
04:56:01,447 --> 04:56:07,570
Families, people we knew in our neighbourhood, everybody was actually gone, just like a wolf.

3291
04:56:08,011 --> 04:56:12,153
Wake up and they're gone, which left many people apprehensive and bewildered.

3292
04:56:12,353 --> 04:56:15,835
When you think about independence now, do you think it was a good thing?

3293
04:56:16,315 --> 04:56:17,556
I think it was premature.

3294
04:56:17,776 --> 04:56:19,597
It should have taken maybe a few more years.

3295
04:56:19,997 --> 04:56:23,579
They should have brought everybody and put them around the same table.

3296
04:56:24,279 --> 04:56:28,542
In 1990, communist South Yemen merged with the separate state of North Yemen.

3297
04:56:28,882 --> 04:56:32,083
But the divisions within Yemeni society have never gone away.

3298
04:56:32,644 --> 04:56:38,327
And Ghazan believes Britain bears much of the responsibility for the violence that still blights the country.

3299
04:56:38,347 --> 04:56:40,388
The people of England have gone through a lot.

3300
04:56:41,388 --> 04:56:45,752
From 1967 up to now, the older generations went through a lot.

3301
04:56:46,753 --> 04:56:54,260
Many of them, they just wait for the day they die because it has been nothing but downhill changes since 1967, unfortunately.

3302
04:56:54,480 --> 04:57:00,886
Do you think the situation that Yemen is in now is partly as a result of the British leaving so quickly?

3303
04:57:01,326 --> 04:57:02,627
Yes, absolutely.

3304
04:57:03,587 --> 04:57:10,370
And I hope that Britain helps now in sorting the issue of the conflict between the North and the South.

3305
04:57:10,730 --> 04:57:14,552
It will be a sort of a make-up for what they, when they left in a hurry and a half.

3306
04:57:14,812 --> 04:57:18,634
I think Britain could actually, they should help them in resolving the conflict.

3307
04:57:18,994 --> 04:57:21,255
And do you miss your home city?

3308
04:57:21,616 --> 04:57:22,136
Extremely.

3309
04:57:22,776 --> 04:57:24,817
And the older you get, the more you miss it.

3310
04:57:24,957 --> 04:57:26,098
I miss my family.

3311
04:57:26,118 --> 04:57:28,279
I miss Eden very much.

3312
04:57:28,579 --> 04:57:30,520
I think of it every day of my life.

3313
04:57:31,449 --> 04:57:33,351
Guthen Luchmann now lives in Ottawa.

3314
04:57:33,891 --> 04:57:40,156
Oliver Mars retired from the diplomatic service in 1996 and is the editor of the Arab Digest.

3315
04:57:43,541 --> 04:57:45,482
And that report was by Fahana Haider.

3316
04:57:45,682 --> 04:57:47,003
That's all from Outlook for today.

3317
04:57:47,083 --> 04:57:48,704
Matthew will be here tomorrow.

3318
04:57:49,224 --> 04:57:54,487
He's hearing from a high-flying Kenyan banker who was jailed for a crime she didn't commit.

3319
04:57:55,087 --> 04:58:00,089
She will tell you, Matthew, what she learned in prison and how she fought to clear her name.

3320
04:58:00,269 --> 04:58:02,551
Do join him for that same time tomorrow.

3321
04:58:03,071 --> 04:58:07,013
But for today, from me, Jo Fidgen, and the rest of the Outlook team, thanks for listening.

3322
04:58:08,485 --> 04:58:13,526
You're listening to the BBC World Service, and here's what's happening in the studio this week.

3323
04:58:15,026 --> 04:58:18,927
Meet Arnd Henning Hessen, one of the top mixologists in the world.

3324
04:58:19,447 --> 04:58:26,408
He captures smells and tastes from across the globe, from frankincense from Oman to tonka beans from Madagascar.

3325
04:58:26,868 --> 04:58:30,869
And who can create a drink for you based on just the perfume you're wearing.

3326
04:58:31,329 --> 04:58:35,870
In the studio at bbcworldservice.com slash inthestudio.

3327
04:58:39,207 --> 04:58:41,810
And in half an hour on Click with Gareth Mitchell.

3328
04:58:42,370 --> 04:58:49,677
Farmers in India are receiving advisories by text or voicemail telling them the best time to sow their crops.

3329
04:58:50,078 --> 04:58:55,423
The alerts come from data from sensors in the ground combined with historical climate records.

3330
04:58:56,264 --> 04:58:56,924
Stay with us.

3331
04:58:57,105 --> 04:59:01,369
The Newsroom is next on the BBC World Service, the world's radio station.

3332
04:59:08,898 --> 04:59:13,183
BBC World Service, it's five o'clock GMT, this is Oliver Conway with the Newsroom.

3333
04:59:13,604 --> 04:59:19,610
In a break with international consensus, Donald Trump is expected to declare Jerusalem to be capital of Israel.

3334
04:59:19,931 --> 04:59:23,435
I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding the President's decision on Jerusalem.

3335
04:59:23,895 --> 04:59:25,738
Tomorrow the President will deliver remarks.

3336
04:59:26,358 --> 04:59:27,939
Has the president made up his mind?

3337
04:59:28,439 --> 04:59:31,620
The president is pretty solid in his thinking at this point.

3338
04:59:32,060 --> 04:59:34,521
Arab leaders have warned of dangerous repercussions.

3339
04:59:35,041 --> 04:59:35,781
Also on the newsroom.

3340
04:59:36,121 --> 04:59:37,362
It's a political decision.

3341
04:59:37,522 --> 04:59:45,184
Very bad decision and I disagree with this position of the World Olympic Committee and so on.

3342
04:59:45,544 --> 04:59:49,046
Russia has reacted angrily after it was banned from the Winter Olympics.

3343
04:59:49,686 --> 04:59:53,367
We report from the Damascus suburb which has faced a relentless bombardment.

3344
04:59:55,128 --> 05:00:00,313
I wish I could have cookies, sweeties, or any other delicious foods.

3345
05:00:00,954 --> 05:00:02,015
I really miss food.

3346
05:00:02,696 --> 05:00:05,678
And France's biggest rock star, Johnny Hallyday, has died.

3347
05:00:06,079 --> 05:00:07,020
First, our top stories.

3348
05:00:08,680 --> 05:00:10,761
BBC News, hello, I'm Gareth Barlow.

3349
05:00:11,401 --> 05:00:12,202
Senior U.S.

3350
05:00:12,242 --> 05:00:17,564
officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

3351
05:00:18,024 --> 05:00:23,987
He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

3352
05:00:24,647 --> 05:00:28,469
Arab states have warned that the decision could provoke violence in the Muslim world.

3353
05:00:28,989 --> 05:00:29,870
Peter Bowes reports.

3354
05:00:30,550 --> 05:00:33,852
Donald Trump is venturing into uncharted territory.

3355
05:00:34,252 --> 05:00:43,096
The president will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, making the US the first country to do so since the foundation of the state in 1948.

3356
05:00:44,216 --> 05:00:49,819
According to the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Mr Trump's thinking on the issue is pretty solid.

3357
05:00:50,536 --> 05:00:58,218
He's already indicated that he intends to move the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and has informed regional leaders of his plans.

3358
05:00:58,918 --> 05:01:00,458
The reaction has been heated.

3359
05:01:01,038 --> 05:01:09,140
The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has warned of dangerous consequences for the peace, security and stability of the region and of the world.

3360
05:01:09,780 --> 05:01:16,062
Jordan's King Abdullah said the decision would undermine efforts to resume the peace process and provoke Muslims.

3361
05:01:16,877 --> 05:01:24,581
Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban it from next February's Winter Olympics in South Korea.

3362
05:01:25,102 --> 05:01:31,865
A damning report by the IOC said there had been an unprecedented systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system.

3363
05:01:32,386 --> 05:01:34,307
From Moscow, here's Steve Rosenberg.

3364
05:01:35,007 --> 05:01:39,770
The deputy speaker of Russia's parliament said it was a humiliation and an insult to Russia.

3365
05:01:40,610 --> 05:01:52,279
In a defiant post in social media, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said Russia would survive this like it survived World War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Western sanctions.

3366
05:01:53,299 --> 05:02:02,646
Although the Russian team has been banned from competing in South Korea, Russian athletes who can prove they are clean will be permitted to participate under the Olympic flag.

3367
05:02:03,346 --> 05:02:05,088
But will the Kremlin allow them to?

3368
05:02:05,768 --> 05:02:11,011
Vladimir Putin has in the past described such a scenario as a humiliation for his country.

3369
05:02:11,352 --> 05:02:12,652
Steve Rosenberg reporting.

3370
05:02:13,253 --> 05:02:18,396
Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

3371
05:02:18,936 --> 05:02:21,858
James Cook reports from the outskirts of Los Angeles.

3372
05:02:22,457 --> 05:02:34,680
In Ventura County, to the north of Los Angeles, a wildfire which broke out on Monday intensified with terrifying speed, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by arid and gusty Santa Ana winds.

3373
05:02:35,200 --> 05:02:43,283
Here on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the charred ruins of houses are still smoking, while dark, choking smoke has closed a major moat away.

3374
05:02:43,823 --> 05:02:47,624
Ash is blowing through the air, and there is a firefighting helicopter overhead.

3375
05:02:48,670 --> 05:02:56,999
Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

3376
05:02:57,020 --> 05:03:01,605
Alfred and George DiGiorgio and Vince Muscat were arrested on Monday.

3377
05:03:01,985 --> 05:03:04,067
They have pleaded not guilty to the charges.

3378
05:03:04,908 --> 05:03:06,630
World News from the BBC.

3379
05:03:08,236 --> 05:03:15,501
A new report says about 15,000 people a day are being forced to flee their homes in African conflict and disaster zones.

3380
05:03:16,041 --> 05:03:20,124
Figures show that more than 12 million people in Africa are internally displaced.

3381
05:03:20,584 --> 05:03:22,746
Nearly 4 million left their homes last year.

3382
05:03:23,982 --> 05:03:31,329
Britain's most prestigious contemporary art award, the Turner Prize, has been won by an art professor who was born in Zanzibar, Labena Habib.

3383
05:03:31,910 --> 05:03:36,274
Judges praised her work, which explores the African diaspora and black creativity.

3384
05:03:36,674 --> 05:03:41,058
Professor Himid is the first black woman and the oldest person to win the award.

3385
05:03:42,454 --> 05:03:52,339
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out the first radiocarbon dating of a fragment of bone claimed to be from Saint Nicholas, believed to be the inspiration for Father Christmas.

3386
05:03:52,880 --> 05:03:58,463
Their findings revealed that the bone was 1,700 years old, matching the era of the saint's life.

3387
05:03:58,943 --> 05:04:00,244
Sean Coughlin has the story.

3388
05:04:00,884 --> 05:04:10,029
Relics of Saint Nicholas have been venerated in churches since at least the 11th century, and his popularity meant that hundreds of bones are claimed to have come from the Christmas saint.

3389
05:04:10,869 --> 05:04:21,498
This fragment of pelvis, tested at the University of Oxford, had come from a church in France, and Professor Tom Hyam said many such relics turn out to be not nearly as old as claimed.

3390
05:04:22,178 --> 05:04:29,964
But researchers were taken aback when test results showed that the bone really was from the era of Saint Nicholas, almost 1700 years ago.

3391
05:04:29,984 --> 05:04:37,630
Although there's no definite proof, Professor Hyam said it was possible that the remains could indeed be those of Saint Nicholas himself.

3392
05:04:38,651 --> 05:04:44,235
France's biggest rock star, Johnny Halliday, has died at the age of 74 after a battle with lung cancer.

3393
05:04:44,796 --> 05:04:50,860
In a career spanning five decades, he sold more than 100 million records and headlined 50 major tours.

3394
05:04:51,441 --> 05:04:58,226
Influenced by the music of Elvis Presley, Johnny Halliday began his career in 1960, singing rock and roll in French.

3395
05:04:58,806 --> 05:05:04,250
Known as the French Elvis, he was hugely popular in the Francophone world, but less well known elsewhere.

3396
05:05:05,291 --> 05:05:06,052
BBC News.

3397
05:05:09,176 --> 05:05:09,756
Thanks very much.

3398
05:05:09,776 --> 05:05:13,759
You're listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service with Oliver Conway.

3399
05:05:14,440 --> 05:05:16,161
In a speech at 1 p.m.

3400
05:05:16,181 --> 05:05:20,504
local time in Washington, Donald Trump is expected to announce that the U.S.

3401
05:05:20,544 --> 05:05:26,748
will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upending years of American policy on the Middle East.

3402
05:05:27,348 --> 05:05:32,111
According to briefings from senior White House officials, the president will start the process of moving the U.S.

3403
05:05:32,232 --> 05:05:36,074
embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although that could take years.

3404
05:05:36,735 --> 05:05:52,886
The decision to recognize Jerusalem would put America at odds with almost every other nation in the world, and Mr Trump was warned about the possible dire consequences of the move when he spoke to Arab leaders, including the Palestinian president, on Tuesday, as we heard from Yolande Nel in Jerusalem.

3405
05:05:53,749 --> 05:05:59,773
In their phone call, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is said to have warned Mr Trump that moving the U.S.

3406
05:05:59,873 --> 05:06:04,836
Embassy would have an impact on the peace process with Israel and regional stability.

3407
05:06:05,376 --> 05:06:11,920
Mr Abbas has since spoken to the Pope and the leaders of Russia, France and Jordan, asking them to intervene.

3408
05:06:12,560 --> 05:06:19,985
King Abdullah of Jordan was also called by Mr Trump and is said to have spoken of possible dangerous repercussions of his plan.

3409
05:06:20,765 --> 05:06:26,639
Egypt's President Sisi is reported to have told him there was no need to complicate matters in the Middle East.

3410
05:06:27,892 --> 05:06:44,198
Now, the White House official did say that Mr Trump recognized that boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem were subject to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and also that he was prepared to support a two-state solution if both sides agree.

3411
05:06:44,738 --> 05:06:47,479
But what is the thinking behind the change in policy?

3412
05:06:47,699 --> 05:06:50,180
I spoke to our correspondent in the U.S., Peter Bowes.

3413
05:06:50,940 --> 05:07:09,419
It was part of his campaign pledge that he wanted to do this and it was one of his major foreign policy planks and perhaps domestic policy comes into this a little bit in terms of the president wanting to be seen to be making good on those big promises in his first year.

3414
05:07:09,479 --> 05:07:12,603
I mentioned domestic politics because it hasn't necessarily all gone his way.

3415
05:07:13,023 --> 05:07:14,464
in terms of those big promises.

3416
05:07:14,524 --> 05:07:20,726
So I think he wants to get something done, and I think he is known as quite an impatient character in this respect.

3417
05:07:20,986 --> 05:07:28,189
But in terms of doing it now, I think there are quite a few people here who are rather mystified by the timing.

3418
05:07:28,349 --> 05:07:32,651
We know that the White House, the Trump administration, has been working on a peace plan for several months.

3419
05:07:32,731 --> 05:07:34,392
We don't know the detail of that.

3420
05:07:34,832 --> 05:07:48,237
So why to make this announcement now, perhaps ahead of a bigger plan and bigger negotiations, I think we remain to see, because it does show the US's hand.

3421
05:07:48,277 --> 05:08:02,042
And if the US is going to play a role as a mediator in negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, it perhaps makes things rather awkward, because it's certainly not what the Palestinians wanted to hear.

3422
05:08:02,602 --> 05:08:03,283
Peter Bowes.

3423
05:08:04,043 --> 05:08:10,088
Russia has reacted angrily after the International Olympic Committee banned its team from the forthcoming Winter Olympics.

3424
05:08:10,529 --> 05:08:19,697
The International Olympic Committee's decision comes after their damning report said that Moscow was guilty of an unprecedented systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system.

3425
05:08:20,177 --> 05:08:27,483
The decision has been welcomed by Dr. Grigory Radchenov, a Russian lab director who was the original whistleblower on the scandal.

3426
05:08:27,904 --> 05:08:29,305
Jim Walden is his lawyer.

3427
05:08:29,945 --> 05:08:35,067
Taking a country as powerful as Russia and saying you can't compete is a very significant penalty.

3428
05:08:35,627 --> 05:08:46,111
It shows that Russia and other countries who break the rules in this kind of a pervasive way need to be held accountable.

3429
05:08:46,891 --> 05:08:51,593
And so from that perspective, I think that it was a step that will help march us toward reform.

3430
05:08:52,061 --> 05:08:57,045
Well, in Russia itself, the Deputy Speaker of Parliament called the ban a humiliation and an insult.

3431
05:08:57,565 --> 05:09:00,447
And President Putin is due to speak about it later today.

3432
05:09:00,888 --> 05:09:03,830
Well, let's get reaction from the country actually hosting the Games.

3433
05:09:03,870 --> 05:09:05,831
Paul Adams is in South Korea.

3434
05:09:06,492 --> 05:09:11,595
I think everyone knew that the IOC was poised to take this unprecedented step.

3435
05:09:12,136 --> 05:09:14,698
And so the reaction here has been pretty measured.

3436
05:09:15,238 --> 05:09:26,260
The head of the committee here, Lee Hee Boom, said that it was the second-best alternative, a reference, obviously, to the fact that Russian athletes deemed to be clean will be able to attend.

3437
05:09:26,741 --> 05:09:27,921
He welcomed that decision.

3438
05:09:28,281 --> 05:09:30,401
There was a statement from the organizing committee.

3439
05:09:30,421 --> 05:09:33,002
We accept and respect the decisions of the IOC.

3440
05:09:33,562 --> 05:09:37,303
And they're very keen to emphasize that these games go ahead regardless.

3441
05:09:37,843 --> 05:09:42,986
The head of the organizing committee said he wasn't particularly worried about the impact on ticket sales.

3442
05:09:43,026 --> 05:09:45,848
He felt that those were going reasonably well.

3443
05:09:46,488 --> 05:09:50,891
Russia is strong in some areas and not so strong in others.

3444
05:09:50,951 --> 05:09:54,333
It's not a big downhill skiing nation, for example.

3445
05:09:54,773 --> 05:09:56,294
But it is a near neighbor.

3446
05:09:56,654 --> 05:10:01,237
The South Koreans must have been expecting significant numbers of Russian fans to show up.

3447
05:10:01,777 --> 05:10:02,958
And that obviously is not going to happen.

3448
05:10:03,398 --> 05:10:05,019
Paul Adams in South Korea.

3449
05:10:05,959 --> 05:10:12,583
Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus, has faced unrelenting bombardment over the past three weeks.

3450
05:10:13,163 --> 05:10:16,905
A ceasefire announced recently didn't even hold for a full 24 hours.

3451
05:10:17,606 --> 05:10:23,509
As the death toll from airstrikes continues to rise, so too does the number of children nearing starvation.

3452
05:10:23,829 --> 05:10:30,933
The UN has said that acute malnutrition among youngsters is at the highest level recorded anywhere in Syria since the war began.

3453
05:10:31,673 --> 05:10:34,313
Our correspondent Martin Patience reports from Eastern Ghouta.

3454
05:10:38,314 --> 05:10:43,315
The aftermath of the latest airstrikes is like a scene from hell.

3455
05:10:44,035 --> 05:10:50,296
The sky is dark with dust and debris as rescuers rush into buildings to scoop up children.

3456
05:10:51,436 --> 05:10:54,657
Among the injured was five-year-old Yusuf with a head wound.

3457
05:10:55,397 --> 05:11:01,058
The doctors patch him up as best they can, but they're desperately short of medical supplies.

3458
05:11:04,272 --> 05:11:11,363
A rebel stronghold, Eastern Rota, has been bombed and besieged by the Syrian government for several years.

3459
05:11:12,325 --> 05:11:15,249
Many families are now on the brink of starvation.

3460
05:11:18,143 --> 05:11:23,525
Eight-year-old Moor and his seven-year-old sister, Ghazal, sit round a wood-burning oven.

3461
05:11:24,425 --> 05:11:32,648
It's their first and only meal of the day, a thin piece of bread made from barley, which is normally fed to donkeys.

3462
05:11:33,748 --> 05:11:38,309
Their father, Abu Ahmed, was seriously injured when out gathering firewood.

3463
05:11:40,753 --> 05:11:43,774
A shell landed close to me and I was hit by a shrapnel.

3464
05:11:43,914 --> 05:11:48,114
I was blinded in my left eye and my knee was damaged and I can no longer walk.

3465
05:11:48,194 --> 05:11:53,355
I'm in a pretty bad shape and I have three kids to look after."

3466
05:11:54,396 --> 05:11:57,416
That means his children are left carrying the burden.

3467
05:11:57,956 --> 05:12:00,117
Here, they're fetching drinking water.

3468
05:12:01,157 --> 05:12:06,958
It's no surprise then that Ghazal dreams of freeing herself from her prison, Eastern Ghouta.

3469
05:12:08,899 --> 05:12:13,465
I wish I could have cookies, sweeties, or any other delicious foods.

3470
05:12:14,446 --> 05:12:19,493
And I wish someone could send me a pair of slippers and some new clothes and shoes.

3471
05:12:20,093 --> 05:12:24,599
I really miss food, like chicken, cheese, tea, and juice.

3472
05:12:30,760 --> 05:12:36,162
In another home, two-and-a-half-year-old Hamza is suffering from severe malnutrition.

3473
05:12:37,003 --> 05:12:41,864
His ribs are protruding, and he's wearing a plastic bag as a nappy.

3474
05:12:42,925 --> 05:12:45,866
He was abandoned before being taken in by a neighbour.

3475
05:12:47,147 --> 05:12:52,129
Umm Mohammed says Hamza is like one of her children.

3476
05:12:52,849 --> 05:12:54,850
He's my son now, she says.

3477
05:12:58,568 --> 05:13:01,670
There's supposed to be a ceasefire in eastern Ghouta.

3478
05:13:02,271 --> 05:13:05,893
But almost every day, people in this area dig fresh graves.

3479
05:13:06,674 --> 05:13:09,716
For families here, there's no respite from the war.

3480
05:13:10,097 --> 05:13:14,120
Martin Patience reporting from eastern Ghouta in Syria.

3481
05:13:15,140 --> 05:13:20,923
The billionaire businessman Andrej Babiš is due to be made Prime Minister of the Czech Republic later today.

3482
05:13:21,223 --> 05:13:27,967
Known as the Czech Donald Trump, he'll lead a minority government with the tacit support of parties from the far left and far right.

3483
05:13:28,607 --> 05:13:32,589
Let's speak to our correspondent in Prague, Rob Cameron.

3484
05:13:32,649 --> 05:13:35,070
Rob, how similar is he to Donald Trump?

3485
05:13:35,771 --> 05:13:43,815
Well, there have been those comparisons, perhaps inevitably, because Andrej Babiš is fantastically rich and there is something of the populist

3486
05:13:44,376 --> 05:13:47,861
about him, but I think the most striking resemblance to Donald Trump

3487
05:13:48,260 --> 05:14:03,771
is that both men have sold the public this image of fighters against the system, of fighting the hydra of corruption, of being an outsider, an iconoclast who's determined to bring the system crashing down.

3488
05:14:04,152 --> 05:14:06,934
Yet both have done massively well under the system.

3489
05:14:06,974 --> 05:14:15,620
That's certainly true of Andrei Babish, because he's been in business since the last few years of the communist system, and he's grown massively rich

3490
05:14:16,521 --> 05:14:29,454
in the transition to capitalism and yet he portrays himself as someone who is determined to bring change and bring the system crashing down and introduce something much more efficient and much better for the Czech Republic.

3491
05:14:29,674 --> 05:14:33,678
How will he be able to do that as a leader of a minority government?

3492
05:14:34,659 --> 05:14:38,503
Well that's going to be very difficult for him and I think if you speak to analysts here

3493
05:14:39,156 --> 05:14:53,442
They suggest that his first attempt to get a confidence vote through Parliament will in fact fail, and then he will be reappointed, appointed a second time by the President to lead a second attempt at forming a government.

3494
05:14:53,822 --> 05:14:59,005
That could, under the Czech system, last for several weeks, maybe even several months.

3495
05:14:59,025 --> 05:15:04,007
So he could be in place with no formal majority, but forming ad hoc coalitions

3496
05:15:04,467 --> 05:15:15,509
to make changes to, you know, very senior posts here and also take some important executive decisions without actually a formal majority.

3497
05:15:15,549 --> 05:15:24,911
But it is the fact that he is willing to lean for support on, say, the far right or the Communist Party that has some people quite worried.

3498
05:15:25,331 --> 05:15:26,971
Rob Cameron in Prague.

3499
05:15:27,551 --> 05:15:30,112
And now with a quick look at some of the day's other stories, here's Gareth.

3500
05:15:30,712 --> 05:15:39,201
The UN's Children Agency is warning that 17 million babies under the age of one are breathing toxic air, putting their brain development at risk.

3501
05:15:39,702 --> 05:15:49,672
Satellite images have revealed that babies in South Asia are the worst affected, with more than 12 million of them living in areas where air pollution is six times higher than safe levels.

3502
05:15:50,553 --> 05:16:01,297
Christine Keeler, the British former model, whose relationships with a British minister and a Soviet diplomat in the 1960s caused one of the most notorious political scandals of the Cold War, has died.

3503
05:16:01,677 --> 05:16:02,717
She was 75.

3504
05:16:03,298 --> 05:16:08,740
As a teenager, she had a brief affair with John Profumo, a senior cabinet member in Harold MacMillan's government.

3505
05:16:09,140 --> 05:16:14,942
She was also seeing Evgeny Ivanov, a Russian diplomat and KGB spy at the Soviet embassy.

3506
05:16:15,762 --> 05:16:19,784
A military operation in Western Cameroon has led to hundreds of people fleeing their villages.

3507
05:16:20,284 --> 05:16:27,107
The exodus comes after the government pledged to retaliate against an armed group that wants independence for the country's two English-speaking regions.

3508
05:16:27,948 --> 05:16:31,910
The hugely popular French rock star Johnny Hallyday has died at the age of 74.

3509
05:16:33,210 --> 05:16:39,073
During his five-decade career, he sold more than 110 million records and made 30 films.

3510
05:16:39,633 --> 05:16:43,255
Yet outside the French-speaking world, France's favourite pop icon,

3511
05:16:43,776 --> 05:16:45,339
is relatively little known.

3512
05:16:45,559 --> 05:16:47,203
Emma-Jane Kirby looks back at his life.

3513
05:16:52,305 --> 05:16:56,546
It was a career that spanned five decades and three generations.

3514
05:16:56,967 --> 05:17:06,530
Born as plain Jean-Philippe Smet, Johnny Halliday first hit the limelight aged 16 as an Elvis wannabe who sang rock in French.

3515
05:17:07,310 --> 05:17:18,874
His early concerts caused riots, but then French President Charles de Gaulle accused him of being a corrupter of youth who was spreading dangerous American values throughout France.

3516
05:17:22,266 --> 05:17:31,655
Yet despite having more than 900 songs under his belt and 100 live tours, his fame never really spread beyond the French-speaking world.

3517
05:17:32,516 --> 05:17:37,741
Most rock and roll stars, Johnny's life had its ups and downs.

3518
05:17:38,201 --> 05:17:46,169
For nearly 50 years, France's gossip and celebrity magazines were full of the details of his three failed marriages, his tax
