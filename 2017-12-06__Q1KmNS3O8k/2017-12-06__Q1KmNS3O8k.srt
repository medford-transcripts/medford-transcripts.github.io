1
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:55,731
Okay.

2
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:51,264
you

3
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:40,042
you

4
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:19,075
speaking in a regular meeting of the Senate President Council in September of 2017.

5
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:26,319
Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President.

6
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,051
[SPEAKER_114]: under God, with liberty and justice for all.

7
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:54,673
[SPEAKER_75]: Councilor Scarbell.

8
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:57,173
[SPEAKER_75]: Sorry, spin the rules so we can hear.

9
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:01,834
[SPEAKER_75]: Take something off of the unfinished business.

10
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:02,514
[SPEAKER_75]: That would be 17-734.

11
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:03,094
[SPEAKER_75]: Motion by Councilor Scarbell

12
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:20,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to go on record as recusing myself from the conversation.

13
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:25,911
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents live on South Street, and I spoke to state ethics today, and I'm going to recuse myself.

14
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:27,251
[SPEAKER_112]: Thank you, Councilor.

15
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:28,672
Councilor Scarponi.

16
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,413
[SPEAKER_75]: Thank you, Mr. President.

17
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:44,859
[SPEAKER_75]: After extensive meetings with our friends from Eversource and a thorough review on many concerns and issues, they've been very responsive with

18
00:09:46,271 --> 00:10:02,816
[SPEAKER_75]: Aside from all of the official approvals through the city engineer and all that need to be apprised of this daunting task of a huge project that will take us through a few different cities.

19
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:27,541
[SPEAKER_75]: If we can have, I think that we've gone over every issue to nauseam and I appreciate everybody's effort and Eversource's responses to all of our concerns and issues and I move to accept and place it on file.

20
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:30,883
[SPEAKER_75]: Move approval, excuse me.

21
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,070
[SPEAKER_96]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli.

22
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,691
[SPEAKER_96]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

23
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:41,592
[SPEAKER_96]: All those in favor.

24
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:44,672
[SPEAKER_115]: Councilor Dello Russo.

25
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:52,914
[SPEAKER_115]: Mr. President, we've had, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, quite extensive meetings, and we've gotten a lot of answers.

26
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:56,535
[SPEAKER_115]: We've gotten a lot of response.

27
00:10:57,495 --> 00:11:03,400
[SPEAKER_115]: in thoughtful responses to the questions that we've asked on behalf of the citizens regarding this program.

28
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:16,550
[SPEAKER_115]: We've also, I think, the representatives of Eversource and their contractor who's going to

29
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:32,862
[SPEAKER_115]: execute the project, have listened seriously and intently to the concerns of the council regarding the citizens and what they want regarding traffic, regarding safety.

30
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:45,084
[SPEAKER_115]: And we also delved in some of the previously negotiated items from the memorandum of agreement that was etched out between Eversource and

31
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:52,126
[SPEAKER_115]: the city administration and various department heads who have expertise in these matters.

32
00:11:53,006 --> 00:12:10,411
[SPEAKER_115]: And although we were able to make some inroads and renegotiate some of the aspects of the Yalta conference, Mr. President, I'm satisfied as one Councilor to have heard everything satisfactorily that concerns me.

33
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:15,613
[SPEAKER_115]: And I approve of this project of the grant.

34
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:17,035
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you.

35
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:18,316
[SPEAKER_68]: Vice President Mox.

36
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:20,537
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you, Mr. President.

37
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:23,019
[SPEAKER_68]: And I agree with my colleagues.

38
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:29,283
[SPEAKER_68]: This has been a thorough and really in-depth process.

39
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:41,811
[SPEAKER_68]: We've heard about this project for at least the past, I think, two and a half years now regarding this underground transmission line and that Eversource was going to be doing this particular work in the community.

40
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:45,233
[SPEAKER_68]: This council had a public hearing back

41
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:53,795
[SPEAKER_68]: I think now it's over a year ago where we opened it up to the general public to ask some preliminary questions regarding the process.

42
00:12:54,595 --> 00:13:13,159
[SPEAKER_68]: As I stated from the beginning and as I still state, this project, in my opinion, may benefit the overall grid and may benefit communities going out north, but it has little to no benefit to the residents of this community other than 100% disruption on our streets,

43
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,801
[SPEAKER_68]: traffic and everything else associated with this project.

44
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:34,128
[SPEAKER_68]: With that being said, Mr. President, I have to say over the last several weeks in meeting with Eversource and the Committee of the Whole meetings and asking the important questions that we did get many of our questions answered at the meeting.

45
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:40,911
[SPEAKER_68]: Part of the meeting tonight was to discuss some of the concerns we had from the last meeting and

46
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:56,337
[SPEAKER_68]: We did get, I think, some of the crucial issues, in my opinion, which, as Councilor Scarpelli brought up, regarding notification of the neighbors, and I feel very comfortable that there is going to be an exhaustive,

47
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:12,649
[SPEAKER_68]: a notification by Eversource to reach out to the neighborhood, not only door to door, but also to have a public meeting, which I think will address many of the issues or concerns residents may have along this particular route.

48
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:17,312
[SPEAKER_68]: And not just residents on the route, Mr. President, this impacts entire neighborhoods.

49
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:23,475
[SPEAKER_68]: and not just people on Winthrop Street or Mystic Ave or South Street, but entire neighborhoods.

50
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:46,249
[SPEAKER_68]: Also tonight, we requested that the city's new leak detection program, which was implemented back, I believe, roughly a year ago, that when this construction work that takes place on our roads is gonna be in the proximity of our water mains, over and above our water mains, that we as a community have to monitor and make sure that

51
00:14:47,309 --> 00:15:03,278
[SPEAKER_68]: If there is disruption to our 100-year-old water pipes or sewer pipes, that we are safeguarded as a community to make sure that Eversource will pick up the tab when it comes to lead or cast iron pipes.

52
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:06,340
[SPEAKER_68]: that may be disturbed during this process.

53
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:18,912
[SPEAKER_68]: And I think we've come to an agreement with Eversource and the city engineer will sit down and do case by case analysis on what they believe is warranted for repair.

54
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:24,298
[SPEAKER_68]: So I think that was a very positive outcome that took place.

55
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:31,143
[SPEAKER_68]: Also, Mr. President, and this has been an issue near and dear to me, raised crosswalks in the community.

56
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:39,029
[SPEAKER_68]: Back some years ago, Mayor McGlynn at the time implemented a pilot program to do three raised crosswalks.

57
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,393
[SPEAKER_68]: And some four years later, we've only implemented one on Winthrop Street.

58
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,555
[SPEAKER_68]: But this particular proposal

59
00:15:47,415 --> 00:16:03,290
[SPEAKER_68]: calls for not only the restoration of Winthrop Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Salt Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, but also, Mr. President, calls for the implementation of raised crosswalks

60
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:18,978
[SPEAKER_68]: at Medford High School on Winthrop Street, Winthrop Street at the crosswalk between Memorial Park and Medford Community Gardens, which we all know is a very tough place to cross, and South Street at the entrance of the pedestrian pathway to Route 16.

61
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:31,545
[SPEAKER_68]: So I am pleased to see that Eversource has included that in the MOU that is signed with the city, and I'm also very pleased to hear that

62
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:37,129
[SPEAKER_68]: We're not going to take a minimal standard as the city solicitor, which I don't know if he's here.

63
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,750
[SPEAKER_68]: I think he may have gone home.

64
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:43,207
[SPEAKER_68]: And I don't blame him, he's put a lot of work in this project.

65
00:16:44,107 --> 00:17:02,022
[SPEAKER_68]: But we're not going to follow just a minimal standard on erecting these raised crosswalks, but we're going to put something that's tastefully done, that aesthetically is pleasing, and something that adheres to state and federal statutes when it comes to transportation and public safety.

66
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:06,386
[SPEAKER_68]: So that is a very positive outcome also, Mr. President.

67
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:14,391
[SPEAKER_68]: I, as one member of the council, would like to see in future agreements.

68
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:25,459
[SPEAKER_68]: We heard from Eversource that even though they're coming to the council for a grant of location, that they already have a memorandum of understanding with the city.

69
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,664
[SPEAKER_68]: So they already sat down with the administration and negotiated everything they'd like to see take place with this project.

70
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:35,286
[SPEAKER_68]: However, they left out one key factor.

71
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:39,399
[SPEAKER_68]: that this project needs approval from the City Council.

72
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:49,188
[SPEAKER_68]: And as we all know, the City Council has its own opinion, its own ideas, and we also communicate with residents and department heads and so forth.

73
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:59,077
[SPEAKER_68]: And I would say for future projects, it would be helpful that the City Council, if any permits are required from us, we be a part of the process.

74
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:03,882
[SPEAKER_68]: in particular when it comes to a memorandum of understanding.

75
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:14,394
[SPEAKER_68]: The city of Boston, which I mentioned tonight, and I won't go into it, but I will bring it up at a future council meeting, has a great process for granting of locations.

76
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,536
[SPEAKER_68]: It's not done by the city council.

77
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,920
[SPEAKER_68]: It's done by a public improvement commission.

78
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:32,715
[SPEAKER_68]: And that commission is comprised of a number of members that sit on the transportation department, property management, inspectional services, water and sewer commission, and the engineering department.

79
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,959
[SPEAKER_68]: And that body gets together and holds public meetings.

80
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:45,986
[SPEAKER_68]: And they discuss with whoever the utility is what some of their plans are and what they'd like to see for mitigation.

81
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:52,891
[SPEAKER_68]: And the approval process is a lengthy process which also involves a checklist.

82
00:18:54,112 --> 00:19:07,126
[SPEAKER_68]: And I don't know, Cassandra, the city engineer is here tonight, but I don't know if our process has a thorough checklist on the process to which takes place in the community.

83
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:08,627
[SPEAKER_68]: We may or may have not.

84
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,528
[SPEAKER_68]: I don't know.

85
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:28,088
[SPEAKER_68]: I can tell you for future reference, Mr. President, it may be worthwhile to look at city ordinances and maybe at some point have the city council removed from the process and create a commissioner board that has all the parties together

86
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:34,831
[SPEAKER_68]: and collaboration that can deal with the utility companies, and it's one-stop shop.

87
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:44,034
[SPEAKER_68]: And as Ebersource mentioned, when they deal with Boston, when they get approval from the PIC, which is Public Improvement Commission,

88
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:51,057
[SPEAKER_68]: that when they leave there, they're done more or less with the permitting and all the process which takes place.

89
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,578
[SPEAKER_68]: And that's not the case here in the city of Medford.

90
00:19:53,878 --> 00:20:01,721
[SPEAKER_68]: They've met with the administration, they've met with the council, and now they're gonna have to go for street openings and other permits and so forth.

91
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:11,625
[SPEAKER_68]: And I think it would only be advantageous for this community and also beneficial to the residents of this community to have one body that looks at it with

92
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:19,936
[SPEAKER_68]: people that their expertise is in this particular field and I am going to offer that as a future resolution.

93
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:27,147
[SPEAKER_68]: But tonight, Mr. President, I do support this and I look forward to the continued commitment that ever

94
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:50,951
[SPEAKER_68]: Eversource has put out there to work with the city to provide a clerk of the works that will be the direct communicator with residents in Eversource or residents in Bond Construction so that residents aren't going to feel the frustration when they need to get a hold of someone at 830 at night and unable to get anyone at Eversource, but they will have a contact that they can reach out.

95
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,672
[SPEAKER_68]: We heard from the city engineer that there will be

96
00:20:54,672 --> 00:21:02,261
[SPEAKER_68]: a working group within the City of contact names and numbers that residents can speak with and that will alleviate a lot of concern.

97
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:09,369
[SPEAKER_68]: Also City Solicitor Rumley mentioned tonight and I thought it was an important subject that

98
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:32,534
[SPEAKER_68]: anyone along this particular route that needs access in and out of their property, someone that might be confined to their home or someone that may need dialysis or other health concerns that Eversource and the city work together to locate where these people are and to communicate directly with the people on the need for access when this construction is taking place.

99
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:35,415
[SPEAKER_68]: So I want to thank all the parties involved

100
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:41,498
[SPEAKER_68]: in particular, the city engineer and the city solicitor for their dedication on this project, Mr. President.

101
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:42,658
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

102
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:49,501
[SPEAKER_96]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

103
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,162
[SPEAKER_112]: Councilor Dello Russo?

[SPEAKER_112]: Yes.

00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:58,823

[SPEAKER_112]: Yes.

113
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:00,845
[SPEAKER_112]: Councilor Scarpelli.

114
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:01,165
[SPEAKER_96]: Yes.

00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:02,767
[SPEAKER_112]: President Caraviello.

116
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:06,510
[SPEAKER_96]: Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, and one abstention.

117
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,572
[SPEAKER_96]: Is that correct?

118
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,174
[SPEAKER_96]: Motion passes.

119
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:10,915
[SPEAKER_96]: Mr. President.

120
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,658
[SPEAKER_96]: While we're on the suspension, yes, Mr. Vote.

121
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:15,018
[SPEAKER_96]: Councilor Scarpelli.

122
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:28,625
[SPEAKER_75]: Can we pull up paper 17-590, it's the Method Association, LLC, Middle Glen Mall, special permit extension hours, 30 day review for December 5th, if we can?

123
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:29,265
[SPEAKER_96]: Yes, we can.

124
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:34,468
[SPEAKER_96]: Disregards the special permit for Wegmans,

125
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:45,650
[SPEAKER_96]: I had contacted John Babuso and he has said that there is no complaints or problems over there that have been reported to him.

126
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:58,837
[SPEAKER_96]: I also spoke to the president of the Condo Association for 3920 Mrs. Valley Parkway and they have said they had no concerns that have been reported to them.

127
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:04,349
[SPEAKER_96]: Do you want to make a motion to?

128
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:07,551
[SPEAKER_75]: Yeah, if I can make the motion that we now.

129
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:08,831
[SPEAKER_75]: 60 days.

130
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:09,692
[SPEAKER_75]: 60 days, next review.

131
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:14,815
[SPEAKER_96]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

132
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:15,835
[SPEAKER_96]: All those in favor?

133
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:16,115
[SPEAKER_96]: Aye.

134
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:17,596
[SPEAKER_96]: Motion passes.

135
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,998
[SPEAKER_96]: While we're on the suspension, Councilor Lococo.

136
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

137
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:29,022
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could allow a couple minutes, a resident would like to speak with regards to the.

138
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,203
[SPEAKER_95]: We have a resident that would like to speak.

139
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:32,619
[SPEAKER_95]: Good evening.

140
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:33,699
[SPEAKER_95]: Name and address of the record, please.

141
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,781
[SPEAKER_37]: Mariana Ducey, 2 North Street, Medford.

142
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:48,491
[SPEAKER_37]: I was before the council last week, and you people passed a resolution regarding the extension of the comment deadline for the Green Line project.

143
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:53,695
[SPEAKER_37]: And the resolution passed, but yet there's been no reverse 911 call.

144
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:54,735
[SPEAKER_37]: That was the resolution.

145
00:23:55,756 --> 00:23:59,499
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm here to question why, what happened,

146
00:24:03,272 --> 00:24:05,032
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, Council President.

147
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:06,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

148
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:08,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for coming again.

149
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:13,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We did pass a resolution requesting that reverse 911 call go out.

150
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:21,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that definitely should have been done before today, but we still have one week, one week left.

151
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:25,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Comments are open and meet are due no later than 5 p.m.

152
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:27,057
[SPEAKER_04]: on Tuesday, December 12th.

153
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:29,798
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's one more week to comment on the

154
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:31,919
[SPEAKER_04]: further extension of the Green Line.

155
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:46,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked, I sent an email out to the mayor today to ask if the mayor's office today to see if we could get a reverse 9-1-1 call to notify the residents, the entire city, especially those that live in the hillside in South Medford.

156
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm publicly asking that a reverse 9-1-1 call go out.

157
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they

158
00:24:52,090 --> 00:25:00,092
[SPEAKER_04]: notification hasn't been great on this project and I think that's essential that we let the public know whether they're for or against or have concerns.

159
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:11,215
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a right to be heard and a right to know what's going on and when deadlines are and when they're extended and when meetings are and this is just one component so I hope that we can get that reverse 911 call out tomorrow.

160
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:27,809
[SPEAKER_37]: If there's an objection from the city hall here, I'd like to know what it is, why they didn't want to send this out because, you know, I mean, the same reason that people weren't notified about the meeting to begin with still stands because the same population didn't know

161
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,031
[SPEAKER_37]: that the deadline was extended.

162
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,073
[SPEAKER_37]: So it's the same principle.

163
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:38,277
[SPEAKER_37]: And they agreed to do the reverse 9-1-1 to tell people that the meeting was scheduled for Thanksgiving week.

164
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:41,879
[SPEAKER_37]: So I really can't see why they don't want to continue this way.

165
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,623
[SPEAKER_37]: Going forward, I hope MassDOT does a better job of communicating with people.

166
00:25:46,663 --> 00:25:56,389
[SPEAKER_37]: I think Councilor General LaRusso last week passed an amendment to the resolution to say that he would like the MassDOT to notify people by mail.

167
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,313
[SPEAKER_37]: So we'll see what happens in the next round.

168
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:03,515
[SPEAKER_115]: Councilor Dello Russo.

169
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:16,766
[SPEAKER_115]: Just briefly on that note as you remember early on in the process 13 years ago that was one of the major concerns that I think people have

170
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:35,094
[SPEAKER_115]: who administer projects like this sometimes become, because they live in a world of email communication, sometimes lose track of the fact that not everybody lives on that planet, and that we're dealing with a bigger solar system, and so various modes of communication have to be employed.

171
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:40,498
[SPEAKER_115]: And that's why we sent that letter out to the department.

172
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:42,044
[SPEAKER_37]: Right, I appreciate that.

173
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:51,828
[SPEAKER_37]: Not only that, but we, 13 years have passed, new people have moved into the neighborhood that didn't even know about this project, that couldn't even get on any kind of a list because they didn't know about it.

174
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:52,368
[SPEAKER_115]: Exactly.

175
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:58,930
[SPEAKER_37]: So, I appreciate your requesting the reverse 9-1-1 again and we'll hope for the best, I guess.

176
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:00,411
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you very much.

177
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:02,232
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you for your hard work.

178
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:04,633
[SPEAKER_96]: While warrant suspension?

179
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:14,144
[SPEAKER_115]: While we're on the suspension, some citizens on Winchester Street would like to address the council regarding a matter that we all received notice on, Mr. President.

180
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:19,486
[SPEAKER_115]: There are some citizens here that would like to speak.

181
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,400
[SPEAKER_90]: Good evening.

182
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:22,761
[SPEAKER_115]: Name and address of the record, please.

183
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:24,583
[SPEAKER_90]: My name is Fran Abola.

184
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,944
[SPEAKER_90]: I live at 9 Alfred Street.

185
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:31,888
[SPEAKER_90]: First of all, I'd like to thank everybody here for giving me an opportunity to listen and hear what's going on.

186
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:34,771
[SPEAKER_90]: I've been living at this address my whole life.

187
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:38,754
[SPEAKER_90]: I'm right next to Nardone Electric.

188
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:40,055
[SPEAKER_90]: I still own the property.

189
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:49,526
[SPEAKER_90]: When he came here in 1995, I never had a problem, anything that I had a problem with, I could call Steve.

190
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:50,447
[SPEAKER_90]: I still have his number.

191
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:52,449
[SPEAKER_90]: I'd say, hey, Steve, this is what's going on.

192
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:54,831
[SPEAKER_90]: And everything always seemed to be resolved.

193
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:59,835
[SPEAKER_90]: His business expanded, and he left the premises.

194
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:00,755
[SPEAKER_90]: He moved to Woburn.

195
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:03,257
[SPEAKER_90]: And that's when all the trouble started.

196
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,557
[SPEAKER_90]: A company by the name of J.F.

197
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:10,359
[SPEAKER_90]: White, which is probably one of the top ten contractors, I would say, in Boston.

198
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:19,781
[SPEAKER_90]: They come in in this area and they totally disrupted the neighborhood with noise, banging,

199
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:26,060
[SPEAKER_90]: loud, I've been woken up, I have all the records here.

200
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,461
[SPEAKER_90]: I mean, I just started filming.

201
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:30,283
[SPEAKER_90]: This is what happened since 2015, 16, when I moved in.

202
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:36,187
[SPEAKER_90]: I didn't film any of this, because I was trying to resolve this all with Steve, who was pretty cooperative, trying to help me.

203
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,869
[SPEAKER_90]: But it just seems we weren't getting anywhere.

204
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:43,752
[SPEAKER_90]: But I have started taking documentation with my phone, which is, my house is literally

205
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:49,396
[SPEAKER_90]: My bedroom was from here to where that gentleman is, Mr. Lepore, of where all the pipes are being stored.

206
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,017
[SPEAKER_90]: They get slammed down.

207
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:55,760
[SPEAKER_90]: They have a fork truck that's made to pick up four tons, okay?

208
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,062
[SPEAKER_90]: They slam the pipes down, 6.30 in the morning.

209
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:01,044
[SPEAKER_90]: I've been woken up about 20 times.

210
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,184
[SPEAKER_90]: I have all the dates here.

211
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:05,126
[SPEAKER_90]: Every video can back up everything I'm talking about here.

212
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:12,331
[SPEAKER_90]: I'm talking about four o'clock in the morning, one o'clock in the morning, and it just totally disrupts the neighborhood.

213
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:14,712
[SPEAKER_90]: I've tried to have them stopped.

214
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:24,700
[SPEAKER_90]: I went down to the building inspector, found out, oh, I spoke to a gentleman by the name of John Bufuso, and he said, oh, you know, there's nothing we can do.

215
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,423
[SPEAKER_90]: You know, I go, well, not doing electric's not operating the property anymore.

216
00:29:28,743 --> 00:29:30,924
[SPEAKER_90]: He goes, well, that carries on to the new tenant.

217
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:43,728
[SPEAKER_90]: Well, you know, looking at everything, and then I asked to go back to get a proposal in 1995 when the ordinance was changed exclusively for Nargon Electric, that they were allowed to operate there.

218
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:53,131
[SPEAKER_90]: This building was used for storage, car storage for Knox Brothers Dodge, and before that, back in the 1900s, it was used to store army jeeps that used to come off the trains.

219
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,352
[SPEAKER_90]: So this building was always storage.

220
00:29:55,412 --> 00:29:56,152
[SPEAKER_90]: It's not like, you know,

221
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:58,835
[SPEAKER_90]: You moved in the neighborhood, you knew what you were living next to.

222
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:00,437
[SPEAKER_90]: It was always quiet, you know?

223
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:01,979
[SPEAKER_90]: It was just cars being parked.

224
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:03,681
[SPEAKER_90]: It wasn't anything business-disruptive.

225
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:08,386
[SPEAKER_90]: Now it's gotten to a point where I work, you know, a demanding job.

226
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:09,487
[SPEAKER_90]: I work a lot of hours.

227
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:11,550
[SPEAKER_90]: I'm not even home that much, you know?

228
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,092
[SPEAKER_90]: I work double shifts sometimes.

229
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:31,064
[SPEAKER_90]: I get woken up at 1.30, 2.30, 4 o'clock in the morning, 6.30 in the morning, 5.30 in the morning, pipes banging, and the pipes literally have destroyed my kitchen floor, blew the tiles right up, because they bring this pipe down that's 30 feet long, about 26 inches wide, and slam it down, and boom, bang.

230
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:35,327
[SPEAKER_90]: And it sounds like, you know, and the grinding, I have an audio clip for you.

231
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:36,948
[SPEAKER_90]: think you want to hear it.

232
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:41,432
[SPEAKER_90]: It'd be a great soundtrack for Guantanamo Bay because it's torturous to listen to.

233
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:43,854
[SPEAKER_90]: And you've got to hear this at 6.30 in the morning.

234
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:51,801
[SPEAKER_90]: And then another thing, too, I just want to, is the other day they have a flatbed truck

235
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:57,163
[SPEAKER_90]: I mean, they're supposed to be, you know, whatever's going on, you should at least have the safety involved in whatever you do.

236
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:57,843
[SPEAKER_90]: Okay?

237
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:10,247
[SPEAKER_90]: Winchester Street, they come down with a flatbed truck, they block the whole street, and then they come out with a fork truck and block the whole street and block the two neighbors behind there on Winchester Street.

238
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,007
[SPEAKER_90]: They can't even get out of their own driveway.

239
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:14,868
[SPEAKER_90]: Not even calling a cop to come down on a detail.

240
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:19,029
[SPEAKER_90]: And all we want is we want peace, and we just want it to stop.

241
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:21,970
[SPEAKER_90]: We haven't got one, uh,

242
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:24,044
[SPEAKER_90]: No one knows when they're getting out of there.

243
00:31:24,064 --> 00:31:26,646
[SPEAKER_90]: We don't know when the lease is, no one knows anything.

244
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:30,910
[SPEAKER_90]: We try to speak to this, you know, the building commission says we're in violation, they're in violation.

245
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,393
[SPEAKER_90]: Well, they're in violation from the day they moved in.

246
00:31:34,713 --> 00:31:36,635
[SPEAKER_90]: They're not Nardone Electric, they're J.F.

247
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:36,975
[SPEAKER_90]: White.

248
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,237
[SPEAKER_90]: Well, they're trying to find another place.

249
00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:41,278
[SPEAKER_90]: Find another place, what about the neighbors?

250
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,741
[SPEAKER_90]: It seems like they're more concerned on getting a place for J.F.

251
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:45,042
[SPEAKER_90]: White.

252
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,403
[SPEAKER_90]: And it's totally disrupted the neighborhood.

253
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:53,104
[SPEAKER_90]: Dumpsters full of stuff, seven in the morning, throwing stuff.

254
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:57,245
[SPEAKER_90]: And all the trash isn't even from the job that they're working at at that building.

255
00:31:57,525 --> 00:32:02,507
[SPEAKER_90]: This trash comes in on a flatbed truck from Kendall's, because I work at MIT every day.

256
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,907
[SPEAKER_90]: This trash comes from the work they're doing on the bridge from Kendall.

257
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:07,548
[SPEAKER_90]: Fills up the truck with trash.

258
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,549
[SPEAKER_90]: They used to come in at one o'clock in the morning, waking me up, slamming the door, that stopped.

259
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,010
[SPEAKER_90]: Now they come in at seven o'clock in the morning with the truck full of trash.

260
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,854
[SPEAKER_90]: First thing they do, boom, start emptying out, boom, start throwing everything in the dumpster.

261
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,496
[SPEAKER_90]: The grinding, the doors are wide open.

262
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:27,400
[SPEAKER_90]: This guy's outside grinding next to stuff, the acetylene tanks, flammable products.

263
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,701
[SPEAKER_90]: They just do whatever they want.

264
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:29,782
[SPEAKER_90]: There's no control.

265
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:34,365
[SPEAKER_90]: I'm kind of upset about it, because I've been putting up this for three years.

266
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,867
[SPEAKER_90]: And I just want your guys' help.

267
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:39,029
[SPEAKER_90]: If you can help, just let me know, when does this end?

268
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,831
[SPEAKER_90]: Who's going to enforce this?

269
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:42,232
[SPEAKER_90]: Who's doing this?

270
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,774
[SPEAKER_90]: These people are doing whatever they want.

271
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:45,856
[SPEAKER_90]: When are they gonna get out?

272
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:49,921
[SPEAKER_90]: I can't even find out when the lease is or when they're supposed to get out.

273
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:58,911
[SPEAKER_90]: I just came here tonight just to address the attention to everybody here and just ask for some help and put us in the right direction on where we go with this.

274
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:01,554
[SPEAKER_90]: for the whole neighborhood.

275
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,295
[SPEAKER_90]: It's really gotten totally out of control.

276
00:33:04,795 --> 00:33:09,538
[SPEAKER_90]: And if you go by there and see the pipe, how big it is, it's insane.

277
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:17,623
[SPEAKER_90]: I get all this video and stuff, I don't want to play it for you, but if you want to hear one grind, I'll let you hear it.

278
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,825
[SPEAKER_90]: This is at 6.30 in the morning.

279
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:26,168
[SPEAKER_90]: I have to decline that call, sorry about that.

280
00:33:31,382 --> 00:33:32,745
[SPEAKER_90]: This is next door to my house.

281
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:37,533
[SPEAKER_90]: All dead.

282
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:39,878
[SPEAKER_90]: This is next door to my house.

283
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,930
[SPEAKER_90]: What they do is they grind it.

284
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,371
[SPEAKER_90]: What they're doing is they're prepping the pipes for the big dig over there, whatever they're doing, I'm sorry, the Kendall Bridge.

285
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:56,233
[SPEAKER_90]: And what they're doing is they're prepping all the big pipes, putting all the elbows on, the offset, the offsets, the heat exchangers, whatever they're putting on.

286
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,874
[SPEAKER_90]: And then they grind it, they weld it, they're welding outside.

287
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:02,195
[SPEAKER_90]: I get video of sparks flying all over the place.

288
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:08,296
[SPEAKER_90]: And then they come in, it's 6.30 in the morning with a big flatbed truck, and this thing backs up.

289
00:34:08,316 --> 00:34:12,657
[SPEAKER_90]: That's all it does is beep, beep, beep, and then they load the flatbed on and they take it out.

290
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:16,080
[SPEAKER_90]: You know, there's guys urinating outside next to the dumpster.

291
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,162
[SPEAKER_90]: I mean, I didn't have a camera with me every time.

292
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:19,123
[SPEAKER_90]: But you know what?

293
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,806
[SPEAKER_90]: I wish I had one with me, but I'm not home all the time.

294
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:24,868
[SPEAKER_90]: So I don't know even what goes on during the day.

295
00:34:24,948 --> 00:34:28,292
[SPEAKER_90]: She works from her house and she deals with the day stuff.

296
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,093
[SPEAKER_90]: But I'm not even home that much.

297
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:34,197
[SPEAKER_90]: in the morning, and I'm out early, and then I come home late at night.

298
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:35,278
[SPEAKER_40]: I live across the street.

299
00:34:35,298 --> 00:34:36,158
[SPEAKER_40]: My name is Mark McPartland.

300
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:39,601
[SPEAKER_40]: I live at 8 Alfred Street, and I work a couple days a week from home.

301
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:46,066
[SPEAKER_40]: I work for Philips Health Care, an international company, so I take a lot of early morning international phone calls and conference calls throughout the day.

302
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:52,151
[SPEAKER_40]: And basically, from spring to fall, I can't have my windows open during the day because I can't be heard on my conference calls.

303
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:54,673
[SPEAKER_118]: Thank you.

304
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,314
[SPEAKER_96]: Councilor Dayton.

305
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,514
[SPEAKER_118]: Mr. President, I think that this is a matter that's appropriate for further review from our building commissioner.

306
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:12,241
[SPEAKER_118]: It's my understanding that in our packet here there is a letter from Mr. Mulkey to the property owner indicating that the current use is an improper use.

307
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,482
[SPEAKER_118]: It's not in compliance with the zoning board decision.

308
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:20,246
[SPEAKER_118]: And it's also my understanding that there was a process to relocate this tenant, Mr. President.

309
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:23,929
[SPEAKER_118]: But if we look further in the packet, we'll also see that that process has fallen through.

310
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:29,871
[SPEAKER_118]: So I think it would be incumbent upon us to figure out where we are in the process from our building commissioner to see what's going on.

311
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,151
[SPEAKER_118]: Ultimately, we've had situations like this in the past.

312
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:41,854
[SPEAKER_118]: If you recall several years back when they were doing the Winthrop Street drainage project, they were using Apostolon Mystic Ave as a layover yard, which abutted Sylvia Road, which is a residential street.

313
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,535
[SPEAKER_118]: And many of the same complaints and same concerns came up.

314
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:49,418
[SPEAKER_118]: you know, working with the building commissioner and the administration, we were able to get them out of there in short order.

315
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:54,961
[SPEAKER_118]: And I think that this is a project, a similar situation, and I think that you have everybody on the same page.

316
00:35:55,001 --> 00:36:00,425
[SPEAKER_118]: I don't think that anybody in the administration wants these people here disrupting the quality of life, and I'm certainly sure that nobody behind this rail does.

317
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,847
[SPEAKER_118]: So with that being said, I think that the proper steps, Mr. President, would be to

318
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:20,085
[SPEAKER_118]: Refer this to the building commissioner for response to see what's going on Ultimately, I think this is something that may have to go through the city solicitor's office at some point in time But as of right now, it's up to the code enforcement officer to issue the appropriate fines for non-compliance with the zoning act and Then go from there Thank You

319
00:36:21,398 --> 00:36:22,179
[SPEAKER_115]: Councilor Dello Russo.

320
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:23,540
[SPEAKER_115]: Thank you, Mr. President.

321
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:34,349
[SPEAKER_115]: I've spoken with Mr. Vola on a couple occasions about this and spoken to the building commissioner, Mr. Moki.

322
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,672
[SPEAKER_115]: Clearly, upon all the research you've done, Fran,

323
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:51,562
[SPEAKER_115]: that the activity that's going on is beyond the scope allowed in the initial variance given to the property owner some 20 plus years ago.

324
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,264
[SPEAKER_115]: The property owner is not in there.

325
00:36:54,664 --> 00:37:04,230
[SPEAKER_115]: He leased the property out to a company that's clearly operating way beyond the scope of the restrictions placed on the use of that property.

326
00:37:07,212 --> 00:37:08,813
[SPEAKER_115]: They are in the process from what the

327
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:15,980
[SPEAKER_115]: Building Commissioner has told me they are in the process of finding a new location.

328
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,403
[SPEAKER_115]: However, he doesn't have an answer on when that's going to be.

329
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:30,291
[SPEAKER_115]: And that's what has him concerned the most, because it's too open-ended, and you folks need redress right away.

330
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:32,052
[SPEAKER_115]: I just want peace.

331
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:32,753
[SPEAKER_90]: That's all.

332
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:33,453
[SPEAKER_90]: I can't.

333
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,255
[SPEAKER_90]: And the whole thing is, is we just

334
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:38,778
[SPEAKER_90]: We just want an answer.

335
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,418
[SPEAKER_90]: That's the whole thing.

336
00:37:39,478 --> 00:37:41,179
[SPEAKER_90]: It's like everything's left up in the air.

337
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:41,820
[SPEAKER_90]: I don't know.

338
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,440
[SPEAKER_90]: I don't know.

339
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,841
[SPEAKER_115]: Here's what it is at this point.

340
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:49,704
[SPEAKER_115]: First of all, I have to share my surprise with J.F.

341
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:49,924
[SPEAKER_115]: White.

342
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:55,866
[SPEAKER_115]: You rightly mentioned, they're one of the top construction firms in Boston.

343
00:37:56,226 --> 00:38:07,711
[SPEAKER_115]: They do enormous projects, and you would think, given their history and their success, that they ought to know how to treat people, and they're not treating you well.

344
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:10,973
[SPEAKER_115]: And that's sad.

345
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:23,604
[SPEAKER_115]: Mr. Mulkey has examined this and cited the property owner for a zoning violation.

346
00:38:24,204 --> 00:38:26,365
[SPEAKER_115]: So a citation has been issued, all right?

347
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:34,467
[SPEAKER_115]: He goes through then a process of responding or appealing, and then they go from there.

348
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:37,787
[SPEAKER_115]: Hopefully this will be resolved before then.

349
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:40,588
[SPEAKER_115]: He personally met with the,

350
00:38:41,428 --> 00:38:46,111
[SPEAKER_115]: the manager or whoever's in charge at that location for the construction company.

351
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:52,356
[SPEAKER_115]: He explained to them and walked through the whole thing with them where they're in violation.

352
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:55,678
[SPEAKER_115]: So they themselves have been put on notice.

353
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:06,586
[SPEAKER_115]: He's assured us that the inspectional service director, Mr. Bavuso, is monitoring them on off hours and making spot checks

354
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:10,127
[SPEAKER_115]: to survey the property, he wanted you to be aware of that.

355
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:14,229
[SPEAKER_115]: And then this is going to have to follow its course.

356
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:25,674
[SPEAKER_115]: I have to say that from what I've been told, the property owner is aware of what's going on clearly now and wants to move to get them out of there.

357
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:32,357
[SPEAKER_115]: Because he doesn't want them, that reflects poorly, because as you recall, he was a good neighbor.

358
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:39,639
[SPEAKER_90]: He's a great guy and I think what actually happened is I think he didn't realize that when they came in and took the space that this was all going to be going on.

359
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:41,719
[SPEAKER_90]: I think he was probably misled himself.

360
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:42,099
[SPEAKER_115]: Right.

361
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:45,020
[SPEAKER_115]: He probably thought it was going to be a dump spot for trucks and that was it.

362
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,040
[SPEAKER_115]: Like it's kind of been.

363
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,441
[SPEAKER_115]: And he was kind of turned key when he operated out there.

364
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,602
[SPEAKER_115]: The trucks left for the day on their projects.

365
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:52,562
[SPEAKER_115]: Never had a problem with him.

366
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:52,982
[SPEAKER_115]: No.

367
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:56,766
[SPEAKER_115]: So that's where I've been updated on this.

368
00:39:57,607 --> 00:40:10,464
[SPEAKER_115]: As far as a council resolution, that's up to the councilors if we want to refer this for action and further communication from the building inspector, but that's where he has us today.

369
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:11,285
[SPEAKER_90]: Okay.

370
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:11,805
[SPEAKER_115]: All right.

371
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:15,169
[SPEAKER_90]: Well, I'm glad everybody gave me a chance to speak.

372
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,952
[SPEAKER_115]: But this is important, too.

373
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:29,366
[SPEAKER_115]: This work that you put together is important, because I think it helped us as Councilors clarify the scope to which they're behind, and it also is clear that it's

374
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:34,034
[SPEAKER_115]: Um, uh, I know your friend.

375
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:36,014
[SPEAKER_115]: I mean, you're not a complainer.

376
00:40:36,715 --> 00:40:38,536
[SPEAKER_115]: Um, I just want to sleep peacefully.

377
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:40,716
[SPEAKER_115]: I don't sleep much as it is, you know, exactly.

378
00:40:40,997 --> 00:40:42,097
[SPEAKER_115]: You work morning, noon and night.

379
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:44,238
[SPEAKER_90]: Well, thank you all.

380
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,098
[SPEAKER_90]: Thank you very much.

381
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:47,459
[SPEAKER_68]: Vice president mocks.

382
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,660
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you.

383
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,700
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you, Mr. President.

384
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:50,341
[SPEAKER_68]: And, um,

385
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:55,754
[SPEAKER_68]: I think we're beyond the point of just talking, giving lip service.

386
00:40:56,695 --> 00:41:03,179
[SPEAKER_68]: And no matter how many violations are handed out, that's not going to help Fran's problem.

387
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,260
[SPEAKER_68]: That's not going to help the neighbor's problems.

388
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:16,287
[SPEAKER_68]: At this particular point, it was clear when I read that document that although they're saying they have plans to relocate, but when you don't give a time frame

389
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,587
[SPEAKER_68]: To me, that's just lip service.

390
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,848
[SPEAKER_68]: So I don't have too much confidence.

391
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:24,329
[SPEAKER_68]: I don't know how long their lease is, as you mentioned.

392
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,430
[SPEAKER_68]: They could have a 10-year lease, five-year lease, who knows.

393
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:37,632
[SPEAKER_68]: But I think at this point, and I've been on the council for a number of years, I think this calls for a cease and desist order, which could be handed out by the building commissioner.

394
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:42,653
[SPEAKER_68]: And I think we're at that point, I shouldn't say I think, I know we're at that point.

395
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:45,334
[SPEAKER_68]: And I think the,

396
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:49,856
[SPEAKER_68]: building commissioner has to line up all his ducks before he does that.

397
00:41:50,336 --> 00:42:05,746
[SPEAKER_68]: But I think we're at that point right now that I would ask the council take a vote to have the building commissioner look into a ceased immediate cease and desist order based on the fact that they're working prior to 7 a.m.

398
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:09,348
[SPEAKER_68]: In the morning, which is a violation of zoning ordinances.

399
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,090
[SPEAKER_68]: They're also doing work

400
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:20,377
[SPEAKER_68]: in that particular location that is not of proper use, which I think the building commissioner already cited them based on that.

401
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:31,908
[SPEAKER_68]: And to me, that's enough information to have in hand to go and provide a cease and desist order, which would have them close operations immediately until it goes to court.

402
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:38,094
[SPEAKER_68]: And I'm sure any business, especially if they're doing work, like you're mentioning, are not going to want to close their operation

403
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:42,677
[SPEAKER_68]: So it really brings them back to the table once this action's taken.

404
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:55,987
[SPEAKER_68]: So I would ask that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we direct the building commissioner to issue a cease and desist order immediately on this particular property.

405
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:59,910
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

406
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a point of information?

407
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:08,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

408
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:10,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

409
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:11,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Councilor Marks.

410
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:21,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I think from those, just listening to that one clip, that would drive me absolutely crazy, never mind while I'm sleeping, during the day while I'm trying to work.

411
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:25,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we need to get a little tougher as a city on this establishment.

412
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,851
[SPEAKER_04]: cease and desist seems to me like it's probably the way to go.

413
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:52,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also ask that we request an opinion from the city solicitor, depending on how long it takes to actually cease and desist the operation, with regards to if the permit was given to Nardone Electric and only to them, how is JF White operating at the site?

414
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was an important piece of information that maybe

415
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:56,792
[SPEAKER_04]: the building commissioner, um,

416
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:04,303
[SPEAKER_04]: needs an opinion from the solicitor to shut down operations.

417
00:44:04,863 --> 00:44:09,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the hours of operation, it seems like it's going all through the night, all through the morning.

418
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:12,685
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a start time and an end time that should be followed.

419
00:44:12,745 --> 00:44:15,166
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's an important piece of information as well.

420
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine every night listening to that noise.

421
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:27,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever the city needs to do, I think they need to do it as if it was their home that was on 8 or 9 Alfred Street.

422
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would second that.

423
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:31,049
[SPEAKER_04]: resolve.

424
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:36,071
[SPEAKER_118]: Mr. President, just to clarify the motion that I made.

425
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:42,652
[SPEAKER_118]: The motion that I was making was to refer the paper to the Building Commissioner Enforcement of the Zoning Act, which would be all-encompassing.

426
00:44:42,672 --> 00:44:47,734
[SPEAKER_118]: It would take into consideration any and all steps that he needs to take to make sure that there's a complying use at this location.

427
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:56,071
[SPEAKER_96]: We have two motions on the floor.

428
00:44:56,111 --> 00:45:01,635
[SPEAKER_96]: We have one from Councilor Marks, Vice-President Marks, and we have one from Councilor Knight.

429
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:03,537
[SPEAKER_96]: As amended.

430
00:45:03,557 --> 00:45:04,417
[SPEAKER_96]: As amended.

431
00:45:04,437 --> 00:45:07,400
[SPEAKER_96]: So, which one are we gonna go with?

432
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,662
[SPEAKER_112]: I think they're one and the same.

433
00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:11,603
[SPEAKER_96]: I just wanted to clarify what I was saying.

434
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:17,908
[SPEAKER_118]: We should refer to the purpose of enforcing the Seizing Act.

435
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:25,253
[SPEAKER_96]: Councilor Marks is asking for a cease and desist.

436
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:28,856
[SPEAKER_114]: Which is probably a step in the process of enforcing the Zoning Act.

437
00:45:29,536 --> 00:45:34,560
[SPEAKER_68]: Right, but I think we're at the point right now where that's the highest level of council to accomplish a request.

438
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:34,700
[SPEAKER_96]: Okay.

439
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,801
[SPEAKER_96]: Other than the zoning, that's fine.

440
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:44,286
[SPEAKER_96]: All right, we'll go with Councilor Marks' motion that the Building Commissioner order a cease and desist, seconded by?

441
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:45,767
[SPEAKER_96]: Councilor Dello Russo.

442
00:45:46,147 --> 00:45:47,668
[SPEAKER_96]: Councilor Dello Russo, all those in favor?

443
00:45:47,688 --> 00:45:48,029
[SPEAKER_96]: Aye.

444
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:49,410
[SPEAKER_96]: Motion passes.

445
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:52,722
[SPEAKER_96]: Motion to revert back to.

446
00:45:52,942 --> 00:45:53,723
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you very much.

447
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:54,564
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you, Mr. Vola.

448
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:55,585
[SPEAKER_90]: Have a good night.

449
00:45:56,846 --> 00:46:02,532
[SPEAKER_96]: Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scarpelli.

450
00:46:02,572 --> 00:46:03,233
[SPEAKER_96]: All those in favor.

451
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:20,543
[SPEAKER_96]: 17785 offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the double poles on Alexander Avenue, pole number 4444 and 4443, and on Barnaround, pole number 2994, be removed in the interest of public safety.

452
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:21,524
[SPEAKER_96]: Vice President Mox.

453
00:46:22,124 --> 00:46:23,105
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you, Mr. President.

454
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:28,128
[SPEAKER_68]: I would just ask that this be sent to National Grid for immediate removal of the double poles.

455
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:30,329
[SPEAKER_68]: And also, if we can get a report

456
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:38,575
[SPEAKER_68]: I believe it was several months back I asked for an update on the double pole report, and I don't think we have yet to receive an update.

457
00:46:39,435 --> 00:46:42,938
[SPEAKER_68]: I'm seeing more and more double poles throughout the community, which is good.

458
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:50,303
[SPEAKER_68]: It means they're replacing older poles, but we also want to stay on top of the utilities to make sure they're removing the double pole, Mr. President.

459
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:52,245
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you.

460
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:54,987
[SPEAKER_96]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by

461
00:46:56,792 --> 00:47:01,433
[SPEAKER_96]: by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

462
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:02,373
[SPEAKER_96]: Motion passes.

463
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:16,437
[SPEAKER_96]: 17-786, petition by Roberta Cameron, Ralph Nordstrom, Reverend Mast, to address the council for an update of the completion of the community preservation plan in the opening of the application process for the first round of funding.

464
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:23,233
[SPEAKER_51]: Yes, Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in Medford.

465
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,537
[SPEAKER_51]: Roberta Cameron is on her way here.

466
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:26,578
[SPEAKER_51]: She should be here shortly.

467
00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:29,362
[SPEAKER_51]: She's the chair of the Community Preservation Committee.

468
00:47:29,923 --> 00:47:32,267
[SPEAKER_51]: She asked me to speak on her behalf until she gets here.

469
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,161
[SPEAKER_51]: and to answer any questions that the Council may have.

470
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:39,885
[SPEAKER_51]: I've been serving on the committees, the CPC, since it was formed in May of this year.

471
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:48,651
[SPEAKER_51]: I believe you have a four-page handout that summarizes the plan in front of you that was distributed with the meeting minutes today.

472
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:56,753
[SPEAKER_51]: And I just want to summarize a couple quick points and then take any questions you may have about the CPA and CPC.

473
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:05,519
[SPEAKER_51]: So over the last six months, the Community Preservation Committee has undertaken to fulfill its obligation to undertake a study of the community needs across Medford.

474
00:48:06,578 --> 00:48:12,643
[SPEAKER_51]: We coordinated with many of the boards in this building and a lot of stakeholders and committees across the entire city.

475
00:48:13,164 --> 00:48:24,033
[SPEAKER_51]: That included things like the Friends of the Medford Public Library, the Royal House, Friends of the Fells, really anyone who could possibly be a recipient or a stakeholder in the CPA process.

476
00:48:25,805 --> 00:48:29,086
[SPEAKER_51]: So we've just published our final community preservation plan.

477
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:32,548
[SPEAKER_51]: It's online, and it's soon to be available in print.

478
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:36,729
[SPEAKER_51]: And we have also opened up the application process for the first round of funding.

479
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:40,930
[SPEAKER_51]: There will be two rounds in 2018.

480
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:44,812
[SPEAKER_51]: The first application process is just for determining if the project is viable.

481
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:47,533
[SPEAKER_51]: That is due on December 15th, which is 10 days from today.

482
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:54,079
[SPEAKER_51]: They'll be awarded, the funds will be awarded in March of next year and then the fall of next year as well.

483
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:56,421
[SPEAKER_51]: Two rounds for fiscal year 17 and 18.

484
00:48:57,122 --> 00:49:01,466
[SPEAKER_51]: And every other, every year following will just be in one round in the fall of each year.

485
00:49:03,448 --> 00:49:11,757
[SPEAKER_51]: So we, again, May will be the award of the first round, October the award of the second round, and October going forward for each year.

486
00:49:13,024 --> 00:49:33,020
[SPEAKER_51]: It's a two-stage process to determine eligibility first, which is the 12-15 date, and then a more detailed application that will obviously get into more details about how much money it costs, the project, who's going to benefit, if there's any matching funds, and how it will serve the city of Medford in terms of the most number of people.

487
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:39,507
[SPEAKER_51]: We'll also consider some off-cycle applications on an as-needed basis.

488
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:44,489
[SPEAKER_51]: There has to be extraordinary circumstances to do that.

489
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:53,493
[SPEAKER_51]: We're not going to just open up the process unless there's a real need, and that could be the City of Medford, it could be somebody else, but we're not going to do that as part of our regular basis.

490
00:49:53,513 --> 00:49:56,754
[SPEAKER_51]: We're going to have everyone compete and then evaluate all the projects.

491
00:49:56,814 --> 00:49:58,215
[SPEAKER_51]: As the City Council knows, you are

492
00:49:59,035 --> 00:50:04,597
[SPEAKER_51]: the final step in the process in terms of approving these projects, but the projects start really from the ground up.

493
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:09,119
[SPEAKER_51]: They're more of a grassroots thing from non-profits and from citizens.

494
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:15,141
[SPEAKER_51]: It could be community groups, neighborhood groups, park advocates, a whole bunch of different options, obviously.

495
00:50:16,393 --> 00:50:26,319
[SPEAKER_51]: So we also intend to set aside $25,000 in funding for small projects, for CPA funds, up to $5,000 for projects with a total cost of up to 10.

496
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:34,184
[SPEAKER_51]: A very simplified application process to, again, to kind of make sure we capture both big and the small and the medium-sized projects as well.

497
00:50:36,386 --> 00:50:45,852
[SPEAKER_51]: It's important to note, as I mentioned before, the city council has the final approval for our CPA funding in order to spend community preservation committee grants.

498
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:52,080
[SPEAKER_51]: All proposals will be vetted open to the public.

499
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,261
[SPEAKER_51]: There'll be public hearings.

500
00:50:53,301 --> 00:51:00,406
[SPEAKER_51]: People will have a chance to advocate for their project and evaluate and give opinions on all the projects that are being submitted.

501
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:14,618
[SPEAKER_51]: At present, the general consensus of the Community Preservation Committee is that we basically equally distribute the funds right now until we understand what's going to be submitted between open space and recreation, affordable housing, and historic preservation.

502
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:18,599
[SPEAKER_51]: Obviously, we don't know what's going to be submitted yet, because nothing has been submitted yet.

503
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,621
[SPEAKER_51]: When we get the projects, we'll obviously evaluate them then.

504
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:34,766
[SPEAKER_51]: But our thought was, after the public forms we had, the public input we had, and talking to all the stakeholders, that we wanted to kind of give ourselves flexibility, but keep generally distributed evenly amongst those three categories.

505
00:51:35,386 --> 00:51:40,468
[SPEAKER_51]: As you all know, by statute, we'd have to have 10% minimum for each of those categories.

506
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:51,636
[SPEAKER_51]: But that leaves 70% that is beyond the administrative needs that is discretionary in terms of which bucket of grants that they go into.

507
00:51:54,918 --> 00:52:11,147
[SPEAKER_51]: As shown in the handout, if you look at the first page, the priorities and goals are laid out pretty clearly, and I'm obviously here to answer any questions, specific questions you may have about the process, or what the needs are, or how we're gonna evaluate these projects.

508
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:14,449
[SPEAKER_51]: So I open up to the council to ask any questions you may have.

509
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:16,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

510
00:52:16,757 --> 00:52:18,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

511
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:20,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Doug Kerr, for coming to explain.

512
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,245
[SPEAKER_04]: My first question just would be with regards to, I understand May and October will be, funds will be awarded, and then October, every year after that, going forward.

513
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:36,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think going forward, it'll be more of a timeline known to the public.

514
00:52:36,228 --> 00:52:42,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question is with regards to this December 15th eligibility determination form due date.

515
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:46,075
[SPEAKER_04]: How have we advertised that so far?

516
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:49,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And when did the advertisements start?

517
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:55,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so we know, I just want to make sure that people are well aware of it and have known for a while.

518
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:58,006
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems just like a very quick date.

519
00:52:58,626 --> 00:53:04,431
[SPEAKER_51]: We do have a coordinator, as everyone knows, Danielle Evans, who was hired by the CPC.

520
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:09,014
[SPEAKER_51]: who works three days a week in this building.

521
00:53:10,075 --> 00:53:18,040
[SPEAKER_51]: And as part of her job is to basically distribute that information as wide as possible into the city.

522
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,963
[SPEAKER_51]: I know she has a big email list that's been developed over the last

523
00:53:22,923 --> 00:53:25,125
[SPEAKER_51]: six or seven months with all the people that we've met.

524
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:28,747
[SPEAKER_51]: Obviously it's on our website as well.

525
00:53:29,187 --> 00:53:31,008
[SPEAKER_51]: I believe there's a link on the city website as well.

526
00:53:32,029 --> 00:53:41,054
[SPEAKER_51]: I don't know if there are any other advertisements in the paper, but picking up on what was just talked about with the Green Line extension, obviously

527
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:43,396
[SPEAKER_51]: The more people that know about this, the better.

528
00:53:43,556 --> 00:53:48,940
[SPEAKER_51]: And that we can't do enough in terms of trying to make sure, whether it's reverse 9-1-1, putting in a transcript.

529
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:55,244
[SPEAKER_51]: The point is that we will do our best to let as many people know as possible through as many forums as possible.

530
00:53:55,945 --> 00:54:00,188
[SPEAKER_51]: We've already had two public forums attended by about 100 people over the last few months.

531
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:04,351
[SPEAKER_51]: And our meetings are obviously open to the public, as every open meeting is.

532
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:07,693
[SPEAKER_51]: But frankly, it is quick.

533
00:54:08,053 --> 00:54:09,474
[SPEAKER_51]: It is happening relatively fast.

534
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:13,337
[SPEAKER_51]: It is the holiday season, so I can understand why people might miss it.

535
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:18,821
[SPEAKER_51]: The point also I think is worth noting is that if people don't get it in by December 15th, there's still

536
00:54:20,115 --> 00:54:25,037
[SPEAKER_51]: There's still opportunity to get it in, and there's still a second round in next year, so they don't have to rush.

537
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:29,758
[SPEAKER_51]: There's going to be at least $1.2 million, I believe, in each of those two rounds available.

538
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,119
[SPEAKER_51]: That's a significant amount of dollars.

539
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:36,081
[SPEAKER_51]: If your project is $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000, that's going to go a long way.

540
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:39,762
[SPEAKER_51]: And we obviously want to have the maximum impact on the city of Medford in terms of

541
00:54:40,442 --> 00:54:46,345
[SPEAKER_51]: improving the quality of our city, whether it's restoring a park, whether it's restoring a historic building, creating affordable housing.

542
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:47,726
[SPEAKER_51]: There's so many different avenues.

543
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:54,869
[SPEAKER_51]: If you had a chance to read the document that was put together by the CPC over the last few months, the needs in Medford are great.

544
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,330
[SPEAKER_51]: They are really profound.

545
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,812
[SPEAKER_51]: It's a real challenge with affordable housing in this city.

546
00:55:00,352 --> 00:55:06,556
[SPEAKER_51]: There's a lot of historic needs in this city, and there's certainly a lot of demand for open space and recreation across this city.

547
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:11,420
[SPEAKER_51]: That is clearly, these funds are meant to fill those gaps and take the city, move the city forward.

548
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:17,424
[SPEAKER_51]: So I can try to get as much information to you, Councilor, as I can beyond what I just described in terms of the advertising.

549
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:24,909
[SPEAKER_51]: But I would just obviously ask people to go to our website, read the plan, and the application will take somebody 10 minutes to fill out.

550
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,521
[SPEAKER_51]: really to get it approved.

551
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:30,463
[SPEAKER_34]: Point of information, Joan Sierra, 40 Cedar Road North.

552
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:37,849
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe the coordinator sent a request into the Medford transcript to have something in the paper, but I think she missed last week's deadline, so it's likely going to be in this week.

553
00:55:38,555 --> 00:55:48,581
[SPEAKER_34]: Not a lot of time, but this is a very quick round because we had to get our process in place, and then we finally got the application done, and we're trying to get the money out as quickly as we can.

554
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:50,022
[SPEAKER_34]: So the first round is going to be really quick.

555
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:52,903
[SPEAKER_34]: The second round is going to be on a regular time schedule and then future rounds.

556
00:55:53,464 --> 00:55:58,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So when did the coordinator send out a notice to her whole email list?

557
00:55:59,212 --> 00:56:09,718
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe it was directly after we had, sorry, the initial meeting where we announced the plan and had some input from the public, which was, I believe, the last Monday.

558
00:56:09,778 --> 00:56:10,258
[SPEAKER_34]: Last Monday.

559
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:10,919
[SPEAKER_34]: Last Monday night.

560
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:13,100
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

561
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:13,820
[SPEAKER_04]: So the end of November.

562
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,321
[SPEAKER_34]: End of November, correct.

563
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And about how many emails does that go out to, do you know?

564
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:20,804
[SPEAKER_34]: I want to say over 200 people.

565
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:31,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if they miss the December 15th deadline, that's for a determination form.

566
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:37,476
[SPEAKER_04]: So do they still have till March 2nd to do a full application for the first round?

567
00:56:38,517 --> 00:56:40,359
[SPEAKER_34]: That, I'm not sure about that.

568
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:41,300
[SPEAKER_34]: It might be the second round.

569
00:56:43,772 --> 00:56:47,454
[SPEAKER_51]: I think for the smaller projects, it's going to be very simple.

570
00:56:47,535 --> 00:56:52,658
[SPEAKER_51]: So I don't think it'll be difficult to get those in by the March actual award.

571
00:56:52,698 --> 00:56:58,822
[SPEAKER_51]: We just want to make sure that nobody spends time working on a project that will not be funded by statute.

572
00:56:58,862 --> 00:57:05,867
[SPEAKER_51]: We want to make sure it's viable as a project, so they don't fundraise, match grants, write all these details, and then it's not viable.

573
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:07,548
[SPEAKER_51]: We don't want to waste anyone's time, obviously.

574
00:57:08,824 --> 00:57:10,785
[SPEAKER_51]: So it's important to get that step out of the way.

575
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:14,707
[SPEAKER_51]: And our coordinator, I think, will be, remember, she's here to answer all these questions.

576
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:18,809
[SPEAKER_51]: People can call her here at Medford or stop by her office three days a week.

577
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,971
[SPEAKER_51]: I think it's Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.

578
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:26,413
[SPEAKER_51]: To talk about the process, to answer questions.

579
00:57:26,433 --> 00:57:28,934
[SPEAKER_51]: She's been a resource for the committee as well, because we're new at this.

580
00:57:28,974 --> 00:57:34,056
[SPEAKER_51]: She has experience in the community preservation arena from previous jobs.

581
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:41,920
[SPEAKER_34]: Is there a particular type of communication?

582
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,004
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll be able to help people with the actual applications too?

583
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:45,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

584
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:45,685
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

585
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:50,651
[SPEAKER_34]: And she's invited people to call her before they fill out the eligibility form to help them walk through the process.

586
00:57:51,391 --> 00:58:00,022
[SPEAKER_34]: Is there a particular form of communication that the council thinks would be helpful for us to use when these deadlines come up besides website, Medford transcript, email?

587
00:58:01,765 --> 00:58:02,466
[SPEAKER_75]: The loop maybe?

588
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:03,188
[SPEAKER_75]: I'm sorry?

589
00:58:03,368 --> 00:58:05,092
[SPEAKER_75]: The loop on cable access.

590
00:58:05,393 --> 00:58:11,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Cable access, Facebook, any type of... I'm sure one on the Facebook page.

591
00:58:11,185 --> 00:58:11,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

592
00:58:11,365 --> 00:58:11,907
[SPEAKER_34]: I missed that one.

593
00:58:12,473 --> 00:58:16,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, my concern, and I appreciate all the hard work you've done.

594
00:58:16,174 --> 00:58:25,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the committee's worked very hard, and I attended one of the forums, which was very, you know, it was a two-hour forum, definitely learned a lot.

595
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:33,577
[SPEAKER_04]: My concern, just with this first round, is that today is the 5th, and December 15th is when the applications are due.

596
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,998
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is, that's just my concern for this initial round.

597
00:58:38,538 --> 00:58:43,159
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be many, yes, there will be many more rounds, but we're talking about a lot, you know, $1.2 million.

598
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:50,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just, I feel like it's a lot of money to rush organizations when you could maybe extend it a few weeks or.

599
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:58,402
[SPEAKER_51]: And there's no guarantee that we would award even half that if the projects aren't there or not enough people.

600
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:02,322
[SPEAKER_51]: It will obviously just, that money just goes back into the fund for the next round.

601
00:59:02,362 --> 00:59:03,482
[SPEAKER_51]: It becomes a much bigger round.

602
00:59:04,143 --> 00:59:06,603
[SPEAKER_51]: We don't know that until we see what comes before us, obviously.

603
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:24,589
[SPEAKER_51]: So I know it is quick, but we are hoping that people will at least put in, literally spend 10 minutes, put together a project name, a couple sentences description, see if it's viable, and then spend the next few months really developing the project.

604
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,591
[SPEAKER_51]: really figuring it out.

605
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:30,053
[SPEAKER_51]: Do you need to hire someone?

606
00:59:30,313 --> 00:59:31,053
[SPEAKER_51]: Is it available?

607
00:59:31,494 --> 00:59:32,954
[SPEAKER_51]: Is the property available?

608
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:36,557
[SPEAKER_51]: Is the property got a master plan already in place?

609
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:37,717
[SPEAKER_51]: Is it something that's shovel ready?

610
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:38,818
[SPEAKER_51]: There's so many different factors here.

611
00:59:39,696 --> 00:59:40,256
[SPEAKER_34]: That's just it.

612
00:59:40,296 --> 00:59:41,517
[SPEAKER_34]: We just don't know what we're going to get.

613
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:43,738
[SPEAKER_34]: We could get a ton of applications.

614
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:44,879
[SPEAKER_34]: We could get no applications.

615
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:45,920
[SPEAKER_34]: I doubt that's going to happen.

616
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,302
[SPEAKER_34]: But if we need to change the timeline based on what we get, we'll have to do that.

617
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:53,204
[SPEAKER_34]: It's basically what our first option out there is.

618
00:59:53,224 --> 00:59:55,045
[SPEAKER_34]: And if we need to change that, we will.

619
00:59:55,951 --> 00:59:57,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're being funded.

620
00:59:57,272 --> 01:00:00,173
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in the key dates, but the first round, you said, was in March.

621
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:01,714
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be awarding.

622
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:02,315
[SPEAKER_34]: Right.

623
01:00:02,355 --> 01:00:09,759
[SPEAKER_34]: So in consultation with you folks, since you're going to be approving the plan, we're trying to, on the first round, it's going to probably coincide a little bit.

624
01:00:09,959 --> 01:00:12,301
[SPEAKER_34]: We're trying to get it ahead of your regular normal budget schedule.

625
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:17,924
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's why we're trying to get it done in March, and then moving it to the fall to get away from your normal budget schedule.

626
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:22,967
[SPEAKER_34]: That's it for now.

627
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:25,048
[SPEAKER_100]: Councilor Falco.

628
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:26,289
[SPEAKER_100]: Thank you, Mr. President.

629
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:28,611
[SPEAKER_100]: And I'd like to thank you for all your hard work.

630
01:00:28,631 --> 01:00:32,693
[SPEAKER_100]: I know this group has been meeting nonstop putting this program together.

631
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:36,475
[SPEAKER_100]: And I had an opportunity to attend the forum last Monday night at the South Medford Fire Station.

632
01:00:36,495 --> 01:00:38,056
[SPEAKER_100]: And you did a great job.

633
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:39,917
[SPEAKER_100]: I mean, it was explaining the program.

634
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:42,639
[SPEAKER_100]: And there were a lot of good questions.

635
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:43,479
[SPEAKER_100]: And it was well attended.

636
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,141
[SPEAKER_100]: But I would definitely agree.

637
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,903
[SPEAKER_100]: If you can put something on cable access, I think even

638
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:58,350
[SPEAKER_100]: almost like an infomercial, just kind of describing what it's about, you know, how people can, you know, apply the process, who to contact with questions.

639
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,612
[SPEAKER_100]: I think that would be definitely beneficial.

640
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:09,760
[SPEAKER_100]: You know, people do, people do watch programs on that station, so I think it's something that, it's a great mode to, of communication to actually get a message out to people.

641
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,762
[SPEAKER_100]: So I think that, I would definitely agree.

642
01:01:11,782 --> 01:01:14,944
[SPEAKER_100]: I think that, you know, a lot of,

643
01:01:16,195 --> 01:01:18,497
[SPEAKER_100]: successful programs, it all comes down to communication.

644
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,038
[SPEAKER_100]: And I think that this is the key.

645
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:23,220
[SPEAKER_100]: But I had a quick question for you.

646
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,283
[SPEAKER_100]: Can you talk a little bit about the small projects?

647
01:01:27,303 --> 01:01:28,503
[SPEAKER_100]: I think it was 25,000.

648
01:01:28,623 --> 01:01:29,324
[SPEAKER_100]: You talked about that.

649
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:31,525
[SPEAKER_100]: I know that question came up last Monday as well.

650
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,567
[SPEAKER_100]: So if you could just shed a light on that, that would be great.

651
01:01:33,587 --> 01:01:45,695
[SPEAKER_34]: So when Roberta and I attended a CPC forum that was run by the city of Somerville a couple months back, the other towns that have already implemented the CPA said that they had set aside a little bit of funding

652
01:01:45,975 --> 01:01:49,999
[SPEAKER_34]: for really small projects, your gardens or that kind of thing.

653
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:59,089
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think what we said was the request would be up to $5,000 per project if the total project was 10, so really small projects.

654
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:04,174
[SPEAKER_34]: We just don't want the little guy feeling like they're going to get taken over by the big project that comes in.

655
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:06,797
[SPEAKER_34]: We wanted to set something aside for them.

656
01:02:07,387 --> 01:02:08,368
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's pretty much what it is.

657
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:09,188
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a trial.

658
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,189
[SPEAKER_34]: We're going to see how it works.

659
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,910
[SPEAKER_100]: And I think it's a great idea.

660
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:16,574
[SPEAKER_100]: So the total project has to be $10,000.

661
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,996
[SPEAKER_100]: Is the total budget for that piece $25,000?

662
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:22,679
[SPEAKER_34]: The total request for CPA funding would be $5,000, as long as the total project was $10,000.

663
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,921
[SPEAKER_34]: So you put in $5,000 from some other source.

664
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:26,322
[SPEAKER_34]: We'd put in $5,000.

665
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:33,657
[SPEAKER_51]: If I could echo on that, one of the evaluation criteria is for matching funds as much as possible.

666
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:51,665
[SPEAKER_51]: Not 100 percent, but it always, I think, and this is quite common in any grant application, if the applicant brings some money to the table to show that there's public support for it and that money will go further, obviously, if we can spread that money and get matching.

667
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:54,546
[SPEAKER_51]: It could be a one-to-one, or it could be a partial match.

668
01:02:54,586 --> 01:03:03,211
[SPEAKER_51]: I think that is one of the criteria that we evaluate, which most grant applications do, to benefit to the money to stretch as far as it can go.

669
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:17,158
[SPEAKER_51]: We urge people, if they're looking for a $20,000 project, maybe they bring $5,000, $10,000, or even another $20,000 to the table, because it will obviously help the process and stretch the money further for the whole city.

670
01:03:17,509 --> 01:03:19,771
[SPEAKER_34]: And again, everything is a trial for this first year.

671
01:03:20,391 --> 01:03:21,732
[SPEAKER_34]: We've seen what other towns have done.

672
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:22,773
[SPEAKER_34]: We're going to try it here.

673
01:03:22,813 --> 01:03:23,433
[SPEAKER_34]: If it works, great.

674
01:03:23,473 --> 01:03:24,634
[SPEAKER_34]: If it doesn't, we'll try something else.

675
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:33,701
[SPEAKER_100]: And as far as in the other cities and towns that you've talked to, that small piece of the budget that was allocated to small projects, is that something that's been successful?

676
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:34,742
[SPEAKER_34]: Very successful.

677
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:35,663
[SPEAKER_34]: Very successful.

678
01:03:35,703 --> 01:03:36,964
[SPEAKER_34]: That's why we wanted to implement it.

679
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:37,364
[SPEAKER_100]: Good.

680
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:37,924
[SPEAKER_100]: Sounds good.

681
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:38,244
[SPEAKER_100]: I like it.

682
01:03:38,465 --> 01:03:38,725
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

683
01:03:40,129 --> 01:03:40,689
[SPEAKER_34]: Councilor Nice.

684
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,651
[SPEAKER_118]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

685
01:03:43,451 --> 01:03:44,832
[SPEAKER_118]: I just want to say, keep doing what you're doing.

686
01:03:44,913 --> 01:03:46,434
[SPEAKER_118]: You guys are doing an excellent job.

687
01:03:46,494 --> 01:03:52,898
[SPEAKER_118]: This is a group that's been very dedicated to this initiative and endeavor since collecting the signatures for the ballot drive back in 2015.

688
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:56,201
[SPEAKER_118]: And to date, we've seen some great progress.

689
01:03:56,221 --> 01:03:57,662
[SPEAKER_118]: So I just want to thank you for your efforts.

690
01:03:57,682 --> 01:03:59,223
[SPEAKER_118]: This really is a marathon, not a sprint.

691
01:03:59,744 --> 01:04:06,709
[SPEAKER_118]: And you guys have really been holding government's feet to the fire to make sure that this is done appropriately and in a fashion that's going to be successful.

692
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:08,470
[SPEAKER_118]: So I want to thank you for your efforts and your hard work.

693
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:12,029
[SPEAKER_118]: Again, keep doing what you're doing, because I think it's work, and the word's getting out there.

694
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:17,253
[SPEAKER_118]: People are talking about it, and people are excited to see the fruits of the labor that has been put into this.

695
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:18,374
[SPEAKER_118]: So thank you very much for your work.

696
01:04:19,835 --> 01:04:21,656
[SPEAKER_51]: Roberta Cameron, who's not here, obviously.

697
01:04:21,696 --> 01:04:22,597
[SPEAKER_51]: She's right behind you.

698
01:04:22,617 --> 01:04:23,157
[SPEAKER_51]: She's here.

699
01:04:23,617 --> 01:04:24,598
[SPEAKER_51]: Who's hiding behind me.

700
01:04:24,638 --> 01:04:26,079
[SPEAKER_51]: She's hiding behind us.

701
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:27,960
[SPEAKER_51]: Has been the driving force of this, really.

702
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,182
[SPEAKER_51]: The credit should go to her and the rest of the committee.

703
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:31,763
[SPEAKER_51]: But she's been fantastic on this.

704
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:36,079
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, and we appreciate all the help that you are giving us because, again, we're new at this.

705
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,580
[SPEAKER_34]: The more we communicate, the better the product is going to be at the end.

706
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,161
[SPEAKER_34]: These progress reports will come on occasion.

707
01:04:43,181 --> 01:04:44,301
[SPEAKER_34]: We're not going to keep you in the dark.

708
01:04:44,321 --> 01:04:46,622
[SPEAKER_34]: We want to keep you involved as to what's happening.

709
01:04:46,962 --> 01:04:50,143
[SPEAKER_34]: Guide us, help us, and it's going to be a collaborative effort.

710
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:55,625
[SPEAKER_75]: I thank you, Mr. President, again.

711
01:04:55,725 --> 01:05:02,000
[SPEAKER_75]: I thank Typical Roberta sitting in the back and sitting down, but again, this is

712
01:05:03,504 --> 01:05:05,245
[SPEAKER_75]: what people would be doing.

713
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:06,706
[SPEAKER_75]: She's definitely not the lazy one.

714
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:18,452
[SPEAKER_75]: But I will tell you, if you see what's going on in neighboring communities that have implemented the Community Preservation Act, and you see the small projects that are happening, it makes such a huge impact on the community.

715
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,013
[SPEAKER_75]: And it really makes a neighborhood a true neighborhood again.

716
01:05:21,073 --> 01:05:23,614
[SPEAKER_75]: So I'm really excited to see that.

717
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:29,417
[SPEAKER_75]: I think that one of the conversations I've had with different organizations, a lot of the youth organizations,

718
01:05:31,497 --> 01:05:34,120
[SPEAKER_75]: It's something as simple as getting the word out to their organizations.

719
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,625
[SPEAKER_75]: For instance, Little League, Babe Ruth, Girls Softball, Youth Socket.

720
01:05:40,085 --> 01:05:47,873
[SPEAKER_75]: Those organizations talk about fields and some questions they've had because I know they've been trying to capture some funding through the city.

721
01:05:49,334 --> 01:05:56,545
[SPEAKER_75]: But everybody that voted for the CPA had talked about, well, this could be a viable source.

722
01:05:56,605 --> 01:06:01,953
[SPEAKER_75]: So I think this is another avenue that maybe we can tap into and reach out to those organizations.

723
01:06:04,597 --> 01:06:19,038
[SPEAKER_75]: There's one group that contacted me and I directed them right to the site so I know that they're coming with a, it's not a huge project, but it's also a project that what I like to hear and like to see is that you have organizations that come

724
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:22,181
[SPEAKER_75]: coming in that will be asking for something that they'll work for as well.

725
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:27,406
[SPEAKER_75]: It's not just my hands out give it to me so we can take care of this one group and that's it.

726
01:06:27,926 --> 01:06:41,319
[SPEAKER_75]: It's I think that what's nice to see is the the partnership to say hey listen this is what our community voted on and this is what how people have worked on to get make this happen but at the same time we want to we want to do something great for our community

727
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,181
[SPEAKER_75]: But we're willing to put in the work with you.

728
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:51,063
[SPEAKER_75]: So it's impressive to see the community stakeholders now as we move forward with this process.

729
01:06:51,083 --> 01:07:03,108
[SPEAKER_75]: So I'm, for one person who worked very hard with the recreation group and this being one of the pieces that when you talked about arts and not just sports and fields but

730
01:07:03,988 --> 01:07:05,389
[SPEAKER_75]: the whole gamut of what we can do.

731
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:07,131
[SPEAKER_75]: I think it's really exciting to see.

732
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:09,072
[SPEAKER_75]: So, again, I thank you for all your hard work.

733
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:12,515
[SPEAKER_75]: I know Roberta's still sitting back there, but thank you for everything you've done.

734
01:07:12,555 --> 01:07:16,258
[SPEAKER_75]: And I'm, for one counts, I'm very excited to see what's coming in front of us.

735
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,159
[SPEAKER_75]: So, thank you.

736
01:07:17,919 --> 01:07:18,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

737
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

738
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:30,289
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could just request a copy of the email that went out to the 200 organizations and people from.

739
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:32,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Devens, Ms.

740
01:07:32,912 --> 01:07:33,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Devens.

741
01:07:34,977 --> 01:07:35,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle Evans.

742
01:07:35,637 --> 01:07:36,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Danielle Evans.

743
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:37,719
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could get that email.

744
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:48,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I request that you just take another look and potentially, possibly push the first date two weeks just to get a little more, two to three weeks just to get a little more.

745
01:07:51,016 --> 01:07:52,377
[SPEAKER_04]: let the public know a little bit more.

746
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:54,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I get the transcript.

747
01:07:54,178 --> 01:07:55,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know of this date.

748
01:07:55,819 --> 01:08:01,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like I just want to make sure that it is potentially $1.2 million.

749
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:08,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to make sure that everybody and every organization is fully aware of this application date.

750
01:08:08,808 --> 01:08:10,069
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my only request.

751
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:10,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

752
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:11,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Respectfully.

753
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:16,334
[SPEAKER_96]: Roberta, did you want to say anything?

754
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:21,652
[SPEAKER_129]: Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to hear everything that was said.

755
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:22,773
[SPEAKER_129]: I kind of walked in in the middle.

756
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:36,549
[SPEAKER_129]: But just in response to your last statement or request about the timeline is that we're squeezing the first round in because we're already a year overdue.

757
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:51,375
[SPEAKER_129]: And we worked backwards from when we needed you to be able to approve the funds, and worked backwards to give ourselves the minimal time that we felt that we needed to be able to consider each of the applications fully.

758
01:08:51,776 --> 01:08:54,397
[SPEAKER_129]: And that's what drove the December 15 date.

759
01:08:54,477 --> 01:09:00,919
[SPEAKER_129]: So we worked very hard to have the plan completed in time to be able to roll out the application.

760
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:15,607
[SPEAKER_129]: We've been doing the best that we can to get the word out about that, but as Doug mentioned earlier, the first hurdle, the eligibility determination form is a very brief form.

761
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:23,632
[SPEAKER_129]: So if people are aware of it, if they have a project that they think is ready to go for the first round, submit the form immediately.

762
01:09:23,852 --> 01:09:28,495
[SPEAKER_129]: If you have a project that needs a little bit more time to cook, submit for the second round.

763
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:31,757
[SPEAKER_129]: We'll take your eligibility application form any time.

764
01:09:32,638 --> 01:09:38,484
[SPEAKER_129]: And we can work with you to figure out which funding round you best fit into.

765
01:09:38,605 --> 01:09:42,709
[SPEAKER_129]: But there's a second funding round coming up this coming year.

766
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:50,198
[SPEAKER_129]: So really the deadline is, if you look at it, March is your next chance to get in line.

767
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:58,158
[SPEAKER_51]: Also, if you submit an eligibility form, it does not commit you to doing that project immediately.

768
01:09:58,839 --> 01:10:00,421
[SPEAKER_51]: It could be done in the second round.

769
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:01,623
[SPEAKER_51]: You just want to know, is it eligible?

770
01:10:01,663 --> 01:10:04,066
[SPEAKER_51]: You don't have to do it as quickly as possible.

771
01:10:04,086 --> 01:10:07,891
[SPEAKER_51]: I can tell you that I know the Berkshire State is going to submit like seven.

772
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:10,193
[SPEAKER_51]: They're not going to do seven in one year.

773
01:10:10,213 --> 01:10:11,674
[SPEAKER_51]: We're going to do that over three years.

774
01:10:11,714 --> 01:10:13,796
[SPEAKER_51]: We want to know if they're eligible just to get in line.

775
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:15,497
[SPEAKER_51]: Might be only one or two.

776
01:10:15,537 --> 01:10:17,179
[SPEAKER_51]: And then, of course, we don't even know if they're going to be funded.

777
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,260
[SPEAKER_51]: And obviously, I have a conflict of interest.

778
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:25,766
[SPEAKER_51]: And I will recuse myself, as the councilor just did right now, earlier this evening on the evaluation.

779
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:28,628
[SPEAKER_51]: So just getting the eligibility form is just the first step.

780
01:10:28,648 --> 01:10:33,292
[SPEAKER_51]: But it doesn't mean you're going to start building this in March of next year at all.

781
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,655
[SPEAKER_51]: There'll be time to properly vet things.

782
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:39,362
[SPEAKER_04]: To the chair, thank you.

783
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Because maybe that's where I'm confused.

784
01:10:41,543 --> 01:10:46,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So the eligibility, the way I'm looking at the key dates, I think it's different than what you're saying.

785
01:10:46,486 --> 01:10:51,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Because December 15th, it says that simple form is due for round one.

786
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:56,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it says March 2nd, full applications are due for round one.

787
01:10:56,812 --> 01:10:58,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But I asked the question, when will they be awarded?

788
01:10:58,914 --> 01:11:00,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought you said March.

789
01:11:01,815 --> 01:11:03,857
[SPEAKER_129]: No, they will be awarded in,

790
01:11:04,957 --> 01:11:07,719
[SPEAKER_129]: May so okay, so that's my problem.

791
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:12,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So may isn't on this key date, which is confusing Yeah, and that is a key date for you.

792
01:11:12,241 --> 01:11:31,091
[SPEAKER_129]: So I should have put that on the memorandum for you This is it the key date for the public is to know that they'll be asked if they're applicants They'll be asked to present to us publicly in April so that we can vet those projects before we recommend them to you and then we would ask for your We'll give that

793
01:11:32,732 --> 01:11:35,634
[SPEAKER_129]: the round of recommendations for your approval in May.

794
01:11:36,855 --> 01:11:49,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so if an organization does not have the simple form done by the end of next week or December 15th, they are not eligible to fill out a full application for March 2nd?

795
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:59,529
[SPEAKER_129]: Correct, but they will be eligible to submit the full application in September, or I'm sorry,

796
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: For round two?

797
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:04,034
[SPEAKER_04]: For round two, yes.

798
01:12:04,094 --> 01:12:08,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's where I just find it an issue with regards to this.

799
01:12:09,195 --> 01:12:13,496
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first we've publicly kind of learned of the December 15th date.

800
01:12:13,936 --> 01:12:20,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I try to stay on top of the politics on social media and the transcript.

801
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:22,519
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first I'm learning of the December 15th date.

802
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:29,868
[SPEAKER_04]: which even though there's going to be a round two, a lot of organizations may want to get in on that first round.

803
01:12:29,908 --> 01:12:39,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're going to know there's going to be less applicants, they're going to have more ability to potentially get some part of the CPA funding.

804
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:51,173
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't plan on meeting, you know, the week of Christmas and New Year's, I respectfully ask, I know it's time crunch and I know how hard you work, but I just ask that we give this,

805
01:12:52,589 --> 01:12:57,233
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, full transparency to the public and definitely publicize this a little bit more.

806
01:12:57,453 --> 01:12:59,275
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really my only concern.

807
01:12:59,756 --> 01:12:59,956
[SPEAKER_129]: Yeah.

808
01:13:03,739 --> 01:13:11,566
[SPEAKER_129]: Did you mention that we also have a process where we will be willing to accept off-cycle applications?

809
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:11,987
[SPEAKER_129]: Yes.

810
01:13:13,244 --> 01:13:36,008
[SPEAKER_129]: So if there is an applicant who has an urgent need for funding for a high priority project that doesn't fall within our timeline that we've laid out, we are willing to work with the applicant for those urgent high priority projects to meet the timeline that they need to consider their application.

811
01:13:38,955 --> 01:13:39,215
[SPEAKER_129]: Thank you.

812
01:13:39,475 --> 01:13:40,556
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you.

813
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:42,598
[SPEAKER_100]: Councilor Falco.

814
01:13:42,658 --> 01:13:43,319
[SPEAKER_100]: Thank you, Mr. President.

815
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:44,179
[SPEAKER_100]: One quick question.

816
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:50,885
[SPEAKER_100]: So as far as those projects go, those urgent projects, what will be an example of an urgent project that would be eligible for this type of funding?

817
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:53,775
[SPEAKER_129]: A common example is property acquisition.

818
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:58,017
[SPEAKER_129]: If there's an opportunity to make a property acquisition, it can't wait months.

819
01:13:58,778 --> 01:14:10,845
[SPEAKER_129]: They would need to be able to line up the funding in a timely manner so that they can close on a property acquisition in the time that the market demands.

820
01:14:10,865 --> 01:14:14,027
[SPEAKER_100]: Okay.

821
01:14:14,047 --> 01:14:15,108
[SPEAKER_100]: So like something that was maybe

822
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:22,729
[SPEAKER_100]: potentially gonna be developed, but the city had the option to buy it and prevent development, something like that?

823
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:23,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

824
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:25,392
[SPEAKER_96]: Okay, thank you very much.

825
01:14:25,572 --> 01:14:26,073
[SPEAKER_96]: Councilor Knights?

826
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:27,735
[SPEAKER_118]: Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

827
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:28,015
[SPEAKER_118]: Second.

828
01:14:29,177 --> 01:14:33,101
[SPEAKER_96]: Motion by Councilor Knights to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

829
01:14:33,141 --> 01:14:33,962
[SPEAKER_96]: All those in favor?

830
01:14:34,222 --> 01:14:34,643
[SPEAKER_46]: Aye.

831
01:14:35,644 --> 01:14:35,964
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm sorry.

832
01:14:39,033 --> 01:14:39,874
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address of the record.

833
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:42,896
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford.

834
01:14:43,156 --> 01:14:44,657
[SPEAKER_46]: Good evening, honorable Councilors.

835
01:14:44,677 --> 01:14:49,781
[SPEAKER_46]: This is Tuesday, it must be Medford City Council meeting.

836
01:14:49,981 --> 01:14:54,204
[SPEAKER_46]: I have an idea for CPA fixed, if they could do this.

837
01:14:55,024 --> 01:15:00,889
[SPEAKER_46]: It may seem trivial to some of you, but presentation, I believe, is everything.

838
01:15:01,569 --> 01:15:05,252
[SPEAKER_46]: And I'm talking about the staple that's missing at 30 Salem Street.

839
01:15:05,852 --> 01:15:06,573
[SPEAKER_46]: As you're coming in,

840
01:15:08,227 --> 01:15:14,452
[SPEAKER_46]: from Route 93, north or south, the only Route 16 exit, through the square.

841
01:15:16,594 --> 01:15:24,580
[SPEAKER_46]: In front of, or next door, I should say, to the Methodist Cinema, which is now Elizabeth Grady, there's a church there at 30 Salem Street.

842
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:29,224
[SPEAKER_46]: It's been missing the steeple for many years.

843
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:32,306
[SPEAKER_46]: And it is the gateway into the city.

844
01:15:34,768 --> 01:15:36,270
[SPEAKER_46]: Now, I would think

845
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:43,590
[SPEAKER_46]: It would be a good idea to place some sort of finial on there.

846
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:47,971
[SPEAKER_46]: It doesn't have to be a full-blown, heavy-duty, original staple.

847
01:15:49,471 --> 01:15:53,832
[SPEAKER_46]: However, anything would be better than a flat top.

848
01:15:55,352 --> 01:16:04,374
[SPEAKER_46]: I think it would be appropriate in our downtown center as it is in most other downtowns I've been to, whether it's Chelsea, Malden, or especially Winchester.

849
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:08,035
[SPEAKER_96]: You should contact that group and have them file with the CPA.

850
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:13,462
[SPEAKER_96]: that you contact the church and have the church file an application.

851
01:16:13,722 --> 01:16:19,344
[SPEAKER_46]: Just feel for at least 25 years, it seems to me that I shouldn't be the one that brings it forward.

852
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:21,404
[SPEAKER_46]: It should have been done a long time ago.

853
01:16:21,504 --> 01:16:22,645
[SPEAKER_46]: If it was structurally sound.

854
01:16:23,805 --> 01:16:24,625
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you for listening.

855
01:16:24,725 --> 01:16:25,085
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

856
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:28,326
[SPEAKER_96]: Communications from the mayor, 17787.

857
01:16:31,519 --> 01:16:47,022
[SPEAKER_96]: Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the appropriation of retained earnings in the amount of $268,000.00 to fund repairs to Douglas Road due to a leak in the water main line causing flooding.

858
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:51,623
[SPEAKER_96]: The balance of retained earnings before this vote is $7,389,422.00.

859
01:16:52,983 --> 01:17:00,765
[SPEAKER_96]: DDBW Commissioner Brian Kerins is present to answer any questions for the council regarding this matter.

860
01:17:01,762 --> 01:17:03,704
[SPEAKER_96]: Mr. Kearns, name and address for the record, please.

861
01:17:04,525 --> 01:17:07,147
[SPEAKER_48]: Brian Kearns, Milton Terrace Hyde Park.

862
01:17:08,408 --> 01:17:10,130
[SPEAKER_96]: Do we have any questions for Mr. Kearns?

863
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:11,351
[SPEAKER_100]: Councilor Falco.

864
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:12,612
[SPEAKER_100]: Thank you, Mr. President.

865
01:17:12,632 --> 01:17:14,173
[SPEAKER_100]: Mr. Kearns, just a couple of quick questions.

866
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:18,577
[SPEAKER_100]: Can you just tell us a little bit about the water leak, the cause of the water leak, when it happens?

867
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:28,615
[SPEAKER_48]: It was brought to my attention by a constituent a little over a month ago that he was getting water in his basement.

868
01:17:29,495 --> 01:17:37,320
[SPEAKER_48]: At that point in time, I had our water and sewer department dispatched out there to see where the source was potentially coming from.

869
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:46,545
[SPEAKER_48]: And okay, the long and short of it is we narrowed it down to the actual main itself on the street.

870
01:17:47,425 --> 01:17:50,987
[SPEAKER_48]: All right, and we had our own leak detection equipment out there.

871
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:55,890
[SPEAKER_48]: We also called in MWRA, all right, to come in and assist us.

872
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:57,531
[SPEAKER_48]: They have a more elaborate setup.

873
01:17:58,291 --> 01:18:04,155
[SPEAKER_48]: Off peak time, daytime, nighttime, to try to narrow down exactly where this leak was occurring.

874
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:18,204
[SPEAKER_48]: And we've actually isolated it down to a 400-foot section of main that the leak is in, but we can't narrow it down any further than that because that whole area is impacted with clay.

875
01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:25,829
[SPEAKER_48]: Clay is actually acting as an insulation around the existing pipe that's there, and we're losing the sound.

876
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:29,111
[SPEAKER_48]: It's almost like sonar gear for a submarine.

877
01:18:29,611 --> 01:18:31,353
[SPEAKER_48]: We can hear it, but then it stops.

878
01:18:32,053 --> 01:18:41,755
[SPEAKER_48]: Now, we've shut off the actual main itself, all right, in both directions, and when we do that, the leak in the home stops, okay?

879
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:49,417
[SPEAKER_48]: So, as a result of that, we know that there is a leak that has occurred and is occurring within this 400-foot section.

880
01:18:49,997 --> 01:18:56,419
[SPEAKER_48]: Now, going back through the history, all right, obviously, this is Douglas Road, by the way, between Summer and George, all right?

881
01:18:56,999 --> 01:19:00,320
[SPEAKER_48]: The water main that exists today was installed in 1927.

882
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:19,738
[SPEAKER_48]: It's a six inch main and given the age factor with tuberculation has occurred, there's probably maybe only a three inch clearance going through the existing pipe as it stands today, which is not uncommon in the water and sewer business.

883
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,386
[SPEAKER_48]: The main service is 32 homes on that street.

884
01:19:28,707 --> 01:19:37,336
[SPEAKER_48]: Going through all the records and everything, it was just several years ago, the gas main was replaced on that entire street.

885
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:53,811
[SPEAKER_48]: Well, as a result of the age and the condition of this pipe, the amount of pipe that we already have to replace, meeting with the mayor, we both agreed to replace the entire main on the street.

886
01:19:55,432 --> 01:20:05,918
[SPEAKER_48]: And to do it right away, because even if we just replace that 400 foot section, through my experience in this business, once you touch something, it spreads.

887
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:10,640
[SPEAKER_48]: And let's do it one stop shopping here.

888
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,921
[SPEAKER_48]: Replace the entire main right away.

889
01:20:14,182 --> 01:20:17,904
[SPEAKER_48]: We already have a contractor in the city who's actually working down on

890
01:20:19,164 --> 01:20:21,607
[SPEAKER_48]: I think it's one of the side streets down there.

891
01:20:22,227 --> 01:20:26,231
[SPEAKER_48]: I can have them start as early as next week, okay, to put the new main in.

892
01:20:26,751 --> 01:20:43,907
[SPEAKER_48]: Now, we put a winter binder on the main, okay, once it's installed, all right, then return in the spring because, okay, with the money that the DPW has requested, the $268,000, that's also going to do curb-to-curb repaving in the spring.

893
01:20:44,948 --> 01:20:54,115
[SPEAKER_48]: some casting adjustments and some new castings as needed, curbing adjustments as needed, and sidewalk replacement panels as needed.

894
01:20:54,155 --> 01:21:01,640
[SPEAKER_48]: All right, we're gonna go full, full width down the entire length of that street, and that will, you know, to completely upgrade the street.

895
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:13,629
[SPEAKER_48]: Actually, in addition to that, we're probably also gonna install an additional fire hydrant, okay, even though there's adequate fire suppression there, an additional one while we're installing, okay, the new main.

896
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:17,917
[SPEAKER_100]: It sounds like there's two parts to the project.

897
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:23,008
[SPEAKER_100]: As far as replacing the main, putting in the new hydrant, how long will that take?

898
01:21:23,898 --> 01:21:35,767
[SPEAKER_48]: The new main, if he were to get the green light from the council this evening, he probably would be starting maybe actually a week from today, all right, or next Wednesday he'd start.

899
01:21:36,328 --> 01:21:38,349
[SPEAKER_48]: And he could probably go within a couple of weeks.

900
01:21:38,729 --> 01:21:43,133
[SPEAKER_48]: Again, with weather, you know, that would also have to be the concern as well.

901
01:21:44,273 --> 01:21:48,136
[SPEAKER_48]: But, you know, we want to, you know, go right ahead and do it right away.

902
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:51,379
[SPEAKER_48]: And, you know, within two weeks he'd have the new main in.

903
01:21:52,414 --> 01:22:02,057
[SPEAKER_100]: So when they're actually installing the new main, what can the residents expect as far as, will they be without water periods during the day, I imagine?

904
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:20,582
[SPEAKER_48]: No, there'd be no loss of water service, Council, because what we would do is we would install a temporary line that would be on the surface of the roadway, in the gutter line, going to the individual homes, and then at that point, we shut the main down, and then excavate and start replacing it.

905
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:27,831
[SPEAKER_100]: So I actually took a ride down the street the other day just to kind of check out the situation and view it firsthand.

906
01:22:28,392 --> 01:22:31,176
[SPEAKER_100]: And there's markings all over the place.

907
01:22:31,236 --> 01:22:35,621
[SPEAKER_100]: And actually at one point the street looks like it comes up on a mound.

908
01:22:35,661 --> 01:22:37,704
[SPEAKER_100]: It looks like something's going on underneath.

909
01:22:38,465 --> 01:22:44,947
[SPEAKER_48]: Yeah, it's the soil, Councilor, like I said, it's heavily loaded with clay in that area.

910
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:51,148
[SPEAKER_48]: And, you know, it's probably one of the worst types of soil you want to deal with.

911
01:22:51,889 --> 01:23:00,051
[SPEAKER_48]: But, you know, when we come back in in the spring, all right, and we, you know, scarify and do repaving, we'd be eliminating it at that point in time.

912
01:23:00,866 --> 01:23:07,108
[SPEAKER_100]: Is there any concern, so when you connect that main on Douglas, that's connecting then to?

913
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:08,649
[SPEAKER_48]: Yeah, it's Summer and George.

914
01:23:09,009 --> 01:23:09,889
[SPEAKER_48]: Summer and George, okay.

915
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:12,070
[SPEAKER_48]: Okay, and they're okay.

916
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:12,830
[SPEAKER_48]: Those are newer mains?

917
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:14,791
[SPEAKER_48]: Right, yeah, no problems there.

918
01:23:15,051 --> 01:23:21,834
[SPEAKER_48]: But this will also include new tees, valves, shutoffs, be the full gamut on that street.

919
01:23:23,095 --> 01:23:28,742
[SPEAKER_48]: We can take advantage of it because, like I said, it was only several years ago the new gas main was installed there.

920
01:23:29,022 --> 01:23:34,249
[SPEAKER_48]: So I'm not concerned with the utility companies coming in for an emergency at any point in time in the near future.

921
01:23:35,476 --> 01:23:41,518
[SPEAKER_100]: I mean, it sounds like, I mean, it's almost 100 years old, so it sounds like the whole thing probably should be replaced, but thank you very much.

922
01:23:41,578 --> 01:23:42,418
[SPEAKER_100]: Okay, thank you, sir.

923
01:23:42,738 --> 01:23:43,659
[SPEAKER_115]: Councilor Dello Russo.

924
01:23:44,579 --> 01:23:46,840
[SPEAKER_115]: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

925
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:56,863
[SPEAKER_115]: If I could, through the chair, say thank you, Commissioner, for bringing this forward and taking the course of action that you're taking in repairing this.

926
01:23:57,863 --> 01:24:07,411
[SPEAKER_115]: I think it's an appropriate use of this money, and it's going to go a long way in giving a good quality of life to the citizens there.

927
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:08,672
[SPEAKER_115]: Thank you.

928
01:24:08,692 --> 01:24:22,083
[SPEAKER_115]: I know your staff does excellent work in communicating to the neighbors what they're going to encounter in these projects, and I can only foresee this going well.

929
01:24:22,764 --> 01:24:23,784
[SPEAKER_115]: So thank you very much.

930
01:24:23,944 --> 01:24:24,345
[SPEAKER_115]: Good luck.

931
01:24:24,365 --> 01:24:26,687
[SPEAKER_115]: Mr. President, Mr. Chairman, move approval.

932
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:29,978
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of approval, Council Member Curran.

933
01:24:30,038 --> 01:24:31,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Marks.

934
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:40,786
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could just explain, Commissioner Cairns, a little bit more about how you're going to potentially start the work very shortly, and then you're going to finish it in the spring.

935
01:24:40,806 --> 01:24:43,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Will the road be closed back up and then reopened?

936
01:24:44,424 --> 01:24:51,910
[SPEAKER_48]: Yeah, okay, right now the contractor, as a matter of fact, he's on, I think it's Linden Street, actually putting a new water main in there.

937
01:24:53,011 --> 01:25:02,038
[SPEAKER_48]: What we would do is we would put in the temporary water lines that would go into the homes, the 32 homes in that street.

938
01:25:02,838 --> 01:25:08,003
[SPEAKER_48]: And then at that point in time, saw, cut, and excavate a trench exposing the existing pipe.

939
01:25:09,864 --> 01:25:13,287
[SPEAKER_48]: Excavate it, remove it, and install the new pipe.

940
01:25:14,712 --> 01:25:17,296
[SPEAKER_48]: backfill with clean fill and not clay.

941
01:25:17,316 --> 01:25:26,872
[SPEAKER_48]: Alright, tamper it down, put a winter patch on it, energize it, chlorinate it, and then remove the temporary pipe that we had installed in the homes.

942
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:29,431
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will be done now?

943
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,312
[SPEAKER_48]: Yeah, OK.

944
01:25:31,472 --> 01:25:33,472
[SPEAKER_48]: That's the process.

945
01:25:33,912 --> 01:25:41,034
[SPEAKER_48]: If they're going to be without water at any point in time, it's when we're going to be connecting up the temporary line from the permanent line.

946
01:25:41,374 --> 01:25:44,575
[SPEAKER_48]: Probably an hour's job, OK, they'd be without water.

947
01:25:44,635 --> 01:25:47,255
[SPEAKER_48]: But they would certainly get plenty of notification.

948
01:25:47,595 --> 01:25:50,436
[SPEAKER_48]: And it would happen at an off-peak time.

949
01:25:50,476 --> 01:25:55,557
[SPEAKER_48]: So that way, we're not concerned with people trying to get to work in the morning, lacking water for showers, and so forth.

950
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,078
[SPEAKER_48]: At the same time, we don't want to inconvenience people at night.

951
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:03,066
[SPEAKER_04]: You had mentioned there's going to be no loss of water, so I believe you on that one.

952
01:26:05,831 --> 01:26:11,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you just clarify, could you have mentioned doing some of the work now and then doing the rest in the spring?

953
01:26:12,386 --> 01:26:14,287
[SPEAKER_04]: so the street will remain open?

954
01:26:14,467 --> 01:26:17,188
[SPEAKER_48]: The street will remain passable at all times.

955
01:26:18,168 --> 01:26:27,412
[SPEAKER_48]: The only time that the street may be shut down will be in the spring when we coal plane it and repave the entire street.

956
01:26:27,892 --> 01:26:40,197
[SPEAKER_48]: So depending on the location of the equipment at the time when they resurface it in the spring, it'll only be like a temporary shutdown till we either remove the old existing asphalt or install the new asphalt.

957
01:26:41,273 --> 01:26:44,815
[SPEAKER_04]: and the reason we can't do the whole project now.

958
01:26:44,915 --> 01:26:48,517
[SPEAKER_48]: The weather is coming upon us, Council, that's correct.

959
01:26:48,978 --> 01:26:50,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So too cold to repave.

960
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:51,839
[SPEAKER_48]: Okay, that's correct.

961
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:53,861
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only step that needs to be done in the spring.

962
01:26:53,881 --> 01:27:08,850
[SPEAKER_48]: That's correct, yeah, okay, and some casting adjustments, okay, manholes, all right, is, you know, another term, manhole either adjustments or replacements, all right, and then also curbing realignment, and then possibly some sidewalk work.

963
01:27:09,885 --> 01:27:15,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So how will Douglas Road be left from when you finish the first portion until the spring?

964
01:27:15,551 --> 01:27:23,339
[SPEAKER_48]: It'll be a long, fresh patch, trench patch, down the center of the road.

965
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:28,264
[SPEAKER_48]: And then in the springtime, we'll return.

966
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:30,549
[SPEAKER_04]: and pave the whole streets.

967
01:27:30,569 --> 01:27:33,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But the trench patch will be safe?

968
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:34,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are we going to be blocking it off?

969
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:36,057
[SPEAKER_48]: No, it will be up to street grade.

970
01:27:36,077 --> 01:27:37,940
[SPEAKER_48]: It will be a winter hot tub.

971
01:27:38,521 --> 01:27:39,763
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm trying to get.

972
01:27:39,803 --> 01:27:40,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

973
01:27:40,664 --> 01:27:41,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Winter hot tub.

974
01:27:42,126 --> 01:27:44,650
[SPEAKER_48]: DPW has its own language on some of these terms.

975
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:50,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so there'll be a winter hot tub, everything will be safe, and then in the spring we're going to repave the whole street, do any sidewalk repair.

976
01:27:50,673 --> 01:27:51,873
[SPEAKER_48]: That's correct, Councilor.

977
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:52,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

978
01:27:53,274 --> 01:27:53,934
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you, Councilor.

979
01:27:53,974 --> 01:27:54,794
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Scarpelli.

980
01:27:55,235 --> 01:27:56,275
[SPEAKER_75]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

981
01:27:58,076 --> 01:28:02,818
[SPEAKER_75]: I can feel my phone blowing up already from Parris Street and Evans Street.

982
01:28:03,638 --> 01:28:06,340
[SPEAKER_75]: This is being done because there's a major water leak.

983
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:13,221
[SPEAKER_75]: and those projects are still on course as we've talked about for the spring, correct?

984
01:28:13,281 --> 01:28:15,122
[SPEAKER_75]: Yeah, nothing's been compromised.

985
01:28:16,302 --> 01:28:18,083
[SPEAKER_75]: I can just only imagine.

986
01:28:18,103 --> 01:28:22,304
[SPEAKER_75]: So, again, this is because there's a major water leak in that area that needs to be done.

987
01:28:22,544 --> 01:28:23,684
[SPEAKER_48]: That's correct, okay.

988
01:28:23,704 --> 01:28:33,686
[SPEAKER_48]: Matter of fact, I have almost weekly dialogue with two of the homeowners out there, and they've been very, very patient and understanding, but they also know there's a process that we have to go through.

989
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:34,887
[SPEAKER_48]: I can understand that.

990
01:28:34,967 --> 01:28:35,727
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, Mr. Carrings.

991
01:28:35,967 --> 01:28:36,267
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

992
01:28:36,607 --> 01:28:37,788
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

993
01:28:37,808 --> 01:28:38,828
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Knight.

994
01:28:38,848 --> 01:28:39,589
[SPEAKER_118]: Thank you, Mr. President.

995
01:28:39,609 --> 01:28:43,671
[SPEAKER_118]: Mr. Kearns, can you tell me who the contractor is that's been selected to perform the work, if the money is appropriate?

996
01:28:43,771 --> 01:28:48,873
[SPEAKER_48]: Kaidila Construction, Councilor, who's presently in the city doing work.

997
01:28:49,794 --> 01:28:52,055
[SPEAKER_118]: And in your experiences, do you think that this is a good idea?

998
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,881
[SPEAKER_118]: A-plus outfit, B-minus outfit?

999
01:28:55,162 --> 01:28:56,403
[SPEAKER_48]: An A-plus.

1000
01:28:57,023 --> 01:29:08,452
[SPEAKER_48]: I had actually the owner, Mark Caraviello, in my office yesterday to lay out potentially this job coming up if the council were to approve it.

1001
01:29:09,092 --> 01:29:15,217
[SPEAKER_48]: I wanted to know if he was capable of taking it on in addition to the responsibilities that he presently has on board.

1002
01:29:15,957 --> 01:29:17,738
[SPEAKER_48]: And, you know, he was.

1003
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:19,379
[SPEAKER_48]: I've seen his work.

1004
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,001
[SPEAKER_48]: I've seen his equipment.

1005
01:29:21,461 --> 01:29:24,983
[SPEAKER_48]: And, you know, I'm pretty confident we'll, you know, get it done and done right.

1006
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:25,944
[SPEAKER_48]: Excellent.

1007
01:29:25,964 --> 01:29:26,244
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

1008
01:29:27,745 --> 01:29:30,047
[SPEAKER_48]: Move the question, Mr. President.

1009
01:29:30,127 --> 01:29:30,967
[SPEAKER_68]: Motion of approval.

1010
01:29:31,107 --> 01:29:31,948
[SPEAKER_68]: All those in favor?

1011
01:29:32,508 --> 01:29:32,909
[SPEAKER_68]: Roll call.

1012
01:29:33,009 --> 01:29:33,369
[SPEAKER_68]: Opposed?

1013
01:29:33,389 --> 01:29:34,830
[SPEAKER_68]: The roll call vote has been requested.

1014
01:29:40,395 --> 01:29:40,575
[SPEAKER_112]: Yes.

1015
01:29:40,616 --> 01:29:40,796
[SPEAKER_112]: Yes.

1016
01:29:40,836 --> 01:29:41,097
[SPEAKER_112]: Yes.

1017
01:29:49,001 --> 01:29:49,842
[SPEAKER_112]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1018
01:29:49,882 --> 01:29:50,122
[SPEAKER_112]: Yes.

1019
01:29:50,662 --> 01:29:51,423
[SPEAKER_112]: Vice President Marks?

1020
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:51,963
[SPEAKER_68]: Yes.

1021
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:54,184
[SPEAKER_68]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1022
01:29:54,204 --> 01:29:55,525
[SPEAKER_68]: The motion is adopted.

1023
01:29:56,406 --> 01:29:58,607
[SPEAKER_68]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1024
01:29:58,627 --> 01:30:00,928
[SPEAKER_68]: Suspend the rules, take the papers in the hands of the clerk.

1025
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:01,749
[SPEAKER_68]: All those in favor?

1026
01:30:01,769 --> 01:30:02,009
[SPEAKER_68]: Aye.

1027
01:30:02,349 --> 01:30:02,730
[SPEAKER_68]: Opposed?

1028
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:03,370
[SPEAKER_68]: The ayes have it.

1029
01:30:04,631 --> 01:30:06,352
[SPEAKER_68]: Offered by Council President Caraviello.

1030
01:30:06,392 --> 01:30:15,918
[SPEAKER_68]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Marguerite Regan, teacher of over 40 years at the Swan School.

1031
01:30:18,397 --> 01:30:19,217
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1032
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:27,121
[SPEAKER_96]: Mr. President, Mrs. Regan has been a teacher in the system for 40 years, and there's not many teachers that can make that claim.

1033
01:30:27,161 --> 01:30:37,367
[SPEAKER_96]: And she recently passed away this week, and I'd like to send condolences to her family this week, if we could have a moment of silence, Mr. President, in memory of her.

1034
01:30:37,747 --> 01:30:38,908
[SPEAKER_68]: All rise for a moment of silence.

1035
01:30:54,752 --> 01:31:12,227
[SPEAKER_68]: Offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council have a representative from the bicycle company give the city a plan on how they are picking up the bicycles that are being left over of the city for several days at a time.

1036
01:31:12,907 --> 01:31:13,408
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor?

1037
01:31:14,528 --> 01:31:15,389
[SPEAKER_96]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1038
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:24,866
[SPEAKER_96]: We have this new company that you sort of pick up a bike anywhere you want, you leave it anywhere you want.

1039
01:31:25,707 --> 01:31:30,011
[SPEAKER_96]: But as you're going around the city, you're seeing them left in the middle of sidewalks and all over the place.

1040
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:40,960
[SPEAKER_96]: There's been a bicycle in particular that sat on the rotary over at Winthrop Street for the last five days, and now it's gone from the rotary over to the sidewalk on Winthrop Street.

1041
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:45,164
[SPEAKER_96]: And I've seen them left over by the book school and all over the city.

1042
01:31:46,563 --> 01:31:58,652
[SPEAKER_96]: I don't know, I've never seen a plan or anything how this company got into the city or even does business here.

1043
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:08,199
[SPEAKER_96]: So if the city can have some type of, we can get some type of representative, either come to the council or somebody from the city to let us know how this company operates.

1044
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:10,861
[SPEAKER_96]: And they say you just can't leave stuff in the middle of sidewalks.

1045
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:13,262
[SPEAKER_96]: for days at a time and not pick them up.

1046
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,324
[SPEAKER_96]: So that's been a concern.

1047
01:32:15,344 --> 01:32:26,133
[SPEAKER_96]: Like I said, there's been a particular one that sat on the rotary of Winthrop Street right in the middle for five days and now somebody took it off and it's on the sidewalk on Winthrop Street.

1048
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:35,221
[SPEAKER_96]: So again, we can have somebody from that, either have somebody come here or somebody from the city give us a plan on how this company works or some kind of contact with them.

1049
01:32:35,241 --> 01:32:36,903
[SPEAKER_96]: I don't even know where these people are from.

1050
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:41,111
[SPEAKER_68]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

1051
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:41,712
[SPEAKER_68]: Aye.

1052
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:44,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Wango-Kern.

1053
01:32:44,814 --> 01:32:49,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Mox, and thanks for bringing up Councilor Caraviello.

1054
01:32:49,539 --> 01:33:02,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually just ran out to the DPW Commissioner to get an update on Marshall Street in issue, and also the bike left on Winthrop Rotary, because I had emailed the Mayor's office this morning to see if they had that company's contact.

1055
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,950
[SPEAKER_96]: It's on the sidewalk.

1056
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:04,931
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually call.

1057
01:33:05,211 --> 01:33:06,371
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have a contact.

1058
01:33:06,411 --> 01:33:10,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe because they called Mr. Karen's to try to go remove it.

1059
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:12,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need definitely need a contact.

1060
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:16,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's the Maldon's new pilot program they use it.

1061
01:33:16,736 --> 01:33:19,797
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bikes are being left on Medford streets all over.

1062
01:33:20,237 --> 01:33:21,778
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do need to get a handle on it.

1063
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:26,780
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he's going to remove the one on Winthrop Street right after he takes pitches hopefully tomorrow.

1064
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:27,800
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to.

1065
01:33:28,288 --> 01:33:29,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information on that.

1066
01:33:29,569 --> 01:33:29,869
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you.

1067
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:31,350
[SPEAKER_68]: On the motion.

1068
01:33:32,271 --> 01:33:32,511
[SPEAKER_68]: Second.

1069
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:34,452
[SPEAKER_68]: All those in favor, seconded by Councilor Leif.

1070
01:33:35,233 --> 01:33:37,034
[SPEAKER_68]: All those opposed, the ayes have it.

1071
01:33:37,074 --> 01:33:38,235
[SPEAKER_68]: The motion is adopted.

1072
01:33:39,156 --> 01:33:42,138
[SPEAKER_68]: Paper from Councilor Scarpelli.

1073
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:49,043
[SPEAKER_68]: Be it resolved that the Traffic Department look into illegal parking of out of state automobiles on Cherry Street.

1074
01:33:49,623 --> 01:33:50,584
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1075
01:33:51,285 --> 01:33:52,345
[SPEAKER_75]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1076
01:33:52,445 --> 01:33:54,587
[SPEAKER_75]: I received a few phone calls on

1077
01:33:56,556 --> 01:34:07,199
[SPEAKER_75]: automobiles that are being left in front of residential homes that are resided by some seniors and the cars are left there for days at a time.

1078
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:24,983
[SPEAKER_75]: If we could just have someone from the Traffic Enforcement Office or Officer Hodden and maybe reach out and just take a few trips down there to Cherry Street and maybe do a little extra enforcement and making sure that these out of state cars aren't left here overnight for a long period of time.

1079
01:34:25,863 --> 01:34:26,163
[SPEAKER_75]: Thank you.

1080
01:34:26,984 --> 01:34:27,644
[SPEAKER_100]: Thank you, Councilor.

1081
01:34:27,664 --> 01:34:28,425
[SPEAKER_100]: Councilor Falco.

1082
01:34:28,545 --> 01:34:29,386
[SPEAKER_100]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1083
01:34:29,406 --> 01:34:36,573
[SPEAKER_100]: I want to thank Council Colleague for bringing this forward tonight because I think this is an issue that is coming up more and more throughout our community.

1084
01:34:36,773 --> 01:34:43,720
[SPEAKER_100]: And if I could just amend the resolution to also include Tainter Street, Everett Street, and lower Fulton Street as well between

1085
01:34:45,642 --> 01:34:47,263
[SPEAKER_100]: Sound Street and Webster Street.

1086
01:34:48,343 --> 01:34:54,225
[SPEAKER_100]: That whole area, that whole block, there's a lot of cars down there with out-of-state plates.

1087
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:57,766
[SPEAKER_100]: It's an issue that really needs to be addressed.

1088
01:34:58,567 --> 01:35:02,548
[SPEAKER_100]: I believe it's happening in other sections of the city or other neighborhoods of the city as well.

1089
01:35:04,569 --> 01:35:07,750
[SPEAKER_100]: It's a resolution that I certainly support, so I second the resolution.

1090
01:35:11,355 --> 01:35:15,817
[SPEAKER_68]: On the motion offered by Councilor Scarpelli, amended further by Councilor Falco.

1091
01:35:16,378 --> 01:35:17,098
[SPEAKER_68]: All those in favor?

1092
01:35:17,118 --> 01:35:17,538
[SPEAKER_68]: Aye.

1093
01:35:17,799 --> 01:35:18,219
[SPEAKER_68]: Opposed?

1094
01:35:18,859 --> 01:35:20,620
[SPEAKER_68]: The ayes have it, the motion is adopted.

1095
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,122
[SPEAKER_68]: Motion by Councilor Langel Kern to revert back to the regular order of business.

1096
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:24,962
[SPEAKER_68]: All those in favor?

1097
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:25,583
[SPEAKER_68]: Aye.

1098
01:35:25,603 --> 01:35:25,943
[SPEAKER_68]: Opposed?

1099
01:35:25,963 --> 01:35:26,643
[SPEAKER_68]: The ayes have it.

1100
01:35:26,703 --> 01:35:27,524

1115
01:36:49,051 --> 01:36:51,252
[SPEAKER_68]: I find those records to be in order and move approval.

1116
01:36:52,552 --> 01:36:53,572
[SPEAKER_68]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1117
01:36:54,952 --> 01:36:58,853
[SPEAKER_68]: The records of the meeting of November 28th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Falco.

1118
01:37:02,628 --> 01:37:14,059
[SPEAKER_100]: Mr. President, I have a small edit that I could review with the clerk, but other than that minor edit, everything looks fine and I move that the records be approved.

1119
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,481
[SPEAKER_100]: As amended.

1120
01:37:16,761 --> 01:37:17,562
[SPEAKER_68]: Approved as amended.

1121
01:37:17,602 --> 01:37:18,123
[SPEAKER_68]: All in favor?

1122
01:37:18,523 --> 01:37:18,803
[SPEAKER_68]: Aye.

1123
01:37:18,823 --> 01:37:19,384
[SPEAKER_68]: Opposed?

1124
01:37:19,404 --> 01:37:20,004
[SPEAKER_68]: The ayes have it.

1125
01:37:21,205 --> 01:37:22,066
[SPEAKER_68]: Motion to adjourn.

1126
01:37:23,007 --> 01:37:23,548
[SPEAKER_68]: All in favor?

1127
01:37:23,748 --> 01:37:24,048
[SPEAKER_68]: Aye.

1128
01:37:24,308 --> 01:37:24,869
[SPEAKER_68]: The ayes have it.

1129
01:37:24,969 --> 01:37:26,110
[SPEAKER_68]: Motion to adjourn.

1130
01:37:27,711 --> 01:37:27,872
[SPEAKER_68]: Yes.

1131
01:38:54,597 --> 01:39:02,263
[SPEAKER_60]: corporate tax havens, places like Ireland, where companies will stash lots of money that Trump would rather have repatriated here to the U.S.

1132
01:39:02,323 --> 01:39:04,045
[SPEAKER_60]: And so that seems to be a main focus.

1133
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:12,051
[SPEAKER_60]: And whatever focus we did have on cracking down on this kind of activity revealed in the Panama or the Paradise Papers has kind of fallen off the map a little bit.

1134
01:39:12,771 --> 01:39:33,703
[SPEAKER_92]: Andrew, is there a case for saying that all this protest is not only pointless, but also perhaps counterproductive, and that actually tax havens are a way almost of the free market of nations, you know, if I give less tax, if I take less tax from you, you'll come and be in my country, that's my benefit, that's the game I'm playing, and any country can do this.

1135
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:41,693
[SPEAKER_80]: I think that's an important point that you make there, Roger, and I think that that's where we sort of have to be realistic about this debate.

1136
01:39:41,733 --> 01:39:47,455
[SPEAKER_80]: You're always going to get countries that have higher or lower tax rates for particular reasons.

1137
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:52,297
[SPEAKER_80]: It seems to me, therefore, that the debate around tax havens has to be around

1138
01:39:53,397 --> 01:39:56,019
[SPEAKER_80]: getting international standards around transparency.

1139
01:39:56,079 --> 01:40:03,202
[SPEAKER_80]: So you look at a place like Hong Kong, we have tax here around 15% personal taxes, 16.5% for companies.

1140
01:40:03,242 --> 01:40:05,923
[SPEAKER_80]: That's low, but it's not the lowest in the world.

1141
01:40:06,003 --> 01:40:10,125
[SPEAKER_80]: What the real concern about Hong Kong is the transparency of the tax system.

1142
01:40:10,145 --> 01:40:13,466
[SPEAKER_80]: And in particular, it's the ownership of companies here.

1143
01:40:13,506 --> 01:40:14,727
[SPEAKER_80]: We have a lot of shell companies,

1144
01:40:15,147 --> 01:40:23,057
[SPEAKER_80]: the allegation, the suspicion is that a lot of those are used for tax avoidance and money laundering as well.

1145
01:40:23,477 --> 01:40:33,390
[SPEAKER_80]: Now that's where potentially you can work to get international standards of disclosure and transparency around tax and companies.

1146
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:39,412
[SPEAKER_80]: The idea that you're going to get some sort of harmony over actual tax rates, I think, you know, that's just not realistic.

1147
01:40:39,832 --> 01:40:41,493
[SPEAKER_80]: And also maybe not desirable.

1148
01:40:41,513 --> 01:40:42,673
[SPEAKER_92]: Is it even right?

1149
01:40:42,693 --> 01:40:46,435
[SPEAKER_80]: I mean, shouldn't there be an element of competition in this?

1150
01:40:46,835 --> 01:40:47,835
[SPEAKER_80]: You know, I think there should be.

1151
01:40:47,875 --> 01:41:01,280
[SPEAKER_80]: And I think developing nations, if part of their, sort of, the pitch they're making to international investors is we have low taxes here and that's how we're going to develop our country, that to me should be fair enough.

1152
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:20,038
[SPEAKER_80]: But what I think you can say to developing nations and developed countries alike is we want to know more about, you know, who exactly is stashing money in your country so that we can combat tax avoidance and we can combat money laundering and all the problems that come with that.

1153
01:41:20,438 --> 01:41:30,854
[SPEAKER_92]: Yeah, but Tony, we know, don't we, that in a place like Switzerland, the actual ability not to be seen is a big part of the attraction for a lot of countries, isn't it?

1154
01:41:30,874 --> 01:41:36,041
[SPEAKER_92]: A lot of investors, they want to go places where whatever they're doing isn't in the public gaze.

1155
01:41:37,275 --> 01:41:37,896
[SPEAKER_60]: Yeah, that's right.

1156
01:41:37,936 --> 01:41:39,418
[SPEAKER_60]: It's a feature, not a bug.

1157
01:41:39,739 --> 01:41:42,242
[SPEAKER_60]: And it's interesting.

1158
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:45,727
[SPEAKER_60]: It makes me think back to our conversation about Deutsche Bank.

1159
01:41:46,589 --> 01:41:51,756
[SPEAKER_60]: Right now we have a president whose finances are pretty opaque, and I don't know

1160
01:41:52,317 --> 01:42:01,603
[SPEAKER_60]: where President Trump's money is tied up, but it's kind of a recurring problem throughout, at least here in the US, trying to manage and debate the issue of tax savings.

1161
01:42:02,304 --> 01:42:07,868
[SPEAKER_60]: A lot of the people who are in power are a lot of the people who are squirreling money away in these countries.

1162
01:42:08,368 --> 01:42:10,530
[SPEAKER_92]: And Tanya, we talked about Delaware and Nevada.

1163
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:17,955
[SPEAKER_92]: Do Americans and other states resent the fact that these states use that mechanism, or do they just think that's fine, that's just the way it works?

1164
01:42:19,106 --> 01:42:19,586
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't think so.

1165
01:42:19,626 --> 01:42:24,109
[SPEAKER_60]: I think, you know, like you said, there's a free market between countries, between states.

1166
01:42:24,189 --> 01:42:30,013
[SPEAKER_60]: They can really do whatever they want to remain competitive, and I think those states would tell you that.

1167
01:42:30,614 --> 01:42:43,442
[SPEAKER_60]: I think a lot of the resentment that you've seen build up here is more, you know, when jobs move overseas, when money is stashed away overseas, or at least that's what, you know, the current political climate has gotten people riled up about.

1168
01:42:43,502 --> 01:42:44,482
[SPEAKER_60]: Maybe there should be more resentment.

1169
01:42:44,502 --> 01:42:44,803
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't know.

1170
01:42:45,503 --> 01:42:47,165
[SPEAKER_92]: Andrew, let me come back to you finally on that one.

1171
01:42:47,185 --> 01:42:52,771
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean, is there a moral case for saying actually these companies should be able to avoid tax?

1172
01:42:53,012 --> 01:42:58,498
[SPEAKER_92]: They should just be able to, they have to pay tax at perhaps a normal standard rate wherever they are in the world.

1173
01:43:00,236 --> 01:43:05,519
[SPEAKER_80]: Well, I just, I mean, you know, if there is a moral case for that, it's unfortunately not a realistic case.

1174
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:10,901
[SPEAKER_80]: I mean, some people would say, in fact, the most sensible thing to do is not tax companies at all.

1175
01:43:10,961 --> 01:43:13,503
[SPEAKER_80]: And then you, you avoid the problem altogether.

1176
01:43:13,663 --> 01:43:21,987
[SPEAKER_80]: And you tax individuals, because, you know, at the end of the day, if you don't tax companies, that means they can pay out more in dividends and payouts to their shareholders.

1177
01:43:22,027 --> 01:43:22,447
[SPEAKER_80]: And that should

1178
01:43:22,967 --> 01:43:24,268
[SPEAKER_80]: increase the wealth of people.

1179
01:43:24,308 --> 01:43:39,635
[SPEAKER_80]: Now, I think, you know, there are plenty of arguments against that as well, but the idea that you can harmonize tax across the world, I think, is slightly for the birds, and that's why I say I think that transparency and disclosure is the way forward here.

1180
01:43:39,675 --> 01:43:46,998
[SPEAKER_80]: That's probably where, more realistically, you can get some international pressure and you can get some international cooperation.

1181
01:43:47,678 --> 01:43:52,983
[SPEAKER_92]: Well, I guess it's an argument that's going to roll on for an awful long time in lots of places and not just in the EU.

1182
01:43:53,003 --> 01:43:55,265
[SPEAKER_92]: Thanks very much to both of you on that.

1183
01:43:55,305 --> 01:43:59,148
[SPEAKER_92]: Let's bring ourselves up to date with the business matters headlines with Jerry Smith.

1184
01:43:59,548 --> 01:44:09,977
[SPEAKER_81]: Reports say that Donald Trump's account with a major investment bank is being investigated as part of an inquiry into possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 US presidential election.

1185
01:44:10,558 --> 01:44:15,042
[SPEAKER_81]: President Trump has previously taken out a multi-million dollar loan with Deutsche Bank.

1186
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:25,096
[SPEAKER_81]: The European Union has published its first blacklist of tax havens, naming 17 territories, including Saint Lucia, Barbados and South Korea.

1187
01:44:25,736 --> 01:44:33,241
[SPEAKER_81]: It's also published a grey list of 47 additional countries which say they're on the way to changing to EU standard tax rules.

1188
01:44:33,702 --> 01:44:36,724
[SPEAKER_81]: These include Hong Kong, Turkey, Bermuda and Switzerland.

1189
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:41,447
[SPEAKER_81]: Both lists have been criticised as omitting the most notorious tax havens.

1190
01:44:42,087 --> 01:44:42,708
[SPEAKER_92]: Jerry, thanks.

1191
01:44:42,788 --> 01:44:45,412
[SPEAKER_92]: Now, it's that moment in the programme where we link up with one of our reporters.

1192
01:44:45,432 --> 01:44:49,256
[SPEAKER_92]: Today, it's Rahul Tandon joining us live on the line from Kolkata.

1193
01:44:49,276 --> 01:44:52,701
[SPEAKER_92]: Now, Rahul, smog, cricket, they don't go together, do they?

1194
01:44:54,033 --> 01:44:54,594
[SPEAKER_77]: No, they don't.

1195
01:44:54,614 --> 01:44:58,777
[SPEAKER_77]: I mean, an extraordinary test match that has been taking place in Delhi.

1196
01:44:58,817 --> 01:45:05,862
[SPEAKER_77]: Really not for what was happening on the pitch, but what was happening off it, Roger, where we had play stopped but for pollution.

1197
01:45:06,363 --> 01:45:09,745
[SPEAKER_77]: First ever, I think, in the history of cricket.

1198
01:45:10,266 --> 01:45:15,270
[SPEAKER_77]: We had the Sri Lankans saying they couldn't continue the match because the breathing conditions were so difficult.

1199
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:36,320
[SPEAKER_77]: you know on yesterday on the last day of the test match we had an Indian bowler vomiting on the pitch we've had Sri Lankan bowlers doing the same and I think what this is bringing into focus is a much bigger debate about the huge problem that pollution now poses not just in Delhi I'm in Kolkata this morning where there is smog around the city we have

1200
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:49,903
[SPEAKER_77]: pollution levels that rival Delhi at this particular point in time, 15 to 20 sometimes, 25 times above the recommended levels that the World Health Organization says that we should be breathing.

1201
01:45:49,943 --> 01:46:00,726
[SPEAKER_77]: And I think this is affecting Indians, but I think for business as well it's going to affect it in a big way, because I think a lot of people are going to think long and hard about whether they want to come and visit India's big cities.

1202
01:46:00,766 --> 01:46:06,047
[SPEAKER_77]: To give you an idea of how big the problem is, I've been speaking to a couple of sports people in Kolkata.

1203
01:46:07,035 --> 01:46:08,717
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm absolutely struggling to breathe today.

1204
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:12,481
[SPEAKER_54]: I can feel, like, the pollution, like, clogging up in my throat as I'm breathing.

1205
01:46:12,521 --> 01:46:15,304
[SPEAKER_54]: And I'm an athlete, so I'm out in the open a lot.

1206
01:46:15,825 --> 01:46:17,126
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm finding it absolutely difficult.

1207
01:46:17,146 --> 01:46:19,950
[SPEAKER_54]: I wake up every morning just, like, gasping for air.

1208
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:21,832
[SPEAKER_77]: Does it make you think about going out?

1209
01:46:22,272 --> 01:46:25,373
[SPEAKER_54]: I wish I could not, but I play golf every day and I can't help it.

1210
01:46:25,393 --> 01:46:26,714
[SPEAKER_54]: I have to play through everything.

1211
01:46:26,854 --> 01:46:35,337
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whenever we travel, you know, we play outside and we can feel the difference in our performance or the amount we can run and how much easier it is to run outside.

1212
01:46:35,797 --> 01:46:39,839
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even with the temperature change or in higher altitudes, we still do better.

1213
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:42,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas here, it should be easier for us.

1214
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are used to this temperature, but we still find it tougher because the pollution is increasing by the day.

1215
01:46:47,949 --> 01:46:50,073
[SPEAKER_92]: The difficulties of sports people there.

1216
01:46:50,414 --> 01:46:51,436
[SPEAKER_92]: Rahul, what about you?

1217
01:46:51,496 --> 01:46:53,139
[SPEAKER_92]: In Kolkata, you say there is smog there.

1218
01:46:53,179 --> 01:46:53,920
[SPEAKER_92]: Do you notice?

1219
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,243
[SPEAKER_92]: Do you find yourself coughing?

1220
01:46:55,263 --> 01:46:58,970
[SPEAKER_92]: Do you find it's a problem on a day-to-day basis?

1221
01:46:59,981 --> 01:47:01,222
[SPEAKER_77]: It's a huge problem, Roger.

1222
01:47:01,242 --> 01:47:10,587
[SPEAKER_77]: I mean, I would say over the last week, I, like most people in Kolkata, is the pollution has really got a lot worse because as the temperatures drop, you know, it can't basically expand.

1223
01:47:10,627 --> 01:47:14,089
[SPEAKER_77]: It can't move up in the air and it stays and hovers around.

1224
01:47:14,109 --> 01:47:14,990
[SPEAKER_77]: Yeah, definitely.

1225
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:19,993
[SPEAKER_77]: I mean, sore throats all the time, coughing a lot of the time.

1226
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:21,714
[SPEAKER_77]: You just don't feel particularly well.

1227
01:47:21,734 --> 01:47:22,574
[SPEAKER_77]: You can taste it.

1228
01:47:22,594 --> 01:47:27,337
[SPEAKER_77]: I mean, I'm on my balcony this morning and you can see the haze and you can sort of taste it in your

1229
01:47:27,757 --> 01:47:35,119
[SPEAKER_77]: in your mouth and I think it is such an issue here now and it's an issue that really doesn't seem to be getting any better.

1230
01:47:35,139 --> 01:47:43,460
[SPEAKER_77]: I was talking to doctors the other day who say you know they see a lot more children coming in with asthma, they see a lot more older people coming in now with severe lung problems.

1231
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,361
[SPEAKER_77]: I mean some of the stats are incredible.

1232
01:47:45,381 --> 01:47:52,762
[SPEAKER_77]: Look at an issue of premature death which in most countries as medical care you know improves is getting much better.

1233
01:47:52,822 --> 01:47:56,923
[SPEAKER_77]: In India over the last 10 years it's almost doubled and it's worse and a lot of people are now

1234
01:47:57,403 --> 01:47:58,464
[SPEAKER_77]: putting it down to pollution.

1235
01:47:58,484 --> 01:48:00,085
[SPEAKER_77]: So yeah, it really does affect you.

1236
01:48:00,105 --> 01:48:04,208
[SPEAKER_77]: And I think there is a big economic consequence that India could face.

1237
01:48:04,248 --> 01:48:09,492
[SPEAKER_77]: I mean, a recent report last year by the World Bank said it could affect GDP by up to 8% a year.

1238
01:48:09,872 --> 01:48:14,275
[SPEAKER_77]: Unless India tackles this, I think the economic and health consequences are going to be huge.

1239
01:48:14,616 --> 01:48:24,283
[SPEAKER_77]: But because India needs to generate more power and people want to travel in cars and public transport systems are not good here, we don't seem to be on the verge of improving the air quality here.

1240
01:48:24,943 --> 01:48:35,450
[SPEAKER_77]: You know Delhi at one stage recently, Roger, was I think a hundred times above what the World Health Organization recommended and it reached a point where doctors were saying you should probably evacuate the city.

1241
01:48:36,191 --> 01:48:49,180
[SPEAKER_92]: Well let's go from finally and briefly one of the, obviously a real bad taste in the mouth, perhaps a metaphorical one, which is the Vijay Malaiya case, one of India's most high-profile businessmen, extradition question mark.

1242
01:48:50,573 --> 01:48:54,095
[SPEAKER_77]: Yeah, well that's taking place very close to you in London at this particular point in time.

1243
01:48:54,115 --> 01:48:55,796
[SPEAKER_77]: Getting a lot of coverage here in India.

1244
01:48:55,816 --> 01:48:58,037
[SPEAKER_77]: India's most flamboyant businessman.

1245
01:48:58,097 --> 01:49:07,202
[SPEAKER_77]: He's basically accused of misleading banks to loan money to his collapsed airlines and that he then wasted that basically on his own personal lifestyle.

1246
01:49:07,222 --> 01:49:12,465
[SPEAKER_77]: A very important case, I think, because a lot of questions were being asked about how he was allowed to leave the country

1247
01:49:13,185 --> 01:49:14,025
[SPEAKER_77]: in the first place.

1248
01:49:14,065 --> 01:49:22,228
[SPEAKER_77]: So if the government can get Mr. Malia back, and the last date of this hearing is on the 14th of December, maybe they're going to have a good Christmas, maybe not going to be such a good one for him.

1249
01:49:22,968 --> 01:49:23,748
[SPEAKER_92]: Alright, well we'll see.

1250
01:49:23,908 --> 01:49:30,150
[SPEAKER_92]: Just before you go there, Rahul, just very quickly, a difficult question for you, but how would you define happiness?

1251
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:35,301
[SPEAKER_77]: Oh, how would I define happiness?

1252
01:49:35,321 --> 01:49:36,241
[SPEAKER_77]: There's a good question.

1253
01:49:36,341 --> 01:49:36,781
[SPEAKER_77]: I'll tell you what.

1254
01:49:37,301 --> 01:49:37,921
[SPEAKER_77]: I'll tell you, Roger.

1255
01:49:37,941 --> 01:49:39,522
[SPEAKER_77]: When I experience it, I'll let you know.

1256
01:49:39,942 --> 01:49:40,182
[SPEAKER_92]: All right.

1257
01:49:40,282 --> 01:49:40,502
[SPEAKER_92]: All right.

1258
01:49:40,522 --> 01:49:41,162
[SPEAKER_92]: We'll let you go.

1259
01:49:41,182 --> 01:49:42,642
[SPEAKER_92]: Thanks very much indeed, Rahul.

1260
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:52,565
[SPEAKER_92]: Now, the reason I was asking Rahul that rather strange and fairly philosophical question is that we are interested in a case that's come up in Nigeria.

1261
01:49:52,625 --> 01:50:02,127
[SPEAKER_92]: Now, the governor of Nigeria's Imo state, Rojas Okorocha, has appointed his sister as commissioner for happiness and couples fulfillment.

1262
01:50:02,787 --> 01:50:08,348
[SPEAKER_92]: The governor's spokesman said there wasn't anything unusual about the appointment, as Mr. Okorocha always wanted to make people happy.

1263
01:50:09,148 --> 01:50:16,030
[SPEAKER_92]: Well, I've been speaking to Yemi Adamokolekun, who is one of the founders of the campaign called Enough is Enough Nigeria.

1264
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:20,211
[SPEAKER_92]: It's a good governance advocacy group based in Lagos.

1265
01:50:21,091 --> 01:50:26,092
[SPEAKER_92]: Now, she says a minister of happiness isn't perhaps as absurd as it sounds.

1266
01:50:26,715 --> 01:50:37,907
[SPEAKER_33]: The UAE actually has one, and the role of the Minister of Happiness is a person who oversees the UAE's plans, programmes and policies to achieve a happier society.

1267
01:50:38,047 --> 01:50:40,310
[SPEAKER_33]: So there's a clear mandate for a Minister of Happiness.

1268
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:43,313
[SPEAKER_92]: But we need to define what happiness is, I suppose.

1269
01:50:43,373 --> 01:50:47,478
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean, you and I might agree, we might disagree on what happiness exactly is.

1270
01:50:47,838 --> 01:50:48,418
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, yes.

1271
01:50:48,598 --> 01:50:56,281
[SPEAKER_33]: According to the lady who was tweeting earlier today, she's been responsible for hospitality for the Imo State government for the last six years.

1272
01:50:56,822 --> 01:51:04,585
[SPEAKER_33]: So it was considered it was a natural fit for her to continue to make provisions for large Christmas tree, catering for statewide events.

1273
01:51:04,925 --> 01:51:10,747
[SPEAKER_33]: So things that relate to fun occasions that the state organizes she was responsible for.

1274
01:51:10,887 --> 01:51:14,849
[SPEAKER_33]: So in their definition, it's just fun events.

1275
01:51:15,429 --> 01:51:17,090
[SPEAKER_33]: Fun events equals happy society.

1276
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:29,260
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean, fun and happiness, I suppose, again, philosophically, you might not think of the same thing, but I mean, maybe if people had more money or didn't have to worry about illness, I mean, those kind of things might bring them happiness.

1277
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,522
[SPEAKER_33]: Most definitely, especially in this context.

1278
01:51:31,582 --> 01:51:37,267
[SPEAKER_33]: So the governor of Imo, for example, is owing pensioners, I think, either 14 or 16 months of salaries.

1279
01:51:37,987 --> 01:51:47,837
[SPEAKER_33]: So I would agree with you that if those ones actually were able to meet their basic needs they will be quite quite happy rather than having a Christmas tree to go and look at.

1280
01:51:48,237 --> 01:51:56,745
[SPEAKER_92]: I'm detecting you don't think this is a particularly well that this is in the end a fairly absurd thing to do to a Minister for Happiness when that kind of thing's going on.

1281
01:51:57,045 --> 01:52:02,030
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah in this context I mean the UAE it's quite okay for them to have a Minister of Happiness because if you have

1282
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:08,614
[SPEAKER_33]: The GDP per capita that they do and sort of income inequality is not a major issue in the UAE.

1283
01:52:09,214 --> 01:52:18,679
[SPEAKER_33]: In Nigeria it is a huge issue and especially in the state in question where there are evidence that the governor is not spending the state's resources judiciously.

1284
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,621
[SPEAKER_33]: So large Christmas tree, lavish events.

1285
01:52:21,661 --> 01:52:26,284
[SPEAKER_33]: I think for his birthday there were like 25 cakes stacked on top of each other.

1286
01:52:26,884 --> 01:52:32,869
[SPEAKER_33]: And then in recent months, he's done a statue of Jacob Zuba, and Jacob Zuba flew in to commission the statue.

1287
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:37,473
[SPEAKER_33]: Spending state resources on things like that, to me, are just quite absurd.

1288
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:40,456
[SPEAKER_33]: And you don't really need a Minister of Happiness to make people happy.

1289
01:52:40,496 --> 01:52:44,820
[SPEAKER_33]: You just need to respond to their needs to be able to meet their basic needs.

1290
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:47,182
[SPEAKER_92]: But it's made this lady quite happy, I suppose.

1291
01:52:47,522 --> 01:52:48,023
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm indeed.

1292
01:52:48,163 --> 01:52:51,148
[SPEAKER_33]: She's actually the minister, the governor's biological sister.

1293
01:52:51,169 --> 01:52:58,701
[SPEAKER_33]: So she's quite comfortable in the role that she's been given and she, according to her tweet, is looking forward to doing more to make the people of Imo happy.

1294
01:52:59,835 --> 01:53:08,841
[SPEAKER_92]: Yemi, that set us all to thinking about whether governments or that kind of thing could actually talk about happiness in this sort of way.

1295
01:53:08,881 --> 01:53:10,022
[SPEAKER_92]: Is it quantifiable?

1296
01:53:10,062 --> 01:53:16,947
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean, Andrew, I do remember it was Bhutan, I think, started talking about the gross national happiness and somehow they could go towards that.

1297
01:53:16,967 --> 01:53:18,588
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean, do you believe that's possible?

1298
01:53:19,808 --> 01:53:22,010
[SPEAKER_80]: I'm pretty skeptical, I'm afraid, Roger.

1299
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:38,383
[SPEAKER_80]: My concern here is, I remember a few years ago, David Cameron, former UK Prime Minister, when he was in opposition, during the years running up to the financial crisis, he would say, well, you know, we've got to start thinking beyond GDP growth, and we've got to start thinking about the happiness of people.

1300
01:53:38,783 --> 01:53:40,985
[SPEAKER_80]: And then, of course, the financial crisis hit, and everyone was

1301
01:53:41,485 --> 01:53:44,526
[SPEAKER_80]: thinking, crikey, we've got to sort out the economy here first.

1302
01:53:44,546 --> 01:53:59,013
[SPEAKER_80]: And it seems to me that when people start talking about this sort of thing, it's a it's a sort of worrying counter cyclical sign that we're getting a bit complacent about things and that actually government should stick to the knitting of just running the country competently.

1303
01:53:59,633 --> 01:54:03,637
[SPEAKER_80]: And whether I'm happy or not, I'll decide for myself.

1304
01:54:03,697 --> 01:54:07,441
[SPEAKER_80]: But as long as the country is run well, that's what I want from my government.

1305
01:54:07,461 --> 01:54:09,142
[SPEAKER_92]: Well, that's an interesting one, actually.

1306
01:54:09,222 --> 01:54:11,825
[SPEAKER_92]: Tony, isn't the problem his definition?

1307
01:54:11,865 --> 01:54:12,846
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean, what is happening?

1308
01:54:12,866 --> 01:54:15,909
[SPEAKER_92]: Some people are happy with one thing, other people are not.

1309
01:54:16,569 --> 01:54:18,371
[SPEAKER_92]: You can't really quantify or measure it, can you?

1310
01:54:19,737 --> 01:54:24,621
[SPEAKER_60]: No, you can't, although I'm sure I'm not the only one who's thinking about it here at the end of the year.

1311
01:54:25,662 --> 01:54:27,824
[SPEAKER_60]: This is a fascinating story.

1312
01:54:27,844 --> 01:54:28,284
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm not sure.

1313
01:54:28,304 --> 01:54:31,367
[SPEAKER_60]: I think I come down on Andy's side with this.

1314
01:54:31,407 --> 01:54:38,733
[SPEAKER_60]: I think stability, consistency in government would make me very happy.

1315
01:54:38,793 --> 01:54:39,233
[SPEAKER_92]: Well, there we are.

1316
01:54:39,253 --> 01:54:40,854
[SPEAKER_92]: You see, now you have defined it a bit.

1317
01:54:40,894 --> 01:54:43,135
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean, surely, Tony, there must be other things that make you happy.

1318
01:54:43,155 --> 01:54:43,495
[SPEAKER_92]: For me?

1319
01:54:43,695 --> 01:54:47,217
[SPEAKER_92]: Yeah, which perhaps, you know, you could make a list and say, right, that's fine.

1320
01:54:47,697 --> 01:54:48,618
[SPEAKER_92]: Now I can get that.

1321
01:54:48,638 --> 01:54:50,138
[SPEAKER_92]: I can even ask the government for it.

1322
01:54:50,178 --> 01:54:51,679
[SPEAKER_92]: And then I shall achieve happiness.

1323
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:52,780
[SPEAKER_92]: Isn't that the way forward?

1324
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:54,901
[SPEAKER_60]: Yeah, I suppose.

1325
01:54:54,941 --> 01:54:58,162
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't know if you need a commissioner for that.

1326
01:54:58,262 --> 01:54:59,123
[SPEAKER_92]: All right, then, come on.

1327
01:54:59,143 --> 01:55:00,383
[SPEAKER_92]: What would make you happy, Tony?

1328
01:55:01,804 --> 01:55:03,325
[SPEAKER_92]: Just a few achievable things.

1329
01:55:03,385 --> 01:55:03,925
[SPEAKER_92]: Come on.

1330
01:55:04,005 --> 01:55:05,466
[SPEAKER_92]: It's getting towards the end of the year.

1331
01:55:05,846 --> 01:55:07,447
[SPEAKER_92]: People might be thinking what to give you for Christmas.

1332
01:55:07,467 --> 01:55:07,827
[SPEAKER_92]: You never know.

1333
01:55:08,863 --> 01:55:10,483
[SPEAKER_60]: A giant Christmas tree sounds great.

1334
01:55:10,623 --> 01:55:15,565
[SPEAKER_60]: I think if our government could get right on that for me or for whoever, you know, I'd appreciate it.

1335
01:55:16,425 --> 01:55:26,927
[SPEAKER_92]: Andrew, it's an interesting, the part of the world you are, there is in some ways a more, I don't know, a mechanical attitude perhaps to some of the things that can bring happiness.

1336
01:55:26,947 --> 01:55:29,548
[SPEAKER_92]: People think, well, we will get this and that and the government can bring it.

1337
01:55:30,328 --> 01:55:35,391
[SPEAKER_92]: and they can make it happen and then we will have a nice utilitarian kind of paradise.

1338
01:55:35,792 --> 01:55:41,055
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean, do you think that's particularly something that in your part of the world, in Asia, is more of a thing people think about?

1339
01:55:42,535 --> 01:55:48,819
[SPEAKER_80]: I think people in this part of the world, particularly in Hong Kong, happiness is quite associated with wealth.

1340
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:50,661
[SPEAKER_80]: Let's put it that way.

1341
01:55:51,902 --> 01:56:02,689
[SPEAKER_80]: And I think certainly in Hong Kong, as long as the government kind of gets out of the way and lets people get on and make money, then that's what makes the people here generally happy.

1342
01:56:03,129 --> 01:56:19,055
[SPEAKER_80]: I mean obviously on the mainland in China you have a slightly different approach where the government sort of is responsible for most things including the delivery of happiness to the people and I just worry that that is not exactly the way that countries are best run.

1343
01:56:19,315 --> 01:56:21,276
[SPEAKER_92]: Is that because it's a very materialistic way?

1344
01:56:21,316 --> 01:56:32,240
[SPEAKER_92]: I mean we think of a lot of course of philosophy coming out of Asia as well but is there a certain materialism you know that happiness is measurable as you say in wealth terms it's clear.

1345
01:56:34,528 --> 01:56:40,911
[SPEAKER_80]: You could argue that these are quite heavy topics for a Thursday morning.

1346
01:56:41,271 --> 01:56:49,194
[SPEAKER_80]: I think, look, I don't want to generalize too much about Hong Kongers in the sense that I don't want to tar them with just being interested in money.

1347
01:56:49,254 --> 01:56:55,276
[SPEAKER_80]: But I do think that it is a feature of the society out here.

1348
01:56:56,757 --> 01:56:59,798
[SPEAKER_80]: And perhaps that comes from historical background where

1349
01:57:00,258 --> 01:57:19,127
[SPEAKER_80]: you know, people have had to work hard for a living here and in this part of the world and so the attainment of a certain level of standard of living is something that's associated with happiness and you can't blame people for that if, you know, they've come from a generally poor background and a poor historical background.

1350
01:57:19,428 --> 01:57:22,489
[SPEAKER_92]: All right, well finally then, Andrew, what would constitute happiness for you?

1351
01:57:22,529 --> 01:57:23,770
[SPEAKER_92]: Come on, I've put Tony through this.

1352
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:25,891
[SPEAKER_80]: I was pretty happy over the weekend.

1353
01:57:25,911 --> 01:57:29,133
[SPEAKER_80]: I was sat watching England play Australia in Adelaide.

1354
01:57:29,573 --> 01:57:32,495
[SPEAKER_80]: What would have made me happier is if England had been playing a bit better.

1355
01:57:32,515 --> 01:57:33,956
[SPEAKER_92]: I was going to say the outcome, but we didn't.

1356
01:57:34,677 --> 01:57:35,417
[SPEAKER_80]: I'm a simple guy.

1357
01:57:36,338 --> 01:57:39,740
[SPEAKER_80]: Good game of cricket, but England winning is what makes me happy.

1358
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:40,420
[SPEAKER_80]: All right.

1359
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:40,660
[SPEAKER_92]: OK.

1360
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,241
[SPEAKER_92]: Well, we'll send you on your way happy.

1361
01:57:42,442 --> 01:57:44,743
[SPEAKER_92]: And Tony, we hope we send you on your way too.

1362
01:57:44,763 --> 01:57:46,284
[SPEAKER_92]: Perhaps you will get that large Christmas tree.

1363
01:57:46,784 --> 01:57:49,486
[SPEAKER_92]: And as for me, well, it's the end of the programme and I get to go to bed.

1364
01:57:49,686 --> 01:57:50,727
[SPEAKER_92]: What could be a better happiness?

1365
01:57:50,747 --> 01:57:51,707
[SPEAKER_92]: Thank you very much for listening.

1366
01:57:52,028 --> 01:57:52,648

1370
01:58:22,011 --> 01:58:30,779
[SPEAKER_64]: It was something that grew in me like a boulder till it was almost choking me and I felt I had to write it.

1371
01:58:30,839 --> 01:58:36,063
[SPEAKER_27]: World Book Club at bbcworldservice.com slash worldbookclub

1372
01:58:38,587 --> 01:58:40,989
[SPEAKER_27]: You're listening to the BBC World Service.

[SPEAKER_27]: Available on the BBC iPlayer radio app.

1380
01:58:56,799 --> 01:59:00,401
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the BBC World Service, the world's radio station.

1381
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:12,715
[SPEAKER_110]: BBC World Service, it's two o'clock GMT, this is Oliver Conway with the Newsroom.

1382
01:59:13,036 --> 01:59:21,507
[SPEAKER_110]: The US President Donald Trump is expected to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later, breaking with the international consensus on the city's status.

1383
01:59:21,858 --> 01:59:25,360
[SPEAKER_124]: I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding the president's decision on Jerusalem.

1384
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:27,701
[SPEAKER_124]: Tomorrow the president will deliver remarks.

1385
01:59:28,281 --> 01:59:30,322
[SPEAKER_124]: Has the president made up his mind?

1386
01:59:30,382 --> 01:59:33,543
[SPEAKER_124]: The president is pretty solid in his thinking at this point.

1387
01:59:33,883 --> 01:59:34,944
[SPEAKER_44]: Also on the newsroom.

1388
01:59:35,224 --> 01:59:36,524
[SPEAKER_44]: It's a political decision.

1389
01:59:36,645 --> 01:59:37,725
[SPEAKER_44]: Very bad decision.

1390
01:59:38,065 --> 01:59:39,446
[SPEAKER_44]: And I disagree.

1391
01:59:40,146 --> 01:59:44,208
[SPEAKER_44]: This position of the World Olympic Committee and so on.

1392
01:59:44,568 --> 01:59:49,370
[SPEAKER_110]: There's been a furious reaction in Moscow after Russia was banned from next year's Winter Olympics.

1393
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:53,852
[SPEAKER_110]: Tens of thousands of Californians have fled wildfires north of Los Angeles.

1394
01:59:54,352 --> 01:59:58,895
[SPEAKER_49]: Good friends up the street lost their homes, and I'm just so sad for them.

1395
01:59:59,595 --> 02:00:04,417
[SPEAKER_110]: And have investigators issued a subpoena for Donald Trump's financial records at Deutsche Bank?

1396
02:00:04,917 --> 02:00:06,118
[SPEAKER_110]: First, our top stories.

1397
02:00:08,325 --> 02:00:10,026
[SPEAKER_88]: BBC News with Gareth Barlow.

1398
02:00:10,647 --> 02:00:16,552
[SPEAKER_88]: Senior US officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

1399
02:00:16,572 --> 02:00:23,418
[SPEAKER_88]: He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

1400
02:00:23,959 --> 02:00:26,661
[SPEAKER_88]: Arab states have warned that the decision could provoke violence.

1401
02:00:27,041 --> 02:00:28,863
[SPEAKER_88]: From Washington, here's Barbara Pletusher.

1402
02:00:29,323 --> 02:00:33,309
[SPEAKER_73]: The president is planning to fulfill a campaign promise made to pro-Israel voters.

1403
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:39,538
[SPEAKER_73]: But in doing so, he's tackling one of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the status of Jerusalem.

1404
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:43,825
[SPEAKER_73]: Senior administration officials said he would simply be acknowledging reality,

1405
02:00:44,225 --> 02:00:46,667
[SPEAKER_73]: that Jerusalem functions as the capital of Israel.

1406
02:00:47,247 --> 02:00:55,794
[SPEAKER_73]: Congress has called for such a move for 22 years, but previous presidents have been resistant, accepting that Jerusalem's future should be part of a negotiated agreement.

1407
02:00:56,535 --> 02:00:56,955
[SPEAKER_73]: One U.S.

1408
02:00:56,995 --> 02:01:00,878
[SPEAKER_73]: official said that delaying the decision had done nothing to advance peace.

1409
02:01:01,519 --> 02:01:05,502
[SPEAKER_73]: But the U.N., Europe and Arab states have long calculated that it would prevent conflict.

1410
02:01:06,256 --> 02:01:13,583
[SPEAKER_88]: Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban it from next February's Winter Olympics in South Korea.

1411
02:01:14,104 --> 02:01:20,710
[SPEAKER_88]: A damning report by the IOC said there had been an unprecedented systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system.

1412
02:01:21,151 --> 02:01:22,972
[SPEAKER_88]: From Moscow, here's Steve Rosenberg.

1413
02:01:23,553 --> 02:01:28,318
[SPEAKER_101]: The deputy speaker of Russia's parliament said it was a humiliation and an insult to Russia.

1414
02:01:29,178 --> 02:01:40,809
[SPEAKER_101]: In a defiant post in social media, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said Russia would survive this like it survived World War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Western sanctions.

1415
02:01:41,850 --> 02:01:51,179
[SPEAKER_101]: Although the Russian team has been banned from competing in South Korea, Russian athletes who can prove they are clean will be permitted to participate under the Olympic flag.

1416
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,642
[SPEAKER_101]: But will the Kremlin allow them to?

1417
02:01:54,322 --> 02:01:59,589
[SPEAKER_101]: Vladimir Putin has in the past described such a scenario as a humiliation for his country.

1418
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:05,576
[SPEAKER_88]: Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

1419
02:02:05,996 --> 02:02:08,620
[SPEAKER_88]: James Cook reports from the outskirts of Los Angeles.

1420
02:02:09,075 --> 02:02:21,331
[SPEAKER_106]: In Ventura County, to the north of Los Angeles, a wildfire which broke out on Monday intensified with terrifying speed, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by arid and gusty Santa Ana winds.

1421
02:02:21,812 --> 02:02:25,557
[SPEAKER_106]: Scores of homes were gutted and a mental health hospital was destroyed.

1422
02:02:26,157 --> 02:02:34,221
[SPEAKER_106]: Here, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the charred ruins of houses are still smoking, while dark, choking smoke has closed a major moat away.

1423
02:02:34,781 --> 02:02:38,643
[SPEAKER_106]: Ash is blowing through the air, and there is a firefighting helicopter overhead.

1424
02:02:39,183 --> 02:02:46,567
[SPEAKER_106]: And with forecasters warning that ferocious winds and low humidity will continue for several days, this could yet get a lot worse.

1425
02:02:47,408 --> 02:02:52,654
[SPEAKER_88]: Three men in Malta have been charged with murdering the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.

1426
02:02:53,054 --> 02:02:55,377
[SPEAKER_88]: She was killed in a car bomb attack in October.

1427
02:02:55,777 --> 02:02:59,261
[SPEAKER_88]: The case has shocked the small Mediterranean island and the European Union.

1428
02:02:59,621 --> 02:03:02,304
[SPEAKER_88]: The three accused men were among ten arrested on Monday.

1429
02:03:03,445 --> 02:03:05,407
[SPEAKER_88]: World News from the BBC.

1430
02:03:09,458 --> 02:03:14,860
[SPEAKER_88]: Fifteen thousand people a day are being forced to flee their homes in African conflict and disaster zones.

1431
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:24,163
[SPEAKER_88]: Figures published by the Norwegian Refugee Council and the Internal Deplacement Monitoring Centre show that more than 12 million people in Africa are internally displaced.

1432
02:03:24,623 --> 02:03:30,045
[SPEAKER_88]: Nearly four million left their homes last year, a quarter of them in the Democratic Republic of Congo alone.

1433
02:03:31,225 --> 02:03:40,970
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favor President Juan Orlando Hernández.

1434
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:47,573
[SPEAKER_88]: The electoral tribunal had already agreed to an earlier opposition demand to recount around one-third of the ballots.

1435
02:03:48,114 --> 02:03:56,058
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla, has appeared set for victory shortly after the election ten days ago, when the vote count was suddenly halted.

1436
02:03:57,385 --> 02:04:07,908
[SPEAKER_88]: Christine Keeler, the British former model whose relationships with a British minister and a Soviet diplomat in the 1960s caused one of the most notorious political scandals of the Cold War, has died.

1437
02:04:08,369 --> 02:04:09,449
[SPEAKER_88]: She was 75.

1438
02:04:09,989 --> 02:04:15,411
[SPEAKER_88]: As a teenager, she had a brief affair with John Profumo, a senior Cabot member who was forced to resign.

1439
02:04:15,891 --> 02:04:17,792
[SPEAKER_88]: The scandal rocked the British establishment.

1440
02:04:18,192 --> 02:04:21,933
[SPEAKER_88]: Christine Keeler said she'd been too young to deal with the impact of the affair.

1441
02:04:22,715 --> 02:04:35,775
[SPEAKER_116]: I wish that at that time I had been older so that I would have been able to have answered or spoke up for myself, but I was only a young girl.

1442
02:04:36,765 --> 02:04:44,230
[SPEAKER_88]: Britain's most prestigious contemporary art award, the Turner Prize, has been won by an art professor who was born in Zanzibar, Lubaina Hameed.

1443
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:54,157
[SPEAKER_88]: Judges praised her work, which explores the African diaspora and black creativity, for what they called its exuberant approach to painting and its sense of theatre and satire.

1444
02:04:54,557 --> 02:04:58,540
[SPEAKER_88]: Professor Hameed is the first black woman and the oldest person to win the award.

1445
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:04,324
[SPEAKER_88]: She said she would use the $33,000 prize money to help young artists get their work exhibited.

1446
02:05:04,884 --> 02:05:05,665
[SPEAKER_88]: BBC News.

1447
02:05:08,417 --> 02:05:08,997
[SPEAKER_110]: Thanks very much.

1448
02:05:09,017 --> 02:05:13,138
[SPEAKER_110]: You're listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service with Oliver Conway.

1449
02:05:13,619 --> 02:05:20,881
[SPEAKER_110]: Despite warnings from Arab leaders about the possible dangerous repercussions, it seems Donald Trump is planning to move the U.S.

1450
02:05:20,961 --> 02:05:24,102
[SPEAKER_110]: embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

1451
02:05:24,662 --> 02:05:37,853
[SPEAKER_110]: White House officials have briefed journalists that the president will announce in a speech at 18 Hours GMT on Wednesday that the US is recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, making it the first and only country to do so.

1452
02:05:37,873 --> 02:05:40,655
[SPEAKER_110]: Here's his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

1453
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:45,310
[SPEAKER_124]: Finally, I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding the President's decision on Jerusalem.

1454
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:47,651
[SPEAKER_124]: Tomorrow, the President will deliver remarks.

1455
02:05:48,251 --> 02:05:52,453
[SPEAKER_124]: Has the President made up his mind about this, or is this decision still in flux?

1456
02:05:53,514 --> 02:05:58,176
[SPEAKER_124]: The President, I would say, is pretty solid in his thinking at this point.

1457
02:05:58,976 --> 02:06:05,201
[SPEAKER_110]: Both the Palestinians and the Israelis claim Jerusalem as a capital of any current or future state.

1458
02:06:05,721 --> 02:06:15,208
[SPEAKER_110]: President Trump has tried to ease concerns with a series of phone calls to Arab leaders in the Middle East, including the Palestinian leader, as we heard from Yolande Nel in Jerusalem.

1459
02:06:15,878 --> 02:06:21,902
[SPEAKER_05]: In their phone call, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is said to have warned Mr. Trump that moving the U.S.

1460
02:06:22,002 --> 02:06:26,946
[SPEAKER_05]: embassy would have an impact on the peace process with Israel and regional stability.

1461
02:06:27,486 --> 02:06:34,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Abbas has since spoken to the Pope and the leaders of Russia, France and Jordan, asking them to intervene.

1462
02:06:34,671 --> 02:06:42,097
[SPEAKER_05]: King Abdullah of Jordan was also called by Mr. Trump and is said to have spoken of possible dangerous repercussions of his plan.

1463
02:06:42,877 --> 02:06:48,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Egypt's President Sisi is reported to have told him there was no need to complicate matters in the Middle East.

1464
02:07:00,348 --> 02:07:12,976
[SPEAKER_83]: Well yes, although with the caveat that unless until he actually delivers the speech we can't predict entirely what he's going to say and specifically his thinking behind this decision.

1465
02:07:13,416 --> 02:07:24,183
[SPEAKER_83]: It would be highly contentious, it already is, in terms of what we have heard in moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem effectively

1466
02:07:24,603 --> 02:07:39,088
[SPEAKER_83]: acknowledging Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the first country to do so since the foundation of the state of Israel since 1948, and it would mark a sea change in certainly US policy towards the region.

1467
02:07:39,608 --> 02:07:46,810
[SPEAKER_110]: And the briefings we're getting from White House officials suggest though that it will take some time to move the embassy.

1468
02:07:49,174 --> 02:08:00,719
[SPEAKER_83]: Yes, what we understand is that there will be some form of waiver written into Mr. Trump's announcement that will keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for at least six months.

1469
02:08:00,799 --> 02:08:16,105
[SPEAKER_83]: Now, my understanding is that much of this is simply logistics, the moving of staff between the two cities, which is clearly going to take some time, but perhaps also it is a little bit of breathing space to see what the reaction

1470
02:08:16,685 --> 02:08:25,293
[SPEAKER_83]: is going to be and the policy may well change over coming months depending on how things unravel in the weeks and months to come.

1471
02:08:25,594 --> 02:08:28,857
[SPEAKER_110]: And why, what is the attraction of doing this for President Trump?

1472
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:51,649
[SPEAKER_83]: Well, certainly it was part of his campaign pledge that he wanted to do this and it was one of his major foreign policy planks and perhaps domestic policy comes into this a little bit in terms of the president wanting to be seen to be making good on those big promises in his first year.

1473
02:08:51,709 --> 02:08:54,832
[SPEAKER_83]: I mentioned domestic politics because it hasn't necessarily all gone his way.

1474
02:08:55,232 --> 02:08:56,693
[SPEAKER_83]: in terms of those big promises.

1475
02:08:56,753 --> 02:09:02,937
[SPEAKER_83]: So I think he wants to get something done, and I think he is known as quite an impatient character in this respect.

1476
02:09:03,218 --> 02:09:10,423
[SPEAKER_83]: But in terms of doing it now, I think there are quite a few people here who are rather mystified by the timing.

1477
02:09:10,563 --> 02:09:14,886
[SPEAKER_83]: We know that the White House, the Trump administration, has been working on a peace plan for several months.

1478
02:09:14,966 --> 02:09:16,607
[SPEAKER_83]: We don't know the detail of that.

1479
02:09:17,047 --> 02:09:44,260
[SPEAKER_83]: So why to make this announcement now, perhaps ahead of a bigger plan and bigger negotiations, I think we remain to see, because it does show the US's hand, and if the US is going to play a role as a mediator in negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, it perhaps makes things rather awkward, because it's certainly not what the Palestinians wanted to hear.

1480
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:45,782
[SPEAKER_110]: Peter, many thanks indeed.

1481
02:09:46,022 --> 02:09:53,956
[SPEAKER_110]: Peter Bowes there and hopefully we'll get more details in that speech apparently from Donald Trump tomorrow at lunchtime in the US.

1482
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,622
[SPEAKER_110]: While he focuses on that big change in U.S.

1483
02:09:57,762 --> 02:10:03,046
[SPEAKER_110]: foreign policy, Donald Trump could be facing an investigation at home into his finances.

1484
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:06,669
[SPEAKER_110]: I say could because there's some dispute over whether the U.S.

1485
02:10:06,689 --> 02:10:12,414
[SPEAKER_110]: special counsel Robert Mueller has issued a subpoena for Mr. Trump's financial records at Deutsche Bank.

1486
02:10:13,014 --> 02:10:14,455
[SPEAKER_110]: Many media outlets in the U.S.

1487
02:10:14,495 --> 02:10:21,361
[SPEAKER_110]: reported that he had, but it was denied by the president's legal team, as relayed by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

1488
02:10:21,905 --> 02:10:38,273
[SPEAKER_124]: Look, I think it's important to note, and hopefully you guys have seen this statement, that Jay Sekulow, a member of the president's legal team, has put out within the last hour that they confirmed that the news reports that the special counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are completely false.

1489
02:10:38,713 --> 02:10:40,714
[SPEAKER_124]: No subpoena has been issued or received.

1490
02:10:41,054 --> 02:10:43,355
[SPEAKER_124]: We've confirmed this with the bank and other sources.

1491
02:10:43,695 --> 02:10:49,758
[SPEAKER_124]: I think that this is another example of the media going too far too fast, and we don't see it going in that direction.

1492
02:10:50,378 --> 02:10:53,540
[SPEAKER_110]: So, do we know if a subpoena has indeed been issued?

1493
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:56,661
[SPEAKER_110]: A question for our correspondent Anthony Zerke in Washington.

1494
02:10:57,081 --> 02:10:57,441
[SPEAKER_87]: We don't.

1495
02:10:57,521 --> 02:11:07,286
[SPEAKER_87]: We had multiple news outlets reporting that the documents had been subpoenaed by the special counsel Robert Mueller, subpoenaing Deutsche Bank.

1496
02:11:07,446 --> 02:11:14,189
[SPEAKER_87]: But since then, the White House lawyers have pushed back fairly vociferously, saying there was no subpoena request.

1497
02:11:14,549 --> 02:11:18,371
[SPEAKER_87]: They checked with Deutsche Bank and other sources that have

1498
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:25,858
[SPEAKER_87]: said these reports are false, but the sources that these news outlets are citing are standing by their contention.

1499
02:11:25,939 --> 02:11:31,284
[SPEAKER_87]: So it's basically up in the air whether this actually has happened or not.

1500
02:11:31,524 --> 02:11:34,828
[SPEAKER_110]: And why would the special counsel want those records?

1501
02:11:35,228 --> 02:11:44,692
[SPEAKER_87]: Well, that's the interesting thing here, because so far Robert Mueller has, say, looked into the foreign lobbying of Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chair.

1502
02:11:44,712 --> 02:11:56,718
[SPEAKER_87]: He has reached a plea agreement with Michael Flynn, who was a confidant of Donald Trump's and his first national security adviser, and George Papadopoulos, who was a foreign policy adviser on the campaign.

1503
02:11:56,878 --> 02:12:05,083
[SPEAKER_87]: Those are all kind of outside the main purview of the inspection of whether there's ties between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling.

1504
02:12:05,103 --> 02:12:18,831
[SPEAKER_87]: Well, here you have Robert Mueller directly looking at the president himself, if it's true, and his finances, looking at Deutsche Bank, because Donald Trump owes Deutsche Bank about $300 million when he came into the presidency.

1505
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:28,556
[SPEAKER_87]: The bank has loaned Donald Trump about $4 billion over the course of the past 20 years, so they have very close financial ties.

1506
02:12:29,096 --> 02:12:36,800
[SPEAKER_110]: And this all raises the question of whether Robert Mueller will be allowed to continue his investigation.

1507
02:12:37,662 --> 02:12:53,537
[SPEAKER_87]: Well, when Donald Trump was interviewed about this a few months back, they asked whether it would be a red line, whether it would be going too far beyond his mandate if Robert Mueller started looking into his business dealings prior to being a presidential candidate.

1508
02:12:54,137 --> 02:13:03,266
[SPEAKER_87]: And Donald Trump was fairly clear that he thought that would be going too far, and perhaps this would instigate a more aggressive response from the president.

1509
02:13:03,726 --> 02:13:16,032
[SPEAKER_87]: possibly even trying to get rid of Robert Mueller, which, as president, he could do if he orders people in his Justice Department to do so, although that would create quite a controversy.

1510
02:13:16,172 --> 02:13:27,558
[SPEAKER_87]: But there may be some uneasiness on the part of Donald Trump to having someone poking around in his business dealings long before he was a serious candidate for political office.

1511
02:13:28,098 --> 02:13:30,039
[SPEAKER_110]: Anthony Zerker in Washington.

1512
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:40,506
[SPEAKER_110]: Let's go across now to Los Angeles, because since wildfires started there just over a day ago, the flames have spread across some 180 square kilometres.

1513
02:13:41,107 --> 02:13:52,654
[SPEAKER_110]: People in California have already experienced a number of bad wildfires this year, but now 27,000 residents have suddenly been forced to evacuate, with no sign of when the fires will be put out.

1514
02:13:53,175 --> 02:13:54,556
[SPEAKER_110]: James Cook is in LA.

1515
02:13:55,356 --> 02:14:02,221
[SPEAKER_105]: This wildfire exploded overnight, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by ferocious Santa Ana winds.

1516
02:14:04,662 --> 02:14:07,244
[SPEAKER_105]: Devastation, with nothing to salvage.

1517
02:14:08,064 --> 02:14:11,887
[SPEAKER_105]: Families had just minutes to scramble their belongings together and flee.

1518
02:14:13,008 --> 02:14:18,011
[SPEAKER_49]: Good friends up the street lost their homes, and I'm just so sad for them.

1519
02:14:18,071 --> 02:14:23,935
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm happy for myself and those of us that kept their homes, but it's awful.

1520
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:28,222
[SPEAKER_105]: There is, though, little hope of the winds easing.

1521
02:14:28,522 --> 02:14:32,846
[SPEAKER_105]: They are dry, gusty and erratic, the most dangerous conditions possible.

1522
02:14:33,667 --> 02:14:42,094
[SPEAKER_105]: Ventura is home to more than 100,000 people, and with more than 1,000 firefighters struggling to protect the city, a second blaze broke out.

1523
02:14:42,775 --> 02:14:49,341
[SPEAKER_105]: This fire is closer to L.A., and millions of Angelenos awoke to find the skies to the north thick with smoke.

1524
02:14:51,239 --> 02:14:56,382
[SPEAKER_105]: Helicopters have struggled to fly in the wind, making it much harder to contain the fires.

1525
02:14:57,023 --> 02:15:03,787
[SPEAKER_105]: With forecasters warning that the dangerous weather will continue for several days, the governor of California declared an emergency.

1526
02:15:04,287 --> 02:15:11,272
[SPEAKER_105]: And with a third fire now burning, the most devastating wildfire season on record in this state just got a lot worse.

1527
02:15:11,952 --> 02:15:14,274
[SPEAKER_110]: James Cook reporting from Los Angeles.

1528
02:15:14,294 --> 02:15:17,257
[SPEAKER_110]: Quick bit of breaking news from France.

1529
02:15:17,317 --> 02:15:26,446
[SPEAKER_110]: The country's best-known rock star, Johnny Hallyday, often known as the French Elvis, has died at the age of 74 after a battle with lung cancer.

1530
02:15:26,466 --> 02:15:29,589
[SPEAKER_110]: And we'll bring you more on that before the end of the programme.

1531
02:15:29,709 --> 02:15:32,191
[SPEAKER_110]: This is the Newsroom from the BBC World Service.

1532
02:15:32,572 --> 02:15:33,573
[SPEAKER_110]: Gareth has our headlines.

1533
02:15:34,191 --> 02:15:41,098
[SPEAKER_88]: Senior officials in the Trump administration say the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

1534
02:15:41,719 --> 02:15:45,422
[SPEAKER_88]: Tens of thousands of Californians have fled wildfires north of Los Angeles.

1535
02:15:45,903 --> 02:15:52,309
[SPEAKER_88]: And there's been a furious reaction in Moscow after the International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the forthcoming Winter Olympics.

1536
02:15:52,689 --> 02:15:56,053
[SPEAKER_110]: Yes, this was state TV in Russia announcing the news.

1537
02:15:56,668 --> 02:16:07,072
[SPEAKER_43]: The International Olympic Committee announced the decision after a 17-month investigation into allegations of state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Games in the Russian city of Sochi.

1538
02:16:18,436 --> 02:16:29,021
[SPEAKER_110]: Some Russian athletes will be able to compete in 2018 as neutral competitors under the Olympic flag, but Russia's Olympic Committee says it will appeal against the ban.

1539
02:16:29,201 --> 02:16:31,662
[SPEAKER_110]: For reaction from Moscow, we heard from Steve Rosenberg.

1540
02:16:32,082 --> 02:16:40,746
[SPEAKER_101]: There's a sense of deep disappointment here, a sense of injustice too, and an unwillingness to accept that Russia has committed a crime here.

1541
02:16:41,267 --> 02:16:43,808
[SPEAKER_101]: The Deputy Speaker of the Russian Parliament, Igor Lebedev,

1542
02:16:44,228 --> 02:16:46,690
[SPEAKER_101]: said this was a humiliation for our country.

1543
02:16:47,050 --> 02:16:49,312
[SPEAKER_101]: I spoke to Dmitry Svishchev.

1544
02:16:49,612 --> 02:16:53,215
[SPEAKER_101]: He's a Russian MP and the president of Russia's Curling Federation.

1545
02:16:53,255 --> 02:16:56,358
[SPEAKER_101]: He told me this was unjust, not based on any evidence.

1546
02:16:56,758 --> 02:16:59,220
[SPEAKER_101]: He said collective responsibility was unfair.

1547
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:04,702
[SPEAKER_101]: He suggested this was a political decision and said sport should be outside of politics.

1548
02:17:04,722 --> 02:17:08,944
[SPEAKER_101]: And then I went to a ski slope on the edge of Moscow, just to speak to ordinary Muscovites.

1549
02:17:09,204 --> 02:17:10,985
[SPEAKER_44]: First of all, it's a political decision.

1550
02:17:11,325 --> 02:17:19,308
[SPEAKER_44]: It's a very bad decision and I disagree with the position of the World Olympic Committee and so on.

1551
02:17:19,968 --> 02:17:28,415
[SPEAKER_44]: because I think that for Russian sportsmen it will be great and very important to show their results under the Russian flag.

1552
02:17:28,796 --> 02:17:45,370
[SPEAKER_101]: In recent weeks a number of Russian politicians have suggested that if the IOC was to take that decision and allow clean Russian sportsmen to take part under the Olympic flag that they should not do so, that this would be almost treachery on the part of the sportsmen.

1553
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:47,952
[SPEAKER_101]: Everything will depend, I think, on what

1554
02:17:48,572 --> 02:18:01,717
[SPEAKER_101]: Vladimir Putin says, because there is one man who will decide this question, that is the Russian president, and we expect that he will announce his decision on whether Russian sportsmen should go and take part under the neutrofag.

1555
02:18:02,077 --> 02:18:06,919
[SPEAKER_101]: This will decide what kind of participation there will be from Russia in the Olympic Games.

1556
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:09,581
[SPEAKER_110]: Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.

1557
02:18:10,602 --> 02:18:17,667
[SPEAKER_110]: Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus, has faced unrelenting bombardment in the past three weeks.

1558
02:18:18,328 --> 02:18:22,211
[SPEAKER_110]: A ceasefire announced recently didn't even hold for a full 24 hours.

1559
02:18:22,852 --> 02:18:28,876
[SPEAKER_110]: As the death toll from airstrikes continues to rise, so does the number of children nearing starvation.

1560
02:18:29,317 --> 02:18:36,723
[SPEAKER_110]: The UN has said that acute malnutrition among youngsters is at the highest level recorded anywhere in Syria since the war there began.

1561
02:18:37,123 --> 02:18:39,544
[SPEAKER_110]: Martin Patience reports now from Eastern Ghouta.

1562
02:18:42,686 --> 02:18:47,368
[SPEAKER_79]: The aftermath of the latest airstrikes is like a scene from hell.

1563
02:18:48,089 --> 02:18:54,432
[SPEAKER_79]: The sky is dark with dust and debris as rescuers rush into buildings to scoop up children.

1564
02:18:55,493 --> 02:18:58,714
[SPEAKER_79]: Among the injured was five-year-old Yusuf with a head wound.

1565
02:18:59,435 --> 02:19:05,098
[SPEAKER_79]: The doctors patch him up as best they can, but they're desperately short of medical supplies.

1566
02:19:08,315 --> 02:19:15,409
[SPEAKER_79]: A rebel stronghold, Eastern Rota, has been bombed and besieged by the Syrian government for several years.

1567
02:19:16,371 --> 02:19:19,297
[SPEAKER_79]: Many families are now on the brink of starvation.

1568
02:19:22,186 --> 02:19:27,568
[SPEAKER_79]: Eight-year-old Noor and his seven-year-old sister, Ghazal, sit round a wood-burning oven.

1569
02:19:28,469 --> 02:19:36,693
[SPEAKER_79]: It's their first and only meal of the day, a thin piece of bread made from barley, which is normally fed to donkeys.

1570
02:19:37,813 --> 02:19:42,355
[SPEAKER_79]: Their father, Abu Ahmed, was seriously injured when out gathering firewood.

1571
02:19:44,812 --> 02:19:47,835
[SPEAKER_76]: A shell landed close to me, and I was hit by a shrapnel.

1572
02:19:47,955 --> 02:19:52,178
[SPEAKER_76]: I was blinded in my left eye, and my knee was damaged, and I can no longer walk.

1573
02:19:52,379 --> 02:19:57,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a pretty bad shape, and I have three kids to look after.

1574
02:19:58,444 --> 02:20:01,486
[SPEAKER_79]: That means his children are left carrying the burden.

1575
02:20:02,027 --> 02:20:04,169
[SPEAKER_79]: Here, they're fetching drinking water.

1576
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:11,015
[SPEAKER_79]: It's no surprise, then, that Ghazal dreams of freeing herself from her prison, Eastern Ghouta.

1577
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:17,526
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could have cookies, sweeties, or any other delicious foods.

1578
02:20:17,546 --> 02:20:23,533
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wish someone could send me a pair of slippers and some new clothes and shoes.

1579
02:20:24,133 --> 02:20:28,639
[SPEAKER_19]: I really miss food, like chicken, cheese, tea, and juice.

1580
02:20:34,802 --> 02:20:40,204
[SPEAKER_79]: In another home, two-and-a-half-year-old Hamza is suffering from severe malnutrition.

1581
02:20:41,044 --> 02:20:45,905
[SPEAKER_79]: His ribs are protruding, and he's wearing a plastic bag as a nappy.

1582
02:20:46,965 --> 02:20:49,906
[SPEAKER_79]: He was abandoned before being taken in by a neighbour.

1583
02:20:51,187 --> 02:20:56,188
[SPEAKER_79]: Umm Mohammed says Hamza is like one of her children.

1584
02:20:56,888 --> 02:20:58,889
[SPEAKER_79]: He's my son now, she says.

1585
02:21:02,610 --> 02:21:05,733
[SPEAKER_79]: There's supposed to be a ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta.

1586
02:21:06,333 --> 02:21:09,956
[SPEAKER_79]: But almost every day, people in this area dig fresh graves.

1587
02:21:10,717 --> 02:21:13,680
[SPEAKER_79]: For families here, there's no respite from the war.

1588
02:21:15,390 --> 02:21:18,191
[SPEAKER_110]: Our report from eastern Utah by Martin Patience.

1589
02:21:18,391 --> 02:21:20,172
[SPEAKER_110]: And now Gareth has some more of the day's stories.

1590
02:21:20,712 --> 02:21:27,115
[SPEAKER_88]: One of Australia's most prominent churchmen is going on trial today accused of covering up child abuse in the 1970s.

1591
02:21:27,595 --> 02:21:33,598
[SPEAKER_88]: The Archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Watson, is the most senior Catholic figure in the world to be charged with this type of offence.

1592
02:21:34,378 --> 02:21:38,360
[SPEAKER_88]: A military operation in Western Cameroon has led to hundreds of people fleeing their villages.

1593
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:46,086
[SPEAKER_88]: The exodus comes after the government pledged to retaliate against an armed group that wants independence for the country's two English-speaking regions.

1594
02:21:46,647 --> 02:21:49,449
[SPEAKER_88]: Some of those fleeing the army have crossed into neighboring Nigeria.

1595
02:21:50,310 --> 02:21:58,998
[SPEAKER_88]: The public prosecutor in Saudi Arabia has said that most of those detained in an unprecedented anti-corruption purge have agreed to settlements in order to avoid prosecution.

1596
02:21:59,438 --> 02:22:05,763
[SPEAKER_88]: He said that a total of 320 people have so far been subpoenaed to provide information about alleged corruption.

1597
02:22:06,604 --> 02:22:15,169
[SPEAKER_110]: Ukraine's prosecutor general says Georgia's former president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has 24 hours to hand himself over to the Ukrainian authorities.

1598
02:22:15,869 --> 02:22:19,551
[SPEAKER_110]: Mr. Saakashvili was invited to Ukraine by its president, Petro Poroshenko.

1599
02:22:20,012 --> 02:22:24,955
[SPEAKER_110]: But the two men have fallen out, and Mr. Saakashvili has become a prominent opposition politician.

1600
02:22:25,495 --> 02:22:34,400
[SPEAKER_110]: On Tuesday, Mr. Saakashvili's supporters helped him escape from security officers in dramatic scenes, as our correspondent in Kiev, Jonah Fisher, reports.

1601
02:22:36,965 --> 02:22:41,067
[SPEAKER_91]: This was a remarkable day in the extraordinary career of Mikhail Saakashvili.

1602
02:22:41,547 --> 02:22:44,909
[SPEAKER_91]: It started on the roof of his apartment block in central Kiev.

1603
02:22:45,329 --> 02:22:50,532
[SPEAKER_91]: He spoke to his supporters below as security agents climbed up the stairs to arrest him.

1604
02:22:51,092 --> 02:23:03,818
[SPEAKER_91]: Then, having been detained, Saakashvili's supporters first blockaded, then hours later broke open the police van he was inside, enabling the former Georgian president to escape triumphantly.

1605
02:23:05,699 --> 02:23:08,400
[SPEAKER_45]: What happens next?

1606
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:11,282
[SPEAKER_74]: We will go now to Parliament.

1607
02:23:11,582 --> 02:23:13,043
[SPEAKER_74]: We will go to Parliament.

1608
02:23:13,103 --> 02:23:13,843
[SPEAKER_74]: What happens next?

1609
02:23:13,863 --> 02:23:20,287
[SPEAKER_74]: We will ask for impeachment of Poroshenko, who is a thief, who is mega-corrupt, who is plundering the entire Ukraine with his gang.

1610
02:23:20,387 --> 02:23:25,990
[SPEAKER_74]: We have to stop supporting him, because it's outrageous what they are up to.

1611
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:28,851
[SPEAKER_74]: And today it was a classical political arrest.

1612
02:23:28,891 --> 02:23:31,773
[SPEAKER_91]: Do you think you really have the support of the people here in your bank?

1613
02:23:31,793 --> 02:23:32,593
[SPEAKER_74]: Absolutely.

1614
02:23:32,654 --> 02:23:33,414
[SPEAKER_91]: You saw it today.

1615
02:23:33,774 --> 02:23:42,986
[SPEAKER_91]: Ukraine's Prosecutor General says Mr. Saakashvili should be detained for allegedly receiving funds from businessmen connected to the former President Viktor Yanukovych.

1616
02:23:43,527 --> 02:23:51,496
[SPEAKER_91]: Mr. Saakashvili says he's being targeted for his increasingly vocal campaign against Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko.

1617
02:23:52,077 --> 02:23:57,684
[SPEAKER_91]: It was Mr. Poroshenko who granted Mr. Saakashvili Ukrainian citizenship in 2015.

1618
02:23:58,144 --> 02:24:05,572
[SPEAKER_91]: But the relationship soured as Mr. Saakashvili accused his former friend of not being serious about tackling corruption.

1619
02:24:06,113 --> 02:24:07,434
[SPEAKER_91]: Jonah Fisher in Ukraine.

1620
02:24:08,015 --> 02:24:13,921
[SPEAKER_110]: There's been political chaos and protest in Honduras since the presidential election on November 26th.

1621
02:24:14,441 --> 02:24:27,214
[SPEAKER_110]: The opposition has now demanded a full recount of the votes, which ended up in favour of the incumbent president, Juan Orlando Hernández, after initially looking promising for the opposition candidate and former TV star Salvador Nasralla.

1622
02:24:27,734 --> 02:24:30,197
[SPEAKER_110]: Candace Peards, our America's editor, told me the latest.

1623
02:24:30,765 --> 02:24:38,050
[SPEAKER_78]: They haven't declared a winner yet and now what we're seeing is the opposition are now demanding a full recount of the vote.

1624
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:39,391
[SPEAKER_78]: Now why are they doing this?

1625
02:24:40,012 --> 02:24:53,902
[SPEAKER_78]: Earlier the electoral tribunal had agreed to a partial recount of around a third of all the ballot papers in the elections and now it looks like the opposition have taken this opportunity to extend their demand even further.

1626
02:24:54,042 --> 02:24:55,403
[SPEAKER_78]: They might have been emboldened by

1627
02:24:55,943 --> 02:24:58,644
[SPEAKER_78]: very recent, quite surprising events.

1628
02:24:59,204 --> 02:25:13,349
[SPEAKER_78]: On Monday, hundreds of members of the riot police refused to carry out orders to enforce a nighttime curfew ordered by the government to keep order after widespread street protests organized by the opposition.

1629
02:25:13,809 --> 02:25:19,551
[SPEAKER_78]: Now, the police spokesman said they didn't want to clamp down on peaceful protest.

1630
02:25:20,091 --> 02:25:29,496
[SPEAKER_78]: It's really unusual in Latin America to see ordinary voters out on the streets, as we saw on Tuesday, holding placards thanking the riot police.

1631
02:25:30,316 --> 02:25:46,104
[SPEAKER_78]: And then the opposition also had support from international observers, who've been urging the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to agree to a wider recount, arguing there'd be numerous inconsistencies, including ballot boxes that arrived opened or incomplete.

1632
02:25:46,244 --> 02:25:47,465
[SPEAKER_110]: So is it possible we could get

1633
02:25:48,205 --> 02:25:50,826
[SPEAKER_110]: a full recount or even a rerun of the election?

1634
02:25:51,766 --> 02:25:58,929
[SPEAKER_78]: That's certainly something that the opposition, Salvador Nasralla and the opposition coalition are calling for.

1635
02:25:58,989 --> 02:26:09,193
[SPEAKER_78]: They're calling now for a very wide recount, 18,000 ballot boxes, and he has already been tweeting about possibly it would be better to have a full election again.

1636
02:26:09,693 --> 02:26:14,058
[SPEAKER_110]: Candace Peart said on the news that Johnny Alliday, the French rocker, has died at the age of 74.

1637
02:26:14,098 --> 02:26:19,764
[SPEAKER_110]: He sold more than 110 million records and made 30 films.

1638
02:26:19,784 --> 02:26:23,607
[SPEAKER_110]: Yet outside the French-speaking world, he was virtually unknown.

1639
02:26:23,748 --> 02:26:25,770
[SPEAKER_110]: Emma-Jane Kirby looks back at Johnny Alliday's life.

1640
02:26:31,307 --> 02:26:35,569
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a career that spanned five decades and three generations.

1641
02:26:35,969 --> 02:26:45,532
[SPEAKER_28]: Born as plain Jean-Philippe Smet, Johnny Halliday first hit the limelight aged 16 as an Elvis wannabe who sang rock in French.

1642
02:26:46,312 --> 02:26:57,896
[SPEAKER_28]: His early concerts caused riots, but then French President Charles de Gaulle accused him of being a corrupter of youth who was spreading dangerous American values throughout France.

1643
02:27:01,284 --> 02:27:10,555
[SPEAKER_28]: Yet despite having more than 900 songs under his belt and 100 live tours, his fame never really spread beyond the French-speaking world.

1644
02:27:13,086 --> 02:27:16,728
[SPEAKER_28]: Most rock and roll stars, Johnny's life had its ups and downs.

1645
02:27:17,208 --> 02:27:28,193
[SPEAKER_28]: For nearly 50 years, France's gossip and celebrity magazines were full of the details of his three failed marriages, his tax evasion scandals and his cocaine addiction.

1646
02:27:28,833 --> 02:27:33,115
[SPEAKER_28]: But his fans remained loyal, and his concerts were always sellouts.

1647
02:27:38,297 --> 02:27:40,779
[SPEAKER_28]: Johnny Halliday announced his semi-retirement in 2009.

1648
02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:58,629
[SPEAKER_28]: France's greatest rock star said he was tired of the limelight, and he yearned to return to the days when he was just plain old Jean-Philippe Smet.

1649
02:27:59,309 --> 02:28:04,492
[SPEAKER_110]: Johnny Halliday, who has died at the age of 74, the Lycée Palace has paid tribute.

1650
02:28:04,672 --> 02:28:05,993
[SPEAKER_110]: That's it for now from the newsroom.

1651
02:28:07,974 --> 02:28:09,735
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the BBC World Service.

1652
02:28:10,035 --> 02:28:12,537
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, take a moment to listen to this.

1653
02:28:13,157 --> 02:28:14,458
[SPEAKER_27]: What intrigues us?

1654
02:28:14,658 --> 02:28:20,362
[SPEAKER_62]: Dogs have a really unique and special ability to read and understand us.

1655
02:28:20,702 --> 02:28:22,203
[SPEAKER_62]: What alters our view?

1656
02:28:22,383 --> 02:28:24,945
[SPEAKER_53]: Every time we look around we just say, it's a homeless people.

1657
02:28:25,085 --> 02:28:27,967
[SPEAKER_11]: But they have names, they have dreams and paths and everything.

1658
02:28:28,107 --> 02:28:29,888
[SPEAKER_11]: There are stories that make us wonder.

1659
02:28:30,148 --> 02:28:33,992
[SPEAKER_61]: They talk about having an intimate, not just a sexual, relationship with the robot.

1660
02:28:34,112 --> 02:28:36,894
[SPEAKER_61]: And that's hard because it's a one-way relationship.

1661
02:28:37,135 --> 02:28:38,716
[SPEAKER_61]: The machine can't love you back.

1662
02:28:38,936 --> 02:28:41,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And ones that defy all belief.

1663
02:28:41,839 --> 02:28:49,266
[SPEAKER_55]: I've found members of different communities, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, stabbed, lying on the street.

1664
02:28:49,746 --> 02:28:54,107
[SPEAKER_11]: The more we know about the world, the more we understand about ourselves.

1665
02:28:54,487 --> 02:28:57,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of us didn't really think bisexuality existed.

1666

[SPEAKER_21]: But what are Chinese people reading?

1670
02:29:16,918 --> 02:29:22,802
[SPEAKER_58]: Not only magazine, I think everything happening in China reflects the new China.

1671
02:29:23,002 --> 02:29:29,206
[SPEAKER_22]: I pretty much read every single page of the magazine.

1672
02:29:29,246 --> 02:29:35,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Join me, Xin Yuan Wang, for the face of China on the BBC World Service after the news.

[SPEAKER_88]: He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

1677
02:29:54,145 --> 02:29:55,906
[SPEAKER_88]: The decision will break with years of U.S.

1678
02:29:55,926 --> 02:30:00,368
[SPEAKER_88]: policy on the status of the disputed city, as well as the international consensus.

[SPEAKER_88]: Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban its participation in next year's Winter Olympics, following a report accusing it of systematic doping.

1680
02:30:12,033 --> 02:30:16,355
[SPEAKER_88]: The deputy speaker of the Russian parliament called the ban a humiliation and an insult.

1681
02:30:16,896 --> 02:30:23,139
[SPEAKER_88]: The foreign ministry spokesman said Russia would survive this as it had survived the world war and the collapse of the Soviet Union.

02:30:24,099 --> 02:30:28,923
[SPEAKER_88]: Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favour President Juan Orlando Hernández.

02:31:20,621 --> 02:31:27,527
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition candidate, Salvador Nasrulla, has appeared set for victory shortly after the election, when the vote count was suddenly halted.

1692
02:31:28,228 --> 02:31:32,512
[SPEAKER_88]: It sparked days of street violence, which have left at least three people dead.

1693
02:31:33,433 --> 02:31:35,294
[SPEAKER_88]: World News from the BBC.

[SPEAKER_21]: The magazine stands in China are crowded with new publications every month.

1695
02:31:44,411 --> 02:31:46,873
[SPEAKER_21]: But what are Chinese people reading and why?

1696
02:31:47,814 --> 02:31:50,676
[SPEAKER_52]: CBN Weekly, Chinese edition.

1697
02:31:50,716 --> 02:31:54,959
[SPEAKER_52]: That's the one that I read almost from day to day.

1698
02:31:55,499 --> 02:31:56,860
[SPEAKER_128]: Oh, I love this one.

1699
02:31:57,380 --> 02:31:58,121
[SPEAKER_128]: Fashion magazine.

1700
02:31:58,381 --> 02:31:59,182
[SPEAKER_128]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1701
02:31:59,242 --> 02:31:59,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Fashion.

1702
02:32:01,683 --> 02:32:05,306
[SPEAKER_22]: I pretty much read every single page of the magazine.

1703
02:32:08,058 --> 02:32:14,023
[SPEAKER_58]: Not only magazine, I think everything happening in China reflects the new China.

1704
02:32:16,405 --> 02:32:26,134
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm Xin Yuan Wang, and for the BBC World Service, I'm out on the streets of Shanghai to find out what's between the magazine covers in The Face of China.

1705
02:32:30,971 --> 02:32:39,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Now I'm in front of one of the magazine stands and on both sides there's a display of altogether around 100 different magazines.

1706
02:32:40,134 --> 02:32:48,536
[SPEAKER_21]: And on my right there's all the magazines about fashion and also the news, like News Weekly and some political reports.

1707
02:32:49,496 --> 02:32:53,979
[SPEAKER_18]: She says the best seller is always something about fashion.

1708
02:32:54,099 --> 02:32:57,061
[SPEAKER_21]: It's actually the main customer, they come from like 30 years plus.

1709
02:33:08,969 --> 02:33:11,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Nowadays young people don't buy newspapers, they use mobile phones.

1710
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:22,337
[SPEAKER_21]: So she said like definitely change a lot and before people came for newspaper and things but now once you have smartphone nobody come to newspaper and magazine, especially young people.

1711
02:33:22,357 --> 02:33:26,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Nowadays we have a lot of newspapers shut down because they can't be opened.

1712
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:36,689
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's actually a very difficult time for those physical Maxine stands because they have to close down.

1713
02:33:36,789 --> 02:33:39,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Many of them have to close down because there are no people.

1714
02:33:40,012 --> 02:33:48,019
[SPEAKER_21]: She hoped that there was some way, some solution that these very traditional physical Maxine stands will exist in Shanghai.

1715
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:52,363
[SPEAKER_21]: So is there any future for magazines in China?

1716
02:33:52,963 --> 02:34:01,129
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to talk to readers of all generations as well as the editors and journalists who are facing new challenges.

1717
02:34:01,149 --> 02:34:03,731
[SPEAKER_55]: Hello, open the door.

1718
02:34:10,225 --> 02:34:20,990
[SPEAKER_21]: I've come to visit a couple in Shanghai with a young baby, a typical middle-class family, with both parents working and facing the issues of bringing up a child in the city.

1719
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:27,033
[SPEAKER_21]: They're looking at the magazine, Nanfang Zhoumo, that's targeting their needs and interests.

1720
02:34:36,898 --> 02:34:42,401
[SPEAKER_21]: So basically this is that the topic actually is very children orientated.

1721
02:34:42,661 --> 02:34:52,027
[SPEAKER_21]: For example like this one is about second child and also the education in general and also housing is a very hot topic.

1722
02:34:52,367 --> 02:35:02,273
[SPEAKER_21]: People are concerned about where they can buy their flat or rent their flat because then that will decide whether they can send their children to the good

1723
02:35:02,653 --> 02:35:04,735
[SPEAKER_21]: primary school, middle school, etc.

1724
02:35:05,155 --> 02:35:08,618
[SPEAKER_21]: So, all in all, it's all about the next generation.

1725
02:35:08,898 --> 02:35:12,021
[SPEAKER_21]: That will be the most popular topic in Shanghai.

1726
02:35:18,446 --> 02:35:21,910
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really interesting.

1727
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:37,988
[SPEAKER_21]: Zizi told me that even strictly speaking in terms of a year's income, she don't think she really account as like middle class because middle class earn certain amount of money and not everybody can reach that amount of money.

1728
02:35:38,448 --> 02:35:48,953
[SPEAKER_21]: But more and more people, including more and more her friends, regard themselves as middle class in terms of high education received and awareness of citizenship.

1729
02:35:49,334 --> 02:35:52,355
[SPEAKER_21]: And in that perspective, they really think they are middle class.

1730
02:35:52,815 --> 02:35:59,078
[SPEAKER_21]: And for those, Maxine actually suits that purpose very well, because they will report, again, as a topic.

1731
02:36:00,339 --> 02:36:05,620
[SPEAKER_21]: about, for example, a marathon, like you train yourself and run for hours.

1732
02:36:05,960 --> 02:36:09,061
[SPEAKER_21]: That kind of thing is typical middle class behavior.

1733
02:36:09,401 --> 02:36:16,403
[SPEAKER_21]: So people would go for a run, not because they really love running, but they want to see themselves as middle class.

1734
02:36:16,523 --> 02:36:26,365
[SPEAKER_21]: And this magazine will give very in-depth discussion about the nuance between the certain kind of behavior and being middle class.

1735
02:36:31,587 --> 02:36:34,949
[SPEAKER_21]: But what about readers who haven't reached this stage of life?

1736
02:36:35,609 --> 02:36:43,413
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to talk to a different generation, the young ambitious workers in Guangzhou, one of the top business cities in the country.

1737
02:36:43,894 --> 02:36:47,516
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very energetic and very rich place.

1738
02:36:49,321 --> 02:36:59,666
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of young generation to work here and want to earn a high salary to raise themselves and have a promising future here.

1739
02:37:00,207 --> 02:37:04,809
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a place with hope and energy.

1740
02:37:06,170 --> 02:37:10,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Here, many of them are in their 20s and have no children.

1741
02:37:10,832 --> 02:37:16,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Over their busy lunch break, we asked them what they think of the family-orientated magazines.

1742
02:37:17,628 --> 02:37:20,111
[SPEAKER_128]: This is about, have a second baby, are you ready?

1743
02:37:20,131 --> 02:37:23,233
[SPEAKER_128]: I was like, I don't even have a husband, I'm not ready.

1744
02:37:23,594 --> 02:37:24,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So I won't read it.

1745
02:37:25,235 --> 02:37:30,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Nowadays, young people are prefer the online magazine or online news.

1746
02:37:30,861 --> 02:37:34,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's totally free, but the magazines, we need to pay for it.

1747
02:37:34,804 --> 02:37:39,989
[SPEAKER_08]: But the information, we can get it the same with the online magazine or online paper.

1748
02:37:41,784 --> 02:37:51,068
[SPEAKER_58]: In China, if we want to get information of some certain subject, we usually go to the cell phone.

1749
02:37:51,448 --> 02:37:54,630
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's not much interest in printed versions here.

1750
02:37:55,290 --> 02:37:56,611
[SPEAKER_21]: Everything is going online.

1751
02:37:57,311 --> 02:38:01,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Clark explains how he reads Maxine's on WeChat, the social media app.

1752
02:38:03,218 --> 02:38:20,400
[SPEAKER_52]: They have this WeChat public account where they will post, they will not post everything there, but they will select some of the key articles from that magazine on their public account and then push that for free.

1753
02:38:21,602 --> 02:38:25,327
[SPEAKER_52]: And then I realized I don't have to buy the magazine myself, I can just read through it.

1754
02:38:25,347 --> 02:38:35,401
[SPEAKER_52]: Because I don't really need to look at all of the magazines, I only need to just try to understand the key, like the whole topics.

1755
02:38:42,747 --> 02:38:43,669
[SPEAKER_21]: In Shanghai, Ms.

1756
02:38:43,689 --> 02:38:51,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Chen is the vice chief editor of CBN Weekly, a magazine that targets young business professionals like those in Guangzhou.

1757
02:38:52,902 --> 02:39:03,011
[SPEAKER_21]: She explains that her magazine must keep pace with technology and the new ways that Chinese people want to get information.

1758
02:39:03,071 --> 02:39:15,462
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course they will put more effort on the online part because of course it's very clear that if you only rely on the paper-based magazine the future will be

1759
02:39:15,802 --> 02:39:16,522
[SPEAKER_21]: not so bright.

1760
02:39:16,862 --> 02:39:26,164
[SPEAKER_21]: They think it's time to think about to keep a relationship with readers because before the main media, they just like sell the magazine and that's it.

1761
02:39:26,565 --> 02:39:32,766
[SPEAKER_21]: But now you really have to keep some two-way communication with readers so that you can keep your readers.

1762
02:39:32,866 --> 02:39:34,346
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not just the selling magazine.

1763
02:39:34,666 --> 02:39:38,287
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is probably the plan, the long-term plan.

1764
02:39:40,528 --> 02:39:44,109
[SPEAKER_21]: But anyway, it's very difficult to survive in this digital age.

1765
02:39:46,670 --> 02:39:50,152
[SPEAKER_21]: So, how has the content of magazines changed in recent years?

1766
02:39:51,132 --> 02:39:55,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Journalist Mandy Lee has worked on traditional magazines and new media.

1767
02:39:56,256 --> 02:40:00,578
[SPEAKER_21]: And she's seen a move away from areas seen as controversial in China.

1768
02:40:01,719 --> 02:40:04,141
[SPEAKER_53]: Before we graduated, it's political.

1769
02:40:04,441 --> 02:40:11,605
[SPEAKER_53]: Most of them will be about politicals and also the sensitive subjects about economy and business.

1770
02:40:16,468 --> 02:40:20,429
[SPEAKER_21]: I've come to see Mr. Zhang, a retired journalist in Shanghai.

1771
02:40:21,070 --> 02:40:28,251
[SPEAKER_21]: In his career over 30 years, he told me how he had witnessed the development of the media in China.

1772
02:40:28,792 --> 02:40:37,154
[SPEAKER_21]: He started on the magazine in a factory, which was really a propaganda for the Communist Party, as were all the publications at that time.

1773
02:40:38,186 --> 02:40:44,748
[SPEAKER_21]: During the economic reforms, he helped to set up a new magazine, but was faced with challenges.

1774
02:40:45,549 --> 02:40:49,050
[SPEAKER_21]: He was one of the co-founders of the magazine called The Bond.

1775
02:40:49,570 --> 02:41:02,155
[SPEAKER_21]: So The Bond used to be, nowadays it's more like fashion magazine, but when it's first established, it's more about political editorial, so it's focused on topics.

1776
02:41:02,575 --> 02:41:04,616
[SPEAKER_21]: And the reason he left The Bond, because

1777
02:41:05,736 --> 02:41:14,987
[SPEAKER_21]: Some political sensitive things happened and he realized maybe it's not where he can take the full social responsibility as the journalist.

1778
02:41:15,568 --> 02:41:18,492
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's the reason he left the bond.

1779
02:41:18,952 --> 02:41:22,877
[SPEAKER_21]: But Mandy believes people's attitudes have changed.

1780
02:41:23,618 --> 02:41:24,238
[SPEAKER_21]: People don't care.

1781
02:41:25,977 --> 02:41:27,538
[SPEAKER_53]: People don't care anymore.

1782
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:30,982
[SPEAKER_53]: So I think they are losing their voice.

1783
02:41:31,102 --> 02:41:36,328
[SPEAKER_53]: Also, on the other hand, people still kind of respect them, but they don't read them.

1784
02:41:36,949 --> 02:41:42,655
[SPEAKER_128]: They have a lot of types of magazines, but I don't read, like, economic magazines or political magazines.

1785
02:41:42,896 --> 02:41:43,536
[SPEAKER_128]: I think that's...

1786
02:41:44,277 --> 02:41:46,099
[SPEAKER_128]: a lot of things to know from them.

1787
02:41:46,479 --> 02:41:47,940
[SPEAKER_128]: But, you know, it's all censored.

1788
02:41:48,921 --> 02:41:55,165
[SPEAKER_128]: So I don't know how many information you can get from there or whether it's altered.

1789
02:41:55,385 --> 02:41:58,067
[SPEAKER_128]: So you have to really find out.

1790
02:41:58,468 --> 02:42:09,135
[SPEAKER_21]: So instead of relying on magazines, many Chinese professionals have been using VPNs, or virtual personal networks, to access the wider Internet.

1791
02:42:09,456 --> 02:42:12,298
[SPEAKER_58]: Basically, if I want to get some information like that,

1792
02:42:13,078 --> 02:42:15,939
[SPEAKER_58]: I will go to the Internet, I will go to Google.

1793
02:42:16,239 --> 02:42:19,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Here they can get information that's not available in China.

1794
02:42:20,180 --> 02:42:28,383
[SPEAKER_21]: However, the government is now trying to restrict the use of VPNs and it may become much more difficult in the future.

1795
02:42:29,196 --> 02:42:50,425
[SPEAKER_58]: I will skip the wall, you know the wall the Chinese government set for all the internet server so I will use some app to skip the wall and get message on internet on YouTube, on Google or something like that because it's quite fresh news and magazines

1796
02:42:51,702 --> 02:42:57,627
[SPEAKER_128]: I think it's very true because, you know, YouTube and Facebook are blocked in China, so we all have VPNs.

1797
02:42:57,927 --> 02:43:03,932
[SPEAKER_128]: We have more opportunities to know other things, to know the real other things, which is good.

1798
02:43:03,952 --> 02:43:08,396
[SPEAKER_128]: It's not changed or altered by Chinese government or other things.

1799
02:43:09,177 --> 02:43:10,318
[SPEAKER_128]: It's closer to the truth.

1800
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:28,146
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to meet Mr. Kuan, the chief editor and founder of the publication Urban China.

1801
02:43:28,926 --> 02:43:38,496
[SPEAKER_21]: He's confident that his magazine can offer a valuable resource for those living in cities and give people the chance to get involved with local issues.

1802
02:43:45,503 --> 02:43:47,344
[SPEAKER_21]: You think there must be something missing.

1803
02:43:47,704 --> 02:43:50,404
[SPEAKER_21]: There's something between the fashion and professional.

1804
02:43:50,704 --> 02:44:04,027
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's like some magazine allow people to care about the very severe, serious issues about urban China, but not necessarily to be too academic and very accessible language.

1805
02:44:04,428 --> 02:44:07,308
[SPEAKER_21]: So we should take our social responsibility.

1806
02:44:07,668 --> 02:44:12,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's talk about some hot issues, the hot topics in contemporary China.

1807
02:44:15,491 --> 02:44:19,036
[SPEAKER_21]: This one is about the urban transformation.

1808
02:44:19,357 --> 02:44:21,701
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is about social housing.

1809
02:44:21,801 --> 02:44:23,964
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're really very open-minded.

1810
02:44:24,044 --> 02:44:29,693
[SPEAKER_21]: They have no problem touching some sensitive problems of urban development.

1811
02:44:33,851 --> 02:44:43,856
[SPEAKER_71]: So actually, it's not like always about political correct or not.

1812
02:44:44,216 --> 02:44:51,220
[SPEAKER_21]: It's actually they want this magazine to represent the concern about the current problem.

1813
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:53,902
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's always problem orientated.

1814
02:44:54,202 --> 02:45:01,386
[SPEAKER_21]: For example, one of the issue talking about the Chinese style of building a city, and they criticize a lot

1815
02:45:01,766 --> 02:45:03,687
[SPEAKER_21]: because the speed is too fast.

1816
02:45:04,107 --> 02:45:10,930
[SPEAKER_21]: So as a result, many new cities become ghost cities because nobody lives there, just empty buildings.

1817
02:45:11,250 --> 02:45:15,852
[SPEAKER_21]: So they criticize a lot of the problems in the process of urbanization.

1818
02:45:16,172 --> 02:45:19,354
[SPEAKER_21]: And he thinks that's totally healthy because that is good for China.

1819
02:45:19,834 --> 02:45:21,995
[SPEAKER_21]: And he thinks the atmosphere for those

1820
02:45:22,736 --> 02:45:32,769
[SPEAKER_21]: very take the responsibility and you do your constructive criticism that is always good and is actually welcomed by the Chinese government.

1821
02:45:32,789 --> 02:45:35,753
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm with Yiming, a typical student reader.

1822
02:45:38,577 --> 02:45:46,420
[SPEAKER_21]: She has found that, for her studies, there are magazines in China which have a lot to offer.

1823
02:45:46,460 --> 02:45:53,223
[SPEAKER_21]: So she just gave me a very good example of the reading experience of the magazine called South Weekly.

1824
02:45:54,783 --> 02:46:23,410
[SPEAKER_21]: rather than just reporting the news, they will invite different specialists come from the sociology or laws to analyze the different layers of argument behind the news and actually that is very helpful for students who are interested in sociology or philosophy or laws because it shows how you can use theory and apply theory to understand the modern society.

1825
02:46:23,550 --> 02:46:30,536
[SPEAKER_21]: But she is honest about what interests her and for so many other young Chinese people.

1826
02:46:30,556 --> 02:46:34,220
[SPEAKER_21]: There's one topic which is really important to them.

1827
02:46:34,780 --> 02:46:47,632
[SPEAKER_21]: So when she came to Shanghai, then it's become mainly fashion magazine because it's really the right place to read fashion magazine because Shanghai itself is regarded as the city of fashion.

1828
02:46:48,212 --> 02:46:55,796
[SPEAKER_21]: So she think she was kind of influenced by the atmosphere of where she studied and live.

1829
02:46:56,136 --> 02:46:59,077
[SPEAKER_21]: So fashion magazine become the main one on the reading list.

1830
02:47:00,538 --> 02:47:04,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Mainland China, the market is several billion R&B.

1831
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:10,183
[SPEAKER_16]: So in terms of US dollars, one or two billion, yeah, that's the market.

1832
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:15,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Loficio is one of the leading fashion magazines in China.

1833
02:47:15,742 --> 02:47:19,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie works with a young and energetic production team.

1834
02:47:20,004 --> 02:47:30,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Ten years ago, if the magazines published stories about these big brands, readers loved to read them and they would love to buy.

1835
02:47:31,030 --> 02:47:38,014
[SPEAKER_16]: But now, the new generation readers, they are less interested in the big brands.

1836
02:47:38,294 --> 02:47:40,095
[SPEAKER_16]: They are more interested in

1837
02:47:40,915 --> 02:47:43,857
[SPEAKER_16]: the individual unique brands.

1838
02:47:44,418 --> 02:47:49,901
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's harder for us to target the right readers.

1839
02:47:50,041 --> 02:47:52,303
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's more challenging to us.

1840
02:47:52,923 --> 02:48:01,749
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that the whole society, the change of the culture, the change of the consumption habits all drive the big change.

1841
02:48:02,089 --> 02:48:07,331
[SPEAKER_16]: in terms of these publications and even the fashion industry itself.

1842
02:48:07,911 --> 02:48:13,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Also the new generation, they are from better off families.

1843
02:48:13,653 --> 02:48:16,854
[SPEAKER_16]: They have enough money, so they are well-traveled.

1844
02:48:17,274 --> 02:48:23,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of them are educated abroad, so they are very selective or picky.

1845
02:48:25,116 --> 02:48:28,038
[SPEAKER_16]: And also they want to show their individuality.

1846
02:48:28,118 --> 02:48:30,420
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't want to conform with others.

1847
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:38,486
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why they're more interested in the unique brands, not these household names.

1848
02:48:38,886 --> 02:48:49,274
[SPEAKER_16]: So to us, we have to change our editorial style and our material to tailor to their needs.

1849
02:48:49,614 --> 02:48:52,316
[SPEAKER_21]: The team are active in promoting their magazine online.

1850
02:48:52,957 --> 02:48:56,142
[SPEAKER_21]: finding innovative ways of getting their material read.

1851
02:48:56,162 --> 02:49:01,030
[SPEAKER_59]: I'm just 22, maybe I'm the youngest fashion editor.

1852
02:49:02,151 --> 02:49:05,036
[SPEAKER_59]: I think I was born to do the job.

1853
02:49:05,056 --> 02:49:06,719
[SPEAKER_115]: I think it's a wonderful job.

1854
02:49:08,236 --> 02:49:17,466
[SPEAKER_15]: They stay in the front line of the fashion industry, so they pick up the trend and the news very quickly.

1855
02:49:17,646 --> 02:49:20,809
[SPEAKER_15]: So he is the future of this business.

1856
02:49:22,972 --> 02:49:28,557
[SPEAKER_59]: We also help the local designers, not just the luxury brands.

1857
02:49:29,318 --> 02:49:36,607
[SPEAKER_59]: I sometimes, yeah, I will cooperate and promote their collections, their new collections, the local designers.

1858
02:49:37,368 --> 02:49:42,215
[SPEAKER_59]: Because we are in a fashion magazine, we can do some things to help them.

1859
02:49:43,282 --> 02:49:55,532
[SPEAKER_16]: You know that's the excitement about being in China right now because every day is different and Probably after five years there will be a big change in ten years.

1860
02:49:55,592 --> 02:49:59,135
[SPEAKER_16]: There will be a huge dramatic change So it's very exciting

1861
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:10,392
[SPEAKER_21]: I've traveled from Shanghai to Beijing to join a group of readers who want to talk to me about their reading habits.

1862
02:50:11,093 --> 02:50:14,198
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, I'm finding that things are changing.

1863
02:50:15,104 --> 02:50:23,528
[SPEAKER_38]: people have the choice of looking for all the news they need from the mobile phone.

1864
02:50:24,329 --> 02:50:29,091
[SPEAKER_38]: By using a mobile phone, you can get a lot of information that you need.

1865
02:50:29,731 --> 02:50:40,957
[SPEAKER_38]: So frankly, I don't know how the magazines or newspapers make a living in today's business environment if they want to make money.

1866
02:50:41,197 --> 02:50:46,201
[SPEAKER_21]: other family members, do they into the internet magazine or what kind of magazine?

1867
02:50:46,341 --> 02:50:53,907
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, my wife and my daughter, you know, love to buy, you know, really old fashion magazines, you know, five years ago, even 10 years ago.

1868
02:50:54,587 --> 02:51:02,954
[SPEAKER_38]: But nowadays, they just check all the information, you know, you know, words or pictures on the mobile phone.

1869
02:51:03,494 --> 02:51:07,537
[SPEAKER_03]: If I buy a physical magazine, I buy it for job.

1870
02:51:07,717 --> 02:51:11,520
[SPEAKER_03]: If I read some online magazines, I read it for fun.

1871
02:51:11,960 --> 02:51:17,544
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I will buy the Harvard Business Review for my job because I'm an HR.

1872
02:51:17,664 --> 02:51:22,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are many HR-related articles in this magazine.

1873
02:51:22,567 --> 02:51:26,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will cost about 50 RMB for one magazine.

1874
02:51:27,030 --> 02:51:29,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So these physical ones is for job.

1875
02:51:30,132 --> 02:51:39,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And for fun, I will read some articles from WeChat, you know, such like Mimeng, the biggest wanghong in China, yeah.

1876
02:51:41,118 --> 02:51:44,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Her article will publish about every day and there will

1877
02:51:45,700 --> 02:51:54,648
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe more than 1 million readers to read it every day so it is quite a popular online magazine for me.

1878
02:51:54,948 --> 02:52:02,095
[SPEAKER_21]: So she just introduced the paid magazine online so if it's like professional content people are still willing to pay even

1879
02:52:02,535 --> 02:52:08,457
[SPEAKER_21]: the one article from the one magazine, and she also mentioned there's some very popular writers.

1880
02:52:08,757 --> 02:52:22,021
[SPEAKER_21]: So in Chinese it's called Wang Hong, literally means Internet Red, which indicates that it's very popular among people, and people just follow them and got millions and millions readership of everyday articles.

1881
02:52:22,281 --> 02:52:24,602
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is, I think, daily live reading.

1882
02:52:25,482 --> 02:52:32,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Nowadays, for the young people, you know, China, we have a policy called one child only.

1883
02:52:32,884 --> 02:52:35,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's why I think I'm the one of it.

1884
02:52:36,706 --> 02:52:40,647
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's quite lonely for my daily life.

1885
02:52:41,607 --> 02:52:45,090
[SPEAKER_12]: after work or after social life.

1886
02:52:45,450 --> 02:52:57,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I'm quite lonely, so I will always check the WeChat and see some articles like the common things.

1887
02:52:57,818 --> 02:52:58,959
[SPEAKER_12]: We will discuss it.

1888
02:52:59,459 --> 02:53:03,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I think this is what we call the interaction.

1889
02:53:04,422 --> 02:53:07,044
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's more about like two-way communication.

1890
02:53:07,344 --> 02:53:15,650
[SPEAKER_21]: Traditional magazine you just read it, there's no feedback, but online you can like it or you can make your comment or even give tips.

1891
02:53:16,051 --> 02:53:25,177
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's more welcoming, encouraging readers to participate the whole process of the re-reading experience of magazine.

1892
02:53:26,118 --> 02:53:28,201
[SPEAKER_22]: On the internet, you will read all those articles.

1893
02:53:28,221 --> 02:53:33,266
[SPEAKER_22]: It's more like you're self-responsible, you're self-sponsored.

1894
02:53:33,466 --> 02:53:35,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody can express what they are thinking.

1895
02:53:36,109 --> 02:53:40,013
[SPEAKER_22]: When a magazine is printed, the writer should be more serious.

1896
02:53:40,754 --> 02:53:43,037
[SPEAKER_22]: They will be responsible to whatever they said.

1897
02:53:43,497 --> 02:53:45,200
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's very, very important.

1898
02:53:45,300 --> 02:53:48,845
[SPEAKER_22]: When you open this kind of paper magazine, you read it, it's printed.

1899
02:53:48,985 --> 02:53:50,928
[SPEAKER_22]: It cannot be cancelled.

1900
02:53:51,028 --> 02:53:52,810
[SPEAKER_22]: It cannot be, you know, drawback.

1901
02:53:53,672 --> 02:53:57,897
[SPEAKER_22]: So this writer will be really, really serious about whatever they say.

1902
02:53:58,298 --> 02:54:09,247
[SPEAKER_39]: And one of the reasons why I stopped buying magazines is because I found one magazine has 20 or 30 articles, but I can't finish it in maybe three months.

1903
02:54:09,667 --> 02:54:14,971
[SPEAKER_39]: So I want to ask the first question is, did you really read every article of every magazine?

1904
02:54:15,292 --> 02:54:16,092
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, that's it.

1905
02:54:17,133 --> 02:54:22,878
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, because I pretty much read every single page of the magazine.

1906
02:54:23,278 --> 02:54:34,369
[SPEAKER_12]: sometimes we'll buy some fashion magazines like Vogue or really as well and I will buy maybe a huge outfit maybe yeah 2020s yeah decoration

1907
02:54:39,974 --> 02:54:40,735
[SPEAKER_12]: It's quite useful.

1908
02:54:41,015 --> 02:54:50,081
[SPEAKER_12]: We put it in like a stage and we use it as a desk maybe sometimes.

1909
02:54:50,141 --> 02:54:58,166
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's a very very nice design so it's like even it's quite cheap for something really nice decoration.

1910
02:54:58,226 --> 02:54:59,447
[SPEAKER_21]: It costs money as well.

1911
02:55:04,033 --> 02:55:12,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Will magazines in China become accessories left around on coffee tables to decorate the homes of well-off families?

1912
02:55:12,903 --> 02:55:15,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Or do they have a more significant future?

1913
02:55:16,487 --> 02:55:24,857
[SPEAKER_21]: The printed versions are certainly facing many challenges, from losing readership to close scrutiny by the Chinese government.

1914
02:55:26,446 --> 02:55:30,290
[SPEAKER_21]: to find one place which is looking positively about the future.

1915
02:55:30,730 --> 02:55:40,340
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm heading to a quite suburb of Beijing to visit a very specialized coffee shop where magazines from all over the world line the shelves.

1916
02:55:41,021 --> 02:55:44,224
[SPEAKER_21]: And they are not just decoration, they are being read.

1917
02:55:51,833 --> 02:55:57,699
[SPEAKER_21]: So Mr. Yin just told me that actually there's not many places like this.

1918
02:55:57,819 --> 02:56:05,528
[SPEAKER_21]: It's quite a small number of the bookshops where you can find foreign magazines, the latest issues.

1919
02:56:06,729 --> 02:56:09,012
[SPEAKER_21]: There's several challenges, for example in China

1920
02:56:09,072 --> 02:56:15,780
[SPEAKER_21]: there's of course the limits that whether you can sell those magazines and a lot of the control of it.

1921
02:56:16,621 --> 02:56:24,611
[SPEAKER_21]: But he comes from the background of the design and publication background, so he has been in this field for more than 10 years.

1922
02:56:25,492 --> 02:56:35,822
[SPEAKER_21]: So he definitely has these links and networks which really help him to introduce these nice magazines or books for Chinese readers.

1923
02:56:36,202 --> 02:56:50,255
[SPEAKER_21]: And also the idea of this bookshop is not only for the professionals that allow them to catch up the newest trend, but also for ordinary Chinese readers that you just enter this bookshop and

1924
02:56:51,236 --> 02:56:58,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe in some ways it will improve your taste, so you have some idea of the better lifestyle.

1925
02:56:59,326 --> 02:57:01,729
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is really his wish for this workshop.

1926
02:57:07,055 --> 02:57:17,764
[SPEAKER_21]: He just told me that actually it's become the safe place for people who love paper maxing and they will come here to read paper maxing regularly.

1927
02:57:18,224 --> 02:57:26,691
[SPEAKER_21]: And some professionals, they saw that how wonderful maxing can be and he told me some of them even thinking about to

1928
02:57:28,073 --> 02:57:45,631
[SPEAKER_21]: set up their own Maxine but of course it's very difficult especially nowadays China everybody go for internet and maybe it's easier to get like first or second issue and then you just can't continue but still you think people see this place of the hope.

1929
02:57:46,212 --> 02:57:48,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me show you how wonderful Maxine can be.

1930
02:57:51,373 --> 02:57:58,491

1942
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:23,887

1947
02:59:47,515 --> 02:59:55,059
[SPEAKER_57]: We have a lot of repression, a lot of suppression, people self-censor, but people self-censor in interviews, in political comments.

1948
02:59:55,099 --> 03:00:02,883
[SPEAKER_57]: You'll go fast to jail if you criticize the government too much, if you attack Erdogan too much, you may end up in a jail.

[SPEAKER_73]: Jordan and Saudi Arabia are custodians of Islam's holy sites, and have issued strong warnings that this move could inflame the Muslim world.

03:03:48,864 --> 03:04:02,647

03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:05,480
[SPEAKER_94]: BBC News.

1999
03:05:08,660 --> 03:05:12,901
[SPEAKER_94]: Welcome to Hard Talk on the BBC World Service with me, Stephen Sacker.

2000
03:05:13,061 --> 03:05:16,961
[SPEAKER_94]: My guest today is one of the most acclaimed novelists in the world today.

2001
03:05:17,482 --> 03:05:37,585
[SPEAKER_94]: Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk has perfected the trick of rooting his stories deep in the history, culture, and geography of his native Turkey, in particular, his beloved home city of Istanbul, but giving them a humanity, depth, and resonance which strikes a chord with readers all over the world.

2002
03:05:38,045 --> 03:05:40,726
[SPEAKER_94]: His novels are translated into scores of languages.

2003
03:05:40,806 --> 03:05:44,768
[SPEAKER_94]: He's been bestowed with a glittering array of international literary prizes.

2004
03:05:45,168 --> 03:05:48,790
[SPEAKER_94]: But still he lives in the same neighborhood in which he was born.

2005
03:05:49,270 --> 03:05:52,172
[SPEAKER_94]: But life hasn't always been easy for him in Turkey.

2006
03:05:52,592 --> 03:05:59,475
[SPEAKER_94]: After one outburst against the government in 2005, he received death threats and he still appears in public with a bodyguard.

2007
03:05:59,935 --> 03:06:03,898
[SPEAKER_94]: And the pressure on writers has increased in Turkey.

2008
03:06:04,258 --> 03:06:13,806
[SPEAKER_94]: President Erdogan's government has locked up scores of writers, academics and journalists as politics has become more polarised and the state more repressive.

2009
03:06:14,106 --> 03:06:26,436
[SPEAKER_94]: The constant tension between East and West secularism and religiosity, liberalism and authoritarianism has put enormous pressure on Turkey's most prominent creative voices.

2010
03:06:26,876 --> 03:06:29,198
[SPEAKER_94]: So how has Orhan Pamuk responded?

2011
03:06:29,738 --> 03:06:32,260
[SPEAKER_94]: Well, I'm delighted to say he's with me now.

2012
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:33,921
[SPEAKER_94]: Welcome to Hard Talk.

2013
03:06:34,121 --> 03:06:34,982
[SPEAKER_94]: Very pleased to be here.

2014
03:06:35,522 --> 03:06:42,046
[SPEAKER_94]: I want to start with the book, the novel that's just been published in English, The Red-Haired Woman, your latest.

2015
03:06:42,107 --> 03:06:48,231
[SPEAKER_94]: It is built around relationships between fathers and sons.

2016
03:06:48,391 --> 03:06:51,473
[SPEAKER_94]: And I just wonder why you were so drawn to that theme.

2017
03:06:51,833 --> 03:07:03,441
[SPEAKER_57]: In 1988, I was finishing one of my novels during summer, and in the land next to me, an oldish man and his disciple started digging a well.

2018
03:07:03,821 --> 03:07:06,223
[SPEAKER_57]: And I was writing my novel and paying attention to them.

2019
03:07:06,603 --> 03:07:09,465
[SPEAKER_57]: After a while, they asked, sir, can we have some water?

2020
03:07:09,805 --> 03:07:11,026
[SPEAKER_57]: Can we have some electricity?

2021
03:07:11,246 --> 03:07:12,727
[SPEAKER_57]: This sort of relation developed.

2022
03:07:13,307 --> 03:07:17,210
[SPEAKER_57]: And in the end, before they left, I asked them to do an interview.

2023
03:07:17,230 --> 03:07:18,891
[SPEAKER_57]: That's how sometimes I operate.

2024
03:07:19,151 --> 03:07:22,392
[SPEAKER_57]: But what stayed with me was two things, actually.

2025
03:07:23,232 --> 03:07:30,335
[SPEAKER_57]: The father-like, older, traditional verdigr, and they were digging a well with their own hands, using an axe.

2026
03:07:30,355 --> 03:07:32,575
[SPEAKER_94]: So he was like the master well digger.

2027
03:07:32,615 --> 03:07:34,236
[SPEAKER_57]: He was a master well digger.

2028
03:07:34,716 --> 03:07:39,118
[SPEAKER_57]: It's something that we have in Istanbul since Byzantium.

2029
03:07:39,498 --> 03:07:43,559
[SPEAKER_57]: Sometimes people find Byzantium coins in old wells in Istanbul.

2030
03:07:43,879 --> 03:07:46,040
[SPEAKER_57]: So they were following this tradition.

2031
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:50,944
[SPEAKER_57]: as the tradition was coming to an end, like many, many things I have seen in my life.

2032
03:07:51,484 --> 03:08:06,616
[SPEAKER_57]: So, and what I observed was this, that the master, old Veldiger, was shouting and shouting at the boy, and sometimes teaching him things, ordering him things, in a very strong, I would say, authoritarian voice.

2033
03:08:06,776 --> 03:08:08,677
[SPEAKER_57]: So, we approached the novel fast.

2034
03:08:08,978 --> 03:08:13,381
[SPEAKER_57]: At that time, I didn't think it was, it was rough, hard, cruel, a cruel father, I thought.

2035
03:08:13,841 --> 03:08:14,061
[SPEAKER_57]: But,

2036
03:08:14,882 --> 03:08:18,486
[SPEAKER_57]: Contrary, I also paid attention to their daily lives.

2037
03:08:18,586 --> 03:08:30,280
[SPEAKER_57]: They had a portable TV as in the novel, they built a tent as in the novel, but the fatherly figure was both scolding, angry, cruel, authoritarian, but

2038
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:38,986
[SPEAKER_57]: at times, after hours, after when the work is finished, very tender, very attentive, very elegant to the son.

2039
03:08:39,407 --> 03:08:50,775
[SPEAKER_57]: And this left a mark on me because perhaps I was raised with an absent father, a father who never scolded me, who was never a Freudian, so to speak, father to me.

2040
03:08:50,915 --> 03:08:51,736
[SPEAKER_57]: And why was that?

2041
03:08:51,816 --> 03:09:08,688
[SPEAKER_94]: because it did strike me from the very beginning knowing a little about your life story that when you address this issue of fathers and sons the balance between sort of being the guide and the authority figure but also the caring and loving figure and it was obvious that the son liked him in the end

2042
03:09:08,768 --> 03:09:18,440
[SPEAKER_94]: Indeed, but you didn't have that because your father, as I understand it, he quit the family home in Istanbul for a long period to go and try and find his writer's voice.

2043
03:09:18,500 --> 03:09:19,241
[SPEAKER_57]: He would disappear for a while.

2044
03:09:19,281 --> 03:09:19,701
[SPEAKER_57]: He went to Paris.

2045
03:09:19,721 --> 03:09:27,090
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, he went to Paris following footsteps of Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris, hotels, he wrote diaries which he gave me.

2046
03:09:27,331 --> 03:09:28,232
[SPEAKER_57]: Did you feel betrayed?

2047
03:09:28,612 --> 03:09:31,834
[SPEAKER_57]: No, and when you're a child, you don't feel betrayed.

2048
03:09:32,134 --> 03:09:43,842
[SPEAKER_57]: Also, since my father was not a Freudian father, a father that perhaps Baudelaire would have hated, oppressing his son, he always said, I'm your best friend.

2049
03:09:44,422 --> 03:09:50,128
[SPEAKER_57]: And, in fact, my Freudian father may be my brother who taught me things, who was stronger.

2050
03:09:50,408 --> 03:09:58,917
[SPEAKER_57]: My father always had fun with us, and he treated us as if we are me and my brother geniuses, and never suppressed us.

2051
03:09:59,458 --> 03:10:04,643
[SPEAKER_57]: While, on the other hand, this other father was more attentive to the boy than my father.

2052
03:10:04,843 --> 03:10:21,644
[SPEAKER_94]: See, your book raises this fascinating question about the way in which individuals develop, the balance between being taught and disciplined and finding your own path, your own identity and individual personality.

2053
03:10:22,384 --> 03:10:24,086
[SPEAKER_94]: You seem to suggest that if

2054
03:10:24,927 --> 03:10:31,130
[SPEAKER_94]: The character in the book, Jem, had had an active father throughout his life.

2055
03:10:31,651 --> 03:10:35,853
[SPEAKER_94]: He might have been different and he might actually have struggled to find his own voice more.

2056
03:10:35,953 --> 03:10:38,194
[SPEAKER_94]: And I wonder if you feel that about your very self.

2057
03:10:39,175 --> 03:10:52,602
[SPEAKER_57]: I was influenced by my father first because he had a good library when he was continuously reading books but never telling me that you have to read this, you have to read that, just being an example without doing anything.

2058
03:10:53,242 --> 03:11:10,505
[SPEAKER_57]: And also, my father's, this is more important, my father's heroes were not, as in most of the time, as in Turkey, soldiers, police, religious notables, political notables, statemen, but my father's heroes were Jean Paul Sartre and Albert Camus or others.

2059
03:11:11,025 --> 03:11:20,127
[SPEAKER_57]: other fashionable but deep philosophical authors of the time and I thought I have to be like that but he never said to me you have to be like that.

2060
03:11:20,147 --> 03:11:34,210
[SPEAKER_94]: It seems to me all Orhan Pamuk novels work on many different levels and many of them are somewhat allegorical and it seems to me this relationship between the well digger and his apprentice who sees him as a father figure for the absent father that he never really had

2061
03:11:34,970 --> 03:11:46,977
[SPEAKER_94]: It is also an allegory, it seems, for Turkey and a desire in Turkey to look up to a figure of authority and the balance between individualism and authoritarianism in your country.

2062
03:11:47,057 --> 03:11:53,120
[SPEAKER_94]: And today you have President Erdogan, who perhaps would like to see himself as the father of the nation.

2063
03:11:53,440 --> 03:11:56,562
[SPEAKER_94]: Was that in your mind as you wrote this book about fathers?

2064
03:11:56,682 --> 03:12:04,325
[SPEAKER_57]: At the beginning, it was not in my mind that this story of fathers and sons stayed with me many, many years.

2065
03:12:04,706 --> 03:12:09,848
[SPEAKER_57]: Then I thought about it, and I have, I must confess, projects like that all around me.

2066
03:12:10,288 --> 03:12:17,012
[SPEAKER_57]: I did the interview, someone typed it up, and I carried it with me as I do, even in my travels, thinking what to do with it.

2067
03:12:17,732 --> 03:12:37,045
[SPEAKER_57]: Then, after a while, I decided to write a book comparing Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, which is about killing the father without knowing it, and Firdevsi, the famous, the most distinguished Persian classic, which also influenced the whole Ottoman Empire.

2068
03:12:37,446 --> 03:12:40,448
[SPEAKER_57]: Firdevsi is called Book of Kings, Shahnameh.

2069
03:12:41,548 --> 03:12:54,074
[SPEAKER_57]: which is a sea of stories, in which there is one particular story, Ruslam and Sohrab, which almost mirror images, mirror reflects Oedipus and his father.

2070
03:12:54,094 --> 03:13:01,798
[SPEAKER_94]: You have a Western classic sort of myth, which is the son killing the father by accident, and then you have an Eastern Persian

2071
03:13:02,458 --> 03:13:08,823
[SPEAKER_94]: similarly, a sort of mythical story in which in the end a father kills a son.

2072
03:13:08,843 --> 03:13:26,395
[SPEAKER_94]: Would it be right to say that what you portray is, and again a lot of allegory is involved, but you use these two myths, one that comes classically from the West, one that comes from Persia and the East, you show the way that both play out in this story of the characters in your book.

2073
03:13:27,315 --> 03:13:38,503
[SPEAKER_94]: And in essence, what you seem to be saying is that Turkey remains pulled in these different directions, Western tradition, Eastern tradition, somehow finding a path between the two.

2074
03:13:38,864 --> 03:13:52,574
[SPEAKER_94]: But is it your feeling that right now, the Eastern tradition, to use the allegories, the father kills the son, the authority figure is the survivor, is that your feeling about Turkey today?

2075
03:13:53,694 --> 03:13:59,396
[SPEAKER_57]: Now, to answer your previous question, where you said, is this an accident, coincidence, that you wrote this?

2076
03:13:59,496 --> 03:13:59,696
[SPEAKER_57]: No.

2077
03:14:00,157 --> 03:14:01,297
[SPEAKER_57]: The story stayed with me.

2078
03:14:01,577 --> 03:14:13,422
[SPEAKER_57]: But I thought, my God, then associating the father who kills his son, then I can also write this book in such a way that alludes to what's happening in Turkey.

2079
03:14:13,762 --> 03:14:17,403
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, Turkey is increasingly getting authoritarian.

2080
03:14:17,883 --> 03:14:19,184
[SPEAKER_57]: Though I had this story

2081
03:14:19,924 --> 03:14:26,511
[SPEAKER_57]: the well-digger and his disciple, a desire to compare Sophocles and Ferdowsi.

2082
03:14:26,851 --> 03:14:42,347
[SPEAKER_57]: But yes, in the last two years, when I was busy with this book, I was thinking also, I am alluding and writing almost a fictional inquiry into the roots of Middle Eastern, Asian, Muslim authoritarianism.

2083
03:14:42,787 --> 03:15:01,221
[SPEAKER_94]: Orhan Pamuk, let's be honest, do you have to write in this form of allegory and almost code, because if you wrote directly about what you see happening in Turkey today, you would run the risk of, frankly, censorship, repression, and as we've seen with some writers, even imprisonment.

2084
03:15:01,361 --> 03:15:02,102
[SPEAKER_57]: Good question.

2085
03:15:02,322 --> 03:15:09,728
[SPEAKER_57]: I never had, even in this horrible state that we are politically in, and maybe I'll explain why horrible, I'm calling it horrible,

2086
03:15:10,709 --> 03:15:29,622
[SPEAKER_57]: You know, everyone knows that some 15 months ago there was a horrible attempt to do a military coup, then after that came a purge, and during the purge 130,000 people were fired from their jobs, and these people cannot go back to their work, and some of them even cannot work in private business.

2087
03:15:30,082 --> 03:15:34,564
[SPEAKER_94]: have hundreds of journalists, writers, academics locked up.

2088
03:15:35,024 --> 03:15:46,648
[SPEAKER_57]: And 50,000 people are jailed and the government needs more prisons and they're announcing their thing and around 180 or 70 journalists are in jail.

2089
03:15:46,668 --> 03:15:50,889
[SPEAKER_57]: This is the situation of the country and I'm writing my novel in this situation.

2090
03:15:51,129 --> 03:15:52,730
[SPEAKER_57]: But even in this situation

2091
03:15:53,190 --> 03:15:56,573
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't think I will ever have a problem with any novel that I want.

2092
03:15:56,833 --> 03:16:00,136
[SPEAKER_57]: This never happened to me in Turkey, nor to anyone.

2093
03:16:00,677 --> 03:16:02,338
[SPEAKER_57]: But you will have... Why is that?

2094
03:16:02,418 --> 03:16:03,960
[SPEAKER_57]: Is it because you self-censor?

2095
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:05,541
[SPEAKER_94]: Is it because you are so careful?

2096
03:16:11,306 --> 03:16:23,011
[SPEAKER_94]: selecting your subject matter, your characters and your words with a knowledge of how to sort of send messages without upsetting the system.

2097
03:16:23,031 --> 03:16:23,571
[SPEAKER_57]: No, it's not.

2098
03:16:23,931 --> 03:16:30,714
[SPEAKER_57]: If I want to send messages like that, as we are going to do now, I am always outspoken in my interviews.

2099
03:16:30,774 --> 03:16:39,457
[SPEAKER_57]: And when we said 170 journalists are in jail, some of them my friends, and they are also novelists.

2100
03:16:40,137 --> 03:16:43,518
[SPEAKER_57]: But they are not in jail for writing their novels.

2101
03:16:43,859 --> 03:16:46,820
[SPEAKER_57]: They're in jail for making political commentary.

2102
03:16:47,260 --> 03:17:00,005
[SPEAKER_57]: Writing novels, say, in Stalin's time in Russia, we have a lot of repression, a lot of suppression, people self-censor, but people self-censor in interviews, in political comments.

2103
03:17:00,045 --> 03:17:07,768
[SPEAKER_57]: You'll go fast to jail if you criticize the government too much, if you attack Erdogan too much, you may end up in a jail.

2104
03:17:08,108 --> 03:17:12,311
[SPEAKER_57]: But I never intend to write a novel attacking a president.

2105
03:17:13,332 --> 03:17:16,094
[SPEAKER_57]: I never wrote actuality, so to speak.

2106
03:17:16,675 --> 03:17:21,198
[SPEAKER_94]: So in no sense do you feel creatively paralyzed by the current situation?

2107
03:17:21,298 --> 03:17:23,100
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm paralyzed, if the word is right.

2108
03:17:23,260 --> 03:17:26,883
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm repressed, angry, confused.

2109
03:17:26,983 --> 03:17:30,446
[SPEAKER_57]: Sometimes I feel guilty because I'm out.

2110
03:17:30,526 --> 03:17:31,967
[SPEAKER_57]: Sometimes I feel angry.

2111
03:17:32,007 --> 03:17:33,188
[SPEAKER_57]: I have to do more.

2112
03:17:33,568 --> 03:17:35,950
[SPEAKER_57]: Sometimes... Do you actually literally feel guilty that

2113
03:17:35,990 --> 03:17:39,712
[SPEAKER_94]: that you are free when some of your writer colleagues are in prison.

2114
03:17:39,852 --> 03:17:46,837
[SPEAKER_57]: Dostoevsky said that we are responsible for everything, you know, and I think this is the moral writerly thing.

2115
03:17:47,277 --> 03:17:48,057
[SPEAKER_57]: And then what do you do?

2116
03:17:48,098 --> 03:17:51,059
[SPEAKER_57]: You look at what the other writers doing in people.

2117
03:17:51,380 --> 03:17:56,523
[SPEAKER_57]: So there, for example, going to courts, the doors of the courts, or backing, or

2118
03:17:57,143 --> 03:18:01,966
[SPEAKER_57]: I also did, for example, there is this prominent intellectual, Murat Belget, whom I respect.

2119
03:18:02,226 --> 03:18:03,727
[SPEAKER_57]: He had a case, so I went there.

2120
03:18:03,747 --> 03:18:06,948
[SPEAKER_57]: You know, prominent Pamuk is there, so it makes a difference.

2121
03:18:07,229 --> 03:18:09,990
[SPEAKER_57]: But in the end, this is... Let me tell you this.

2122
03:18:10,250 --> 03:18:18,515
[SPEAKER_57]: The biggest Turkish newspaper, just before the referendum we had, I think in March or April, asked to do an interview with me.

2123
03:18:18,555 --> 03:18:20,255
[SPEAKER_57]: Now, I was very happy.

2124
03:18:20,356 --> 03:18:24,478
[SPEAKER_57]: This is the biggest Turkish newspaper, and they're going to publish my views, and I'm going to say

2125
03:18:25,178 --> 03:18:27,718
[SPEAKER_57]: no to the referendum, no to Erdogan.

2126
03:18:27,819 --> 03:18:28,259
[SPEAKER_57]: Very happy.

2127
03:18:28,599 --> 03:18:37,420
[SPEAKER_57]: We did a nice interview, but then just before the interview, the editor-in-chief, who is a sort of a friend, called me to say, I'm sorry, we can't publish this.

2128
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:41,081
[SPEAKER_57]: And really, I cannot accuse the editor too much.

2129
03:18:41,381 --> 03:18:42,581
[SPEAKER_57]: They're pressured so much.

2130
03:18:42,801 --> 03:18:44,381
[SPEAKER_57]: And in the end, they're all my friends.

2131
03:18:44,722 --> 03:18:46,422
[SPEAKER_57]: We are in the same atmosphere.

2132
03:18:46,762 --> 03:18:49,542
[SPEAKER_57]: And I couldn't address my Turkish readers.

2133
03:18:50,022 --> 03:18:52,363
[SPEAKER_94]: Therefore, what fascinates me is that you

2134
03:18:53,283 --> 03:19:09,182
[SPEAKER_94]: This atmosphere you talk about is so constraining when it comes to your public voice as a campaigner as a man who cares about your your national life And yet you're telling me that all of those constraints the anger that you feel the guilt that you feel doesn't affect

2135
03:19:09,582 --> 03:19:23,434
[SPEAKER_94]: you when you go to your writing room, wherever it is, I know it's in Istanbul, it's in the building that you've occupied for a long time, you go to your writing room and you can shed all of that frustration and that anger and that feeling of constraint and write as free as a bird?

2136
03:19:23,855 --> 03:19:33,083
[SPEAKER_57]: Not as free as a bird, but let me tell you what the products of this repressive authoritarian air to a writer who is more concerned about the beauty.

2137
03:19:33,843 --> 03:19:39,786
[SPEAKER_57]: First, you shouldn't read newspapers till 2 o'clock because it spoils your day, you get angry.

2138
03:19:40,606 --> 03:19:46,209
[SPEAKER_57]: Second, this kind of atmosphere of fear and repression makes me work harder.

2139
03:19:46,949 --> 03:19:55,733
[SPEAKER_57]: I work harder, just perhaps like in my early years when my family didn't want me a writer and they all accused of me, maybe you're a bohemian, what?

2140
03:19:56,653 --> 03:20:00,955
[SPEAKER_57]: I worked so hard in these years because I felt guilty about something.

2141
03:20:01,375 --> 03:20:06,181
[SPEAKER_57]: Again, in the last 15, 16 months, I'm working a lot.

2142
03:20:06,361 --> 03:20:06,681
[SPEAKER_57]: Why?

2143
03:20:06,862 --> 03:20:08,544
[SPEAKER_57]: Perhaps to avoid these problems.

2144
03:20:08,804 --> 03:20:17,073
[SPEAKER_57]: And also, if you write well, even if you're living in a terribly undemocratic, threatening, menacing situation, you feel happy.

2145
03:20:17,454 --> 03:20:21,078
[SPEAKER_94]: Could you write your books anywhere else but Istanbul?

2146
03:20:21,398 --> 03:20:21,778
[SPEAKER_57]: I can.

2147
03:20:21,959 --> 03:20:22,499
[SPEAKER_57]: I did that.

2148
03:20:22,599 --> 03:20:25,462
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm teaching at Columbia University one semester each year.

2149
03:20:25,662 --> 03:20:33,630
[SPEAKER_57]: I wrote there and there was a time that I was, remember we also did an interview ten years ago, I was almost a semi-exile.

2150
03:20:33,690 --> 03:20:40,456
[SPEAKER_94]: You ran into a lot of problems for a while because of things you'd said which were relevant to both the Armenia and Kurdish issues.

2151
03:20:41,617 --> 03:20:44,098
[SPEAKER_94]: The Turkish government sought to charge you for a while.

2152
03:20:44,158 --> 03:20:45,039
[SPEAKER_94]: You had to leave the country.

2153
03:20:45,359 --> 03:20:50,501
[SPEAKER_94]: But it seems to me you always go, in the end, you always go home for creative inspiration.

2154
03:20:50,661 --> 03:20:50,841
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2155
03:20:51,041 --> 03:20:57,704
[SPEAKER_57]: Not only that, I also don't want to go to Europe or America and criticize it from distance.

2156
03:20:57,784 --> 03:20:58,544
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't want that.

2157
03:20:58,844 --> 03:21:00,225
[SPEAKER_57]: And also there is a reality.

2158
03:21:00,585 --> 03:21:03,346
[SPEAKER_57]: a reality that feeds my optimism.

2159
03:21:03,386 --> 03:21:05,807
[SPEAKER_57]: I'll tell you about it perhaps.

2160
03:21:06,107 --> 03:21:11,629
[SPEAKER_57]: Don't forget that Erdogan's bloc's votes are going down, and the opposition got 49%.

2161
03:21:12,489 --> 03:21:18,711
[SPEAKER_57]: I am optimistic about the situation, not because there is so much repression, so much repression.

2162
03:21:19,191 --> 03:21:28,214
[SPEAKER_57]: Also, in the last referendum, I think the referendum was unfair, that is, there was unfair government propaganda.

2163
03:21:28,654 --> 03:21:33,439
[SPEAKER_57]: In a way, they were taking our tax money and making propaganda for their party.

2164
03:21:33,820 --> 03:21:36,422
[SPEAKER_57]: But in the end, the results were objective.

2165
03:21:37,103 --> 03:21:40,527
[SPEAKER_57]: Though it was unfair, the result was objective.

2166
03:21:40,987 --> 03:21:44,571
[SPEAKER_57]: And if they continue to keep the voting ballot there, I'm there.

2167
03:21:44,691 --> 03:21:45,212
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm going to come.

2168
03:21:45,432 --> 03:21:46,233
[SPEAKER_57]: I'll be part of it.

2169
03:21:46,373 --> 03:21:47,494
[SPEAKER_57]: This is how I think.

2170
03:21:48,497 --> 03:21:58,525
[SPEAKER_94]: Let me get back to one aspect of this book, The Red-Haired Woman, that again just strikes me as very relevant to your own place in Turkey.

2171
03:21:59,345 --> 03:22:10,334
[SPEAKER_94]: The key relationship really in the book is between Mahmut the welder, the master welder, and Cem, the assistant who's a student and who comes from a westernized family.

2172
03:22:10,394 --> 03:22:15,538
[SPEAKER_94]: His father's a leftist and he goes to university and he becomes a property developer.

2173
03:22:15,798 --> 03:22:23,868
[SPEAKER_94]: So you've got East and you've got tradition juxtaposed with a Western mentality and individualistic liberal sort of background.

2174
03:22:24,669 --> 03:22:34,102
[SPEAKER_94]: Most people would assume that you yourself, coming from an upper middle class family, as you say, spending time in America, an acclaimed writer, a secularist and a

2175
03:22:34,923 --> 03:22:36,885
[SPEAKER_94]: you know, a modernist in Turkey.

2176
03:22:37,186 --> 03:22:41,091
[SPEAKER_94]: Most would assume that you identify completely with the Western tradition in Turkey.

2177
03:22:41,111 --> 03:22:41,472
[SPEAKER_94]: I do.

2178
03:22:41,792 --> 03:22:42,093
[SPEAKER_94]: Do you?

2179
03:22:42,213 --> 03:22:47,781
[SPEAKER_94]: Because the implication of the book is that Turkey draws from all of its history and culture and its different traditions.

2180
03:22:47,801 --> 03:22:49,063
[SPEAKER_94]: So I wonder what you draw

2181
03:22:49,583 --> 03:22:50,424
[SPEAKER_94]: from tradition.

2182
03:22:50,764 --> 03:22:54,869
[SPEAKER_57]: I identify, I believe in Western political values.

2183
03:22:54,909 --> 03:22:55,469
[SPEAKER_57]: What are they?

2184
03:22:56,150 --> 03:23:02,697
[SPEAKER_57]: In the end, it's represented by French Revolution slogan, Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.

2185
03:23:03,978 --> 03:23:05,980
[SPEAKER_57]: In Turkey, we lack Liberté.

2186
03:23:06,861 --> 03:23:19,030
[SPEAKER_57]: And some people even claim that in pro-government newspapers they are saying, well, our democracy is not European democracy, we are inventing Turkish democracy, let me add.

2187
03:23:20,231 --> 03:23:24,494
[SPEAKER_57]: It seems that they're trying to invent a democracy without free speech.

2188
03:23:24,555 --> 03:23:26,716
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't think it will work, but I'm there.

2189
03:23:26,936 --> 03:23:32,701
[SPEAKER_57]: I am at least saying this to you, to other journalists in Turkey, outside of Turkey.

2190
03:23:32,961 --> 03:23:35,603
[SPEAKER_57]: In Turkey they don't print, but they listen somehow.

2191
03:23:35,923 --> 03:23:37,303
[SPEAKER_94]: Let me talk to you about Istanbul.

2192
03:23:38,023 --> 03:23:45,945
[SPEAKER_94]: Again, it's almost like it's a character in the book because you describe evocatively how Istanbul changes over 40 years.

2193
03:23:45,965 --> 03:23:50,106
[SPEAKER_94]: You know, where they dig the well in the first place is a little village outside the city.

2194
03:23:50,146 --> 03:23:51,966
[SPEAKER_94]: By the end of the book, it's just another suburb.

2195
03:23:51,986 --> 03:23:52,867
[SPEAKER_94]: Swallowed by the city.

2196
03:23:52,947 --> 03:23:58,608
[SPEAKER_94]: Sucked up by the city with its industrial zones and its high-rises and its condos and everything else.

2197
03:24:00,030 --> 03:24:06,093
[SPEAKER_94]: Has the change in Istanbul changed the people and the character of the city?

2198
03:24:06,113 --> 03:24:06,673
[SPEAKER_57]: Good question.

2199
03:24:06,734 --> 03:24:17,659
[SPEAKER_57]: OK, first, the change, and this is Erdogan's success, the change in last 15 years is bigger than the change in my first 50 years of my life.

2200
03:24:18,179 --> 03:24:28,325
[SPEAKER_57]: That is, I also want to argue, especially to my Western journalist friend, key to his success, as much as religion is his success,

2201
03:24:29,185 --> 03:24:33,526
[SPEAKER_57]: But on the other hand, this party is saying they're conservative, and they're not.

2202
03:24:33,746 --> 03:24:38,127
[SPEAKER_57]: And besides, the religious buildings and mosques, they're not conserving anything, they're destroying everything.

2203
03:24:38,567 --> 03:24:50,430
[SPEAKER_57]: The city had turned out to be a sea of baton, and I'd love to ask them, well, you were conservatives, and it's not only religious buildings that should be preserved.

2204
03:24:50,630 --> 03:24:53,651
[SPEAKER_57]: Where is the old Istanbul you were so lovingly talking about?

2205
03:24:54,112 --> 03:25:07,808
[SPEAKER_57]: There is also, this book is going into that, money and politics combined in construction businesses, and of course leading party, ruling party, people who are close around this benefit from these.

2206
03:25:09,390 --> 03:25:11,211
[SPEAKER_94]: Do you feel it's still your city?

2207
03:25:11,231 --> 03:25:12,491
[SPEAKER_94]: It is.

2208
03:25:12,711 --> 03:25:13,551
[SPEAKER_57]: It's geographically.

2209
03:25:13,571 --> 03:25:14,612
[SPEAKER_57]: It's my city.

2210
03:25:15,012 --> 03:25:16,632
[SPEAKER_57]: I am looking at its entrance.

2211
03:25:16,752 --> 03:25:17,693
[SPEAKER_57]: I have a great view.

2212
03:25:18,293 --> 03:25:19,393
[SPEAKER_57]: It's changing, yes.

2213
03:25:20,273 --> 03:25:22,634
[SPEAKER_57]: The hills overlooking Bosphorus, I see that now.

2214
03:25:22,754 --> 03:25:27,016
[SPEAKER_57]: Behind them, they are preserving at least the hills overlooking Bosphorus, the gardens.

2215
03:25:27,256 --> 03:25:31,377
[SPEAKER_57]: But behind them, all the high-rises are grazing there, and it's changing.

2216
03:25:31,697 --> 03:25:33,480
[SPEAKER_57]: But I cannot say that it's not my city.

2217
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:42,232
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, also it's a self-imposed ethical mission that I don't want to be a nostalgic middle-class Turkish westernized secular.

2218
03:25:43,053 --> 03:25:45,697
[SPEAKER_57]: They only look at the newcomers, immigrants.

2219
03:25:46,858 --> 03:25:47,639
[SPEAKER_57]: you're destroying.

2220
03:25:48,379 --> 03:25:49,740
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't want to even see you.

2221
03:25:50,141 --> 03:25:50,461
[SPEAKER_57]: Why?

2222
03:25:50,761 --> 03:25:55,645
[SPEAKER_57]: Just like in Germany, they need labour and also they look down upon them.

2223
03:25:56,086 --> 03:26:00,789
[SPEAKER_57]: From the beginning, I didn't want to belong to my class.

2224
03:26:01,150 --> 03:26:07,174
[SPEAKER_57]: I betrayed my class because I want to see the totality of the nation in an ethical way.

2225
03:26:07,234 --> 03:26:09,896
[SPEAKER_94]: But only somebody of your class could say that sort of thing.

2226
03:26:09,917 --> 03:26:10,237
[SPEAKER_94]: I mean,

2227
03:26:10,677 --> 03:26:18,263
[SPEAKER_94]: That is the irony of being so full of self-awareness and education that you can talk about not wanting to be of your class.

2228
03:26:18,303 --> 03:26:19,964
[SPEAKER_94]: You are quintessentially of your class.

2229
03:26:20,224 --> 03:26:28,630
[SPEAKER_94]: And that's the problem, perhaps, for some people in Turkey, that however hard you try, you cannot help but be what you are, which is a member of the elite.

2230
03:26:29,531 --> 03:26:38,318
[SPEAKER_57]: It started with Snow that, in that book, 65% of Turkey's population has not political, some kind of headgear, headscarf.

2231
03:26:39,138 --> 03:26:44,679
[SPEAKER_57]: And even in early 2000s, they did not allow these people to universities.

2232
03:26:45,139 --> 03:26:49,260
[SPEAKER_57]: And then they thought the secular parties, they would get votes from the people.

2233
03:26:49,681 --> 03:26:57,762
[SPEAKER_57]: They paid way for the success of Erdogan's party, for their cruel, authoritarian attitudes.

2234
03:26:57,842 --> 03:27:01,743
[SPEAKER_57]: Now, Erdogan is even more, getting even more authoritarian now.

2235
03:27:02,183 --> 03:27:08,445
[SPEAKER_57]: But whenever, I sometimes argue, whenever these two sides clash, I can find a space in between

2236
03:27:08,725 --> 03:27:11,506
[SPEAKER_57]: talk but if they're happy together I'm afraid.

2237
03:27:11,526 --> 03:27:14,788
[SPEAKER_57]: Are you happy in Turkey today?

2238
03:27:15,248 --> 03:27:27,875
[SPEAKER_57]: I am a happy novelist but I can first never be happy in life that when I'm too happy I begin sleeping you know I need to running around fight with some people I have ideas I have projects that to be realized

2239
03:27:28,575 --> 03:27:28,956
[SPEAKER_57]: I am.

2240
03:27:29,276 --> 03:27:32,358
[SPEAKER_57]: I will be even unhappier is the right answer.

2241
03:27:32,698 --> 03:27:36,961
[SPEAKER_57]: That I may not be happy, but I will be even unhappier outside of Turkey.

2242
03:27:37,401 --> 03:27:43,926
[SPEAKER_57]: If Turkey had a decent European democracy, I would be very happy, no matter where I am.

2243
03:27:44,306 --> 03:27:49,850
[SPEAKER_57]: Unfortunately, it seems that we are not having it, and we are not going to have it for quite a long time.

2244
03:27:50,130 --> 03:27:59,722
[SPEAKER_57]: because I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I persist staying in my country and be part of what's happening there now.

2245
03:28:00,903 --> 03:28:02,125
[SPEAKER_94]: It's a great thought to end on.

2246
03:28:02,185 --> 03:28:05,028
[SPEAKER_94]: Orhan Pamuk, thank you so much for being on Hard Talk.

2247
03:28:08,222 --> 03:28:12,125
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the BBC World Service, where a family secret is shared.

2248
03:28:12,445 --> 03:28:16,328
[SPEAKER_47]: I'd always believed that my father was a bureaucrat in the American State Department.

2249
03:28:16,548 --> 03:28:21,832
[SPEAKER_47]: But one day when I was 18, he turned to me and he said, it's time I told you about the family business.

2250
03:28:22,672 --> 03:28:23,253
[SPEAKER_47]: Espionage.

2251
03:28:28,022 --> 03:28:32,227
[SPEAKER_47]: In the late 1960s, during the Vietnam War, the CIA sent him to Laos.

2252
03:28:32,267 --> 03:28:38,294
[SPEAKER_61]: The troops are not regular Laotian soldiers, but members of a force trained and financed by the CIA.

2253
03:28:38,935 --> 03:28:40,536
[SPEAKER_47]: But what was this covert mission about?

2254
03:28:40,677 --> 03:28:43,360
[SPEAKER_61]: Bang Pao denies this success was due to America.

2255
03:28:46,207 --> 03:28:48,888
[SPEAKER_47]: After my dad died, I decided to look for answers.

2256
03:28:48,928 --> 03:28:50,288
[SPEAKER_47]: We weren't cold-hearted.

2257
03:28:50,588 --> 03:28:53,229
[SPEAKER_47]: We were trying to help those folks and do anything we could for them.

2258
03:28:53,969 --> 03:28:59,370
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm Peter Lang Stanton, and this is a very personal story, but one I feel needs to be told.

2259
03:29:08,088 --> 03:29:11,390
[SPEAKER_06]: The Arctic Ocean is warming at an extraordinary rate.

2260
03:29:11,830 --> 03:29:16,573
[SPEAKER_06]: But what does that mean for the wildlife and the people that rely on these waters?

2261
03:29:16,953 --> 03:29:18,714
[SPEAKER_06]: The ice is changing.

2262
03:29:18,954 --> 03:29:20,996
[SPEAKER_09]: It's changing so fast.

2263
03:29:21,436 --> 03:29:26,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's challenging trying to go caribou hunting because of the erosion.

2264
03:29:26,979 --> 03:29:27,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Liz Bonnen.

2265
03:29:27,880 --> 03:29:36,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And after the news, I'll bring you ocean stories for The Compass on the BBC World Service, diving into the icy depths of the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

2266
03:29:38,662 --> 03:29:40,363
[SPEAKER_88]: BBC News with Gareth Barlow.

2267
03:29:41,003 --> 03:29:42,083
[SPEAKER_88]: Two senior U.S.

2268
03:29:42,123 --> 03:29:47,185
[SPEAKER_88]: officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

2269
03:29:47,205 --> 03:29:53,447
[SPEAKER_88]: He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

2270
03:29:53,927 --> 03:29:55,707
[SPEAKER_88]: The decision will break with years of U.S.

2271
03:29:55,767 --> 03:30:00,369
[SPEAKER_88]: policy on the status of the disputed city, as well as the international consensus.

2272
03:30:00,969 --> 03:30:04,270
[SPEAKER_88]: Arab states have warned the decision could provoke violence in the Muslim world.

2273
03:30:05,210 --> 03:30:15,415
[SPEAKER_88]: Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban its participation in next year's Winter Olympics, following a report accusing it of systematic doping.

2274
03:30:15,876 --> 03:30:20,438
[SPEAKER_88]: The deputy speaker of the Russian parliament called the ban a humiliation and an insult.

2275
03:30:21,358 --> 03:30:26,201
[SPEAKER_88]: Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

2276
03:30:26,821 --> 03:30:31,825
[SPEAKER_88]: One fire in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, trebled in size in just a few hours.

2277
03:30:32,365 --> 03:30:37,229
[SPEAKER_88]: At least 150 buildings have been destroyed, and a quarter of a million homes are without power.

2278
03:30:38,290 --> 03:30:45,836
[SPEAKER_88]: Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the campaigning journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

2279
03:30:46,336 --> 03:30:50,259
[SPEAKER_88]: Alfred and Jorge de Georgiou and Vince Muscard were arrested on Monday.

2280
03:30:50,539 --> 03:30:52,081
[SPEAKER_88]: They have pleaded not guilty.

2281
03:30:53,064 --> 03:31:02,668
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favour President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

2282
03:31:03,229 --> 03:31:10,132
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla, had appeared on course for victory after the election, when the count was suddenly halted.

2283
03:31:11,252 --> 03:31:15,276
[SPEAKER_88]: France's biggest rock star, Johnny Hallyday, has died from lung cancer at the age of 74.

2284
03:31:16,677 --> 03:31:22,862
[SPEAKER_88]: In a career spanning five decades, he sold more than 100 million records and headlined 50 major tours.

2285
03:31:23,402 --> 03:31:32,790
[SPEAKER_88]: Known as the French Elvis, he was hugely popular in the Francophone world, but less well-known elsewhere, earning him the nickname, the biggest rock star you've never heard of.

2286
03:31:33,891 --> 03:31:34,732
[SPEAKER_88]: BBC News.

2287
03:31:38,288 --> 03:31:38,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Liz Bonnen.

2288
03:31:39,108 --> 03:31:42,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a wild animal biologist and a science and wildlife presenter.

2289
03:31:43,429 --> 03:31:47,190
[SPEAKER_06]: In this series for The Compass, we're on a voyage through the world's oceans.

2290
03:31:47,730 --> 03:31:57,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I've spent time tracking Siberian tigers in the frozen Russian Far East, and I'm fascinated by how both animals and humans adapt to the coldest conditions on Earth.

2291
03:31:58,252 --> 03:31:59,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Ocean Stories.

2292
03:32:04,272 --> 03:32:07,633
[SPEAKER_06]: The oceans cover 70% of our planet's surface.

2293
03:32:08,333 --> 03:32:16,256
[SPEAKER_06]: The wildlife they contain is extraordinary, but so too are the people who make their living from the depths and the shallows of our seas.

2294
03:32:17,417 --> 03:32:26,780
[SPEAKER_06]: In this special four-part series for The Compass, I'm introducing you to them, from the ice-strewn landscapes of Alaska to the coral reef coastlines of Madagascar.

2295
03:32:27,560 --> 03:32:33,744
[SPEAKER_06]: From the BBC World Service, this is Ocean Stories, part three, the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

2296
03:32:38,286 --> 03:32:41,088
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the extremes of marine life.

2297
03:32:42,168 --> 03:32:47,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Two very different oceans where life has evolved to survive the intense cold.

2298
03:32:47,952 --> 03:32:55,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Two oceans where the climate is changing rapidly, where the fish, mammals and people are learning to adapt.

2299
03:32:57,884 --> 03:33:06,410
[SPEAKER_06]: We begin in the far north, the ocean encircled by Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and Alaska.

2300
03:33:07,331 --> 03:33:14,356
[SPEAKER_06]: The Arctic Ocean has tempted explorers in search of a faster passage from east to west for centuries.

2301
03:33:16,235 --> 03:33:24,089
[SPEAKER_06]: As the waters warm, the voyage becomes less dangerous and the plentiful, rich resources of the north are suddenly within reach.

2302
03:33:25,050 --> 03:33:28,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Our marine ecologist John Copley is watching closely.

2303
03:33:30,494 --> 03:33:41,440
[SPEAKER_102]: That whole area is very rich in oil and gas, and so there's a real bit of an underwater land grab around the Arctic at the moment for these seabed resources.

2304
03:33:42,080 --> 03:33:52,026
[SPEAKER_102]: Russia is claiming that the Lomonosov Ridge is an extension of the Siberian continental self geologically, and therefore it should belong to Russia as seafloor territory and its resources.

2305
03:33:52,366 --> 03:33:54,427
[SPEAKER_102]: A lot of that oil and gas should belong to Russia.

2306
03:33:54,887 --> 03:34:00,533
[SPEAKER_102]: and other nations who ring the arctic are also simply trying to get a piece of the pie.

2307
03:34:00,593 --> 03:34:14,586
[SPEAKER_102]: Previously we hadn't thought about those resources because the ocean is covered most of the time or most of its extent by sea ice but of course there have been such dramatic declines in arctic sea ice extent in recent years that the prospect of

2308
03:34:15,367 --> 03:34:29,560
[SPEAKER_102]: operations that require more open water, whether that's shipping and navigation to make a shortcut across the top of the world for transport of goods or actually to start extracting oil and gas from these sorts of latitudes, that's potentially becoming more realistic.

2309
03:34:30,928 --> 03:34:33,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Oil is already being extracted from the Arctic.

2310
03:34:34,509 --> 03:34:40,210
[SPEAKER_06]: At Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, millions of barrels of oil have been pumped since the 1960s.

2311
03:34:41,110 --> 03:34:46,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Operations there provide the jobs for Utqiagvik, America's most northerly town.

2312
03:34:47,311 --> 03:34:53,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, 500 kilometers inside the Arctic Circle, it's completely dark for 65 long winter days.

2313
03:34:55,906 --> 03:34:59,270
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the Arctic summer, a beach party is underway.

2314
03:34:59,830 --> 03:35:01,873
[SPEAKER_06]: The whaling season is coming to an end.

2315
03:35:02,673 --> 03:35:09,942
[SPEAKER_06]: As the last boat, a sealskin canoe, is pulled onto shore, the local Inupiat Inuit gather for a feast.

2316
03:35:13,385 --> 03:35:28,188
[SPEAKER_10]: the beginning of a ceremony called the Parati where the crew is going to bring in their boat from the ice symbolizing that they're done whaling for the season and they're gonna hand out fermented whale, some soup.

2317
03:35:37,045 --> 03:35:39,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I just said, welcome, everybody.

2318
03:35:39,547 --> 03:35:42,189
[SPEAKER_10]: I am Naomi Asok, and I'm from Barrow.

2319
03:35:42,829 --> 03:35:43,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Naomi is 23.

2320
03:35:44,530 --> 03:35:49,533
[SPEAKER_06]: She hunts walrus, seal, caribou, and whale with her father, Herman.

2321
03:35:49,974 --> 03:35:53,116
[SPEAKER_41]: When you harvest a whale, you can't sell the meat or muktak.

2322
03:35:53,816 --> 03:35:56,398
[SPEAKER_41]: It's given away to everybody, everybody.

2323
03:35:56,939 --> 03:35:58,640
[SPEAKER_41]: Even if you don't belong to a whaling crew,

2324
03:35:59,360 --> 03:36:01,482
[SPEAKER_41]: and you go up and butcher the whale, you get a share.

2325
03:36:02,283 --> 03:36:09,850
[SPEAKER_41]: You can't sell it because it's the International Whaling Commission law, because we use it as subsistence.

2326
03:36:10,607 --> 03:36:20,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The success and safety of a hunting season here depends on the local knowledge of the ice, as it forms, solidifies and breaks up over the course of a winter.

2327
03:36:21,033 --> 03:36:28,438
[SPEAKER_41]: Ice is siku in Inupiaq, and there's also the tuak, which is the ice that's connected to the shore.

2328
03:36:28,998 --> 03:36:32,080
[SPEAKER_41]: And then the salvi is the main pack that travels with the current.

2329
03:36:41,749 --> 03:36:43,511
[SPEAKER_06]: These names are important.

2330
03:36:43,931 --> 03:36:55,802
[SPEAKER_06]: They allow the hunters to communicate, to tell each other where they can walk, where they can drive their trucks and where they can gut their prey in a landscape that merges for most of the year with the Arctic Ocean.

2331
03:36:56,543 --> 03:37:04,569
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of different changes within just my 23 years of existing at home.

2332
03:37:05,389 --> 03:37:07,111
[SPEAKER_09]: The ice is changing.

2333
03:37:07,391 --> 03:37:09,432
[SPEAKER_09]: It's changing so fast.

2334
03:37:10,473 --> 03:37:13,935
[SPEAKER_09]: The coastline has eroded so fast.

2335
03:37:15,196 --> 03:37:24,658
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a little bit more challenging trying to go caribou hunting with the four-wheelers along the coast because of the erosion.

2336
03:37:24,678 --> 03:37:35,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're trying to have to work around the thawing and around the breaking of ice.

2337
03:37:35,281 --> 03:37:37,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to be very careful.

2338
03:37:39,142 --> 03:37:40,122
[SPEAKER_47]: We have a hammer up there?

2339
03:37:43,355 --> 03:37:48,697
[SPEAKER_06]: The whales that are caught in the short hunting season feed the community here right through the year.

2340
03:37:49,458 --> 03:38:01,583
[SPEAKER_06]: In a town where an omelette in a cafe costs 20 US dollars, the whale meat, traditionally kept frozen at the bottom of a four meter shaft drilled through the ice, is a vital food source.

2341
03:38:01,603 --> 03:38:02,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's have a look.

2342
03:38:03,093 --> 03:38:06,454
[SPEAKER_10]: This is our traditional ice cellar.

2343
03:38:07,154 --> 03:38:10,894
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where we store our muktuk and our meat from the bowhead whale.

2344
03:38:11,555 --> 03:38:15,235
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 20 feet down, and it's a natural freezer.

2345
03:38:15,815 --> 03:38:23,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever a crew is successful catching a whale, they'll put the excess meat and muktuk in here, the blubber.

2346
03:38:23,737 --> 03:38:25,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a difference, you can tell.

2347
03:38:25,137 --> 03:38:30,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if you put the meat in a traditional freezer, like in your home, you'll actually

2348
03:38:31,878 --> 03:38:35,620
[SPEAKER_10]: You can taste where it's been sitting, but it tastes really good.

2349
03:38:35,660 --> 03:38:36,720
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the earth.

2350
03:38:37,480 --> 03:38:40,361
[SPEAKER_06]: But the permafrost here is no longer reliable.

2351
03:38:41,062 --> 03:38:44,783
[SPEAKER_06]: There's water instead of ice at the bottom of Naomi's cellar.

2352
03:38:45,603 --> 03:38:51,666
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some that are not working anymore because of the changing weather.

2353
03:38:59,267 --> 03:39:13,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Travel across the Arctic Ocean, over the North Pole, and you reach Svalbard, a group of islands administered by Norway, but home to research stations belonging to France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and even China.

2354
03:39:14,792 --> 03:39:21,655
[SPEAKER_06]: With so many scientists here, the melting of the ice and the thawing of the permafrost are monitored very carefully.

2355
03:39:22,195 --> 03:39:34,700
[SPEAKER_99]: So it was relatively cold here in Svalbard in the 60s and in the 80s and then after that for the last 35 years we have seen a more or less persistent temperature increase up here.

2356
03:39:35,020 --> 03:39:39,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Ole Humlen is a geographer at UNIS, the university centre in Svalbard.

2357
03:39:40,424 --> 03:39:45,168
[SPEAKER_111]: This was what we had in the beginning at UNIS, the only room where we could work on frozen samples.

2358
03:39:45,388 --> 03:39:48,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Ole is married to geology professor Hannah Christensen.

2359
03:39:48,690 --> 03:39:51,172
[SPEAKER_111]: It's minus 17 in the freezer today.

2360
03:39:51,332 --> 03:39:56,156
[SPEAKER_06]: She keeps her core samples from the Svalbard permafrost in a walk-in freezer at UNIS.

2361
03:39:56,416 --> 03:40:08,540
[SPEAKER_111]: Not only do we measure the temperature of the permafrost in Svalbard, but we're also monitoring and measuring the thickness of the thawed layer, the active layer on top of the permafrost that develops every summer when energy is provided to the ground.

2362
03:40:09,160 --> 03:40:10,941
[SPEAKER_111]: And then we can monitor that.

2363
03:40:11,041 --> 03:40:12,561
[SPEAKER_111]: And we've been doing that for 15, 16 years now.

2364
03:40:14,422 --> 03:40:25,806
[SPEAKER_111]: So we know that on average over that period of time where temperatures have gone up, we see an increase in the thickness of the active layer of around half a centimeter to a centimeter, of course varies between years.

2365
03:40:26,566 --> 03:40:31,768
[SPEAKER_111]: So that means that we're losing that amount of permafrost from this area that we are monitoring like that.

2366
03:40:32,208 --> 03:40:38,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Thawing permafrost can release the climate-warming gas methane, which is even more damaging than carbon dioxide.

2367
03:40:39,713 --> 03:40:41,474
[SPEAKER_06]: It also causes local problems.

2368
03:40:41,994 --> 03:40:50,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the offices, shops and homes in Svalbard are built on stilts resting on ground that used to be frozen solid all year round.

2369
03:40:51,220 --> 03:41:03,650
[SPEAKER_111]: I'm living in a house on piles, as you have just seen, and at the moment you can't close the windows in one side of the house because the whole house is being deformed because of the ground that it's standing on.

2370
03:41:03,810 --> 03:41:07,453
[SPEAKER_111]: It's getting maybe a thicker active layer or getting more water under there.

2371
03:41:09,140 --> 03:41:16,622
[SPEAKER_06]: From the Norwegian Polar Institute, Christian Ledesen studies the mammals that spend their entire lives in these arctic waters.

2372
03:41:17,182 --> 03:41:24,903
[SPEAKER_70]: Walruses is one, ring seal and bearded seals are other, and also the narwhal and the bowhead and the white whale.

2373
03:41:25,603 --> 03:41:30,044
[SPEAKER_70]: And they are what we call ice associated, two different degrees.

2374
03:41:30,804 --> 03:41:33,505
[SPEAKER_70]: And the one that is most dependent on sea ice is the ring seal.

2375
03:41:34,165 --> 03:41:45,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the ringed seal, a small seal with a coat of black spots surrounded by grey rings, that's having a particularly tough time coping with the warm waters around Svalbard.

2376
03:41:45,197 --> 03:41:54,426
[SPEAKER_70]: They have this very special breathing system where they actually pop in a snow cave on top of a breathing hole in the ice.

2377
03:41:55,487 --> 03:42:01,634
[SPEAKER_70]: And that protects the very small pup from harsh weather conditions to some degree, but also from predation.

2378
03:42:02,094 --> 03:42:10,383
[SPEAKER_70]: Because it takes a while for a predator, which is normally a polar bear or a fox, to dig through the layer and take the pup so it has a chance to escape.

2379
03:42:10,903 --> 03:42:25,737
[SPEAKER_70]: What the problem has been here now the last years is that first, especially on the west side of Spitsbergen, the ice forms very late, if at all, and normally it forms too late for snow, enough snow to accumulate, so they can make these layers.

2380
03:42:27,037 --> 03:42:32,678
[SPEAKER_70]: And then they pup on the open ice, and then almost all pups are killed before they are weaned.

2381
03:42:32,998 --> 03:42:34,458
[SPEAKER_70]: Even big gulls take them then.

2382
03:42:35,199 --> 03:42:38,519
[SPEAKER_70]: In principle, we're not having Arctic conditions here anymore.

2383
03:42:38,539 --> 03:42:40,040
[SPEAKER_70]: You know, they're changing to more Atlantic.

2384
03:42:41,120 --> 03:42:46,301
[SPEAKER_70]: And we have here on the west coast of Svalbard, we have harbor seals too, not so ice adapted.

2385
03:42:46,841 --> 03:42:52,222
[SPEAKER_70]: And it seems like they are thriving with this new Atlantic water, and they're expanding their distribution into the fjords here.

2386
03:42:53,973 --> 03:42:57,796
[SPEAKER_06]: The oceans at both ends of the world are changing fast.

2387
03:42:58,257 --> 03:43:01,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Some animals may adapt to warmer waters, others won't.

2388
03:43:03,031 --> 03:43:09,815
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Arctic, the shifting climate will certainly change the lives of native people and bring more workers from the South.

2389
03:43:11,676 --> 03:43:23,043
[SPEAKER_06]: A place like Svalbard, perfectly positioned on the Northeast Passage from Asia across Northern Europe to North America, is likely to take on newfound importance in world trade.

2390
03:43:23,883 --> 03:43:26,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Mads Forshamer is a local biologist.

2391
03:43:27,205 --> 03:43:31,226
[SPEAKER_63]: When the sea ice goes, it will open for transportations by ships.

2392
03:43:31,566 --> 03:43:37,807
[SPEAKER_63]: It will open for explorations of petroleum and other natural resources.

2393
03:43:38,988 --> 03:43:41,928
[SPEAKER_63]: So yeah, it will change the picture a lot.

2394
03:43:42,568 --> 03:43:49,330
[SPEAKER_63]: And that could have consequences for a place like this because it could be increased in size considerably if you have ships coming in.

2395
03:43:50,831 --> 03:43:52,334
[SPEAKER_63]: because Svalbard is positioned there.

2396
03:43:52,454 --> 03:43:57,224
[SPEAKER_63]: They're actually the hub, the main entrance to cross polar routes.

2397
03:43:58,226 --> 03:44:00,230
[SPEAKER_63]: So yeah, that's going to be quite interesting to watch.

2398
03:44:02,885 --> 03:44:11,191
[SPEAKER_119]: There are a lot of people who are wondering about what will happen to Svalbard if it should be possible to sail through the Northeast Passage.

2399
03:44:12,112 --> 03:44:17,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Tarin Sorensen is deacon at the Svalbard Kirke, the most northerly church in the world.

2400
03:44:18,517 --> 03:44:20,919
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the spilling of oil?

2401
03:44:21,899 --> 03:44:27,604
[SPEAKER_119]: What about the fuel effect, the Arctic?

2402
03:44:29,045 --> 03:44:30,106
[SPEAKER_06]: There are many questions.

2403
03:44:33,495 --> 03:44:36,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Liz Bonnen and this is Ocean Stories.

2404
03:44:37,181 --> 03:44:42,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Today we're discovering how a warming climate is changing the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

2405
03:44:48,337 --> 03:44:59,086
[SPEAKER_06]: head south, 60 degrees south, far beyond the southern tip of South Africa, Chile and New Zealand, to the mother of the oceans, the water that brings life to the rest of the world.

2406
03:44:59,546 --> 03:45:06,753
[SPEAKER_102]: The Antarctic is particularly important because it's where a lot of the deep oceans of the world are effectively breathing in.

2407
03:45:07,413 --> 03:45:12,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Our guide to the deep is Southampton University's ocean explorer John Copley.

2408
03:45:12,636 --> 03:45:21,680
[SPEAKER_102]: Deep water that fills the bottom of Marianas Trench in the Pacific actually begun its journey into the deep at the sea surface around Antarctica.

2409
03:45:22,141 --> 03:45:26,503
[SPEAKER_102]: In winter in the Antarctic a lot more of the sea freezes around Antarctica.

2410
03:45:26,523 --> 03:45:30,625
[SPEAKER_102]: We get this phenomenal growth of sea ice spreading out from the continent and if

2411
03:45:31,465 --> 03:45:34,226
[SPEAKER_102]: It effectively doubles the size of the Antarctic.

2412
03:45:34,706 --> 03:45:41,128
[SPEAKER_102]: And as the surface sea freezes to form that sea ice, it leaves behind very cold, very salty water.

2413
03:45:41,588 --> 03:45:46,929
[SPEAKER_102]: And that very cold, very salty water is heavier than normal sea water, so it sinks.

2414
03:45:47,989 --> 03:45:52,571
[SPEAKER_102]: And it sinks and it flows out, spills out from the Antarctic into the deep ocean basins.

2415
03:45:52,651 --> 03:45:57,192
[SPEAKER_102]: It flows north in the Atlantic, north in the Pacific, north in the Indian Ocean.

2416
03:45:57,852 --> 03:46:07,019
[SPEAKER_102]: And it's very important because when it's forming at the surface, that's when it's dissolving oxygen from the air into the ocean and then carrying that oxygen into the deep ocean.

2417
03:46:07,119 --> 03:46:17,126
[SPEAKER_102]: So all of the deep sea marine life in those deep ocean basins, it gets its oxygen from that deep water formation at the surface around Antarctica.

2418
03:46:17,667 --> 03:46:24,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Where other continents slope gently into the surrounding ocean, Antarctica stops and drops off dramatically.

2419
03:46:26,352 --> 03:46:35,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Deep sea washes right up against the land and this far south the difference in temperature between the deep water and the shallows is greatly reduced.

2420
03:46:40,162 --> 03:46:47,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Which means that the strange life forms of the deep can be spotted close to land and relatively close to the surface.

2421
03:46:48,158 --> 03:46:52,960
[SPEAKER_06]: John Copley is one of the first people to take a submersible into these waters.

2422
03:46:53,560 --> 03:46:55,021
[SPEAKER_102]: So we're 120 meters now.

2423
03:46:55,481 --> 03:47:01,964
[SPEAKER_102]: Toby's driving us towards the point we hope to land on the seabed at to start our dive.

2424
03:47:02,625 --> 03:47:07,707
[SPEAKER_102]: So we're heading down half a kilometer to explore this part of our planet for the first time.

2425
03:47:10,032 --> 03:47:11,253
[SPEAKER_102]: So we just passed 100 meters.

2426
03:47:11,273 --> 03:47:13,214
[SPEAKER_102]: All the daylight has gone now.

2427
03:47:13,894 --> 03:47:16,235
[SPEAKER_102]: It's all been quenched by the seawater.

2428
03:47:16,395 --> 03:47:19,917
[SPEAKER_102]: Amazing, thick soup of plankton.

2429
03:47:20,397 --> 03:47:21,638
[SPEAKER_102]: And it's mainly animal plankton.

2430
03:47:21,938 --> 03:47:22,918
[SPEAKER_102]: And they're tiny.

2431
03:47:23,018 --> 03:47:25,660
[SPEAKER_102]: It's hard for me to make out what we're seeing here.

2432
03:47:25,680 --> 03:47:28,241
[SPEAKER_102]: That's a larval fish that's just gone by the sphere there.

2433
03:47:29,101 --> 03:47:30,162
[SPEAKER_102]: Tiny little crustaceans.

2434
03:47:30,182 --> 03:47:31,762
[SPEAKER_102]: They're kind of like the insects of the ocean.

2435
03:47:31,883 --> 03:47:33,463
[SPEAKER_102]: Control, control, rover.

2436
03:47:33,543 --> 03:47:34,904
[SPEAKER_102]: Both subs off bottom.

2437
03:47:34,984 --> 03:47:36,205
[SPEAKER_36]: Depth 4-0-0 meters, over.

2438
03:47:39,190 --> 03:47:42,792
[SPEAKER_102]: Where we are right now, mid-water, this is a very strange place.

2439
03:47:43,052 --> 03:47:49,055
[SPEAKER_102]: It's a world without war, so there are animals that live their whole lives here, never touching a solid, hard surface.

2440
03:47:49,256 --> 03:47:53,338
[SPEAKER_102]: And that means they've got bodies that are like blown glass, that are sort of ethereal.

2441
03:47:53,358 --> 03:47:56,840
[SPEAKER_102]: A lot of them are bodies very delicate, made of jelly.

2442
03:47:57,480 --> 03:47:59,721
[SPEAKER_102]: And the only way to understand the life here is to come and see it.

2443
03:48:00,081 --> 03:48:04,604
[SPEAKER_102]: Because if you try and fish these up with a net, all you get is a lot of snot in the bottom of the net.

2444
03:48:05,284 --> 03:48:06,545
[SPEAKER_102]: Oh, look at that ice fish there.

2445
03:48:06,725 --> 03:48:07,705
[SPEAKER_102]: Crocodile ice fish.

2446
03:48:07,765 --> 03:48:09,806
[SPEAKER_102]: That's a beauty.

2447
03:48:10,507 --> 03:48:13,748
[SPEAKER_102]: And it has a... Its snout is really like crocodile-like.

2448
03:48:14,869 --> 03:48:20,071
[SPEAKER_102]: Just everywhere we go, there is something amazing and something different.

2449
03:48:24,648 --> 03:48:26,989
[SPEAKER_102]: Oh, the krill are really starting to swarm around us now.

2450
03:48:27,009 --> 03:48:29,490
[SPEAKER_102]: I mean, they're almost see-through.

2451
03:48:29,510 --> 03:48:44,055
[SPEAKER_102]: You sometimes catch a flash of what's in their gut, a little line down the body, and they've actually got little organs like headlights dotted along their bodies as well, which when we switch out the lights later, hopefully we'll be able to see some of their firework displays.

2452
03:48:44,615 --> 03:48:48,557
[SPEAKER_36]: Control, Rover, that's both subs finished, standing by to leave bottom hour.

2453
03:48:52,543 --> 03:48:56,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Those krill are the foundation of life in the Antarctic.

2454
03:48:56,467 --> 03:49:01,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Food for the seals, the whales and the penguins that live on the West Antarctic Peninsula.

2455
03:49:02,932 --> 03:49:06,095
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of the fastest warming areas on Earth.

2456
03:49:06,836 --> 03:49:09,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Warming temperatures means less sea ice.

2457
03:49:09,898 --> 03:49:14,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Less sea ice means less habitat for the algae that the krill eat.

2458
03:49:14,722 --> 03:49:19,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And that could be catastrophic for the mammals and birds in this part of the Southern Ocean.

2459
03:49:21,080 --> 03:49:23,081
[SPEAKER_123]: You know, really, it's amazing.

2460
03:49:23,361 --> 03:49:27,522
[SPEAKER_123]: There are so many wandering albatrosses behind this boat now, I can't describe.

2461
03:49:28,282 --> 03:49:31,183
[SPEAKER_123]: They're the world's largest bird in terms of wingspan.

2462
03:49:31,203 --> 03:49:33,144
[SPEAKER_123]: They're three, three and a half meters.

2463
03:49:33,744 --> 03:49:35,505
[SPEAKER_123]: And they come just alongside the boat.

2464
03:49:35,805 --> 03:49:39,926
[SPEAKER_123]: And they sort of, they just float, just almost within fingertip reach of them.

2465
03:49:40,406 --> 03:49:44,828
[SPEAKER_123]: They just look at you as they sort of glide gently up to see what you're all about.

2466
03:49:45,948 --> 03:49:51,874
[SPEAKER_123]: and then fire off across the surface of the ocean, almost skimming the surface of the sea with their wingtips.

2467
03:49:51,914 --> 03:49:55,938
[SPEAKER_123]: They're just extraordinarily capable birds in the air.

2468
03:49:56,119 --> 03:50:00,203
[SPEAKER_123]: They look like they're applying no effort to the mechanism of flight whatsoever.

2469
03:50:01,232 --> 03:50:03,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Gerard Baker is a chef and a writer.

2470
03:50:03,995 --> 03:50:12,322
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been working in the Southern Ocean for 23 years on cruise ships, fishing boats, and in the British Antarctic Survey's research stations.

2471
03:50:13,163 --> 03:50:17,287
[SPEAKER_06]: In a region with no permanent residents, Gerard qualifies as a local.

2472
03:50:17,728 --> 03:50:22,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And like most of us, he cares about the future of life on his own doorstep.

2473
03:50:24,233 --> 03:50:32,797
[SPEAKER_123]: We've been stalked by a foot and a half long, fluffy, slightly damp-looking fur seal pup with teeth about a millimetre long.

2474
03:50:32,817 --> 03:50:39,620
[SPEAKER_123]: So although it makes a growly, aggressive kind of noise, it might nibble the end of your boot, but not much more than that.

2475
03:50:41,800 --> 03:50:44,162
[SPEAKER_123]: This is one of the more unusual treasure hunts I've ever been on.

2476
03:50:44,202 --> 03:50:50,269
[SPEAKER_123]: We're hunting for fur seal scats, or faeces, here on the snow at King Edward Point.

2477
03:50:50,289 --> 03:50:56,815
[SPEAKER_123]: And I'm with the zoologist here, Kieran, who is going to show me what he does with this.

2478
03:50:56,835 --> 03:51:00,920
[SPEAKER_123]: He's got a plastic bag on one hand and there's a dirty brown lump on the snow.

2479
03:51:00,940 --> 03:51:01,580
[SPEAKER_123]: Kieran, you go ahead.

2480
03:51:01,600 --> 03:51:04,924
[SPEAKER_123]: Tell me, what's the point of collecting the fur seal scats?

2481
03:51:05,584 --> 03:51:21,747
[SPEAKER_117]: So the whole point to this is to analyse their diet, to understand exactly what they're eating, and this can indicate then how much krill and fish and potentially squid is in the waters here in South Georgia.

2482
03:51:22,407 --> 03:51:23,587
[SPEAKER_117]: OK, well, you go ahead and pick up.

2483
03:51:24,367 --> 03:51:31,428
[SPEAKER_117]: So there's absolutely no skill towards this, same as what you would do with your own dog.

2484
03:51:32,909 --> 03:51:34,449
[SPEAKER_117]: And this one is basically...

2485
03:51:37,255 --> 03:51:39,596
[SPEAKER_123]: It's nicely frozen onto the snow there.

2486
03:51:41,797 --> 03:51:43,918
[SPEAKER_123]: Dog owners will be sympathetic to you at this point.

2487
03:51:45,399 --> 03:51:57,704
[SPEAKER_123]: The reason Kieran, who works for the South Georgia government, is so interested in krill numbers, is that krill fishing is on the increase, as the world's human population craves new sources of omega-3 oils.

2488
03:51:58,564 --> 03:52:04,027
[SPEAKER_123]: The warming climate means that fishing boats can work further south, deeper into the Antarctic winter.

2489
03:52:05,182 --> 03:52:11,585
[SPEAKER_123]: Crucially, the Norwegians have developed a cunning way of catching the krill and freezing them whilst they're still completely fresh.

2490
03:52:12,385 --> 03:52:19,808
[SPEAKER_123]: That makes them fit for human consumption, so you'll now see krill oil high in omega-3 in a lot of health food shops around the world.

2491
03:52:20,648 --> 03:52:25,450
[SPEAKER_123]: The Chinese and South Koreans are now following the Norwegians into the southern waters.

2492
03:52:27,556 --> 03:52:35,125
[SPEAKER_123]: Well, I've come to Nikko Harbour on the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and here it's a large Gentoo penguin colony.

2493
03:52:35,285 --> 03:52:41,632
[SPEAKER_123]: There are adults wandering around, chicks, large chicks now, it's mid-season, and they're beginning to fledge.

2494
03:52:43,014 --> 03:52:48,100
[SPEAKER_123]: And all around is evidence of krill and iguana on the ground in between the rocks here.

2495
03:52:49,748 --> 03:52:53,890
[SPEAKER_123]: Oh, there's a glacier carving in the background, a little bit of wave happening.

2496
03:52:55,611 --> 03:53:04,355
[SPEAKER_123]: It's hard not to connect the success, the breeding success of the penguins here on shore with what's happening out there on the water.

2497
03:53:06,236 --> 03:53:13,560
[SPEAKER_123]: Here at Neco Harbour last year, along with other nearby islands like Cooverville, almost all of the Gentoo chicks died from starvation.

2498
03:53:17,411 --> 03:53:23,535
[SPEAKER_103]: This is one of the cameras, and as you can see, there's a bunch of nests in view.

2499
03:53:25,175 --> 03:53:26,096
[SPEAKER_103]: And this is the cool one.

2500
03:53:26,196 --> 03:53:34,701
[SPEAKER_103]: It takes a photo every hour all year, which shows when they arrive, when they depart, and the reproductive success, so which chicks survive and which don't.

2501
03:53:35,922 --> 03:53:45,787
[SPEAKER_123]: Using a network of cameras, Tom Hart from Oxford University monitors the three species of brushtail penguin on the Antarctic Peninsula, the chinstrap, a dayleaf, and gen2.

2502
03:53:47,208 --> 03:53:49,549
[SPEAKER_123]: Every summer, he visits the cameras to change the batteries.

2503
03:53:50,490 --> 03:53:57,493
[SPEAKER_123]: In the spring of 2016, he noticed a sharp decline in the number of chicks successfully fledged on Cooverville Island.

2504
03:53:59,374 --> 03:54:02,695
[SPEAKER_104]: Cooverville Island has about 2,000 gentoo penguins on it.

2505
03:54:03,295 --> 03:54:06,557
[SPEAKER_104]: And there was a big die-off there right at the end of the season.

2506
03:54:07,497 --> 03:54:09,498
[SPEAKER_104]: So I'd come back, I didn't see it.

2507
03:54:10,619 --> 03:54:13,320
[SPEAKER_104]: But we started getting all these reports of a die-off.

2508
03:54:14,492 --> 03:54:16,373
[SPEAKER_123]: So what caused the southern penguin die-off?

2509
03:54:17,133 --> 03:54:23,395
[SPEAKER_123]: The evidence, according to scientists at the nearby Palmer Research Station, suggests it wasn't disease, but starvation.

2510
03:54:24,475 --> 03:54:26,056
[SPEAKER_123]: That points to a problem with the krill.

2511
03:54:27,116 --> 03:54:31,918
[SPEAKER_123]: They could have suffered their own bad breeding year, or returning whales could have taken a larger share.

2512
03:54:33,233 --> 03:54:35,394
[SPEAKER_123]: Climate change is another of the key suspects.

2513
03:54:36,314 --> 03:54:38,535
[SPEAKER_123]: Mark Belsher from the British Antarctic Survey.

2514
03:54:39,155 --> 03:54:48,358
[SPEAKER_98]: Climate change is likely to have a very large impact on all aspects of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, not least in Antarctic krill.

2515
03:54:49,399 --> 03:54:55,121
[SPEAKER_98]: They are very much dependent for their early life history stages on the northerly extent of sea ice.

2516
03:54:55,918 --> 03:54:59,540
[SPEAKER_98]: where their spawning and egg duration phase takes place.

2517
03:55:00,060 --> 03:55:14,807
[SPEAKER_98]: So clearly the location of the ice edge and the timing of the extent of the ice edge will have a major impact as to where krill ultimately will end up in the Southern Ocean, which currents they get entrained in, and indeed their overall success.

2518
03:55:15,407 --> 03:55:19,709
[SPEAKER_123]: Brent Stewart from the Hubb Seaworld Research Institute also expects an impact.

2519
03:55:20,289 --> 03:55:37,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think the key here with all the discussion about changes in climate, which is clearly happening, local changes in climate, regional changes in climate, oceanographic climate or atmospheric climate, is the question is how quickly does it happen and do animals have the, can they respond to it?

2520
03:55:37,786 --> 03:55:41,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Some will respond to it well and some won't if it happens very quickly.

2521
03:55:41,209 --> 03:55:45,233
[SPEAKER_13]: So if the climate changes quickly enough that it

2522
03:55:45,953 --> 03:55:57,180
[SPEAKER_13]: degrades the habitat for krill, which are the primary food source for a lot of things, and that just vanishes, then that's going to be a very, very sudden change for the predators.

2523
03:55:57,500 --> 03:55:59,701
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll either move elsewhere or they won't do so well.

2524
03:56:00,402 --> 03:56:06,425
[SPEAKER_123]: So climate change is likely to affect the krill, but it may be premature to blame it for a single bad year.

2525
03:56:07,286 --> 03:56:09,087
[SPEAKER_123]: Another suspect is the fishing industry.

2526
03:56:09,787 --> 03:56:14,670
[SPEAKER_123]: Large krill fishing boats were seen working close to the penguin colonies at the time of the die-off.

2527
03:56:15,150 --> 03:56:18,431
[SPEAKER_104]: Trying to pin the blame on any one event is really hard.

2528
03:56:19,252 --> 03:56:33,418
[SPEAKER_104]: It was possibly a bad krill year but there was also a lot of fishing going on nearby and yeah that to me absolutely highlights the problem that you can have associations and that's not evidence either way.

2529
03:56:34,685 --> 03:56:38,488
[SPEAKER_123]: So far, there's no firm evidence that krill numbers have declined in the Southern Ocean.

2530
03:56:39,089 --> 03:56:42,872
[SPEAKER_123]: It's very difficult to gather accurate data over such a huge area.

2531
03:56:44,033 --> 03:56:48,956
[SPEAKER_123]: What worries Tom is that the birds and mammals are concentrated in particular parts of the ocean.

2532
03:56:49,877 --> 03:56:54,101
[SPEAKER_123]: If fishing boats target exactly the same area, then food could run short.

2533
03:56:57,467 --> 03:57:06,715
[SPEAKER_104]: Yeah, so all of these predators, they're land-based, raising their young on land, so they're tied to the land like an aircraft carrier.

2534
03:57:07,035 --> 03:57:13,640
[SPEAKER_104]: They can go out and they can fish, they can go foraging, but they need to come back to land where they're young are to raise their young.

2535
03:57:14,481 --> 03:57:24,870
[SPEAKER_104]: All different species, so this could be Adelie penguins, Chinstrap penguins and Gentoo penguins, but also Crabbeater seals, anything apart from whales, they're land-based when they're breeding.

2536
03:57:26,332 --> 03:57:29,175
[SPEAKER_104]: and doing these little forays out to get food.

2537
03:57:29,195 --> 03:57:36,301
[SPEAKER_123]: The penguins all around me are witnesses to what's happening in the Southern Ocean.

2538
03:57:37,202 --> 03:57:44,408
[SPEAKER_123]: The future health of this colony and others like it is very dependent on climate change and ultimately what we as humans do.

2539
03:57:47,703 --> 03:57:53,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Liz Bonnen and you've been listening to Ocean Stories for the Compass from the BBC World Service.

2540
03:57:54,605 --> 03:57:56,646
[SPEAKER_06]: The producer was Alistair Cross.

2541
03:57:57,646 --> 03:58:03,568
[SPEAKER_06]: In episode four, I'll be exploring the biggest and deepest ocean of all, the Pacific.

2542
03:58:08,022 --> 03:58:11,484
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the BBC World Service, where science lives.

2543
03:58:12,084 --> 03:58:13,145
[SPEAKER_27]: For the creative.

2544
03:58:13,385 --> 03:58:17,827
[SPEAKER_36]: With drones, we can get blood anywhere in the country in 15 to 20 minutes.

2545
03:58:18,108 --> 03:58:18,888
[SPEAKER_32]: And the curious.

2546
03:58:19,128 --> 03:58:26,092
[SPEAKER_89]: When we looked at our twins, we found there were certain microbes that were always present in the skinnier twins than in the overweight twins.

2547
03:58:26,352 --> 03:58:28,033
[SPEAKER_89]: For our remarkable world.

2548
03:58:28,633 --> 03:58:31,095
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like releasing the valve on a pressure cooker.

2549
03:58:31,215 --> 03:58:36,137
[SPEAKER_27]: Science on the BBC World Service at bbcworldservice.com.

2550
03:58:39,015 --> 03:58:41,357
[SPEAKER_27]: You're listening to the BBC World Service.

2551
03:59:08,532 --> 03:59:09,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, welcome to Outlook.

2552
03:59:09,913 --> 03:59:15,655
[SPEAKER_14]: When Ayik Shute was 13, he joined a rebel army in Sudan, but he hated it and tried to run away.

2553
03:59:15,975 --> 03:59:18,216
[SPEAKER_14]: When he was caught, he was horribly punished.

2554
03:59:18,656 --> 03:59:21,537
[SPEAKER_108]: All I remember, I cried and you can't cry anymore.

2555
03:59:21,917 --> 03:59:26,639
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, you want to, your lung is gone.

2556
03:59:26,659 --> 03:59:28,179
[SPEAKER_108]: There's nothing that can come out of it.

2557
03:59:28,340 --> 03:59:29,100
[SPEAKER_108]: Who would punish you?

2558
03:59:29,120 --> 03:59:33,421
[SPEAKER_108]: There was a guy who ran the prison, the child soldiers prison.

2559
03:59:33,441 --> 03:59:34,622
[SPEAKER_108]: His name was Anyang.

2560
03:59:35,029 --> 03:59:40,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Anuang was just a child himself, a few years older than Ayik, and Ayik hated him with a passion.

2561
03:59:40,392 --> 03:59:45,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Years later, Ayik got asylum in Australia, and one day in church, saw a familiar face.

2562
03:59:46,035 --> 03:59:47,916
[SPEAKER_108]: This is the guy that used to torture me.

2563
03:59:48,357 --> 03:59:57,802
[SPEAKER_108]: Every time we run away, he'll send the guard to go and get us, and bring us back there, and then lock us up for up to four weeks, and then release us into training again.

2564
03:59:58,282 --> 03:59:58,863
[SPEAKER_108]: That's him.

2565
03:59:58,883 --> 04:00:02,410
[SPEAKER_108]: Okay, I think I should kill him.

2566
04:00:02,811 --> 04:00:05,135
[SPEAKER_14]: What happened next is truly extraordinary.

2567
04:00:05,296 --> 04:00:06,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Find out after the news.

2568
04:00:08,503 --> 04:00:10,624
[SPEAKER_88]: BBC News, hello, I'm Gareth Barlow.

2569
04:00:11,325 --> 04:00:12,106
[SPEAKER_88]: Senior U.S.

2570
04:00:12,166 --> 04:00:17,289
[SPEAKER_88]: officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

2571
04:00:17,309 --> 04:00:23,974
[SPEAKER_88]: He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

2572
04:00:24,494 --> 04:00:28,277
[SPEAKER_88]: Arab states have warned that the decision could provoke violence in the Muslim world.

2573
04:00:28,817 --> 04:00:29,938
[SPEAKER_88]: Barbara Platusha reports.

2574
04:00:30,525 --> 04:00:34,509
[SPEAKER_73]: The president is planning to fulfill a campaign promise made to pro-Israel voters.

2575
04:00:34,929 --> 04:00:40,734
[SPEAKER_73]: But in doing so, he's tackling one of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the status of Jerusalem.

2576
04:00:41,595 --> 04:00:47,721
[SPEAKER_73]: Senior administration officials said he would simply be acknowledging reality, that Jerusalem functions as the capital of Israel.

2577
04:00:48,422 --> 04:00:56,972
[SPEAKER_73]: Congress has called for such a move for 22 years, but previous presidents have been resistant, accepting that Jerusalem's future should be part of a negotiated agreement.

2578
04:00:57,713 --> 04:00:58,133
[SPEAKER_73]: One U.S.

2579
04:00:58,173 --> 04:01:02,058
[SPEAKER_73]: official said that delaying the decision had done nothing to advance peace.

2580
04:01:02,679 --> 04:01:06,684
[SPEAKER_73]: But the U.N., Europe and Arab states have long calculated that it would prevent conflict.

2581
04:01:07,423 --> 04:01:14,986
[SPEAKER_88]: Russia has reacted furiously to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban it from next February's Winter Olympics in South Korea.

2582
04:01:15,466 --> 04:01:24,810
[SPEAKER_88]: In a defiant post on social media, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Russia would survive this as it had survived World War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and sanctions.

2583
04:01:25,270 --> 04:01:26,451
[SPEAKER_88]: Here is Alex Kapstik.

2584
04:01:26,911 --> 04:01:31,353
[SPEAKER_67]: The decision was made following a damning report which confirmed there was state-sponsored doping.

2585
04:01:31,893 --> 04:01:33,914
[SPEAKER_67]: The sports ministry has been held responsible.

2586
04:01:34,294 --> 04:01:39,095
[SPEAKER_67]: Its former boss and the current Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has been banned for life.

2587
04:01:39,715 --> 04:01:41,916
[SPEAKER_67]: The country's flag will not fly in Pyeongchang.

2588
04:01:42,196 --> 04:01:43,716
[SPEAKER_67]: Its anthem will not be played.

2589
04:01:44,216 --> 04:01:50,798
[SPEAKER_67]: Russian athletes will be free to compete as long as they prove they are clean and were not directly implicated in the doping program.

2590
04:01:51,258 --> 04:01:57,780
[SPEAKER_67]: They will wear neutral uniforms, but in what could be a crucial concession, they will be known as Olympic athletes from Russia.

2591
04:01:58,990 --> 04:02:04,554
[SPEAKER_88]: Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

2592
04:02:05,094 --> 04:02:08,817
[SPEAKER_88]: The BBC's James Cook reports from the outskirts of Los Angeles.

2593
04:02:09,317 --> 04:02:21,546
[SPEAKER_106]: In Ventura County, to the north of Los Angeles, a wildfire which broke out on Monday intensified with terrifying speed, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by arid and gusty Santa Ana winds.

2594
04:02:22,046 --> 04:02:25,769
[SPEAKER_106]: Scores of homes were gutted, and a mental health hospital was destroyed.

2595
04:02:26,389 --> 04:02:34,455
[SPEAKER_106]: Here on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the charred ruins of houses are still smoking while dark choking smoke has closed a major motorway.

2596
04:02:35,015 --> 04:02:38,878
[SPEAKER_106]: Ash is blowing through the air and there is a firefighting helicopter overhead.

2597
04:02:39,398 --> 04:02:46,844
[SPEAKER_106]: And with forecasters warning that ferocious winds and low humidity will continue for several days, this could yet get a lot worse.

2598
04:02:47,204 --> 04:02:48,225
[SPEAKER_88]: James Cook reporting.

2599
04:02:49,045 --> 04:02:57,155
[SPEAKER_88]: Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

2600
04:02:57,715 --> 04:03:01,740
[SPEAKER_88]: Alfred and Giorgio De Gionio and Vince Muscat were arrested on Monday.

2601
04:03:02,040 --> 04:03:03,622
[SPEAKER_88]: They have pleaded not guilty.

2602
04:03:04,683 --> 04:03:06,545
[SPEAKER_88]: World News from the BBC.

2603
04:03:08,421 --> 04:03:18,323
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favour President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

2604
04:03:18,884 --> 04:03:27,806
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition candidate Salvador Nasrulla had appeared set for victory shortly after the election ten days ago, when the vote count was suddenly halted.

2605
04:03:28,903 --> 04:03:35,449
[SPEAKER_88]: A new report says about 15,000 people a day are being forced to flee their homes in African conflict and disaster zones.

2606
04:03:36,069 --> 04:03:45,157
[SPEAKER_88]: Figures published by the Norwegian Refugee Council and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre show that more than 12 million people in Africa are internally displaced.

2607
04:03:45,638 --> 04:03:51,063
[SPEAKER_88]: Nearly four million left their homes last year, a quarter of them in the Democratic Republic of Congo alone.

2608
04:03:52,178 --> 04:03:59,703
[SPEAKER_88]: Britain's most prestigious contemporary art award, the Turner Prize, has been won by an art professor who was born in Zanzibar, Lubaina Himid.

2609
04:04:00,243 --> 04:04:04,586
[SPEAKER_88]: Judges praised her work, which explores the African diaspora and black creativity.

2610
04:04:05,087 --> 04:04:06,968
[SPEAKER_88]: Rebecca Jones has this report.

2611
04:04:07,588 --> 04:04:12,852
[SPEAKER_76]: So, the winner of this year's Turner Prize is Lubaina Himid.

2612
04:04:14,155 --> 04:04:23,103
[SPEAKER_29]: And with that, Lubaina Himid made Turner Prize history, the first black woman to win the prize, and at the age of 63, the oldest.

2613
04:04:23,863 --> 04:04:35,153
[SPEAKER_29]: She's an artist who paints, makes collages and installations, but all her work focuses on the black experience in Britain, highlighting racism and the legacy of colonialism.

2614
04:04:36,113 --> 04:04:41,638
[SPEAKER_88]: France's biggest rock star, Johnny Alliday, has died aged 74 after a battle with lung cancer.

2615
04:04:42,178 --> 04:04:48,423
[SPEAKER_88]: In a career spanning five decades, he sold more than 100 million records and headlined 50 major tours.

2616
04:04:49,003 --> 04:04:55,529
[SPEAKER_88]: Influenced by the music of Elvis Presley, Johnny Alliday began his career in 1960, singing rock and roll in French.

2617
04:04:56,109 --> 04:05:01,854
[SPEAKER_88]: Known as the French Elvis, he was hugely popular in the Francophone world, but less well known elsewhere.

2618
04:05:02,374 --> 04:05:03,915
[SPEAKER_88]: He was married five times.

2619
04:05:04,898 --> 04:05:06,569
[SPEAKER_88]: World News from the BBC.

2620
04:05:08,793 --> 04:05:14,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, I'm Jo Fidgen and this is Outlook, taking you around the world one extraordinary story at a time.

2621
04:05:15,198 --> 04:05:21,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Today we'll be hanging out with rebel cows in Italy and foraging for fungi in Bhutan.

2622
04:05:22,783 --> 04:05:31,370
[SPEAKER_14]: But our first story takes place in a prison camp run by children on the border of what is now South Sudan and in a church in Brisbane, Australia.

2623
04:05:31,610 --> 04:05:36,193
[SPEAKER_14]: It links two men in ways that are both disturbing and inspiring.

2624
04:05:36,293 --> 04:05:37,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Both were child soldiers in the 1980s

2625
04:05:38,795 --> 04:05:40,096
[SPEAKER_14]: in Sudan's civil war.

2626
04:05:40,616 --> 04:05:43,917
[SPEAKER_14]: The younger of them, Ayik Shute, was just 13 when he took up arms.

2627
04:05:44,317 --> 04:05:50,200
[SPEAKER_14]: He did it because his father, brother and grandmother had all been killed and he wanted to fight back.

2628
04:05:50,440 --> 04:05:55,422
[SPEAKER_14]: So he joined the Sudan People's Liberation Army and was sent to a training camp in Ethiopia.

2629
04:05:56,062 --> 04:05:57,523
[SPEAKER_108]: The first few weeks was all right.

2630
04:05:58,613 --> 04:06:00,074
[SPEAKER_108]: And then it just got worse.

2631
04:06:00,114 --> 04:06:01,215
[SPEAKER_108]: We're getting trained.

2632
04:06:01,896 --> 04:06:03,557
[SPEAKER_108]: It's on, like, Ethiopian mountain.

2633
04:06:03,998 --> 04:06:05,379
[SPEAKER_108]: So we just climb up there.

2634
04:06:05,499 --> 04:06:09,162
[SPEAKER_108]: Even if you're thirsty, you can't go to the river by yourselves.

2635
04:06:09,202 --> 04:06:11,945
[SPEAKER_108]: When the boss say we got to go and drink, that's when you got to go.

2636
04:06:12,325 --> 04:06:15,308
[SPEAKER_108]: It's like the old age, the stone age, you know?

2637
04:06:16,048 --> 04:06:18,249
[SPEAKER_108]: Everything, we used to use rocks to cut trees.

2638
04:06:18,750 --> 04:06:19,490
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's hard work.

2639
04:06:19,690 --> 04:06:22,492
[SPEAKER_14]: And what were you expected to do apart from that?

2640
04:06:22,892 --> 04:06:24,213
[SPEAKER_108]: Just getting trained every day.

2641
04:06:24,233 --> 04:06:24,833
[SPEAKER_108]: That's it.

2642
04:06:25,113 --> 04:06:26,254
[SPEAKER_108]: Do what the boss say.

2643
04:06:26,354 --> 04:06:29,776
[SPEAKER_108]: In the morning, wake up around 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock in the morning.

2644
04:06:30,436 --> 04:06:32,237
[SPEAKER_108]: You go until 12 o'clock.

2645
04:06:32,597 --> 04:06:35,119
[SPEAKER_108]: Just getting trained in the mountain with using a stick.

2646
04:06:35,780 --> 04:06:36,721
[SPEAKER_108]: to haul it like a gun.

2647
04:06:37,341 --> 04:06:41,124
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, how you attack when you make ambush, all that sort of thing.

2648
04:06:41,184 --> 04:06:44,066
[SPEAKER_108]: And it was just too much running on the mountain, no water.

2649
04:06:44,686 --> 04:06:47,228
[SPEAKER_108]: And you only eat once in the morning, and that's it.

2650
04:06:47,468 --> 04:06:48,069
[SPEAKER_108]: What would you eat?

2651
04:06:48,409 --> 04:06:48,789
[SPEAKER_108]: Corn.

2652
04:06:48,809 --> 04:06:50,490
[SPEAKER_108]: We used to boil corn or rice.

2653
04:06:51,391 --> 04:06:54,473
[SPEAKER_108]: And then we make our own soup or whatever.

2654
04:06:54,493 --> 04:06:59,977
[SPEAKER_108]: We're going to get some tree leaves somewhere, because we're all from different part of Sudan.

2655
04:07:00,317 --> 04:07:04,580
[SPEAKER_108]: So when I came there, you learn to eat other food from other cultures.

2656
04:07:05,504 --> 04:07:08,965
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, other culture that were there with me, other children that were there with me.

2657
04:07:09,145 --> 04:07:13,947
[SPEAKER_14]: When you graduated, as it were, from sticks to guns, what was expected of you?

2658
04:07:14,827 --> 04:07:15,587
[SPEAKER_108]: Just get a fight.

2659
04:07:16,047 --> 04:07:16,427
[SPEAKER_108]: That was it.

2660
04:07:16,747 --> 04:07:17,408
[SPEAKER_14]: And would you fight?

2661
04:07:18,308 --> 04:07:18,688
[SPEAKER_108]: Yeah.

2662
04:07:20,189 --> 04:07:21,589
[SPEAKER_108]: I've been attacked so many times.

2663
04:07:21,789 --> 04:07:23,610
[SPEAKER_108]: And I've seen people dying.

2664
04:07:23,630 --> 04:07:24,970
[SPEAKER_108]: It's too much.

2665
04:07:24,990 --> 04:07:27,971
[SPEAKER_108]: When I used to think of them, I used to cry.

2666
04:07:28,071 --> 04:07:31,172
[SPEAKER_108]: And then after a while, I think it's fading.

2667
04:07:32,874 --> 04:07:37,738
[SPEAKER_108]: The memories is there but it's not as bad as I used to think because I'm grown up now.

2668
04:07:38,059 --> 04:07:39,840
[SPEAKER_108]: But the punishment was so bad.

2669
04:07:40,401 --> 04:07:46,566
[SPEAKER_14]: The punishment was to be sent to a prison at the camp where another child soldier called Anyang had been put in charge.

2670
04:07:47,167 --> 04:07:50,750
[SPEAKER_14]: He and the other young prison guards were known to torture the boys.

2671
04:07:51,490 --> 04:07:58,857
[SPEAKER_108]: Sometimes you have to stand on one feet and every time you take the ground with the other feet you got four people around you that would just whip you

2672
04:08:00,487 --> 04:08:02,789
[SPEAKER_108]: And sometimes you get tied up, like hogtie.

2673
04:08:03,289 --> 04:08:04,611
[SPEAKER_108]: You're only sitting on your chest.

2674
04:08:04,631 --> 04:08:08,414
[SPEAKER_108]: They'll just leave you there for hours, six, seven hours tied up.

2675
04:08:08,815 --> 04:08:10,897
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, the skin does peel off a little bit.

2676
04:08:11,618 --> 04:08:15,061
[SPEAKER_108]: And when you see the skin peel off, he'll put chili in it.

2677
04:08:15,081 --> 04:08:16,923
[SPEAKER_108]: He'll just rub chili in it.

2678
04:08:18,395 --> 04:08:30,865
[SPEAKER_108]: And he'd done it, he'd done it to another child, so I was there with me, and he was tired after so long, and chile was put there, and got infected, and then the doctors couldn't do anything about it, so ended up getting amputated.

2679
04:08:31,466 --> 04:08:33,447
[SPEAKER_14]: You had chile rubbed in your wounds as well, did you?

2680
04:08:33,828 --> 04:08:35,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it happened to me all the time.

2681
04:08:35,629 --> 04:08:38,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you even describe what that feels like?

2682
04:08:39,332 --> 04:08:42,955
[SPEAKER_108]: All I remember, I cry, then you can't cry anymore, you know what I mean?

2683
04:08:44,512 --> 04:08:47,313
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, you want to, and your lunk is gone.

2684
04:08:47,333 --> 04:08:48,854
[SPEAKER_108]: There's nothing that can come out of it.

2685
04:08:49,434 --> 04:08:54,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyang, Iyik's torturer, was a child himself, just a few years older than his prisoner.

2686
04:08:55,397 --> 04:08:59,679
[SPEAKER_108]: I know that he was just bigger than me, and he had the power.

2687
04:08:59,899 --> 04:09:05,021
[SPEAKER_108]: When you would see Anyang, what kind of emotions would come to you?

2688
04:09:05,842 --> 04:09:06,842
[SPEAKER_108]: Back then, there's nothing.

2689
04:09:07,082 --> 04:09:10,924
[SPEAKER_108]: I'd just stand up and just salute him, because that was it.

2690
04:09:11,084 --> 04:09:12,885
[SPEAKER_108]: I was useless at the time, but inside,

2691
04:09:13,619 --> 04:09:15,900
[SPEAKER_108]: I used to pray that I want to get deployed with them.

2692
04:09:16,461 --> 04:09:17,562
[SPEAKER_108]: I want to go to war with them.

2693
04:09:18,322 --> 04:09:19,323
[SPEAKER_108]: That was my prayer.

2694
04:09:19,363 --> 04:09:20,543
[SPEAKER_108]: That was what I used to pray for.

2695
04:09:20,924 --> 04:09:21,144
[SPEAKER_108]: Why?

2696
04:09:22,144 --> 04:09:23,545
[SPEAKER_108]: Because I wanted to kill them.

2697
04:09:24,626 --> 04:09:26,207
[SPEAKER_108]: So bad, so bad.

2698
04:09:26,227 --> 04:09:32,031
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, no one has ever, ever, ever put me through what I went through in the rebel.

2699
04:09:32,391 --> 04:09:35,553
[SPEAKER_108]: No one has ever, ever beat me up like Aung San Suu Kyi did.

2700
04:09:36,365 --> 04:09:44,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Ayik kept trying to run away and each time was caught and punished by Anyang until he'd finished his training and was sent off to fight.

2701
04:09:44,127 --> 04:09:55,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Ayik was on the front lines for four years before his older sister managed to get him away to Kenya to a refugee camp and to his joy he and his relatives were granted a visa to go and live in Australia.

2702
04:09:57,532 --> 04:09:58,652
[SPEAKER_108]: The first night we came here

2703
04:09:59,817 --> 04:10:01,078
[SPEAKER_108]: Oh, man, the sausages.

2704
04:10:01,458 --> 04:10:04,721
[SPEAKER_108]: And I have never eaten so many sausages in my life until I came here.

2705
04:10:05,081 --> 04:10:05,942
[SPEAKER_108]: I even threw up.

2706
04:10:06,623 --> 04:10:11,907
[SPEAKER_108]: I went there, threw up, and then came and ate, because I was thinking, maybe this is just, they're doing it for tonight.

2707
04:10:12,367 --> 04:10:14,209
[SPEAKER_108]: Tomorrow is going to be just the same.

2708
04:10:14,249 --> 04:10:15,710
[SPEAKER_108]: We wouldn't be treated like visitors.

2709
04:10:16,210 --> 04:10:20,614
[SPEAKER_108]: And then the next day, I wake up in the morning, there's breakfast, again, sausages.

2710
04:10:21,374 --> 04:10:22,815
[SPEAKER_108]: I don't even eat sausages anymore.

2711
04:10:22,835 --> 04:10:23,756
[SPEAKER_108]: I hate sausages.

2712
04:10:24,116 --> 04:10:25,117
[SPEAKER_14]: You overdosed on them.

2713
04:10:25,597 --> 04:10:26,298
[SPEAKER_108]: Yeah, I think.

2714
04:10:26,358 --> 04:10:27,019
[SPEAKER_108]: I think I did.

2715
04:10:28,336 --> 04:10:30,277
[SPEAKER_14]: What else did you like about Australia?

2716
04:10:31,138 --> 04:10:33,360
[SPEAKER_108]: Oh, it's just that you'd be able to sleep.

2717
04:10:33,380 --> 04:10:35,202
[SPEAKER_108]: You wouldn't hear a gun.

2718
04:10:35,762 --> 04:10:41,748
[SPEAKER_108]: The first time I heard fireworks, being an ex-child soldier, when I hear bang, bang, I'm just scared.

2719
04:10:41,848 --> 04:10:43,209
[SPEAKER_108]: I'm looking around, what's going on?

2720
04:10:43,569 --> 04:10:47,092
[SPEAKER_108]: And then my brother's little nephew says, yeah, it's the fireworks.

2721
04:10:47,453 --> 04:10:49,715
[SPEAKER_108]: They were kids, and I just get used to it.

2722
04:10:50,176 --> 04:10:52,723
[SPEAKER_108]: If I hear a gun now, I probably wouldn't even think it's a gun.

2723
04:10:52,763 --> 04:10:53,966
[SPEAKER_108]: I'd probably think it's a firework.

2724
04:10:54,307 --> 04:10:56,553
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the most amazing Australian accent.

2725
04:10:56,774 --> 04:10:57,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you really have.

2726
04:10:59,382 --> 04:11:00,343
[SPEAKER_14]: become Australian, huh?

2727
04:11:01,043 --> 04:11:02,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, not really.

2728
04:11:02,764 --> 04:11:06,307
[SPEAKER_108]: Maybe because you're a Pommie, that's why you think I sound like an Aussie.

2729
04:11:06,327 --> 04:11:11,691
[SPEAKER_108]: But if you hear, if you live in Australia, you probably think, nah, I don't even know my accent.

2730
04:11:11,971 --> 04:11:14,092
[SPEAKER_108]: You go to church in Australia, in Brisbane?

2731
04:11:14,112 --> 04:11:14,953
[SPEAKER_108]: Yeah, I go to church.

2732
04:11:15,353 --> 04:11:18,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell us about what happened in church a couple of years after you got there.

2733
04:11:19,036 --> 04:11:20,697
[SPEAKER_108]: A few years ago, I went to church.

2734
04:11:21,557 --> 04:11:22,378
[SPEAKER_108]: I think it was a wedding.

2735
04:11:23,232 --> 04:11:25,293
[SPEAKER_108]: I knew a few people there, hello, how are you doing?

2736
04:11:25,353 --> 04:11:26,534
[SPEAKER_108]: And then we just had to pray.

2737
04:11:26,854 --> 04:11:32,457
[SPEAKER_108]: After everything was done, you know when people shake hands, okay, see you Joe, see you Michael.

2738
04:11:32,897 --> 04:11:35,858
[SPEAKER_108]: And then I look to my right, and I saw this face.

2739
04:11:37,139 --> 04:11:38,980
[SPEAKER_108]: And I thought, oh no, what's going on?

2740
04:11:39,500 --> 04:11:45,583
[SPEAKER_108]: And then I look again, and then I realized the face that I was looking at, it was Anyang.

2741
04:11:46,544 --> 04:11:49,846
[SPEAKER_108]: My mind was telling me, this guy should be dead.

2742
04:11:50,166 --> 04:11:52,587
[SPEAKER_108]: He should have died back home because I thought

2743
04:11:53,390 --> 04:11:55,835
[SPEAKER_108]: If someone didn't kill him, who got killed in the war?

2744
04:11:56,416 --> 04:11:57,217
[SPEAKER_108]: But it was him.

2745
04:11:57,237 --> 04:12:01,646
[SPEAKER_14]: The moment you saw him, you recognised him as the man who'd run the prison, did you?

2746
04:12:01,786 --> 04:12:03,169
[SPEAKER_108]: At first I thought it was a flashback.

2747
04:12:04,456 --> 04:12:08,098
[SPEAKER_108]: And I shook my head like that, wake up, wake up, I was like, what's going on?

2748
04:12:08,158 --> 04:12:10,239
[SPEAKER_108]: And then I look, I said, oh yeah, that's him.

2749
04:12:10,259 --> 04:12:13,360
[SPEAKER_108]: I said, oh, this is the guy that used to torture me.

2750
04:12:13,840 --> 04:12:24,605
[SPEAKER_108]: And this is the guy, every time we run away, he'll send the guard to go and get us, and bring us back there, and then lock us up for up to four weeks, and then release us into training again.

2751
04:12:24,625 --> 04:12:26,346
[SPEAKER_108]: Oh, this, that's him.

2752
04:12:26,366 --> 04:12:30,428
[SPEAKER_108]: Okay, I think I should kill him.

2753
04:12:31,448 --> 04:12:32,068
[SPEAKER_108]: But how?

2754
04:12:32,549 --> 04:12:33,529
[SPEAKER_108]: And then I start thinking,

2755
04:12:34,550 --> 04:12:37,532
[SPEAKER_108]: He's in church, and then I'm in Australia.

2756
04:12:37,872 --> 04:12:41,534
[SPEAKER_108]: If I kill him now, I'll probably get locked up for the rest of my life.

2757
04:12:41,954 --> 04:12:43,595
[SPEAKER_108]: All these sort of things were going on in my mind.

2758
04:12:43,995 --> 04:12:47,337
[SPEAKER_108]: And then the time was over anyway, because it was the end of the service.

2759
04:12:47,857 --> 04:12:49,398
[SPEAKER_108]: And then I never went to that church again.

2760
04:12:50,058 --> 04:12:51,319
[SPEAKER_108]: Because he might be there?

2761
04:12:52,279 --> 04:12:52,820
[SPEAKER_108]: Because of him.

2762
04:12:53,260 --> 04:12:55,101
[SPEAKER_108]: I was very angry, very angry.

2763
04:12:55,929 --> 04:12:58,011
[SPEAKER_108]: I wanted to kill him, but I just didn't know how to do it.

2764
04:12:58,411 --> 04:13:01,853
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, if I found him in Africa, I think it would have been a different story.

2765
04:13:01,873 --> 04:13:07,337
[SPEAKER_108]: If I found him where he had no power and it was in Africa, that's it.

2766
04:13:07,798 --> 04:13:12,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you have anyone in Australia to talk to about it, to talk about your feelings and what you were going through?

2767
04:13:13,263 --> 04:13:15,084
[SPEAKER_108]: No, I didn't want to talk to no one.

2768
04:13:15,744 --> 04:13:18,265
[SPEAKER_108]: I just kept it to myself, even my own family.

2769
04:13:18,785 --> 04:13:20,546
[SPEAKER_108]: My own family didn't even know about it.

2770
04:13:20,906 --> 04:13:25,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Two years, I think it was, after that church sighting, you see Anyang again.

2771
04:13:25,909 --> 04:13:27,029
[SPEAKER_14]: What were the circumstances?

2772
04:13:27,269 --> 04:13:29,110
[SPEAKER_108]: It was at a party, a friend's place.

2773
04:13:30,118 --> 04:13:31,699
[SPEAKER_108]: And then I was drinking.

2774
04:13:32,239 --> 04:13:34,781
[SPEAKER_108]: And then when I'm drinking, you know, I'm a happy person.

2775
04:13:35,601 --> 04:13:37,242
[SPEAKER_108]: I said, hey, how you doing?

2776
04:13:37,663 --> 04:13:39,184
[SPEAKER_108]: I said, yeah, you remember me?

2777
04:13:39,204 --> 04:13:41,605
[SPEAKER_108]: And he said, yeah, of course I remember.

2778
04:13:42,245 --> 04:13:45,948
[SPEAKER_108]: And then I said, man, I swear to God, you're lucky.

2779
04:13:46,428 --> 04:13:47,989
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, Australia saved your life.

2780
04:13:48,889 --> 04:13:50,951
[SPEAKER_108]: From there, I went, I left.

2781
04:13:51,411 --> 04:13:52,091
[SPEAKER_108]: And that was it.

2782
04:13:53,072 --> 04:13:54,453
[SPEAKER_108]: That was the second time I saw him.

2783
04:13:55,213 --> 04:13:58,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Ayat, can you introduce the man sitting next to you right now?

2784
04:14:00,223 --> 04:14:01,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2785
04:14:02,386 --> 04:14:09,616
[SPEAKER_108]: Joe, meet Anyang, Anyang Rang, my ex-boss when I was a child soldier.

2786
04:14:09,636 --> 04:14:11,318
[SPEAKER_108]: He's here sitting next to me.

2787
04:14:12,159 --> 04:14:12,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyang, hello.

2788
04:14:12,800 --> 04:14:13,982
[SPEAKER_108]: Hello.

2789
04:14:16,526 --> 04:14:23,710
[SPEAKER_14]: What can you tell us about seeing Ayik at that party, talking to him, saying you remembered him?

2790
04:14:24,390 --> 04:14:26,231
[SPEAKER_14]: What went through your head?

2791
04:14:26,832 --> 04:14:32,594
[SPEAKER_42]: That was not a good meeting at all, to be honest, because you can judge somebody by their look.

2792
04:14:34,235 --> 04:14:39,498
[SPEAKER_42]: Ayik was coming near to me while he's really, really angry.

2793
04:14:40,913 --> 04:14:44,183
[SPEAKER_42]: So when I see that way, I didn't wait.

2794
04:14:44,604 --> 04:14:46,168
[SPEAKER_42]: I walked away from him.

2795
04:14:46,928 --> 04:14:48,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Ayik couldn't forget about it.

2796
04:14:48,549 --> 04:14:50,049
[SPEAKER_14]: It preyed on his mind.

2797
04:14:50,269 --> 04:14:56,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And then he saw an advert for a new television programme on the Australian channel SBS, Look Me In The Eye.

2798
04:14:56,591 --> 04:15:07,075
[SPEAKER_14]: They were trying to find people who were estranged or had an issue to meet and try to solve their differences through a mediation technique where the parties stare at each other but don't talk, at least at first.

2799
04:15:07,655 --> 04:15:10,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Ayik applied and was invited onto the show.

2800
04:15:10,536 --> 04:15:12,477
[SPEAKER_108]: It's like a warehouse.

2801
04:15:12,937 --> 04:15:14,757
[SPEAKER_108]: There's two seats and that's it.

2802
04:15:15,078 --> 04:15:16,138
[SPEAKER_108]: So I was sitting there

2803
04:15:16,910 --> 04:15:19,292
[SPEAKER_108]: And then I can hear footsteps.

2804
04:15:19,392 --> 04:15:20,452
[SPEAKER_108]: There was someone coming.

2805
04:15:21,393 --> 04:15:23,955
[SPEAKER_108]: And that person came and sat opposite to me.

2806
04:15:24,135 --> 04:15:28,197
[SPEAKER_108]: And I had to raise my head and look straight into his eye.

2807
04:15:28,818 --> 04:15:29,818
[SPEAKER_108]: And that's where we began.

2808
04:15:30,239 --> 04:15:32,260
[SPEAKER_108]: And then from there, the tears start coming.

2809
04:15:32,280 --> 04:15:35,862
[SPEAKER_108]: Because I went back to when I was in my younger age, 13.

2810
04:15:37,323 --> 04:15:38,684
[SPEAKER_108]: I went back to that age.

2811
04:15:39,125 --> 04:15:44,188
[SPEAKER_108]: And all I can remember was, it was that face that used to beat me up.

2812
04:15:45,200 --> 04:15:47,841
[SPEAKER_108]: The phase that I suffer under, I didn't see any change.

2813
04:15:48,461 --> 04:15:51,522
[SPEAKER_108]: Then I just break down, tears start coming, and that's it.

2814
04:15:52,042 --> 04:15:54,323
[SPEAKER_108]: And then what did you do when you were staring at Ayik?

2815
04:15:55,163 --> 04:15:56,264
[SPEAKER_42]: I was really shaking.

2816
04:15:57,204 --> 04:16:03,946
[SPEAKER_42]: I was thinking, if I go and sit next to Ayik, I was not sure what reaction Ayik will have.

2817
04:16:04,706 --> 04:16:12,729
[SPEAKER_42]: And in the beginning, to be honest, Ayik's reaction was not good either to me, because he was crying, upset.

2818
04:16:13,383 --> 04:16:16,606
[SPEAKER_42]: I was even scared that Ayik can do something to me.

2819
04:16:17,446 --> 04:16:23,351
[SPEAKER_42]: So that was a really hard time for me to sit with Ayik and look face to face.

2820
04:16:24,351 --> 04:16:26,933
[SPEAKER_42]: That was really a scary moment for me.

2821
04:16:27,053 --> 04:16:28,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So you were afraid of him?

2822
04:16:28,775 --> 04:16:29,015
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

2823
04:16:29,695 --> 04:16:31,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Were you sorry for what you had done to him?

2824
04:16:32,197 --> 04:16:35,800
[SPEAKER_42]: I was sorry, but I didn't did it intention to Ayik.

2825
04:16:36,631 --> 04:16:40,354
[SPEAKER_42]: That's the order given to me, and I have to implement the order.

2826
04:16:40,654 --> 04:16:42,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you have to be so cruel?

2827
04:16:42,656 --> 04:16:51,002
[SPEAKER_42]: All I say, if my big boss told me, Nyang, your soldiers have to do this, I have to make sure that they done what I was told.

2828
04:16:51,562 --> 04:16:57,407
[SPEAKER_14]: And you didn't have any doubts about the kind of pain, torture you were inflicting on those boys?

2829
04:16:58,027 --> 04:17:01,410
[SPEAKER_42]: To be honest to you, I asked for the forgiveness.

2830
04:17:02,070 --> 04:17:05,813
[SPEAKER_42]: And I told him that what I did, I knew is wrong.

2831
04:17:06,808 --> 04:17:09,269
[SPEAKER_42]: But I was having a big boss ahead of me.

2832
04:17:10,329 --> 04:17:16,592
[SPEAKER_14]: When you heard that from Anyang, when he said, look, you know, I had a boss who was giving me orders, how did you respond to that?

2833
04:17:17,252 --> 04:17:19,093
[SPEAKER_108]: I think maybe he had his own problem.

2834
04:17:19,213 --> 04:17:20,213
[SPEAKER_108]: I really don't understand.

2835
04:17:20,233 --> 04:17:29,177
[SPEAKER_108]: You know, I realize now he's a good person, but there is something that I think that down the track Anyang needs to look into.

2836
04:17:29,437 --> 04:17:32,498
[SPEAKER_108]: Treatment, because he's never been treated with anything at all.

2837
04:17:33,128 --> 04:17:39,995
[SPEAKER_14]: It's clear that there are still many issues between you and yet, Ayik, you said, I realise he is a good person.

2838
04:17:40,676 --> 04:17:41,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Where has that come from?

2839
04:17:41,577 --> 04:17:42,998
[SPEAKER_108]: I forgive him.

2840
04:17:43,058 --> 04:17:45,721
[SPEAKER_108]: I forgive him because he's got two grandkids.

2841
04:17:46,342 --> 04:17:47,523
[SPEAKER_108]: I have one little boy.

2842
04:17:48,420 --> 04:17:50,701
[SPEAKER_108]: And I know how much I love my little boy now.

2843
04:17:50,821 --> 04:17:52,302
[SPEAKER_108]: So I just think the same with Anyang.

2844
04:17:52,362 --> 04:17:55,423
[SPEAKER_108]: I know how much he loves his kids, how much he loves his grandkids.

2845
04:17:56,203 --> 04:18:00,685
[SPEAKER_108]: And if I hold all the grudges for the rest of my life, it's me hurting myself.

2846
04:18:01,186 --> 04:18:04,747
[SPEAKER_108]: Because everywhere I'm going to go here in Brisbane, I'm going to see him and I get angry.

2847
04:18:05,067 --> 04:18:07,808
[SPEAKER_108]: That means that I'm the one hurting myself every time.

2848
04:18:08,289 --> 04:18:09,209
[SPEAKER_108]: That's why I forgive him.

2849
04:18:10,009 --> 04:18:13,351
[SPEAKER_108]: And after I've forgiven him, you know, we become good friends.

2850
04:18:14,283 --> 04:18:15,504
[SPEAKER_108]: I go to his house now.

2851
04:18:15,524 --> 04:18:17,026
[SPEAKER_108]: I sleep there.

2852
04:18:17,366 --> 04:18:19,268
[SPEAKER_108]: Every time I go to his house, there's no spare bed.

2853
04:18:19,328 --> 04:18:20,469
[SPEAKER_108]: I try to sleep on the couch.

2854
04:18:20,489 --> 04:18:22,210
[SPEAKER_108]: He says, no, you sleep in the bed.

2855
04:18:22,230 --> 04:18:24,312
[SPEAKER_108]: I say, all right, I'll sleep in the bed.

2856
04:18:24,693 --> 04:18:25,553
[SPEAKER_108]: They'll give me food.

2857
04:18:25,613 --> 04:18:26,454
[SPEAKER_108]: They give me anything.

2858
04:18:26,634 --> 04:18:30,058
[SPEAKER_108]: If I get into any problem now, I think Anyang will stand up for me, I swear to God.

2859
04:18:30,138 --> 04:18:31,939
[SPEAKER_108]: And if he get in trouble, I'll stand up for him.

2860
04:18:32,360 --> 04:18:39,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that there is somehow a special bond between you, an element of your friendship which is rooted in this

2861
04:18:40,627 --> 04:18:42,709
[SPEAKER_14]: shared experience you had all those years ago?

2862
04:18:43,069 --> 04:18:51,035
[SPEAKER_108]: Yeah, that's the only one I can relate to in a way that this guy understands me as a child because my own family don't even know me.

2863
04:18:54,138 --> 04:19:00,542
[SPEAKER_107]: It's because... Sorry.

2864
04:19:01,103 --> 04:19:04,125
[SPEAKER_107]: Honestly, I've got the best family in the whole world.

2865
04:19:04,165 --> 04:19:07,328
[SPEAKER_107]: My family will look after you before they look after me.

2866
04:19:07,488 --> 04:19:10,190
[SPEAKER_107]: Not because they don't love me, that's how much they care.

2867
04:19:11,687 --> 04:19:13,068
[SPEAKER_107]: They're a very caring family.

2868
04:19:13,469 --> 04:19:14,269
[SPEAKER_107]: They're better than me.

2869
04:19:16,151 --> 04:19:17,352
[SPEAKER_107]: All of them are better than me.

2870
04:19:18,633 --> 04:19:22,035
[SPEAKER_107]: But the thing is, the bad thing is, I don't have a bond with them.

2871
04:19:22,776 --> 04:19:25,538
[SPEAKER_107]: I can go to my mum's house now, just stay there.

2872
04:19:26,499 --> 04:19:28,520
[SPEAKER_107]: After an hour, I want to get out of the house.

2873
04:19:29,161 --> 04:19:35,806
[SPEAKER_107]: Not because I don't love them, but something just takes me out.

2874
04:19:36,627 --> 04:19:38,968
[SPEAKER_107]: There's no bond because I grew away from them.

2875
04:19:39,569 --> 04:19:40,950
[SPEAKER_107]: The best moment of my life.

2876
04:19:41,584 --> 04:19:42,745
[SPEAKER_107]: that I should have spent with them.

2877
04:19:43,786 --> 04:19:45,067
[SPEAKER_107]: I spent it in the rebel.

2878
04:19:47,208 --> 04:19:48,910
[SPEAKER_107]: That's the only sad thing about this.

2879
04:19:49,330 --> 04:19:52,112
[SPEAKER_107]: But apart from that, I forgive Anyang.

2880
04:19:53,533 --> 04:19:55,955
[SPEAKER_107]: And I have so much to achieve, you know.

2881
04:19:55,975 --> 04:19:59,978
[SPEAKER_107]: I want to just move on and try to build a bond with my family now.

2882
04:20:00,358 --> 04:20:01,219
[SPEAKER_107]: That's the next one.

2883
04:20:01,679 --> 04:20:05,302
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a son now, and you can be there with him.

2884
04:20:05,422 --> 04:20:06,843
[SPEAKER_14]: You can be a father to him.

2885
04:20:07,970 --> 04:20:10,252
[SPEAKER_107]: Yeah, I have my son's name Freeman.

2886
04:20:10,672 --> 04:20:11,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Freeman?

2887
04:20:11,813 --> 04:20:15,436
[SPEAKER_107]: Yeah, Freeman, like just Freeman, like a free man, you know, that's when he was born.

2888
04:20:15,496 --> 04:20:21,721
[SPEAKER_107]: I thought, okay, I talked to his mama, said, I think the only name will make me happy after what I went through.

2889
04:20:21,901 --> 04:20:24,684
[SPEAKER_108]: And I think Freeman is a free man.

2890
04:20:24,724 --> 04:20:27,106
[SPEAKER_108]: And I'm a free man now, because I'm in a free country.

2891
04:20:27,326 --> 04:20:28,487
[SPEAKER_108]: So I named him Freeman.

2892
04:20:29,548 --> 04:20:31,089
[SPEAKER_108]: And he's one of the best kid I know.

2893
04:20:31,309 --> 04:20:31,830
[SPEAKER_108]: How old is he?

2894
04:20:32,170 --> 04:20:32,330
[SPEAKER_108]: He's 11.

2895
04:20:33,891 --> 04:20:34,632
[SPEAKER_108]: What kind of boy is he?

2896
04:20:36,007 --> 04:20:39,930
[SPEAKER_108]: Oh, he's a funny boy, you know, he's got that sense of humor, you know.

2897
04:20:39,970 --> 04:20:50,018
[SPEAKER_108]: For example, sometime when I pick him up, we're driving down the street, and then I stop at the light, and I saw this one day we're driving, and there's these two girls looking at us.

2898
04:20:50,458 --> 04:20:52,440
[SPEAKER_108]: I said, Freeman, look at them girls, they're checking me out.

2899
04:20:52,940 --> 04:20:56,163
[SPEAKER_108]: And he said, Dad, because you're ugly.

2900
04:20:56,963 --> 04:20:57,523
[SPEAKER_108]: You know what I mean?

2901
04:20:57,563 --> 04:20:58,664
[SPEAKER_108]: All these little things.

2902
04:20:59,184 --> 04:21:01,084
[SPEAKER_108]: I say no for him because I'm good looking.

2903
04:21:01,324 --> 04:21:03,325
[SPEAKER_108]: I tell him if I was ugly, your mum wouldn't pick me.

2904
04:21:03,525 --> 04:21:05,205
[SPEAKER_108]: So he's got that humour, you know?

2905
04:21:05,225 --> 04:21:06,245
[SPEAKER_108]: He makes me laugh.

2906
04:21:06,266 --> 04:21:08,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Ayik and Anyang meet up often now.

2907
04:21:08,986 --> 04:21:12,347
[SPEAKER_14]: They talk about their past and they started writing a book together.

2908
04:21:12,747 --> 04:21:14,128
[SPEAKER_14]: It means a lot to Anyang.

2909
04:21:14,668 --> 04:21:19,149
[SPEAKER_42]: Now I'm working hard to build a good relationship between me and Ayik.

2910
04:21:20,306 --> 04:21:29,870
[SPEAKER_42]: Because I ignored what I did, and he's the one who forgave me, so it's now my turn to do something to convince him that I was not that bad.

2911
04:21:30,550 --> 04:21:32,711
[SPEAKER_14]: And what did you do to convince him that you're not that bad?

2912
04:21:32,731 --> 04:21:36,012
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, like I have to talk with him every single day.

2913
04:21:36,753 --> 04:21:42,875
[SPEAKER_42]: I have to come and see his child, and he does come and see my kid too.

2914
04:21:44,104 --> 04:21:50,488
[SPEAKER_42]: So, and we just discuss the life, what should we achieve in the life ahead of us.

2915
04:21:50,869 --> 04:21:53,190
[SPEAKER_108]: I wish we didn't go through what we went through.

2916
04:21:53,210 --> 04:21:55,652
[SPEAKER_108]: I wish we started on a good foot.

2917
04:21:55,852 --> 04:22:00,836
[SPEAKER_108]: It would have been better, but my world number one enemy become a good friend to me now.

2918
04:22:01,316 --> 04:22:02,497
[SPEAKER_108]: I think the ending

2919
04:22:03,609 --> 04:22:05,470
[SPEAKER_108]: It's really good.

2920
04:22:06,210 --> 04:22:12,733
[SPEAKER_14]: A remarkable story of two child soldiers from Sudan and their reconciliation in Australia many years later.

2921
04:22:12,753 --> 04:22:18,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Ayik Shute and Anyang Rang, and you can see a photo of them together on our Facebook page.

2922
04:22:19,116 --> 04:22:26,220
[SPEAKER_14]: You're listening to Outlook on the BBC World Service.

2923
04:22:26,400 --> 04:22:31,422
[SPEAKER_14]: To get in touch with any comments, our email address outlook at bbc.com.

2924
04:22:36,915 --> 04:22:42,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Now up in the highest mountains of Bhutan, there's an underground fungus that's very rare and very valuable.

2925
04:22:42,660 --> 04:22:47,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Cordyceps are a group of parasitic fungi that grow mainly on the bodies of insects.

2926
04:22:47,704 --> 04:22:52,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of them are worth twice their weight in gold, and people sometimes risk their lives to find them.

2927
04:22:53,528 --> 04:22:59,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Not everyone going foraging is doing so legally, but Outlook's Canada Beverage has been to meet someone who is above board.

2928
04:23:00,294 --> 04:23:01,034
[SPEAKER_14]: He's called Chawton.

2929
04:23:07,523 --> 04:23:13,307
[SPEAKER_25]: Chawton lives in Nashville, a tiny, picturesque village in Bumthang Valley in central Bhutan.

2930
04:23:13,987 --> 04:23:18,510
[SPEAKER_25]: It's as remote a place as you can imagine, with towering mountains all around.

2931
04:23:23,114 --> 04:23:28,737
[SPEAKER_25]: He and his family have just returned from a month's camping, up where the snow line starts and the air is thin.

2932
04:23:29,378 --> 04:23:34,381
[SPEAKER_25]: He's been collecting this year's harvest of cordyceps and invites me to join him for lunch.

2933
04:23:36,906 --> 04:23:44,300
[SPEAKER_23]: taking our shoes off and going up some large wooden steps hello nice to meet you

2934
04:23:46,348 --> 04:23:48,470
[SPEAKER_23]: So everyone's cooking.

2935
04:23:48,750 --> 04:23:49,550
[SPEAKER_23]: Local dish, ma'am.

2936
04:23:49,750 --> 04:23:50,211
[SPEAKER_23]: Local dish.

2937
04:23:50,231 --> 04:23:50,771
[SPEAKER_23]: What is it?

2938
04:23:50,851 --> 04:23:51,712
[SPEAKER_23]: Flat noodles.

2939
04:23:52,412 --> 04:23:53,073
[SPEAKER_23]: Flat noodles.

2940
04:23:53,153 --> 04:23:54,173
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, they look delicious.

2941
04:23:54,233 --> 04:23:55,374
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that what we're having for lunch?

2942
04:23:55,794 --> 04:23:57,195
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2943
04:23:57,335 --> 04:24:01,278
[SPEAKER_25]: Chorten's daughter and wife bring out an incredible array of sumptuous food.

2944
04:24:01,298 --> 04:24:06,982
[SPEAKER_25]: A meal like this would once have been impossible for this family, says Chorten.

2945
04:24:07,542 --> 04:24:09,984
[SPEAKER_25]: That was until he discovered cordyceps.

2946
04:24:13,387 --> 04:24:20,656
[SPEAKER_56]: When I was young and herding cattle, I knew about codices, but I didn't realize them, that they were so valuable.

2947
04:24:21,677 --> 04:24:25,561
[SPEAKER_56]: The demand for them was started by the Chinese, who used them medicinally.

2948
04:24:26,462 --> 04:24:30,983
[SPEAKER_25]: Cordyceps grow in the fertile high plateaus and mountains of Tibet and Bhutan.

2949
04:24:31,643 --> 04:24:33,704
[SPEAKER_25]: They're antioxidant and antiviral.

2950
04:24:34,124 --> 04:24:41,906
[SPEAKER_25]: It's for this reason and their scarcity that they fetch such high sums of money, sometimes priced at twice their weight in gold.

2951
04:24:43,706 --> 04:24:45,427
[SPEAKER_25]: We've got some cordyceps in front of us.

2952
04:24:45,667 --> 04:24:46,867
[SPEAKER_25]: They're very strange looking.

2953
04:24:46,927 --> 04:24:52,109
[SPEAKER_25]: It's sort of like a caterpillar with a long strangled root coming out of it.

2954
04:24:53,629 --> 04:24:57,192
[SPEAKER_25]: The odd appearance of the cordyceps is due to its unique nature.

2955
04:24:58,152 --> 04:25:03,877
[SPEAKER_25]: It starts life as an underground dwelling caterpillar that becomes infected by a parasitic fungus.

2956
04:25:04,717 --> 04:25:09,601
[SPEAKER_25]: The fungus engulfs the body of the caterpillar, leaving only its exoskeleton intact.

2957
04:25:10,161 --> 04:25:16,346
[SPEAKER_25]: Then, at the start of spring, the fungus explodes through the caterpillar's head, poking a stalk up through the grass.

2958
04:25:19,909 --> 04:25:24,412
[SPEAKER_56]: By looking at the top of the fungus, I can tell whether or not it is cordyceps.

2959
04:25:24,653 --> 04:25:28,875
[SPEAKER_56]: It has a thing that looks like a black blade of grass poking out of the soil.

2960
04:25:29,876 --> 04:25:35,680
[SPEAKER_56]: You have to be very close to the ground and be on your hands and knees with your face about a foot from the ground.

2961
04:25:36,561 --> 04:25:38,262
[SPEAKER_56]: They are very difficult to spot.

2962
04:25:38,762 --> 04:25:44,526
[SPEAKER_56]: I remember the first one I found, I was so happy because I was thinking how much money I would get.

2963
04:25:45,507 --> 04:25:46,988
[SPEAKER_56]: They literally are like gold.

2964
04:25:47,008 --> 04:25:50,189
[SPEAKER_56]: But nowadays, I don't think so much about the money.

2965
04:25:50,629 --> 04:25:55,650
[SPEAKER_56]: I just feel immense happiness just to see one cordyceps because they are precious to me.

2966
04:25:56,311 --> 04:26:01,772
[SPEAKER_25]: Searching for cordyceps takes place from early May until late June, up where the snow line starts.

2967
04:26:02,333 --> 04:26:05,454
[SPEAKER_25]: Chawton shows me the track he takes up to the mountain pass.

2968
04:26:05,994 --> 04:26:06,814
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow, look at that.

2969
04:26:06,874 --> 04:26:07,734
[SPEAKER_23]: That's so steep.

2970
04:26:07,794 --> 04:26:12,316
[SPEAKER_23]: How long does it take you to get up to where we can see just the top of the mountain?

2971
04:26:13,317 --> 04:26:18,881
[SPEAKER_56]: To reach the summit where the snow line is, it takes three nights and four days.

2972
04:26:19,522 --> 04:26:28,469
[SPEAKER_56]: I pack enough food to eat and drink, and a raincoat and heavy woolen clothes to protect against the cold if it snows.

2973
04:26:29,770 --> 04:26:32,032
[SPEAKER_56]: We also need a tent and a sleeping bag.

2974
04:26:33,277 --> 04:26:34,498
[SPEAKER_56]: We have to take horses.

2975
04:26:35,339 --> 04:26:39,603
[SPEAKER_56]: When we camp, it can be hard to get wood for the fire and to pitch our tent.

2976
04:26:40,264 --> 04:26:42,546
[SPEAKER_56]: Sometimes I'll be going with 20 people.

2977
04:26:43,286 --> 04:26:46,209
[SPEAKER_56]: Sometimes it can be as many as 200 to 300 people.

2978
04:26:46,489 --> 04:26:48,932
[SPEAKER_25]: Looking for cordyceps is not an easy task.

2979
04:26:49,452 --> 04:26:56,654
[SPEAKER_25]: The altitude and vertiginous terrain means even the most experienced locals may lose their lives, and many do.

2980
04:26:57,314 --> 04:27:04,377
[SPEAKER_25]: Once Chawton has collected all his cordyceps, he brings them down the mountain and waits for the auction date to be set, when he can sell them.

2981
04:27:05,037 --> 04:27:15,060
[SPEAKER_25]: When he first started selling them, he was making around US$4,000 a year, but in recent years his profits have been far less because the fungus is getting harder to find.

2982
04:27:15,800 --> 04:27:18,621
[SPEAKER_25]: This year's crop was even smaller than usual.

2983
04:27:22,522 --> 04:27:25,025
[SPEAKER_56]: This must be around 130 grams.

2984
04:27:25,386 --> 04:27:28,330
[SPEAKER_56]: This would be worth around 1000 US dollars.

2985
04:27:28,470 --> 04:27:31,153
[SPEAKER_23]: And how has it changed your life, finding these cordyceps?

2986
04:27:31,433 --> 04:27:38,843
[SPEAKER_56]: I paid for my house, the car parked outside, the TV, and the education of my children with money from cordyceps.

2987
04:27:39,734 --> 04:27:43,516
[SPEAKER_56]: It has improved everybody's living standard so much.

2988
04:27:43,836 --> 04:27:47,037
[SPEAKER_56]: We have everything we need because of this amazing fungus.

2989
04:27:48,077 --> 04:27:57,621
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm hopeful that I'll be able to continue for the next five years, and then I'm not sure whether my body will endure the challenges of walking up to the mountains.

2990
04:27:58,081 --> 04:28:00,562
[SPEAKER_56]: If my children are going to carry on, it is good.

2991
04:28:01,203 --> 04:28:03,544
[SPEAKER_56]: If not, I guess that will be the end of cordyceps.

2992
04:28:04,204 --> 04:28:06,665
[SPEAKER_27]: Chawton, speaking to Outlook's Canada Beverage.

2993
04:28:08,095 --> 04:28:11,557
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the BBC World Service, where science lives.

2994
04:28:12,157 --> 04:28:13,238
[SPEAKER_27]: For the creative.

2995
04:28:13,458 --> 04:28:17,900
[SPEAKER_36]: With drones, we can get blood anywhere in the country in 15 to 20 minutes.

2996
04:28:18,160 --> 04:28:19,021
[SPEAKER_89]: The curious.

2997
04:28:19,101 --> 04:28:26,164
[SPEAKER_89]: When we looked at our twins, we found there were certain microbes that were always present in the skinnier twins than in the overweight twins.

2998
04:28:26,305 --> 04:28:27,405
[SPEAKER_12]: For nature lovers.

2999
04:28:27,685 --> 04:28:32,908
[SPEAKER_12]: With our extensive agriculture, our use of pesticides, this could become a really big problem.

3000
04:28:32,968 --> 04:28:34,669
[SPEAKER_12]: And forward thinkers.

3001
04:28:34,909 --> 04:28:39,592
[SPEAKER_93]: It demonstrates what I think robotics is for, which is helping us to understand ourselves.

3002
04:28:40,032 --> 04:28:40,892
[SPEAKER_25]: The thoughtful.

3003
04:28:41,292 --> 04:28:47,636
[SPEAKER_36]: Everything that's already happened has happened, and everything that's going to happen has already taken place, and we're just a little piece of it now.

3004
04:28:47,996 --> 04:28:49,297
[SPEAKER_25]: And the adventurous.

3005
04:28:49,337 --> 04:28:56,281
[SPEAKER_50]: We keep finding ever more compelling evidence for not only water on Mars, but now even the potential for life.

3006
04:28:56,741 --> 04:28:58,442
[SPEAKER_29]: For our remarkable world.

3007
04:29:03,252 --> 04:29:06,834
[SPEAKER_27]: World Service at bbcworldservice.com.

3008
04:29:08,195 --> 04:29:13,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming up on Outlook, what happens when a herd of cattle run away from their owners and live wild for years?

3009
04:29:16,339 --> 04:29:20,141
[SPEAKER_97]: The most interesting thing about the rebel cows is that their behaviour changed.

3010
04:29:20,662 --> 04:29:22,643
[SPEAKER_97]: They turn into a wild herd.

3011
04:29:22,963 --> 04:29:26,965
[SPEAKER_97]: They hide in the forest during the day and only come out to graze at night.

3012
04:29:27,345 --> 04:29:28,986
[SPEAKER_97]: They are extremely agile.

3013
04:29:29,327 --> 04:29:31,528
[SPEAKER_97]: They run and jump around like deer.

3014
04:29:33,465 --> 04:29:36,941
[SPEAKER_14]: more about the rebel cows still at large after the news.

3015
04:29:38,893 --> 04:29:40,654
[SPEAKER_88]: BBC News with Gareth Barlow.

3016
04:29:41,334 --> 04:29:42,115
[SPEAKER_88]: Senior U.S.

3017
04:29:42,175 --> 04:29:47,137
[SPEAKER_88]: officials say President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel later on Wednesday.

3018
04:29:47,578 --> 04:29:53,141
[SPEAKER_88]: He'll also direct the State Department to start the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

3019
04:29:53,581 --> 04:29:55,442
[SPEAKER_88]: The decision will break with years of U.S.

3020
04:29:55,482 --> 04:30:00,024
[SPEAKER_88]: policy on the status of the disputed city, as well as the international consensus.

3021
04:30:00,585 --> 04:30:04,027
[SPEAKER_88]: Arab states have warned the decision could provoke violence in the Muslim world.

3022
04:30:05,047 --> 04:30:15,600
[SPEAKER_88]: Russia has reacted angrily to a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban its participation in next year's Winter Olympics, following a report accusing it of systematic doping.

3023
04:30:16,121 --> 04:30:20,306
[SPEAKER_88]: The deputy speaker of the Russian parliament called the ban a humiliation and an insult.

3024
04:30:21,347 --> 04:30:26,451
[SPEAKER_88]: Tens of thousands of people in Southern California have fled wildfires being driven by high winds.

3025
04:30:27,052 --> 04:30:32,036
[SPEAKER_88]: One fire in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, trebled in size in just a few hours.

3026
04:30:32,536 --> 04:30:37,800
[SPEAKER_88]: At least 150 buildings have been destroyed, and a quarter of a million homes are without power.

3027
04:30:38,821 --> 04:30:46,746
[SPEAKER_88]: Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the campaigning journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

3028
04:30:47,267 --> 04:30:51,109
[SPEAKER_88]: Alfred and Giorgio De Giorgio and Vince Muscat were arrested on Monday.

3029
04:30:51,470 --> 04:30:52,931
[SPEAKER_88]: They have pleaded not guilty.

3030
04:30:54,027 --> 04:31:03,653
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition in Honduras has demanded a full recount of the presidential election ballot papers, which it says were tampered with in order to favour President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

3031
04:31:04,213 --> 04:31:11,117
[SPEAKER_88]: The opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla, had appeared on course for victory after the election, when the count was suddenly halted.

3032
04:31:12,336 --> 04:31:16,379
[SPEAKER_88]: France's biggest rock star, Johnny Allardy, has died from lung cancer at the age of 74.

3033
04:31:17,739 --> 04:31:23,983
[SPEAKER_88]: In a career spanning five decades, he'd sold more than 100 million records and headlined 50 major concerts.

3034
04:31:24,624 --> 04:31:33,789
[SPEAKER_88]: Known as the French Elvis, he was hugely popular in the Francophone world, but less well-known elsewhere, earning him the nickname, the biggest rock star you've never heard of.

3035
04:31:34,450 --> 04:31:36,091
[SPEAKER_88]: World News from the BBC.

3036
04:31:38,500 --> 04:31:40,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, I'm Jo Fidgen, and you're tuned to Outlook.

3037
04:31:41,201 --> 04:31:48,924
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Russia is finding out today whether its athletes will be allowed to compete in next year's Winter Olympics in South Korea after a doping scandal.

3038
04:31:49,505 --> 04:31:56,428
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're listening to the live edition of Outlook at 12 hours GMT, we're still in the dark about the decision by the International Olympic Committee.

3039
04:31:56,928 --> 04:32:01,490
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're listening to the rebroadcast later in the day, then you'll probably know what happened.

3040
04:32:02,190 --> 04:32:05,331
[SPEAKER_14]: But we thought we'd take you back to how the whole scandal broke.

3041
04:32:05,511 --> 04:32:11,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Last year, we spoke to the couple who helped blow the whistle on what was happening, Yulia and Vitaly Stepanov.

3042
04:32:11,712 --> 04:32:13,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Yulia is a Russian runner.

3043
04:32:13,312 --> 04:32:14,512
[SPEAKER_14]: She does the 800 meters.

3044
04:32:15,092 --> 04:32:20,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And when they met eight years ago, Vitaly worked for the country's anti-doping agency, Rosada.

3045
04:32:20,993 --> 04:32:22,354
[SPEAKER_14]: They fell in love, got married.

3046
04:32:22,974 --> 04:32:29,735
[SPEAKER_14]: But the complicating factor in their relationship was that Yulia was on a regular drug-taking regime to enhance her running.

3047
04:32:30,995 --> 04:32:33,897
[SPEAKER_31]: I took steroids and EPO.

3048
04:32:35,739 --> 04:32:46,567
[SPEAKER_31]: Steroids helped me to build up my muscles and be quicker, faster, stronger, and EPO helped me to be stronger as well.

3049
04:32:48,708 --> 04:32:57,152
[SPEAKER_31]: that coaches always, always told us that actually it's not only us who take illegal drugs and doping, that everyone does it.

3050
04:32:57,892 --> 04:33:04,735
[SPEAKER_31]: And when you hear these things from them, obviously you don't think that it's a lie.

3051
04:33:04,876 --> 04:33:14,880
[SPEAKER_31]: You trust them because you see all the achievements, previous achievements of Russian sportsmen, Russian champions, and you sort of think that should be okay.

3052
04:33:19,422 --> 04:33:29,167
[SPEAKER_65]: I guess I somewhat preferred to close my eyes to this, because I was not doing doping controls at that point that much.

3053
04:33:29,387 --> 04:33:31,748
[SPEAKER_65]: I was mainly involved with educational programs.

3054
04:33:32,508 --> 04:33:40,892
[SPEAKER_65]: So I thought, well, maybe I'll just try to continue doing my job, knowing what's really happening, and see what happens.

3055
04:33:43,233 --> 04:33:54,665
[SPEAKER_65]: Obviously, as we got married with Julie and we had the honeymoon and we had our first real fight where we started to talk about her preparation for the winter season.

3056
04:33:56,367 --> 04:34:01,993
[SPEAKER_65]: And I said, well, maybe we can try to prepare a different way without doping.

3057
04:34:03,283 --> 04:34:04,404
[SPEAKER_65]: And she was completely right.

3058
04:34:04,424 --> 04:34:05,745
[SPEAKER_65]: She said, well, are you a coach?

3059
04:34:05,865 --> 04:34:06,845
[SPEAKER_65]: Do you know any other way?

3060
04:34:07,406 --> 04:34:08,486
[SPEAKER_65]: And I had no answer.

3061
04:34:09,007 --> 04:34:11,128
[SPEAKER_65]: We had to change the topic of the conversation.

3062
04:34:11,288 --> 04:34:16,992
[SPEAKER_65]: But from that point on, we kind of knew that within the family, we have different opinions.

3063
04:34:17,812 --> 04:34:24,156
[SPEAKER_31]: Our relations were based on Vitaly's loyalty.

3064
04:34:24,216 --> 04:34:26,078
[SPEAKER_31]: He really didn't want to divorce.

3065
04:34:26,178 --> 04:34:28,019
[SPEAKER_31]: He really wanted to save our marriage.

3066
04:34:28,619 --> 04:34:29,520
[SPEAKER_65]: It was difficult.

3067
04:34:29,620 --> 04:34:37,347
[SPEAKER_65]: This part of the relationship was really difficult, and both of us still don't understand how we were able to get through those years without getting divorced.

3068
04:34:37,827 --> 04:34:41,891
[SPEAKER_14]: All the while Vitaly was struggling with what to do with the information Yulia had given him.

3069
04:34:42,051 --> 04:34:47,976
[SPEAKER_14]: He had some contacts at the World Anti-Daping Agency, WADA, and was considering becoming a whistleblower.

3070
04:34:48,456 --> 04:34:50,978
[SPEAKER_65]: I had to make up my own mind, what do I do?

3071
04:34:52,239 --> 04:34:59,285
[SPEAKER_65]: Do I go against, I guess you can say against even my own home country and do I share the information with WADA?

3072
04:34:59,966 --> 04:35:12,857
[SPEAKER_65]: And in the end I was invited to Vancouver to the Olympic Games and I spoke to one of the persons from WADA and I said I'm concerned about some things that I'm seeing and I think I should share it with you.

3073
04:35:14,158 --> 04:35:16,219
[SPEAKER_65]: From that moment on I started telling

3074
04:35:17,412 --> 04:35:20,054
[SPEAKER_65]: to my point of context, at what I was seeing.

3075
04:35:20,074 --> 04:35:27,921
[SPEAKER_65]: I have to tell how I know things, and yeah, I said that my wife is involved in it as well, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

3076
04:35:28,021 --> 04:35:31,603
[SPEAKER_65]: I mean, that's completely against the code, but this is the Russian reality.

3077
04:35:32,304 --> 04:35:38,789
[SPEAKER_65]: Ever since I came back from Vancouver, I openly started to complain about the things that Rosada was not doing correctly.

3078
04:35:39,770 --> 04:35:45,655
[SPEAKER_65]: Obviously, my bosses did not like that, and at some point, they openly started to try to get rid of me.

3079
04:35:46,547 --> 04:35:51,676
[SPEAKER_65]: And finally, in February 2011, there was a reorganization, restructure.

3080
04:35:52,718 --> 04:35:57,487
[SPEAKER_65]: It was kind of expected that I will not be kept in the newly restructured organization.

3081
04:35:58,343 --> 04:36:05,953
[SPEAKER_14]: After Vitaly lost his job in February 2013, Yulia failed a drugs test and was banned from competing for two years.

3082
04:36:06,414 --> 04:36:16,747
[SPEAKER_65]: It turned out that Yulia is going to become a scapegoat, even though the officials in Russia were saying that if you follow the system, you will never be sanctioned and we'll protect you.

3083
04:36:18,375 --> 04:36:24,779
[SPEAKER_30]: But then it turned out that it's just not true.

3084
04:36:24,799 --> 04:36:28,422
[SPEAKER_30]: Disqualification changed everything.

3085
04:36:29,302 --> 04:36:31,063
[SPEAKER_31]: It actually saved our marriage.

3086
04:36:31,724 --> 04:36:35,406
[SPEAKER_31]: Because after I was disqualified, I had three choices.

3087
04:36:35,686 --> 04:36:44,052
[SPEAKER_31]: First, to continue and to keep silent and to continue taking drugs and be a part of this existing system.

3088
04:36:44,853 --> 04:36:51,361
[SPEAKER_31]: The second choice was just to end up my career and just leave this big sport.

3089
04:36:51,841 --> 04:36:58,730
[SPEAKER_31]: And the third one was actually to tell the truth to everyone about what's happening in the Russian sport with the doping.

3090
04:36:59,852 --> 04:37:08,935
[SPEAKER_31]: I've decided to choose a third way to tell the truth and actually to find the system.

3091
04:37:09,155 --> 04:37:23,740
[SPEAKER_31]: We've decided that our marriage is the main thing and we should be together, we should fight together all this illegal stuff and I had enough

3092
04:37:25,160 --> 04:37:28,141
[SPEAKER_31]: strength to see the world in real terms.

3093
04:37:29,002 --> 04:37:31,062
[SPEAKER_31]: So, for our family it was a blessing.

3094
04:37:31,082 --> 04:37:32,423
[SPEAKER_31]: This crisis was a blessing.

3095
04:37:32,923 --> 04:37:42,887
[SPEAKER_30]: Yulia started making secret recordings of her meetings with people involved in Russian doping.

3096
04:37:42,987 --> 04:37:47,409
[SPEAKER_14]: The couple then approached a German investigative journalist, Hajo Seppelt, with their evidence.

3097
04:37:48,009 --> 04:37:52,751
[SPEAKER_14]: They agreed to take part in a documentary which was to be aired on German television.

3098
04:37:53,251 --> 04:37:55,812
[SPEAKER_65]: We could never imagine that we would actually go public with it.

3099
04:37:56,832 --> 04:38:04,856
[SPEAKER_65]: It was in the beginning of 2014, more than a year after officially Yulei was providing statements, providing audio recordings.

3100
04:38:06,436 --> 04:38:14,540
[SPEAKER_65]: We met Hajo Zeppelt, and we spoke to him, and he was actually the one who said, we got to try to fight this.

3101
04:38:15,220 --> 04:38:17,261
[SPEAKER_65]: The more evidence we have, the better it would be.

3102
04:38:18,141 --> 04:38:20,482
[SPEAKER_65]: Unfortunately, you know, as a journalist, he cannot

3103
04:38:21,670 --> 04:38:23,231
[SPEAKER_65]: help us with getting the evidence.

3104
04:38:24,212 --> 04:38:36,980
[SPEAKER_65]: So Julia was just talking to different athletes, coaches, and officials, just having normal conversations, only the difference was she always had her phone voice recording program on all the time.

3105
04:38:37,701 --> 04:38:40,383
[SPEAKER_65]: We left the country, Russia, right before the documentary.

3106
04:38:40,723 --> 04:38:50,690
[SPEAKER_65]: We knew that the reaction will be negative because protecting at least systematic doping in Russia, it's called being a patriot in Russia.

3107
04:38:51,801 --> 04:38:59,747
[SPEAKER_65]: And even though I do not share this point of view, I could understand that as soon as this information is out, we will be called traitors and liars.

3108
04:39:00,508 --> 04:39:02,069
[SPEAKER_65]: And that's exactly what happened.

3109
04:39:02,349 --> 04:39:07,013
[SPEAKER_65]: So I had to make sure that we go public, but that our family feels safe.

3110
04:39:07,133 --> 04:39:09,775
[SPEAKER_65]: And I knew that we wouldn't feel safe in Russia.

3111
04:39:10,580 --> 04:39:15,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Yulia and Vitaly watched the story break from their temporary home in Germany.

3112
04:39:15,687 --> 04:39:21,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Soon the World Anti-Doping Agency commissioned an independent commission to investigate the claims made in that documentary.

3113
04:39:21,895 --> 04:39:26,301
[SPEAKER_14]: The report confirmed the existence of widespread cheating in Russia through doping.

3114
04:39:27,202 --> 04:39:36,428
[SPEAKER_14]: The aftermath has been bittersweet for the couple, as Yulia has since been banned from competing at the Rio Olympics because of her own doping charge in 2013.

3115
04:39:40,931 --> 04:39:43,933
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't want to whitewash my own past.

3116
04:39:44,013 --> 04:39:52,599
[SPEAKER_31]: Obviously, I know what I did was wrong, and I want to apologize before all the clean athletes for what I did.

3117
04:39:53,319 --> 04:39:54,119
[SPEAKER_31]: But you know what?

3118
04:39:54,460 --> 04:39:55,781
[SPEAKER_31]: I cannot change my past.

3119
04:39:56,601 --> 04:40:08,612
[SPEAKER_31]: The only thing I can do is actually try to change the current situation and the future and to be just another person.

3120
04:40:08,972 --> 04:40:16,659
[SPEAKER_65]: Right from the beginning, I understood that, unfortunately, the best supporters in doping fighting are investigative journalists.

3121
04:40:18,153 --> 04:40:24,075
[SPEAKER_65]: If a journalist approaches us and wants to talk to us and wants to hear us, we will tell our story.

3122
04:40:25,036 --> 04:40:29,518
[SPEAKER_65]: It's not a pretty story, but it's a real story and we are telling the truth.

3123
04:40:29,578 --> 04:40:37,461
[SPEAKER_65]: We will keep apologizing for our own mistakes and we are trying to change and at least as a family I am sure that we are doing a good job.

3124
04:40:38,221 --> 04:40:42,943
[SPEAKER_65]: A new relationship is not easy to build, but we are working on it and it's improving.

3125
04:40:44,030 --> 04:40:47,132
[SPEAKER_65]: We have a two-year-old son, and we try to be good parents now.

3126
04:40:50,134 --> 04:40:54,677
[SPEAKER_30]: Even I was banned from the Rio Olympic Games.

3127
04:40:55,358 --> 04:41:02,662
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that we made the right choice, because it didn't affect our marriage, it didn't affect our relations.

3128
04:41:06,317 --> 04:41:09,620
[SPEAKER_31]: young athletes will help sport in future.

3129
04:41:09,640 --> 04:41:12,922
[SPEAKER_30]: Yulia and Vitaly Stepanov speaking in 2016.

3130
04:41:12,962 --> 04:41:13,803
[SPEAKER_30]: They're still in hiding.

3131
04:41:21,268 --> 04:41:29,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we're off to the north of Italy, to the valleys around the city of Genoa, where a herd of cattle has been making the headlines after running away from their owner.

3132
04:41:29,853 --> 04:41:32,335
[SPEAKER_14]: They've been dubbed the rebel cows.

3133
04:41:33,015 --> 04:41:39,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get the story from local scientist and documentary maker Alessandro Ghigi, who's been following the rebel cows deep into the woods.

3134
04:41:40,320 --> 04:41:41,921
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a territory he knows well.

3135
04:41:42,741 --> 04:41:50,845
[SPEAKER_97]: I grew up in a city, but I've always been passionate about science and nature.

3136
04:41:51,446 --> 04:41:55,088
[SPEAKER_97]: My dad is a hunter and we would always go hiking in the countryside.

3137
04:41:55,548 --> 04:41:59,570
[SPEAKER_97]: He would be killing animals, while I was more interested in taking pictures of them.

3138
04:42:00,630 --> 04:42:03,192
[SPEAKER_97]: I soon became a keen bird watcher.

3139
04:42:03,732 --> 04:42:09,375
[SPEAKER_97]: I got used to hide in the bushes, completely still, waiting for hours for a bird to approach.

3140
04:42:12,458 --> 04:42:17,640
[SPEAKER_97]: Throughout the years, I became very familiar with the mountains and woods surrounding Genoa.

3141
04:42:18,000 --> 04:42:21,961
[SPEAKER_97]: It's a very harsh place, with narrow valleys and steep slopes.

3142
04:42:22,741 --> 04:42:24,442
[SPEAKER_97]: It's also a wild place.

3143
04:42:24,602 --> 04:42:27,303
[SPEAKER_97]: Wolves and wild boars inhabit these forests.

3144
04:42:30,593 --> 04:42:34,499
[SPEAKER_97]: I normally go hiking there with some friends looking for wild animals to photograph.

3145
04:42:35,039 --> 04:42:38,985
[SPEAKER_97]: One day we heard a story from a local that caught our attention.

3146
04:42:39,506 --> 04:42:41,989
[SPEAKER_97]: It's the story of the rebel cows.

3147
04:42:50,504 --> 04:42:53,709
[SPEAKER_97]: The rebel cows are a mysterious presence in these valleys.

3148
04:42:54,149 --> 04:42:57,334
[SPEAKER_97]: It's a herd that has been living in the wild for almost seven years.

3149
04:42:57,974 --> 04:43:02,441
[SPEAKER_97]: They're a very elusive bunch and they're surrounded by an aura of mystery.

3150
04:43:03,142 --> 04:43:06,286
[SPEAKER_97]: Everybody who lives in the villages up here has a story to tell about them.

3151
04:43:08,507 --> 04:43:14,510
[SPEAKER_97]: This group of cows must have had something special to begin with, to be able to break free in the way they did.

3152
04:43:14,530 --> 04:43:16,091
[SPEAKER_97]: It's just unbelievable.

3153
04:43:16,551 --> 04:43:19,713
[SPEAKER_97]: I don't know much about how they managed to escape in the first place.

3154
04:43:20,393 --> 04:43:21,294
[SPEAKER_97]: It must have been around 2010.

3155
04:43:22,915 --> 04:43:25,596
[SPEAKER_97]: People told us that they belonged to a local farmer.

3156
04:43:25,856 --> 04:43:28,597
[SPEAKER_97]: They had been sold and they had to be driven away.

3157
04:43:29,258 --> 04:43:37,102
[SPEAKER_97]: But as the farmer was trying to get them into a lorry, a small group of them broke free and they simply disappeared in the bushes.

3158
04:43:38,240 --> 04:43:41,221
[SPEAKER_97]: Since then, the rebel cows have been living in the woods.

3159
04:43:57,847 --> 04:44:00,888
[SPEAKER_97]: Local authorities tried everything they could to catch them.

3160
04:44:01,595 --> 04:44:05,017
[SPEAKER_97]: They even brought in expert cowboys, but nothing worked.

3161
04:44:05,878 --> 04:44:10,820
[SPEAKER_97]: And because of the nature of these wild valleys, it's incredibly difficult to build traps.

3162
04:44:11,301 --> 04:44:17,004
[SPEAKER_121]: The rebel cows are still at large.

3163
04:44:17,044 --> 04:44:23,127
[SPEAKER_97]: My friends and I were immediately captivated by the story of the rebel cows and by their indomitable spirit.

3164
04:44:23,327 --> 04:44:24,808
[SPEAKER_97]: We don't know how big the herd is.

3165
04:44:25,249 --> 04:44:26,870
[SPEAKER_97]: A few years ago, it was of about 15.

3166
04:44:28,387 --> 04:44:31,429
[SPEAKER_97]: We know there's a bull among them, and calves have been born.

3167
04:44:32,250 --> 04:44:37,013
[SPEAKER_97]: But throughout the years, the herd was decimated by diseases and natural deaths.

3168
04:44:37,653 --> 04:44:44,378
[SPEAKER_97]: Some of them have been found dead in ditches, horribly wounded, because, unfortunately, poachers are operating in the area.

3169
04:44:45,062 --> 04:44:46,802
[SPEAKER_97]: and they are looking for the cows too.

3170
04:44:47,383 --> 04:44:49,663
[SPEAKER_97]: Now we think there are only six cows left.

3171
04:44:54,104 --> 04:44:58,265
[SPEAKER_97]: But I mean, you have to give them credit.

3172
04:44:58,305 --> 04:45:04,746
[SPEAKER_97]: The rebel cows have been living in the wild for seven years and survived several attempts of capturing or killing them.

3173
04:45:05,186 --> 04:45:06,347
[SPEAKER_97]: It's a unique case.

3174
04:45:08,567 --> 04:45:12,348
[SPEAKER_97]: The most interesting thing about the rebel cows is that their behavior changed.

3175
04:45:12,888 --> 04:45:14,851
[SPEAKER_97]: They turned into a wild herd.

3176
04:45:18,054 --> 04:45:21,939
[SPEAKER_97]: Because of their elusive attitude, it's almost impossible to study them.

3177
04:45:22,840 --> 04:45:27,124
[SPEAKER_97]: So my friends and I decided to put together a little documentary about them.

3178
04:45:27,885 --> 04:45:33,271
[SPEAKER_97]: We positioned several hidden cameras in the woods, in places where we thought they might roam around.

3179
04:45:35,911 --> 04:45:38,313
[SPEAKER_97]: We didn't have to wait long to get our first footage.

3180
04:45:38,854 --> 04:45:43,398
[SPEAKER_97]: One day, my friend Paolo went to collect the SD card from the camera, and he called me.

3181
04:45:43,679 --> 04:45:46,201
[SPEAKER_97]: He was so excited, he screamed, we have the cows!

3182
04:45:46,782 --> 04:45:50,866
[SPEAKER_97]: Oh, he was so happy.

3183
04:45:51,446 --> 04:45:56,231
[SPEAKER_97]: I still remember seeing them appearing in the footage, walking around, then fleeing from something.

3184
04:45:58,597 --> 04:46:03,043
[SPEAKER_97]: I'm sure you're all familiar with the video of a cow, and that's usually boring.

3185
04:46:03,483 --> 04:46:05,486
[SPEAKER_97]: But this is nothing like that.

3186
04:46:06,006 --> 04:46:13,816
[SPEAKER_97]: The footage is shot at night with an infrared camera, so the rebel cows look like extraordinary and mysterious creatures.

3187
04:46:18,108 --> 04:46:18,909
[SPEAKER_97]: They're crossbred.

3188
04:46:19,410 --> 04:46:27,299
[SPEAKER_97]: The females are light brown, almost gingerish, while the calves are darker, mainly black, and they behave like wild animals.

3189
04:46:27,840 --> 04:46:31,825
[SPEAKER_97]: They hide in the forest during the day and only come out to graze at night.

3190
04:46:32,425 --> 04:46:34,468
[SPEAKER_97]: They move in perfect silence.

3191
04:46:34,928 --> 04:46:43,072
[SPEAKER_121]: Locals who saw them noticed that there is what we would call a sentinel in the group.

3192
04:46:43,633 --> 04:46:53,278
[SPEAKER_97]: While the others eat, she stays on the side, her back to the group, nose in the air, sniffing the potential dangers, ready to tell the other cows to run and hide.

3193
04:46:53,978 --> 04:46:56,961
[SPEAKER_97]: And from what we know, they are extremely agile.

3194
04:46:57,341 --> 04:47:04,546
[SPEAKER_97]: They run and jump around like deer.

3195
04:47:04,586 --> 04:47:10,731
[SPEAKER_97]: While filming our doc, we tried to remain impartial, but we're obviously biased because we cheer for the cows.

3196
04:47:11,352 --> 04:47:14,814
[SPEAKER_97]: Of course, not everybody is excited as we are about the rebel cows.

3197
04:47:15,194 --> 04:47:19,618
[SPEAKER_97]: The villages in these valleys are very small, and people rely mostly on agriculture.

3198
04:47:20,225 --> 04:47:25,169
[SPEAKER_97]: During the winter, the rebel cows come down the mountains and they break into gardens and allotments.

3199
04:47:25,609 --> 04:47:34,877
[SPEAKER_97]: You have to understand, these animals weigh 500 or 600 kilos, so if they spot a cabbage they are really interested in, be sure they will do everything they can to get it.

3200
04:47:35,617 --> 04:47:39,138
[SPEAKER_97]: And that often means trampling down fences and damaging fields.

3201
04:47:41,559 --> 04:47:44,200
[SPEAKER_97]: Lots of people around here would like to capture or kill them.

3202
04:47:44,700 --> 04:47:50,302
[SPEAKER_97]: But some scientists would like to let them be, because it would be very interesting to do more research on them.

3203
04:47:50,882 --> 04:47:54,664
[SPEAKER_97]: And our documentary created a lot of hype around the rebel cows.

3204
04:47:55,604 --> 04:47:58,345
[SPEAKER_97]: They have become resistance icons in Italy.

3205
04:47:58,365 --> 04:48:09,346
[SPEAKER_121]: People are fascinated by their rebel spirit, and that's what I love about them too.

3206
04:48:09,747 --> 04:48:20,308
[SPEAKER_97]: When you think about the fact that these animals have been tamed thousands of years ago, and for all this time they have lived with humans, the idea that they can break free and run away is just extraordinary.

3207
04:48:20,988 --> 04:48:23,509
[SPEAKER_97]: I never had a face-to-face encounter with one of them,

3208
04:48:24,189 --> 04:48:27,131
[SPEAKER_97]: But in a way, this is what keeps my interest going.

3209
04:48:27,672 --> 04:48:29,893
[SPEAKER_97]: It keeps the mystery intact.

3210
04:48:32,215 --> 04:48:33,316
[SPEAKER_97]: Long live the cows.

3211
04:48:37,899 --> 04:48:41,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Alessandro Ghigi on the trail of the rebel cows in northern Italy.

3212
04:48:42,923 --> 04:48:52,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Now a witness, and today we're going back 50 years to 1967, the British withdrawal from the port city of Aden, and the creation of the People's Republic of South Yemen.

3213
04:48:53,287 --> 04:49:03,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Farhana Haider has been speaking to a former British diplomat, Oliver Miles, who was instrumental in Britain's departure, and Tugarsun Lukman, who as a teenager lived through that time.

3214
04:49:04,752 --> 04:49:15,676
[SPEAKER_125]: With torchlight processions and dancing in the streets, the people are celebrating independence, although they're still awaiting the arrival of the National Liberation Front leaders from Geneva.

3215
04:49:16,196 --> 04:49:22,478
[SPEAKER_32]: Britain had colonised the port city of Aden in 1839, one of the longest inhabited places on earth.

3216
04:49:23,039 --> 04:49:32,482
[SPEAKER_32]: The colony consisted of Aden and the British protectorates of South Arabia, desert hinterlands which surrounded the city, controlled by tribal leaders.

3217
04:49:33,182 --> 04:49:38,744
[SPEAKER_32]: But by the 1950s, Britain's retreat from empire around the world was well underway.

3218
04:49:38,764 --> 04:49:43,046
[SPEAKER_32]: And in the Middle East, there was a rising wave of Arab nationalism.

3219
04:49:46,748 --> 04:49:48,409
[SPEAKER_113]: There were definitely celebrations.

3220
04:49:48,949 --> 04:49:50,950
[SPEAKER_113]: It was a happy day for many people.

3221
04:49:50,970 --> 04:49:58,713
[SPEAKER_113]: And for many others, it was a day of reflection of what happened in the past and what could have the effect on the future.

3222
04:49:59,465 --> 04:50:05,407
[SPEAKER_32]: Ghazan Luqman was 14 years old in November 1967, and from a prominent Adeny family.

3223
04:50:05,967 --> 04:50:11,268
[SPEAKER_32]: While he remembers jubilation on the day of independence, there was also a sense of uncertainty.

3224
04:50:11,288 --> 04:50:13,009
[SPEAKER_113]: I think the mood was somber.

3225
04:50:13,309 --> 04:50:16,110
[SPEAKER_32]: People were apprehensive as to what would come next.

3226
04:50:16,130 --> 04:50:17,170
[SPEAKER_113]: Yes, exactly.

3227
04:50:17,530 --> 04:50:19,391
[SPEAKER_113]: And their apprehension proved to be right.

3228
04:50:19,611 --> 04:50:22,591
[SPEAKER_113]: It was good to see the colonial power was gone, but then what's next?

3229
04:50:23,192 --> 04:50:27,813
[SPEAKER_113]: The people of Aden, I would say, probably the majority was very scared of the future.

3230
04:50:28,398 --> 04:50:31,443
[SPEAKER_32]: Aden was at the centre of the British colonial trading system.

3231
04:50:31,823 --> 04:50:36,911
[SPEAKER_32]: Ships stopped there to refuel en route between Europe and India, the Far East and Australia.

3232
04:50:37,311 --> 04:50:39,294
[SPEAKER_32]: It was one of the busiest ports in the world.

3233
04:50:39,675 --> 04:50:43,641
[SPEAKER_32]: Growing up in the city, Gazan Lukman remembers it being prosperous and modern.

3234
04:50:44,081 --> 04:50:47,123
[SPEAKER_113]: As a teenager growing in Eden, life was good.

3235
04:50:47,324 --> 04:50:50,906
[SPEAKER_113]: The majority of people were enjoying their progress at that time.

3236
04:50:51,147 --> 04:50:53,548
[SPEAKER_113]: Electronics were available at that time.

3237
04:50:53,568 --> 04:50:56,831
[SPEAKER_113]: Eden was actually a hub or a center because of tourism.

3238
04:50:57,051 --> 04:51:00,414
[SPEAKER_113]: You could buy the best watches of the time, fancy clothing.

3239
04:51:00,754 --> 04:51:05,678
[SPEAKER_82]: The big passenger ships bring swarms of tourists to the famous duty-free crescent of shops ashore.

3240
04:51:05,938 --> 04:51:13,620
[SPEAKER_113]: Life was good, and it was a paradise lost from textile to perfumes to consumer goods.

3241
04:51:13,940 --> 04:51:16,061
[SPEAKER_113]: Aden had great beaches.

3242
04:51:16,661 --> 04:51:19,882
[SPEAKER_113]: Aden had great airport, great port.

3243
04:51:20,282 --> 04:51:23,022
[SPEAKER_113]: Aden was the Dubai of the 1960s.

3244
04:51:23,623 --> 04:51:25,083
[SPEAKER_113]: It was a liberal city.

3245
04:51:25,463 --> 04:51:33,508
[SPEAKER_32]: There was, however, growing resentment at the British presence, and although they had announced they were withdrawing from Aden, they hadn't fixed the date.

3246
04:51:33,928 --> 04:51:38,350
[SPEAKER_82]: We've said we'll quit by 1968, yet the terrorist attacks become more frequent.

3247
04:51:38,691 --> 04:51:40,652
[SPEAKER_82]: We can't be allowed to just pack up and go.

3248
04:51:41,092 --> 04:51:48,395
[SPEAKER_32]: Oliver Miles was posted to Yemen in 1966 and appointed private secretary to the British High Commissioner in Aden.

3249
04:51:48,595 --> 04:51:56,679
[SPEAKER_69]: And as private secretary, of course, I was in a position of absolutely in the centre of everything that happened in the last six, nine months before independence.

3250
04:51:57,079 --> 04:51:59,760
[SPEAKER_32]: And by 1967, there was growing violence.

3251
04:52:00,100 --> 04:52:04,082
[SPEAKER_32]: Two armed movements were vying to lead a new post-independent government.

3252
04:52:04,482 --> 04:52:11,925
[SPEAKER_32]: FLOSSI, the Front for the Liberation of South Yemen, who was supported by Egypt, and the NLF, a Marxist movement.

3253
04:52:12,165 --> 04:52:20,629
[SPEAKER_69]: The people who were fighting us, we called them terrorists, the Front for the Liberation of South Yemen and the National Liberation Front, the two rival groups.

3254
04:52:21,329 --> 04:52:27,077
[SPEAKER_69]: They didn't really believe that they were going to go because they thought that Aden was too important to the British Empire and there was no way we were going to go.

3255
04:52:27,158 --> 04:52:37,251
[SPEAKER_69]: So although the first of those two groups, the Front for Liberation of South Yemen, was moderately prepared to see themselves as a future government and therefore be ready to talk to us about the process,

3256
04:52:37,952 --> 04:52:40,874
[SPEAKER_69]: the National Liberation Front were absolutely not willing to talk to us.

3257
04:52:41,254 --> 04:52:51,480
[SPEAKER_69]: And as the time of independence drew closer, the two fought each other, literally fought each other in the streets with a good deal of bloodshed, and the NLF won.

3258
04:52:51,641 --> 04:53:01,727
[SPEAKER_127]: This is the flag of the terrorists of Aden, the red, white and black tricolour of the National Liberation Front, a symbol of the NLF's triumph over its rivals Flossie.

3259
04:53:01,847 --> 04:53:05,529
[SPEAKER_113]: Events leading to independence were not great.

3260
04:53:05,809 --> 04:53:06,690
[SPEAKER_113]: There was a civil war.

3261
04:53:07,050 --> 04:53:10,733
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you remember feeling scared because of the war happening around you?

3262
04:53:11,174 --> 04:53:20,562
[SPEAKER_113]: Very scared, especially during night time, because if you are perceived to be from the other group, the other group will come and drag you in the middle of the night, and many people disappear.

3263
04:53:20,983 --> 04:53:22,124
[SPEAKER_113]: One of them was my brother.

3264
04:53:22,904 --> 04:53:26,267
[SPEAKER_113]: And so we were very, very scared.

3265
04:53:26,467 --> 04:53:29,030
[SPEAKER_113]: To actually see a civil war was very sad.

3266
04:53:29,450 --> 04:53:34,712
[SPEAKER_32]: Having won the civil war, the NLF now sat down for talks with the British to negotiate the withdrawal.

3267
04:53:34,972 --> 04:53:42,215
[SPEAKER_126]: Geneva and the lakeside setting for the first political confrontation between the terrorists of Aden and the British government.

3268
04:53:42,415 --> 04:53:49,718
[SPEAKER_69]: It became clear in the last month or so before independence that we were going to hand over to people we'd never met, literally never met.

3269
04:53:50,158 --> 04:53:53,700
[SPEAKER_126]: In that building over there, that Britain will meet the National Liberation Front

3270
04:53:54,541 --> 04:54:07,572
[SPEAKER_69]: To our surprise, we found one or two faces on the other side of the table were familiar, but they were familiar in different guises, if you like, because there was one senior police officer from the Aden police who we thought was on our side, but it turned out he was a senior NLF man.

3271
04:54:08,092 --> 04:54:14,298
[SPEAKER_69]: There was an army officer, similarly, and at that time, of course, the British Empire was shedding its colonies like autumn leaves.

3272
04:54:14,898 --> 04:54:21,406
[SPEAKER_69]: Normally, it's a long process where a lot of people spend a lot of time in each other's offices, getting to know how systems work.

3273
04:54:21,726 --> 04:54:26,592
[SPEAKER_69]: But because the NLF were our enemy, we didn't have time to do that, and it was all done in a terrible rush.

3274
04:54:26,772 --> 04:54:31,517
[SPEAKER_69]: I could see that my friends, the Adenese and the Yemenis, were in for a hell of a time after we left.

3275
04:54:31,698 --> 04:54:32,759
[SPEAKER_69]: That was perfectly obvious.

3276
04:54:32,999 --> 04:54:46,892
[SPEAKER_69]: If only because Aden City, Aden Town, was to some extent a creation of the British Empire, and the fact that the British were leaving, in particular the British military base was closing down, meant that they were losing half the source of their income.

3277
04:54:47,613 --> 04:54:53,839
[SPEAKER_69]: And the other half they'd lost already because the Suez Canal had been closed following the 1967 war, so the trade was off.

3278
04:54:54,019 --> 04:54:55,641
[SPEAKER_69]: So they were left with nothing to live on.

3279
04:54:56,321 --> 04:54:59,623
[SPEAKER_69]: Aden was clearly going to nosedive as we left, we could see that.

3280
04:54:59,763 --> 04:55:09,948
[SPEAKER_69]: The government was resorting to more and more repressive measures, but that was not immediately after amendments, that was when the situation deteriorated maybe a year later or two years later.

3281
04:55:10,329 --> 04:55:14,451
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you feel that the British had let down the people of Aden?

3282
04:55:15,457 --> 04:55:16,819
[SPEAKER_69]: I don't think that it was our fault.

3283
04:55:17,039 --> 04:55:19,401
[SPEAKER_69]: I think we did the best we could in the circumstances.

3284
04:55:19,761 --> 04:55:31,012
[SPEAKER_69]: You can argue that we let the people of Yemen or of South Yemen down more broadly, that they weren't ready for independence, that they didn't really want independence, most of them, many of them, and that we got out in a rush.

3285
04:55:31,632 --> 04:55:41,462
[SPEAKER_32]: Britain left behind deep divisions between those who'd worked for the colonial government and those that had fought against it, and between supporters of the different independence movements.

3286
04:55:42,083 --> 04:55:49,430
[SPEAKER_32]: Guzun Lukman found that many of his friends and family were targeted by the repressive and pro-Soviet state that later emerged.

3287
04:55:49,771 --> 04:55:50,772
[SPEAKER_32]: He soon left Aden.

3288
04:55:51,962 --> 04:55:55,504
[SPEAKER_113]: Many Adenese felt that they were betrayed by Britain, unfortunately.

3289
04:55:55,544 --> 04:56:01,227
[SPEAKER_113]: The withdrawal from Aden was abrupt, it was fast, just gone, just overnight.

3290
04:56:01,447 --> 04:56:07,570
[SPEAKER_113]: Families, people we knew in our neighbourhood, everybody was actually gone, just like a wolf.

3291
04:56:08,011 --> 04:56:12,153
[SPEAKER_113]: Wake up and they're gone, which left many people apprehensive and bewildered.

3292
04:56:12,353 --> 04:56:15,835
[SPEAKER_32]: When you think about independence now, do you think it was a good thing?

3293
04:56:16,315 --> 04:56:17,556
[SPEAKER_113]: I think it was premature.

3294
04:56:17,776 --> 04:56:19,597
[SPEAKER_113]: It should have taken maybe a few more years.

3295
04:56:19,997 --> 04:56:23,579
[SPEAKER_113]: They should have brought everybody and put them around the same table.

3296
04:56:24,279 --> 04:56:28,542
[SPEAKER_32]: In 1990, communist South Yemen merged with the separate state of North Yemen.

3297
04:56:28,882 --> 04:56:32,083
[SPEAKER_32]: But the divisions within Yemeni society have never gone away.

3298
04:56:32,644 --> 04:56:38,327
[SPEAKER_32]: And Ghazan believes Britain bears much of the responsibility for the violence that still blights the country.

3299
04:56:38,347 --> 04:56:40,388
[SPEAKER_113]: The people of England have gone through a lot.

3300
04:56:41,388 --> 04:56:45,752
[SPEAKER_113]: From 1967 up to now, the older generations went through a lot.

3301
04:56:46,753 --> 04:56:54,260
[SPEAKER_113]: Many of them, they just wait for the day they die because it has been nothing but downhill changes since 1967, unfortunately.

3302
04:56:54,480 --> 04:57:00,886
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you think the situation that Yemen is in now is partly as a result of the British leaving so quickly?

3303
04:57:01,326 --> 04:57:02,627
[SPEAKER_113]: Yes, absolutely.

3304
04:57:03,587 --> 04:57:10,370
[SPEAKER_113]: And I hope that Britain helps now in sorting the issue of the conflict between the North and the South.

3305
04:57:10,730 --> 04:57:14,552
[SPEAKER_113]: It will be a sort of a make-up for what they, when they left in a hurry and a half.

3306
04:57:14,812 --> 04:57:18,634
[SPEAKER_113]: I think Britain could actually, they should help them in resolving the conflict.

3307
04:57:18,994 --> 04:57:21,255
[SPEAKER_32]: And do you miss your home city?

3308
04:57:21,616 --> 04:57:22,136
[SPEAKER_113]: Extremely.

3309
04:57:22,776 --> 04:57:24,817
[SPEAKER_113]: And the older you get, the more you miss it.

3310
04:57:24,957 --> 04:57:26,098
[SPEAKER_113]: I miss my family.

3311
04:57:26,118 --> 04:57:28,279
[SPEAKER_113]: I miss Eden very much.

3312
04:57:28,579 --> 04:57:30,520
[SPEAKER_113]: I think of it every day of my life.

3313
04:57:31,449 --> 04:57:33,351
[SPEAKER_32]: Guthen Luchmann now lives in Ottawa.

3314
04:57:33,891 --> 04:57:40,156
[SPEAKER_32]: Oliver Mars retired from the diplomatic service in 1996 and is the editor of the Arab Digest.

3315
04:57:43,541 --> 04:57:45,482
[SPEAKER_14]: And that report was by Fahana Haider.

3316
04:57:45,682 --> 04:57:47,003
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all from Outlook for today.

3317
04:57:47,083 --> 04:57:48,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Matthew will be here tomorrow.

3318
04:57:49,224 --> 04:57:54,487
[SPEAKER_14]: He's hearing from a high-flying Kenyan banker who was jailed for a crime she didn't commit.

3319
04:57:55,087 --> 04:58:00,089
[SPEAKER_14]: She will tell you, Matthew, what she learned in prison and how she fought to clear her name.

3320
04:58:00,269 --> 04:58:02,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Do join him for that same time tomorrow.

3321
04:58:03,071 --> 04:58:07,013
[SPEAKER_14]: But for today, from me, Jo Fidgen, and the rest of the Outlook team, thanks for listening.

3322
04:58:08,485 --> 04:58:13,526
[SPEAKER_27]: You're listening to the BBC World Service, and here's what's happening in the studio this week.

3323
04:58:15,026 --> 04:58:18,927
[SPEAKER_26]: Meet Arnd Henning Hessen, one of the top mixologists in the world.

3324

3333
04:59:13,604 --> 04:59:19,610

3334
04:59:19,931 --> 04:59:23,435
[SPEAKER_124]: I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding the President's decision on Jerusalem.

3335
04:59:23,895 --> 04:59:25,738
[SPEAKER_124]: Tomorrow the President will deliver remarks.

3336
04:59:26,358 --> 04:59:27,939
[SPEAKER_124]: Has the president made up his mind?

3337
04:59:28,439 --> 04:59:31,620
[SPEAKER_124]: The president is pretty solid in his thinking at this point.

3338
04:59:32,060 --> 04:59:34,521
[SPEAKER_110]: Arab leaders have warned of dangerous repercussions.

3339
04:59:35,041 --> 04:59:35,781
[SPEAKER_110]: Also on the newsroom.

3340
04:59:36,121 --> 04:59:37,362
[SPEAKER_44]: It's a political decision.

3341
04:59:37,522 --> 04:59:45,184
[SPEAKER_44]: Very bad decision and I disagree with this position of the World Olympic Committee and so on.

3342
04:59:45,544 --> 04:59:49,046
[SPEAKER_110]: Russia has reacted angrily after it was banned from the Winter Olympics.

3343

[SPEAKER_88]: Peter Bowes reports.

3354
05:00:30,550 --> 05:00:33,852
[SPEAKER_83]: Donald Trump is venturing into uncharted territory.

3355
05:00:34,252 --> 05:00:43,096
[SPEAKER_83]: The president will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, making the US the first country to do so since the foundation of the state in 1948.

3356
05:00:44,216 --> 05:00:49,819
[SPEAKER_83]: According to the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Mr. Trump's thinking on the issue is pretty solid.

3357
05:00:50,536 --> 05:00:58,218
[SPEAKER_83]: He's already indicated that he intends to move the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and has informed regional leaders of his plans.

3358
05:00:58,918 --> 05:01:00,458
[SPEAKER_83]: The reaction has been heated.

3359
05:01:01,038 --> 05:01:09,140
[SPEAKER_83]: The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has warned of dangerous consequences for the peace, security and stability of the region and of the world.

3360
05:01:09,780 --> 05:01:16,062
[SPEAKER_83]: Jordan's King Abdullah said the decision would undermine efforts to resume the peace process and provoke Muslims.

3364
05:01:35,007 --> 05:01:39,770
[SPEAKER_101]: The deputy speaker of Russia's parliament said it was a humiliation and an insult to Russia.

3365
05:01:40,610 --> 05:01:52,279
[SPEAKER_101]: In a defiant post in social media, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said Russia would survive this like it survived World War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Western sanctions.

3366
05:01:53,299 --> 05:02:02,646
[SPEAKER_101]: Although the Russian team has been banned from competing in South Korea, Russian athletes who can prove they are clean will be permitted to participate under the Olympic flag.

3367
05:02:03,346 --> 05:02:05,088
[SPEAKER_101]: But will the Kremlin allow them to?

3368
05:02:05,768 --> 05:02:11,011
[SPEAKER_101]: Vladimir Putin has in the past described such a scenario as a humiliation for his country.

3369
05:02:11,352 --> 05:02:12,652
[SPEAKER_88]: Steve Rosenberg reporting.

3372
05:02:22,457 --> 05:02:34,680
[SPEAKER_106]: In Ventura County, to the north of Los Angeles, a wildfire which broke out on Monday intensified with terrifying speed, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by arid and gusty Santa Ana winds.

3373
05:02:35,200 --> 05:02:43,283
[SPEAKER_106]: Here on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the charred ruins of houses are still smoking, while dark, choking smoke has closed a major moat away.

3374
05:02:43,823 --> 05:02:47,624
[SPEAKER_106]: Ash is blowing through the air, and there is a firefighting helicopter overhead.

3375
05:02:48,670 --> 05:02:56,999
[SPEAKER_88]: Three men in Malta have been charged with the murder of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.

3376
05:02:57,020 --> 05:03:01,605
[SPEAKER_88]: Alfred and George DiGiorgio and Vince Muscat were arrested on Monday.

3377
05:03:01,985 --> 05:03:04,067
[SPEAKER_88]: They have pleaded not guilty to the charges.

3378
05:03:04,908 --> 05:03:06,630
[SPEAKER_88]: World News from the BBC.

3379
05:03:08,236 --> 05:03:15,501
[SPEAKER_88]: A new report says about 15,000 people a day are being forced to flee their homes in African conflict and disaster zones.

3380
05:03:16,041 --> 05:03:20,124
[SPEAKER_88]: Figures show that more than 12 million people in Africa are internally displaced.

3381
05:03:20,584 --> 05:03:22,746
[SPEAKER_88]: Nearly 4 million left their homes last year.

3382
05:03:23,982 --> 05:03:31,329
[SPEAKER_88]: Britain's most prestigious contemporary art award, the Turner Prize, has been won by an art professor who was born in Zanzibar, Labena Habib.

3383
05:03:31,910 --> 05:03:36,274
[SPEAKER_88]: Judges praised her work, which explores the African diaspora and black creativity.

3384
05:03:36,674 --> 05:03:41,058
[SPEAKER_88]: Professor Himid is the first black woman and the oldest person to win the award.

3385
05:03:42,454 --> 05:03:52,339
[SPEAKER_88]: Scientists at Oxford University have carried out the first radiocarbon dating of a fragment of bone claimed to be from Saint Nicholas, believed to be the inspiration for Father Christmas.

3386
05:03:52,880 --> 05:03:58,463
[SPEAKER_88]: Their findings revealed that the bone was 1,700 years old, matching the era of the saint's life.

3387
05:03:58,943 --> 05:04:00,244
[SPEAKER_88]: Sean Coughlin has the story.

3388
05:04:00,884 --> 05:04:10,029
[SPEAKER_84]: Relics of Saint Nicholas have been venerated in churches since at least the 11th century, and his popularity meant that hundreds of bones are claimed to have come from the Christmas saint.

3389
05:04:10,869 --> 05:04:21,498
[SPEAKER_84]: This fragment of pelvis, tested at the University of Oxford, had come from a church in France, and Professor Tom Hyam said many such relics turn out to be not nearly as old as claimed.

3390
05:04:22,178 --> 05:04:29,964
[SPEAKER_84]: But researchers were taken aback when test results showed that the bone really was from the era of Saint Nicholas, almost 1700 years ago.

3391
05:04:29,984 --> 05:04:37,630
[SPEAKER_84]: Although there's no definite proof, Professor Hyam said it was possible that the remains could indeed be those of Saint Nicholas himself.

3392
05:04:38,651 --> 05:04:44,235
[SPEAKER_88]: France's biggest rock star, Johnny Halliday, has died at the age of 74 after a battle with lung cancer.

3393
05:04:44,796 --> 05:04:50,860
[SPEAKER_88]: In a career spanning five decades, he sold more than 100 million records and headlined 50 major tours.

3394
05:04:51,441 --> 05:04:58,226
[SPEAKER_88]: Influenced by the music of Elvis Presley, Johnny Halliday began his career in 1960, singing rock and roll in French.

3395
05:04:58,806 --> 05:05:04,250
[SPEAKER_88]: Known as the French Elvis, he was hugely popular in the Francophone world, but less well known elsewhere.

3396
05:05:05,291 --> 05:05:06,052
[SPEAKER_88]: BBC News.

3397
05:05:09,176 --> 05:05:09,756
[SPEAKER_110]: Thanks very much.

3398
05:05:09,776 --> 05:05:13,759
[SPEAKER_110]: You're listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service with Oliver Conway.

3399
05:05:14,440 --> 05:05:16,161
[SPEAKER_110]: In a speech at 1 p.m.

3400
05:05:16,181 --> 05:05:20,504
[SPEAKER_110]: local time in Washington, Donald Trump is expected to announce that the U.S.

3401
05:05:20,544 --> 05:05:26,748
[SPEAKER_110]: will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upending years of American policy on the Middle East.

3402
05:05:27,348 --> 05:05:32,111
[SPEAKER_110]: According to briefings from senior White House officials, the president will start the process of moving the U.S.

3403
05:05:32,232 --> 05:05:36,074
[SPEAKER_110]: embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although that could take years.

3404
05:05:36,735 --> 05:05:52,886
[SPEAKER_110]: The decision to recognize Jerusalem would put America at odds with almost every other nation in the world, and Mr. Trump was warned about the possible dire consequences of the move when he spoke to Arab leaders, including the Palestinian president, on Tuesday, as we heard from Yolande Nel in Jerusalem.

3405
05:05:53,749 --> 05:05:59,773
[SPEAKER_05]: In their phone call, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is said to have warned Mr. Trump that moving the U.S.

3406
05:05:59,873 --> 05:06:04,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Embassy would have an impact on the peace process with Israel and regional stability.

3407
05:06:05,376 --> 05:06:11,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Abbas has since spoken to the Pope and the leaders of Russia, France and Jordan, asking them to intervene.

3408
05:06:12,560 --> 05:06:19,985
[SPEAKER_05]: King Abdullah of Jordan was also called by Mr. Trump and is said to have spoken of possible dangerous repercussions of his plan.

3409
05:06:20,765 --> 05:06:26,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Egypt's President Sisi is reported to have told him there was no need to complicate matters in the Middle East.

3410
05:06:27,892 --> 05:06:44,198
[SPEAKER_110]: Now, the White House official did say that Mr. Trump recognized that boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem were subject to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and also that he was prepared to support a two-state solution if both sides agree.

3411
05:06:44,738 --> 05:06:47,479
[SPEAKER_110]: But what is the thinking behind the change in policy?

3412
05:06:47,699 --> 05:06:50,180
[SPEAKER_110]: I spoke to our correspondent in the U.S., Peter Bowes.

3413
05:06:50,940 --> 05:07:09,419
[SPEAKER_83]: It was part of his campaign pledge that he wanted to do this and it was one of his major foreign policy planks and perhaps domestic policy comes into this a little bit in terms of the president wanting to be seen to be making good on those big promises in his first year.

3414
05:07:09,479 --> 05:07:12,603
[SPEAKER_83]: I mentioned domestic politics because it hasn't necessarily all gone his way.

3415
05:07:13,023 --> 05:07:14,464
[SPEAKER_83]: in terms of those big promises.

3416
05:07:14,524 --> 05:07:20,726
[SPEAKER_83]: So I think he wants to get something done, and I think he is known as quite an impatient character in this respect.

3417
05:07:20,986 --> 05:07:28,189
[SPEAKER_83]: But in terms of doing it now, I think there are quite a few people here who are rather mystified by the timing.

3418
05:07:28,349 --> 05:07:32,651
[SPEAKER_83]: We know that the White House, the Trump administration, has been working on a peace plan for several months.

3419
05:07:32,731 --> 05:07:34,392
[SPEAKER_83]: We don't know the detail of that.

3420
05:07:34,832 --> 05:07:48,237
[SPEAKER_83]: So why to make this announcement now, perhaps ahead of a bigger plan and bigger negotiations, I think we remain to see, because it does show the US's hand.

3421
05:07:48,277 --> 05:08:02,042
[SPEAKER_83]: And if the US is going to play a role as a mediator in negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, it perhaps makes things rather awkward, because it's certainly not what the Palestinians wanted to hear.

3422
05:08:02,602 --> 05:08:03,283
[SPEAKER_110]: Peter Bowes.

3423
05:08:04,043 --> 05:08:10,088
[SPEAKER_110]: Russia has reacted angrily after the International Olympic Committee banned its team from the forthcoming Winter Olympics.

3424
05:08:10,529 --> 05:08:19,697
[SPEAKER_110]: The International Olympic Committee's decision comes after their damning report said that Moscow was guilty of an unprecedented systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system.

3425
05:08:20,177 --> 05:08:27,483
[SPEAKER_110]: The decision has been welcomed by Dr. Grigory Radchenov, a Russian lab director who was the original whistleblower on the scandal.

3426
05:08:27,904 --> 05:08:29,305
[SPEAKER_110]: Jim Walden is his lawyer.

3427
05:08:29,945 --> 05:08:35,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking a country as powerful as Russia and saying you can't compete is a very significant penalty.

3428
05:08:35,627 --> 05:08:46,111
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows that Russia and other countries who break the rules in this kind of a pervasive way need to be held accountable.

3429
05:08:46,891 --> 05:08:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And so from that perspective, I think that it was a step that will help march us toward reform.

3430
05:08:52,061 --> 05:08:57,045
[SPEAKER_110]: Well, in Russia itself, the Deputy Speaker of Parliament called the ban a humiliation and an insult.

3431
05:08:57,565 --> 05:09:00,447
[SPEAKER_110]: And President Putin is due to speak about it later today.

3432
05:09:00,888 --> 05:09:03,830
[SPEAKER_110]: Well, let's get reaction from the country actually hosting the Games.

3433
05:09:03,870 --> 05:09:05,831
[SPEAKER_110]: Paul Adams is in South Korea.

3434
05:09:06,492 --> 05:09:11,595
[SPEAKER_66]: I think everyone knew that the IOC was poised to take this unprecedented step.

3435
05:09:12,136 --> 05:09:14,698
[SPEAKER_66]: And so the reaction here has been pretty measured.

3436
05:09:15,238 --> 05:09:26,260
[SPEAKER_66]: The head of the committee here, Lee Hee Boom, said that it was the second-best alternative, a reference, obviously, to the fact that Russian athletes deemed to be clean will be able to attend.

3437
05:09:26,741 --> 05:09:27,921
[SPEAKER_66]: He welcomed that decision.

3438
05:09:28,281 --> 05:09:30,401
[SPEAKER_66]: There was a statement from the organizing committee.

3439
05:09:30,421 --> 05:09:33,002
[SPEAKER_66]: We accept and respect the decisions of the IOC.

3440
05:09:33,562 --> 05:09:37,303
[SPEAKER_66]: And they're very keen to emphasize that these games go ahead regardless.

3441
05:09:37,843 --> 05:09:42,986
[SPEAKER_66]: The head of the organizing committee said he wasn't particularly worried about the impact on ticket sales.

3442
05:09:43,026 --> 05:09:45,848
[SPEAKER_66]: He felt that those were going reasonably well.

3443
05:09:46,488 --> 05:09:50,891
[SPEAKER_66]: Russia is strong in some areas and not so strong in others.

3444
05:09:50,951 --> 05:09:54,333
[SPEAKER_66]: It's not a big downhill skiing nation, for example.

3445
05:09:54,773 --> 05:09:56,294
[SPEAKER_66]: But it is a near neighbor.

3446
05:09:56,654 --> 05:10:01,237
[SPEAKER_66]: The South Koreans must have been expecting significant numbers of Russian fans to show up.

3447
05:10:01,777 --> 05:10:02,958
[SPEAKER_66]: And that obviously is not going to happen.

3448
05:10:03,398 --> 05:10:05,019
[SPEAKER_66]: Paul Adams in South Korea.

3449
05:10:05,959 --> 05:10:12,583
[SPEAKER_110]: Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus, has faced unrelenting bombardment over the past three weeks.

3450
05:10:13,163 --> 05:10:16,905
[SPEAKER_110]: A ceasefire announced recently didn't even hold for a full 24 hours.

3451
05:10:17,606 --> 05:10:23,509
[SPEAKER_110]: As the death toll from airstrikes continues to rise, so too does the number of children nearing starvation.

3452
05:10:23,829 --> 05:10:30,933
[SPEAKER_110]: The UN has said that acute malnutrition among youngsters is at the highest level recorded anywhere in Syria since the war began.

3453
05:10:31,673 --> 05:10:34,313
[SPEAKER_110]: Our correspondent Martin Patience reports from Eastern Ghouta.

3454
05:10:38,314 --> 05:10:43,315
[SPEAKER_79]: The aftermath of the latest airstrikes is like a scene from hell.

3455
05:10:44,035 --> 05:10:50,296
[SPEAKER_79]: The sky is dark with dust and debris as rescuers rush into buildings to scoop up children.

3456
05:10:51,436 --> 05:10:54,657
[SPEAKER_79]: Among the injured was five-year-old Yusuf with a head wound.

3457
05:10:55,397 --> 05:11:01,058
[SPEAKER_79]: The doctors patch him up as best they can, but they're desperately short of medical supplies.

3458
05:11:04,272 --> 05:11:11,363
[SPEAKER_79]: A rebel stronghold, Eastern Rota, has been bombed and besieged by the Syrian government for several years.

3459
05:11:12,325 --> 05:11:15,249
[SPEAKER_79]: Many families are now on the brink of starvation.

3460
05:11:18,143 --> 05:11:23,525
[SPEAKER_79]: Eight-year-old Moor and his seven-year-old sister, Ghazal, sit round a wood-burning oven.

3461
05:11:24,425 --> 05:11:32,648
[SPEAKER_79]: It's their first and only meal of the day, a thin piece of bread made from barley, which is normally fed to donkeys.

3462
05:11:33,748 --> 05:11:38,309
[SPEAKER_79]: Their father, Abu Ahmed, was seriously injured when out gathering firewood.

3463
05:11:40,753 --> 05:11:43,774
[SPEAKER_76]: A shell landed close to me and I was hit by a shrapnel.

3464
05:11:43,914 --> 05:11:48,114
[SPEAKER_76]: I was blinded in my left eye and my knee was damaged and I can no longer walk.

3465
05:11:48,194 --> 05:11:53,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a pretty bad shape and I have three kids to look after."

3466
05:11:54,396 --> 05:11:57,416
[SPEAKER_79]: That means his children are left carrying the burden.

3467
05:11:57,956 --> 05:12:00,117
[SPEAKER_79]: Here, they're fetching drinking water.

3468
05:12:01,157 --> 05:12:06,958
[SPEAKER_79]: It's no surprise then that Ghazal dreams of freeing herself from her prison, Eastern Ghouta.

3469
05:12:08,899 --> 05:12:13,465
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could have cookies, sweeties, or any other delicious foods.

3470
05:12:14,446 --> 05:12:19,493
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wish someone could send me a pair of slippers and some new clothes and shoes.

3471
05:12:20,093 --> 05:12:24,599
[SPEAKER_19]: I really miss food, like chicken, cheese, tea, and juice.

3472
05:12:30,760 --> 05:12:36,162
[SPEAKER_79]: In another home, two-and-a-half-year-old Hamza is suffering from severe malnutrition.

3473
05:12:37,003 --> 05:12:41,864
[SPEAKER_79]: His ribs are protruding, and he's wearing a plastic bag as a nappy.

3474
05:12:42,925 --> 05:12:45,866
[SPEAKER_79]: He was abandoned before being taken in by a neighbour.

3475
05:12:47,147 --> 05:12:52,129
[SPEAKER_79]: Umm Mohammed says Hamza is like one of her children.

3476
05:12:52,849 --> 05:12:54,850
[SPEAKER_79]: He's my son now, she says.

3477
05:12:58,568 --> 05:13:01,670
[SPEAKER_79]: There's supposed to be a ceasefire in eastern Ghouta.

3478
05:13:02,271 --> 05:13:05,893
[SPEAKER_79]: But almost every day, people in this area dig fresh graves.

3479
05:13:06,674 --> 05:13:09,716
[SPEAKER_79]: For families here, there's no respite from the war.

3480
05:13:10,097 --> 05:13:14,120
[SPEAKER_110]: Martin Patience reporting from eastern Ghouta in Syria.

3481
05:13:15,140 --> 05:13:20,923
[SPEAKER_110]: The billionaire businessman Andrej Babiš is due to be made Prime Minister of the Czech Republic later today.

3482
05:13:21,223 --> 05:13:27,967
[SPEAKER_110]: Known as the Czech Donald Trump, he'll lead a minority government with the tacit support of parties from the far left and far right.

3483
05:13:28,607 --> 05:13:32,589
[SPEAKER_110]: Let's speak to our correspondent in Prague, Rob Cameron.

3484
05:13:32,649 --> 05:13:35,070
[SPEAKER_110]: Rob, how similar is he to Donald Trump?

3485
05:13:35,771 --> 05:13:43,815
[SPEAKER_86]: Well, there have been those comparisons, perhaps inevitably, because Andrej Babiš is fantastically rich and there is something of the populist

3486
05:13:44,376 --> 05:13:47,861
[SPEAKER_86]: about him, but I think the most striking resemblance to Donald Trump

3487
05:13:48,260 --> 05:14:03,771
[SPEAKER_86]: is that both men have sold the public this image of fighters against the system, of fighting the hydra of corruption, of being an outsider, an iconoclast who's determined to bring the system crashing down.

3488
05:14:04,152 --> 05:14:06,934
[SPEAKER_86]: Yet both have done massively well under the system.

3489
05:14:06,974 --> 05:14:15,620
[SPEAKER_86]: That's certainly true of Andrei Babish, because he's been in business since the last few years of the communist system, and he's grown massively rich

3490
05:14:16,521 --> 05:14:29,454
[SPEAKER_86]: in the transition to capitalism and yet he portrays himself as someone who is determined to bring change and bring the system crashing down and introduce something much more efficient and much better for the Czech Republic.

3491
05:14:29,674 --> 05:14:33,678
[SPEAKER_110]: How will he be able to do that as a leader of a minority government?

3492
05:14:34,659 --> 05:14:38,503
[SPEAKER_86]: Well that's going to be very difficult for him and I think if you speak to analysts here

3493
05:14:39,156 --> 05:14:53,442
[SPEAKER_86]: They suggest that his first attempt to get a confidence vote through Parliament will in fact fail, and then he will be reappointed, appointed a second time by the President to lead a second attempt at forming a government.

3494
05:14:53,822 --> 05:14:59,005
[SPEAKER_86]: That could, under the Czech system, last for several weeks, maybe even several months.

3495
05:14:59,025 --> 05:15:04,007
[SPEAKER_86]: So he could be in place with no formal majority, but forming ad hoc coalitions

3496
05:15:04,467 --> 05:15:15,509
[SPEAKER_86]: to make changes to, you know, very senior posts here and also take some important executive decisions without actually a formal majority.

3497
05:15:15,549 --> 05:15:24,911
[SPEAKER_86]: But it is the fact that he is willing to lean for support on, say, the far right or the Communist Party that has some people quite worried.

3498
05:15:25,331 --> 05:15:26,971
[SPEAKER_110]: Rob Cameron in Prague.

3499
05:15:27,551 --> 05:15:30,112
[SPEAKER_88]: And now with a quick look at some of the day's other stories, here's Gareth.

3500
05:15:30,712 --> 05:15:39,201
[SPEAKER_88]: The UN's Children Agency is warning that 17 million babies under the age of one are breathing toxic air, putting their brain development at risk.

3501
05:15:39,702 --> 05:15:49,672
[SPEAKER_88]: Satellite images have revealed that babies in South Asia are the worst affected, with more than 12 million of them living in areas where air pollution is six times higher than safe levels.

3502
05:15:50,553 --> 05:16:01,297
[SPEAKER_88]: Christine Keeler, the British former model, whose relationships with a British minister and a Soviet diplomat in the 1960s caused one of the most notorious political scandals of the Cold War, has died.

3503
05:16:01,677 --> 05:16:02,717
[SPEAKER_88]: She was 75.

3504
05:16:03,298 --> 05:16:08,740
[SPEAKER_88]: As a teenager, she had a brief affair with John Profumo, a senior cabinet member in Harold MacMillan's government.

3505
05:16:09,140 --> 05:16:14,942
[SPEAKER_88]: She was also seeing Evgeny Ivanov, a Russian diplomat and KGB spy at the Soviet embassy.

3506
05:16:15,762 --> 05:16:19,784
[SPEAKER_88]: A military operation in Western Cameroon has led to hundreds of people fleeing their villages.

3507
05:16:20,284 --> 05:16:27,107
[SPEAKER_88]: The exodus comes after the government pledged to retaliate against an armed group that wants independence for the country's two English-speaking regions.

3508
05:16:27,948 --> 05:16:31,910
[SPEAKER_110]: The hugely popular French rock star Johnny Hallyday has died at the age of 74.

3509
05:16:33,210 --> 05:16:39,073
[SPEAKER_110]: During his five-decade career, he sold more than 110 million records and made 30 films.

3510
05:16:39,633 --> 05:16:43,255
[SPEAKER_110]: Yet outside the French-speaking world, France's favourite pop icon,

3511
05:16:43,776 --> 05:16:45,339
[SPEAKER_110]: is relatively little known.

3512
05:16:45,559 --> 05:16:47,203
[SPEAKER_110]: Emma-Jane Kirby looks back at his life.

3513
05:16:52,305 --> 05:16:56,546
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a career that spanned five decades and three generations.

3514
05:16:56,967 --> 05:17:06,530
[SPEAKER_28]: Born as plain Jean-Philippe Smet, Johnny Halliday first hit the limelight aged 16 as an Elvis wannabe who sang rock in French.

3515
05:17:07,310 --> 05:17:18,874
[SPEAKER_28]: His early concerts caused riots, but then French President Charles de Gaulle accused him of being a corrupter of youth who was spreading dangerous American values throughout France.

3516
05:17:22,266 --> 05:17:31,655
[SPEAKER_28]: Yet despite having more than 900 songs under his belt and 100 live tours, his fame never really spread beyond the French-speaking world.

3517
05:17:32,516 --> 05:17:37,741
[SPEAKER_28]: Most rock and roll stars, Johnny's life had its ups and downs.

3518
05:17:38,201 --> 05:17:46,169
[SPEAKER_28]: For nearly 50 years, France's gossip and celebrity magazines were full of the details of his three failed marriages, his tax
