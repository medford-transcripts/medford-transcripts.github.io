    <p>[WGpYlC7_Nvc_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=517.83s">under</a>  God, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=521.131s">Councilor</a>  Scarbell. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=534.693s">Sorry,</a>  spin the rules so we can hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=538.774s">Take</a>  something off of the unfinished business. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=541.854s">That</a>  would be 17-734. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=542.534s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Scarbell</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=557.227s">I</a>  just want to go on record as recusing myself from the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=560.829s">My</a>  parents live on South Street, and I spoke to state ethics today, and I'm going to recuse myself.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=566.671s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=568.992s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=571.833s">After</a>  extensive meetings with our friends from Eversource and a thorough review on many concerns and issues, they've been very responsive with <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=586.271s">Aside</a>  from all of the official approvals through the city engineer and all that need to be apprised of this daunting task of a huge project that will take us through a few different cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=605.947s">If</a>  we can have, I think that we've gone over every issue to nauseam and I appreciate everybody's effort and Eversource's responses to all of our concerns and issues and I move to accept and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=630.063s">Move</a>  approval, excuse me.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=634.09s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=638.231s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=640.751s">All</a>  those in favor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=643.752s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=644.712s">Mr.</a>  President, we've had, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, quite extensive meetings, and we've gotten a lot of answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=653.934s">We've</a>  gotten a lot of response. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=657.495s">in</a>  thoughtful responses to the questions that we've asked on behalf of the citizens regarding this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=664.301s">We've</a>  also, I think, the representatives of Eversource and their contractor who's going to <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=679.299s">execute</a>  the project, have listened seriously and intently to the concerns of the council regarding the citizens and what they want regarding traffic, regarding safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=693.982s">And</a>  we also delved in some of the previously negotiated items from the memorandum of agreement that was etched out between Eversource and <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=706.164s">the</a>  city administration and various department heads who have expertise in these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=713.006s">And</a>  although we were able to make some inroads and renegotiate some of the aspects of the Yalta conference, Mr. President, I'm satisfied as one Councilor to have heard everything satisfactorily that concerns me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=731.012s">And</a>  I approve of this project of the grant.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=736.675s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=737.455s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=739.497s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=740.838s">And</a>  I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=743.059s">This</a>  has been a thorough and really in-depth process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=750.404s">We've</a>  heard about this project for at least the past, I think, two and a half years now regarding this underground transmission line and that Eversource was going to be doing this particular work in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=762.411s">This</a>  council had a public hearing back <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=765.713s">I</a>  think now it's over a year ago where we opened it up to the general public to ask some preliminary questions regarding the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=774.595s">As</a>  I stated from the beginning and as I still state, this project, in my opinion, may benefit the overall grid and may benefit communities going out north, but it has little to no benefit to the residents of this community other than 100% disruption on our streets, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=795.8s">traffic</a>  and everything else associated with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=799.442s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I have to say over the last several weeks in meeting with Eversource and the Committee of the Whole meetings and asking the important questions that we did get many of our questions answered at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=815.489s">Part</a>  of the meeting tonight was to discuss some of the concerns we had from the last meeting and <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=822.352s">We</a>  did get, I think, some of the crucial issues, in my opinion, which, as Councilor Scarpelli brought up, regarding notification of the neighbors, and I feel very comfortable that there is going to be an exhaustive, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=837.778s">a</a>  notification by Eversource to reach out to the neighborhood, not only door to door, but also to have a public meeting, which I think will address many of the issues or concerns residents may have along this particular route. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=852.989s">And</a>  not just residents on the route, Mr. President, this impacts entire neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=858.012s">and</a>  not just people on Winthrop Street or Mystic Ave or South Street, but entire neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=864.196s">Also</a>  tonight, we requested that the city's new leak detection program, which was implemented back, I believe, roughly a year ago, that when this construction work that takes place on our roads is gonna be in the proximity of our water mains, over and above our water mains, that we as a community have to monitor and make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=887.309s">If</a>  there is disruption to our 100-year-old water pipes or sewer pipes, that we are safeguarded as a community to make sure that Eversource will pick up the tab when it comes to lead or cast iron pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=903.878s">that</a>  may be disturbed during this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=906.961s">And</a>  I think we've come to an agreement with Eversource and the city engineer will sit down and do case by case analysis on what they believe is warranted for repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=919.993s">So</a>  I think that was a very positive outcome that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=925.378s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, and this has been an issue near and dear to me, raised crosswalks in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=931.883s">Back</a>  some years ago, Mayor McGlynn at the time implemented a pilot program to do three raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=939.85s">And</a>  some four years later, we've only implemented one on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=945.014s">But</a>  this particular proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=947.415s">calls</a>  for not only the restoration of Winthrop Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Salt Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, but also, Mr. President, calls for the implementation of raised crosswalks <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=963.81s">at</a>  Medford High School on Winthrop Street, Winthrop Street at the crosswalk between Memorial Park and Medford Community Gardens, which we all know is a very tough place to cross, and South Street at the entrance of the pedestrian pathway to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=980.059s">So</a>  I am pleased to see that Eversource has included that in the MOU that is signed with the city, and I'm also very pleased to hear that <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=992.225s">We're</a>  not going to take a minimal standard as the city solicitor, which I don't know if he's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=997.149s">I</a>  think he may have gone home. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1000.064s">And</a>  I don't blame him, he's put a lot of work in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1004.107s">But</a>  we're not going to follow just a minimal standard on erecting these raised crosswalks, but we're going to put something that's tastefully done, that aesthetically is pleasing, and something that adheres to state and federal statutes when it comes to transportation and public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1022.482s">So</a>  that is a very positive outcome also, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1028.427s">I,</a>  as one member of the council, would like to see in future agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1035.192s">We</a>  heard from Eversource that even though they're coming to the council for a grant of location, that they already have a memorandum of understanding with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1046.119s">So</a>  they already sat down with the administration and negotiated everything they'd like to see take place with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1053.264s">However,</a>  they left out one key factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1056.196s">that</a>  this project needs approval from the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1060.34s">And</a>  as we all know, the City Council has its own opinion, its own ideas, and we also communicate with residents and department heads and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1069.768s">And</a>  I would say for future projects, it would be helpful that the City Council, if any permits are required from us, we be a part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1080.138s">in</a>  particular when it comes to a memorandum of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1084.623s">The</a>  city of Boston, which I mentioned tonight, and I won't go into it, but I will bring it up at a future council meeting, has a great process for granting of locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1094.974s">It's</a>  not done by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1097.818s">It's</a>  done by a public improvement commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1100.681s">And</a>  that commission is comprised of a number of members that sit on the transportation department, property management, inspectional services, water and sewer commission, and the engineering department. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1113.395s">And</a>  that body gets together and holds public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1117.72s">And</a>  they discuss with whoever the utility is what some of their plans are and what they'd like to see for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1126.586s">And</a>  the approval process is a lengthy process which also involves a checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1134.112s">And</a>  I don't know, Cassandra, the city engineer is here tonight, but I don't know if our process has a thorough checklist on the process to which takes place in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1147.506s">We</a>  may or may have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1148.647s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1150.529s">I</a>  can tell you for future reference, Mr. President, it may be worthwhile to look at city ordinances and maybe at some point have the city council removed from the process and create a commissioner board that has all the parties together <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1169.109s">and</a>  collaboration that can deal with the utility companies, and it's one-stop shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1174.851s">And</a>  as Ebersource mentioned, when they deal with Boston, when they get approval from the PIC, which is Public Improvement Commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1184.914s">that</a>  when they leave there, they're done more or less with the permitting and all the process which takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1191.657s">And</a>  that's not the case here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1193.878s">They've</a>  met with the administration, they've met with the council, and now they're gonna have to go for street openings and other permits and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1202.361s">And</a>  I think it would only be advantageous for this community and also beneficial to the residents of this community to have one body that looks at it with <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1212.566s">people</a>  that their expertise is in this particular field and I am going to offer that as a future resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1219.997s">But</a>  tonight, Mr. President, I do support this and I look forward to the continued commitment that ever <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1227.167s">Eversource</a>  has put out there to work with the city to provide a clerk of the works that will be the direct communicator with residents in Eversource or residents in Bond Construction so that residents aren't going to feel the frustration when they need to get a hold of someone at 830 at night and unable to get anyone at Eversource, but they will have a contact that they can reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1251.351s">We</a>  heard from the city engineer that there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1254.672s">a</a>  working group within the City of contact names and numbers that residents can speak with and that will alleviate a lot of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1263.622s">Also</a>  City Solicitor Rumley mentioned tonight and I thought it was an important subject that <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1269.849s">anyone</a>  along this particular route that needs access in and out of their property, someone that might be confined to their home or someone that may need dialysis or other health concerns that Eversource and the city work together to locate where these people are and to communicate directly with the people on the need for access when this construction is taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1293.074s">So</a>  I want to thank all the parties involved <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1296.035s">in</a>  particular, the city engineer and the city solicitor for their dedication on this project, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1409.042s">We</a>  have a resident that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1411.918s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1412.639s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1413.799s">Mariana</a>  Ducey, 2 North Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1416.622s">I</a>  was before the council last week, and you people passed a resolution regarding the extension of the comment deadline for the Green Line project. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1428.971s">And</a>  the resolution passed, but yet there's been no reverse 911 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1433.715s">That</a>  was the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1435.756s">So</a>  I'm here to question why, what happened,</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1443.272s">If</a>  I may, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1446.413s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1447.973s">Thank</a>  you for coming again. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1449.353s">We</a>  did pass a resolution requesting that reverse 911 call go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1453.754s">And</a>  I think that definitely should have been done before today, but we still have one week, one week left. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1461.556s">Comments</a>  are open and meet are due no later than 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1465.617s">on</a>  Tuesday, December 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1467.117s">So</a>  there's one more week to comment on the <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1470.358s">further</a>  extension of the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1471.939s">And</a>  I asked, I sent an email out to the mayor today to ask if the mayor's office today to see if we could get a reverse 9-1-1 call to notify the residents, the entire city, especially those that live in the hillside in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1486.107s">And</a>  I'm publicly asking that a reverse 9-1-1 call go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1490.029s">I</a>  know they <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1492.09s">notification</a>  hasn't been great on this project and I think that's essential that we let the public know whether they're for or against or have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1500.472s">They</a>  have a right to be heard and a right to know what's going on and when deadlines are and when they're extended and when meetings are and this is just one component so I hope that we can get that reverse 911 call out tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1511.715s">If</a>  there's an objection from the city hall here, I'd like to know what it is, why they didn't want to send this out because, you know, I mean, the same reason that people weren't notified about the meeting to begin with still stands because the same population didn't know <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1528.57s">that</a>  the deadline was extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1530.331s">So</a>  it's the same principle. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1532.093s">And</a>  they agreed to do the reverse 9-1-1 to tell people that the meeting was scheduled for Thanksgiving week. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1538.337s">So</a>  I really can't see why they don't want to continue this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1541.919s">Going</a>  forward, I hope MassDOT does a better job of communicating with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1546.663s">I</a>  think Councilor General LaRusso last week passed an amendment to the resolution to say that he would like the MassDOT to notify people by mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1557.43s">So</a>  we'll see what happens in the next round.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1562.614s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1563.615s">Just</a>  briefly on that note as you remember early on in the process 13 years ago that was one of the major concerns that I think people have <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1578.102s">who</a>  administer projects like this sometimes become, because they live in a world of email communication, sometimes lose track of the fact that not everybody lives on that planet, and that we're dealing with a bigger solar system, and so various modes of communication have to be employed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1595.715s">And</a>  that's why we sent that letter out to the department.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1600.803s">Right,</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1602.084s">Not</a>  only that, but we, 13 years have passed, new people have moved into the neighborhood that didn't even know about this project, that couldn't even get on any kind of a list because they didn't know about it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1611.848s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1612.708s">So,</a>  I appreciate your requesting the reverse 9-1-1 again and we'll hope for the best, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1619.711s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1620.971s">Thank</a>  you for your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1623.632s">While</a>  warrant suspension?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1625.42s">While</a>  we're on the suspension, some citizens on Winchester Street would like to address the council regarding a matter that we all received notice on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1636.205s">There</a>  are some citizens here that would like to speak.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1641.1s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1641.701s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1643.482s">My</a>  name is Fran Abola. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1644.743s">I</a>  live at 9 Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1646.865s">First</a>  of all, I'd like to thank everybody here for giving me an opportunity to listen and hear what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1652.989s">I've</a>  been living at this address my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1655.471s">I'm</a>  right next to Nardone Electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1659.114s">I</a>  still own the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1662.14s">When</a>  he came here in 1995, I never had a problem, anything that I had a problem with, I could call Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1669.566s">I</a>  still have his number. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1670.647s">I'd</a>  say, hey, Steve, this is what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1672.489s">And</a>  everything always seemed to be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1676.232s">His</a>  business expanded, and he left the premises. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1679.915s">He</a>  moved to Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1681.716s">And</a>  that's when all the trouble started. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1683.577s">A</a>  company by the name of J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1685.637s">White,</a>  which is probably one of the top ten contractors, I would say, in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1691.279s">They</a>  come in in this area and they totally disrupted the neighborhood with noise, banging, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1703.378s">loud,</a>  I've been woken up, I have all the records here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1706.1s">I</a>  mean, I just started filming. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1707.481s">This</a>  is what happened since 2015, 16, when I moved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1710.883s">I</a>  didn't film any of this, because I was trying to resolve this all with Steve, who was pretty cooperative, trying to help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1716.647s">But</a>  it just seems we weren't getting anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1719.169s">But</a>  I have started taking documentation with my phone, which is, my house is literally <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1724.573s">My</a>  bedroom was from here to where that gentleman is, Mr. Lepore, of where all the pipes are being stored. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1729.936s">They</a>  get slammed down. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1731.177s">They</a>  have a fork truck that's made to pick up four tons, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1736.14s">They</a>  slam the pipes down, 6.30 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1739.082s">I've</a>  been woken up about 20 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1741.164s">I</a>  have all the dates here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1742.504s">Every</a>  video can back up everything I'm talking about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1745.626s">I'm</a>  talking about four o'clock in the morning, one o'clock in the morning, and it just totally disrupts the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1753.091s">I've</a>  tried to have them stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1755.333s">I</a>  went down to the building inspector, found out, oh, I spoke to a gentleman by the name of John Bufuso, and he said, oh, you know, there's nothing we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1764.9s">You</a>  know, I go, well, not doing electric's not operating the property anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1768.743s">He</a>  goes, well, that carries on to the new tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1771.004s">Well,</a>  you know, looking at everything, and then I asked to go back to get a proposal in 1995 when the ordinance was changed exclusively for Nargon Electric, that they were allowed to operate there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1783.748s">This</a>  building was used for storage, car storage for Knox Brothers Dodge, and before that, back in the 1900s, it was used to store army jeeps that used to come off the trains. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1793.791s">So</a>  this building was always storage. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1795.412s">It's</a>  not like, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1796.592s">You</a>  moved in the neighborhood, you knew what you were living next to. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1799.195s">It</a>  was always quiet, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1800.477s">It</a>  was just cars being parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1802.059s">It</a>  wasn't anything business-disruptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1804.201s">Now</a>  it's gotten to a point where I work, you know, a demanding job. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1808.446s">I</a>  work a lot of hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1809.788s">I'm</a>  not even home that much, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1811.81s">I</a>  work double shifts sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1813.512s">I</a>  get woken up at 1.30, 2.30, 4 o'clock in the morning, 6.30 in the morning, 5.30 in the morning, pipes banging, and the pipes literally have destroyed my kitchen floor, blew the tiles right up, because they bring this pipe down that's 30 feet long, about 26 inches wide, and slam it down, and boom, bang. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1831.504s">And</a>  it sounds like, you know, and the grinding, I have an audio clip for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1836.027s">think</a>  you want to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1836.968s">It'd</a>  be a great soundtrack for Guantanamo Bay because it's torturous to listen to. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1841.452s">And</a>  you've got to hear this at 6.30 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1844.635s">And</a>  then another thing, too, I just want to, is the other day they have a flatbed truck <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1852.802s">I</a>  mean, they're supposed to be, you know, whatever's going on, you should at least have the safety involved in whatever you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1857.623s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1858.544s">Winchester</a>  Street, they come down with a flatbed truck, they block the whole street, and then they come out with a fork truck and block the whole street and block the two neighbors behind there on Winchester Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1870.447s">They</a>  can't even get out of their own driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1872.627s">Not</a>  even calling a cop to come down on a detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1875.788s">And</a>  all we want is we want peace, and we just want it to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1879.449s">We</a>  haven't got one, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1882.743s">No</a>  one knows when they're getting out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1884.064s">We</a>  don't know when the lease is, no one knows anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1886.847s">We</a>  try to speak to this, you know, the building commission says we're in violation, they're in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1891.45s">Well,</a>  they're in violation from the day they moved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1894.713s">They're</a>  not Nardone Electric, they're J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1896.715s">White.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1897.455s">Well,</a>  they're trying to find another place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1899.737s">Find</a>  another place, what about the neighbors? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1901.339s">It</a>  seems like they're more concerned on getting a place for J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1904.821s">White.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1906.362s">And</a>  it's totally disrupted the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1909.803s">Dumpsters</a>  full of stuff, seven in the morning, throwing stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1913.144s">And</a>  all the trash isn't even from the job that they're working at at that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1917.525s">This</a>  trash comes in on a flatbed truck from Kendall's, because I work at MIT every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1922.867s">This</a>  trash comes from the work they're doing on the bridge from Kendall. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1926.248s">Fills</a>  up the truck with trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1927.828s">They</a>  used to come in at one o'clock in the morning, waking me up, slamming the door, that stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1931.809s">Now</a>  they come in at seven o'clock in the morning with the truck full of trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1935.37s">First</a>  thing they do, boom, start emptying out, boom, start throwing everything in the dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1940.534s">The</a>  grinding, the doors are wide open. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1942.516s">This</a>  guy's outside grinding next to stuff, the acetylene tanks, flammable products. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1947.66s">They</a>  just do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1948.721s">There's</a>  no control. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1949.802s">I'm</a>  kind of upset about it, because I've been putting up this for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1954.485s">And</a>  I just want your guys' help. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1956.327s">If</a>  you can help, just let me know, when does this end? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1959.75s">Who's</a>  going to enforce this? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1961.431s">Who's</a>  doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1962.252s">These</a>  people are doing whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1964.475s">When</a>  are they gonna get out? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1965.896s">I</a>  can't even find out when the lease is or when they're supposed to get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1970.181s">I</a>  just came here tonight just to address the attention to everybody here and just ask for some help and put us in the right direction on where we go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1980.713s">for</a>  the whole neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1982.514s">It's</a>  really gotten totally out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1984.795s">And</a>  if you go by there and see the pipe, how big it is, it's insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1991.539s">I</a>  get all this video and stuff, I don't want to play it for you, but if you want to hear one grind, I'll let you hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=1998.563s">This</a>  is at 6.30 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2001.965s">I</a>  have to decline that call, sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2011.382s">This</a>  is next door to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2013.586s">All</a>  dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2017.573s">This</a>  is next door to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2022.81s">What</a>  they do is they grind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2023.99s">What</a>  they're doing is they're prepping the pipes for the big dig over there, whatever they're doing, I'm sorry, the Kendall Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2028.871s">And</a>  what they're doing is they're prepping all the big pipes, putting all the elbows on, the offset, the offsets, the heat exchangers, whatever they're putting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2036.733s">And</a>  then they grind it, they weld it, they're welding outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2039.934s">I</a>  get video of sparks flying all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2042.575s">And</a>  then they come in, it's 6.30 in the morning with a big flatbed truck, and this thing backs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2048.316s">That's</a>  all it does is beep, beep, beep, and then they load the flatbed on and they take it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2053.438s">You</a>  know, there's guys urinating outside next to the dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2056.12s">I</a>  mean, I didn't have a camera with me every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2058.643s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2059.643s">I</a>  wish I had one with me, but I'm not home all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2063.267s">So</a>  I don't know even what goes on during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2064.948s">She</a>  works from her house and she deals with the day stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2068.792s">But</a>  I'm not even home that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2071.494s">in</a>  the morning, and I'm out early, and then I come home late at night.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2095.834s">Councilor</a>  Dayton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2097.53s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that this is a matter that's appropriate for further review from our building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2102.534s">It's</a>  my understanding that in our packet here there is a letter from Mr. Mulkey to the property owner indicating that the current use is an improper use. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2112.321s">It's</a>  not in compliance with the zoning board decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2115.663s">And</a>  it's also my understanding that there was a process to relocate this tenant, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2120.286s">But</a>  if we look further in the packet, we'll also see that that process has fallen through. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2124.289s">So</a>  I think it would be incumbent upon us to figure out where we are in the process from our building commissioner to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2130.111s">Ultimately,</a>  we've had situations like this in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2132.731s">If</a>  you recall several years back when they were doing the Winthrop Street drainage project, they were using Apostolon Mystic Ave as a layover yard, which abutted Sylvia Road, which is a residential street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2142.274s">And</a>  many of the same complaints and same concerns came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2145.775s">you</a>  know, working with the building commissioner and the administration, we were able to get them out of there in short order. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2149.438s">And</a>  I think that this is a project, a similar situation, and I think that you have everybody on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2155.001s">I</a>  don't think that anybody in the administration wants these people here disrupting the quality of life, and I'm certainly sure that nobody behind this rail does. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2161.225s">So</a>  with that being said, I think that the proper steps, Mr. President, would be to <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2164.247s">Refer</a>  this to the building commissioner for response to see what's going on Ultimately, I think this is something that may have to go through the city solicitor's office at some point in time But as of right now, it's up to the code enforcement officer to issue the appropriate fines for non-compliance with the zoning act and Then go from there Thank You</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2181.398s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2182.539s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2184.581s">I've</a>  spoken with Mr. Vola on a couple occasions about this and spoken to the building commissioner, Mr. Moki. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2195.651s">Clearly,</a>  upon all the research you've done, Fran, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2200.775s">that</a>  the activity that's going on is beyond the scope allowed in the initial variance given to the property owner some 20 plus years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2213.083s">The</a>  property owner is not in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2214.664s">He</a>  leased the property out to a company that's clearly operating way beyond the scope of the restrictions placed on the use of that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2227.212s">They</a>  are in the process from what the <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2230.736s">Building</a>  Commissioner has told me they are in the process of finding a new location. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2236.42s">However,</a>  he doesn't have an answer on when that's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2240.984s">And</a>  that's what has him concerned the most, because it's too open-ended, and you folks need redress right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2250.311s">I</a>  just want peace.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2252.292s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2252.893s">I</a>  can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2253.834s">And</a>  the whole thing is, is we just <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2257.257s">We</a>  just want an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2258.798s">That's</a>  the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2259.478s">It's</a>  like everything's left up in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2261.299s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2261.9s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2263.441s">Here's</a>  what it is at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2265.342s">First</a>  of all, I have to share my surprise with J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2269.744s">White.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2272.664s">You</a>  rightly mentioned, they're one of the top construction firms in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2276.226s">They</a>  do enormous projects, and you would think, given their history and their success, that they ought to know how to treat people, and they're not treating you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2288.612s">And</a>  that's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2293.562s">Mr.</a>  Mulkey has examined this and cited the property owner for a zoning violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2304.204s">So</a>  a citation has been issued, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2307.505s">He</a>  goes through then a process of responding or appealing, and then they go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2315.567s">Hopefully</a>  this will be resolved before then. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2319.028s">He</a>  personally met with the, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2321.428s">the</a>  manager or whoever's in charge at that location for the construction company. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2328.013s">He</a>  explained to them and walked through the whole thing with them where they're in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2333.537s">So</a>  they themselves have been put on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2337.119s">He's</a>  assured us that the inspectional service director, Mr. Bavuso, is monitoring them on off hours and making spot checks <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2347.106s">to</a>  survey the property, he wanted you to be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2350.888s">And</a>  then this is going to have to follow its course. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2355.37s">I</a>  have to say that from what I've been told, the property owner is aware of what's going on clearly now and wants to move to get them out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2365.954s">Because</a>  he doesn't want them, that reflects poorly, because as you recall, he was a good neighbor.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2372.437s">He's</a>  a great guy and I think what actually happened is I think he didn't realize that when they came in and took the space that this was all going to be going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2379.659s">I</a>  think he was probably misled himself.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2381.899s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2382.199s">He</a>  probably thought it was going to be a dump spot for trucks and that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2385.16s">Like</a>  it's kind of been. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2386.46s">And</a>  he was kind of turned key when he operated out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2389.481s">The</a>  trucks left for the day on their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2391.642s">Never</a>  had a problem with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2392.902s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2393.582s">So</a>  that's where I've been updated on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2397.607s">As</a>  far as a council resolution, that's up to the councilors if we want to refer this for action and further communication from the building inspector, but that's where he has us today.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2410.984s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2411.505s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2412.286s">Well,</a>  I'm glad everybody gave me a chance to speak.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2415.69s">But</a>  this is important, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2418.012s">This</a>  work that you put together is important, because I think it helped us as Councilors clarify the scope to which they're behind, and it also is clear that it's <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2430.912s">Um,</a>  uh, I know your friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2434.234s">I</a>  mean, you're not a complainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2436.715s">Um,</a>  I just want to sleep peacefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2438.576s">I</a>  don't sleep much as it is, you know, exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2440.997s">You</a>  work morning, noon and night.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2442.437s">Well,</a>  thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2444.318s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2446.659s">Vice</a>  president mocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2448.3s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2448.72s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2449.941s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2451.531s">I</a>  think we're beyond the point of just talking, giving lip service. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2456.695s">And</a>  no matter how many violations are handed out, that's not going to help Fran's problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2463.519s">That's</a>  not going to help the neighbor's problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2465.76s">At</a>  this particular point, it was clear when I read that document that although they're saying they have plans to relocate, but when you don't give a time frame <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2477.107s">To</a>  me, that's just lip service. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2479.728s">So</a>  I don't have too much confidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2482.288s">I</a>  don't know how long their lease is, as you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2484.709s">They</a>  could have a 10-year lease, five-year lease, who knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2488.49s">But</a>  I think at this point, and I've been on the council for a number of years, I think this calls for a cease and desist order, which could be handed out by the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2498.312s">And</a>  I think we're at that point, I shouldn't say I think, I know we're at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2503.693s">And</a>  I think the, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2507.014s">building</a>  commissioner has to line up all his ducks before he does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2510.336s">But</a>  I think we're at that point right now that I would ask the council take a vote to have the building commissioner look into a ceased immediate cease and desist order based on the fact that they're working prior to 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2525.766s">In</a>  the morning, which is a violation of zoning ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2530.589s">They're</a>  also doing work <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2532.71s">in</a>  that particular location that is not of proper use, which I think the building commissioner already cited them based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2540.818s">And</a>  to me, that's enough information to have in hand to go and provide a cease and desist order, which would have them close operations immediately until it goes to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2552.549s">And</a>  I'm sure any business, especially if they're doing work, like you're mentioning, are not going to want to close their operation <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2558.634s">So</a>  it really brings them back to the table once this action's taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2563.017s">So</a>  I would ask that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we direct the building commissioner to issue a cease and desist order immediately on this particular property.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2576.487s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2580.11s">Is</a>  it a point of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2587.704s">I</a>  don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2588.664s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2590.424s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2591.805s">I</a>  think from those, just listening to that one clip, that would drive me absolutely crazy, never mind while I'm sleeping, during the day while I'm trying to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2601.408s">And</a>  I think we need to get a little tougher as a city on this establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2606.79s">cease</a>  and desist seems to me like it's probably the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2610.451s">I'd</a>  also ask that we request an opinion from the city solicitor, depending on how long it takes to actually cease and desist the operation, with regards to if the permit was given to Nardone Electric and only to them, how is JF White operating at the site? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2632.756s">I</a>  think that was an important piece of information that maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2635.743s">the</a>  building commissioner, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2640.142s">needs</a>  an opinion from the solicitor to shut down operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2644.863s">Also,</a>  the hours of operation, it seems like it's going all through the night, all through the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2649.604s">There</a>  is a start time and an end time that should be followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2652.745s">So</a>  I think that's an important piece of information as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2656.286s">I</a>  can't imagine every night listening to that noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2659.547s">So</a>  whatever the city needs to do, I think they need to do it as if it was their home that was on 8 or 9 Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2668.249s">So</a>  I would second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2670.669s">resolve.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2672.99s">Mr.</a>  President, just to clarify the motion that I made. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2676.111s">The</a>  motion that I was making was to refer the paper to the Building Commissioner Enforcement of the Zoning Act, which would be all-encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2682.672s">It</a>  would take into consideration any and all steps that he needs to take to make sure that there's a complying use at this location.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2694.029s">We</a>  have two motions on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2696.111s">We</a>  have one from Councilor Marks, Vice-President Marks, and we have one from Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2702.976s">As</a>  amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2703.557s">As</a>  amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2704.437s">So,</a>  which one are we gonna go with?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2707.76s">I</a>  think they're one and the same.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2709.742s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify what I was saying.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2711.683s">We</a>  should refer to the purpose of enforcing the Seizing Act.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2723.052s">Councilor</a>  Marks is asking for a cease and desist.</p>

    <p>[WGpYlC7_Nvc_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2726.194s">Which</a>  is probably a step in the process of enforcing the Zoning Act.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2729.536s">Right,</a>  but I think we're at the point right now where that's the highest level of council to accomplish a request.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2734.58s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2734.72s">Other</a>  than the zoning, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2736.901s">All</a>  right, we'll go with Councilor Marks' motion that the Building Commissioner order a cease and desist, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2744.306s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2746.147s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2747.688s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2748.509s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2751.621s">Motion</a>  to revert back to. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2752.942s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2754.043s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vola.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2754.604s">Have</a>  a good night.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2756.846s">Motion</a>  to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2762.572s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2766.256s">17785</a>  offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the double poles on Alexander Avenue, pole number 4444 and 4443, and on Barnaround, pole number 2994, be removed in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2780.603s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2782.124s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2783.125s">I</a>  would just ask that this be sent to National Grid for immediate removal of the double poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2788.728s">And</a>  also, if we can get a report <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2790.869s">I</a>  believe it was several months back I asked for an update on the double pole report, and I don't think we have yet to receive an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2799.435s">I'm</a>  seeing more and more double poles throughout the community, which is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2802.998s">It</a>  means they're replacing older poles, but we also want to stay on top of the utilities to make sure they're removing the double pole, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2811.904s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2812.325s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2816.792s">by</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2821.473s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2822.393s">17-786,</a>  petition by Roberta Cameron, Ralph Nordstrom, Reverend Mast, to address the council for an update of the completion of the community preservation plan in the opening of the application process for the first round of funding.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2839.548s">Yes,</a>  Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2843.974s">Roberta</a>  Cameron is on her way here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2845.597s">She</a>  should be here shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2847.379s">She's</a>  the chair of the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2849.923s">She</a>  asked me to speak on her behalf until she gets here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2853.4s">and</a>  to answer any questions that the Council may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2855.902s">I've</a>  been serving on the committees, the CPC, since it was formed in May of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2860.585s">I</a>  believe you have a four-page handout that summarizes the plan in front of you that was distributed with the meeting minutes today. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2870.449s">And</a>  I just want to summarize a couple quick points and then take any questions you may have about the CPA and CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2877.674s">So</a>  over the last six months, the Community Preservation Committee has undertaken to fulfill its obligation to undertake a study of the community needs across Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2886.578s">We</a>  coordinated with many of the boards in this building and a lot of stakeholders and committees across the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2893.164s">That</a>  included things like the Friends of the Medford Public Library, the Royal House, Friends of the Fells, really anyone who could possibly be a recipient or a stakeholder in the CPA process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2905.805s">So</a>  we've just published our final community preservation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2909.787s">It's</a>  online, and it's soon to be available in print. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2913.468s">And</a>  we have also opened up the application process for the first round of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2916.749s">There</a>  will be two rounds in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2920.97s">The</a>  first application process is just for determining if the project is viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2924.832s">That</a>  is due on December 15th, which is 10 days from today. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2929.113s">They'll</a>  be awarded, the funds will be awarded in March of next year and then the fall of next year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2934.179s">Two</a>  rounds for fiscal year 17 and 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2937.122s">And</a>  every other, every year following will just be in one round in the fall of each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2943.448s">So</a>  we, again, May will be the award of the first round, October the award of the second round, and October going forward for each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2953.024s">It's</a>  a two-stage process to determine eligibility first, which is the 12-15 date, and then a more detailed application that will obviously get into more details about how much money it costs, the project, who's going to benefit, if there's any matching funds, and how it will serve the city of Medford in terms of the most number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2974.845s">We'll</a>  also consider some off-cycle applications on an as-needed basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2980.968s">There</a>  has to be extraordinary circumstances to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2985.029s">We're</a>  not going to just open up the process unless there's a real need, and that could be the City of Medford, it could be somebody else, but we're not going to do that as part of our regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2993.513s">We're</a>  going to have everyone compete and then evaluate all the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2996.814s">As</a>  the City Council knows, you are <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2999.035s">the</a>  final step in the process in terms of approving these projects, but the projects start really from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3004.637s">They're</a>  more of a grassroots thing from non-profits and from citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3009.139s">It</a>  could be community groups, neighborhood groups, park advocates, a whole bunch of different options, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3016.393s">So</a>  we also intend to set aside $25,000 in funding for small projects, for CPA funds, up to $5,000 for projects with a total cost of up to 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3027.24s">A</a>  very simplified application process to, again, to kind of make sure we capture both big and the small and the medium-sized projects as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3036.386s">It's</a>  important to note, as I mentioned before, the city council has the final approval for our CPA funding in order to spend community preservation committee grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3048.697s">All</a>  proposals will be vetted open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3052.16s">There'll</a>  be public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3053.301s">People</a>  will have a chance to advocate for their project and evaluate and give opinions on all the projects that are being submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3061.227s">At</a>  present, the general consensus of the Community Preservation Committee is that we basically equally distribute the funds right now until we understand what's going to be submitted between open space and recreation, affordable housing, and historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3075.218s">Obviously,</a>  we don't know what's going to be submitted yet, because nothing has been submitted yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3079.32s">When</a>  we get the projects, we'll obviously evaluate them then. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3082.441s">But</a>  our thought was, after the public forms we had, the public input we had, and talking to all the stakeholders, that we wanted to kind of give ourselves flexibility, but keep generally distributed evenly amongst those three categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3095.386s">As</a>  you all know, by statute, we'd have to have 10% minimum for each of those categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3101.108s">But</a>  that leaves 70% that is beyond the administrative needs that is discretionary in terms of which bucket of grants that they go into. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3114.918s">As</a>  shown in the handout, if you look at the first page, the priorities and goals are laid out pretty clearly, and I'm obviously here to answer any questions, specific questions you may have about the process, or what the needs are, or how we're gonna evaluate these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3131.287s">So</a>  I open up to the council to ask any questions you may have.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3135.676s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3136.757s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3138.278s">Thank</a>  you, Doug Kerr, for coming to explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3142.0s">My</a>  first question just would be with regards to, I understand May and October will be, funds will be awarded, and then October, every year after that, going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3152.066s">And</a>  I think going forward, it'll be more of a timeline known to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3156.228s">So</a>  my question is with regards to this December 15th eligibility determination form due date. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3164.213s">How</a>  have we advertised that so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3166.095s">And</a>  when did the advertisements start? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3170.339s">Just</a>  so we know, I just want to make sure that people are well aware of it and have known for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3176.004s">It</a>  seems just like a very quick date.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3178.626s">We</a>  do have a coordinator, as everyone knows, Danielle Evans, who was hired by the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3185.372s">who</a>  works three days a week in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3190.075s">And</a>  as part of her job is to basically distribute that information as wide as possible into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3198.06s">I</a>  know she has a big email list that's been developed over the last <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3202.923s">six</a>  or seven months with all the people that we've met. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3207.206s">Obviously</a>  it's on our website as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3209.187s">I</a>  believe there's a link on the city website as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3212.029s">I</a>  don't know if there are any other advertisements in the paper, but picking up on what was just talked about with the Green Line extension, obviously <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3222.075s">The</a>  more people that know about this, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3223.556s">And</a>  that we can't do enough in terms of trying to make sure, whether it's reverse 9-1-1, putting in a transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3229.4s">The</a>  point is that we will do our best to let as many people know as possible through as many forums as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3235.945s">We've</a>  already had two public forums attended by about 100 people over the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3240.988s">And</a>  our meetings are obviously open to the public, as every open meeting is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3245.551s">But</a>  frankly, it is quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3248.053s">It</a>  is happening relatively fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3250.055s">It</a>  is the holiday season, so I can understand why people might miss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3253.357s">The</a>  point also I think is worth noting is that if people don't get it in by December 15th, there's still <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3260.115s">There's</a>  still opportunity to get it in, and there's still a second round in next year, so they don't have to rush. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3265.097s">There's</a>  going to be at least $1.2 million, I believe, in each of those two rounds available. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3269.778s">That's</a>  a significant amount of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3272.339s">If</a>  your project is $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000, that's going to go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3276.681s">And</a>  we obviously want to have the maximum impact on the city of Medford in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3280.442s">improving</a>  the quality of our city, whether it's restoring a park, whether it's restoring a historic building, creating affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3286.365s">There's</a>  so many different avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3287.806s">If</a>  you had a chance to read the document that was put together by the CPC over the last few months, the needs in Medford are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3295.209s">They</a>  are really profound. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3297.25s">It's</a>  a real challenge with affordable housing in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3300.352s">There's</a>  a lot of historic needs in this city, and there's certainly a lot of demand for open space and recreation across this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3306.596s">That</a>  is clearly, these funds are meant to fill those gaps and take the city, move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3312.14s">So</a>  I can try to get as much information to you, Councilor, as I can beyond what I just described in terms of the advertising. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3318.184s">But</a>  I would just obviously ask people to go to our website, read the plan, and the application will take somebody 10 minutes to fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3325.9s">really</a>  to get it approved.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3328.342s">Point</a>  of information, Joan Sierra, 40 Cedar Road North. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3330.523s">I</a>  believe the coordinator sent a request into the Medford transcript to have something in the paper, but I think she missed last week's deadline, so it's likely going to be in this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3338.555s">Not</a>  a lot of time, but this is a very quick round because we had to get our process in place, and then we finally got the application done, and we're trying to get the money out as quickly as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3348.621s">So</a>  the first round is going to be really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3350.062s">The</a>  second round is going to be on a regular time schedule and then future rounds.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3353.464s">So</a>  when did the coordinator send out a notice to her whole email list?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3359.212s">I</a>  believe it was directly after we had, sorry, the initial meeting where we announced the plan and had some input from the public, which was, I believe, the last Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3369.778s">Last</a>  Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3370.278s">Last</a>  Monday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3371.239s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3373.16s">So</a>  the end of November.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3373.88s">End</a>  of November, correct.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3375.501s">And</a>  about how many emails does that go out to, do you know?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3379.744s">I</a>  want to say over 200 people.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3386.847s">And</a>  then if they miss the December 15th deadline, that's for a determination form. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3391.451s">So</a>  do they still have till March 2nd to do a full application for the first round?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3398.517s">That,</a>  I'm not sure about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3400.379s">It</a>  might be the second round.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3403.772s">I</a>  think for the smaller projects, it's going to be very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3407.535s">So</a>  I don't think it'll be difficult to get those in by the March actual award. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3412.698s">We</a>  just want to make sure that nobody spends time working on a project that will not be funded by statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3418.862s">We</a>  want to make sure it's viable as a project, so they don't fundraise, match grants, write all these details, and then it's not viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3426.067s">We</a>  don't want to waste anyone's time, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3428.824s">So</a>  it's important to get that step out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3431.585s">And</a>  our coordinator, I think, will be, remember, she's here to answer all these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3434.747s">People</a>  can call her here at Medford or stop by her office three days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3439.97s">I</a>  think it's Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3443.211s">To</a>  talk about the process, to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3446.433s">She's</a>  been a resource for the committee as well, because we're new at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3448.974s">She</a>  has experience in the community preservation arena from previous jobs.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3460.799s">Is</a>  there a particular type of communication?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3461.96s">She'll</a>  be able to help people with the actual applications too? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3465.024s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3465.505s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3465.785s">And</a>  she's invited people to call her before they fill out the eligibility form to help them walk through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3471.391s">Is</a>  there a particular form of communication that the council thinks would be helpful for us to use when these deadlines come up besides website, Medford transcript, email?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3481.765s">The</a>  loop maybe? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3482.867s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3483.368s">The</a>  loop on cable access.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3485.393s">Cable</a>  access, Facebook, any type of... I'm sure one on the Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3491.185s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3491.365s">I</a>  missed that one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3492.473s">Yeah,</a>  no, my concern, and I appreciate all the hard work you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3496.174s">I</a>  know the committee's worked very hard, and I attended one of the forums, which was very, you know, it was a two-hour forum, definitely learned a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3506.256s">My</a>  concern, just with this first round, is that today is the 5th, and December 15th is when the applications are due. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3513.677s">So</a>  that is, that's just my concern for this initial round. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3518.538s">There'll</a>  be many, yes, there will be many more rounds, but we're talking about a lot, you know, $1.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3523.199s">So</a>  I just, I feel like it's a lot of money to rush organizations when you could maybe extend it a few weeks or.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3530.3s">And</a>  there's no guarantee that we would award even half that if the projects aren't there or not enough people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3538.542s">It</a>  will obviously just, that money just goes back into the fund for the next round. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3542.362s">It</a>  becomes a much bigger round. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3544.143s">We</a>  don't know that until we see what comes before us, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3547.969s">So</a>  I know it is quick, but we are hoping that people will at least put in, literally spend 10 minutes, put together a project name, a couple sentences description, see if it's viable, and then spend the next few months really developing the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3565.29s">really</a>  figuring it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3566.671s">Do</a>  you need to hire someone? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3570.313s">Is</a>  it available? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3571.494s">Is</a>  the property available? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3573.015s">Is</a>  the property got a master plan already in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3576.657s">Is</a>  it something that's shovel ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3577.757s">There's</a>  so many different factors here.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3579.696s">That's</a>  just it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3580.296s">We</a>  just don't know what we're going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3582.158s">We</a>  could get a ton of applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3583.778s">We</a>  could get no applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3584.919s">I</a>  doubt that's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3586.0s">But</a>  if we need to change the timeline based on what we get, we'll have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3590.702s">It's</a>  basically what our first option out there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3593.224s">And</a>  if we need to change that, we will.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3595.951s">And</a>  they're being funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3597.272s">It's</a>  not in the key dates, but the first round, you said, was in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3600.594s">You'll</a>  be awarding.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3602.115s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3602.355s">So</a>  in consultation with you folks, since you're going to be approving the plan, we're trying to, on the first round, it's going to probably coincide a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3609.959s">We're</a>  trying to get it ahead of your regular normal budget schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3613.001s">So</a>  that's why we're trying to get it done in March, and then moving it to the fall to get away from your normal budget schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3622.446s">That's</a>  it for now.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3624.348s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3625.429s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3626.529s">And</a>  I'd like to thank you for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3628.631s">I</a>  know this group has been meeting nonstop putting this program together. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3632.713s">And</a>  I had an opportunity to attend the forum last Monday night at the South Medford Fire Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3636.495s">And</a>  you did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3638.116s">I</a>  mean, it was explaining the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3639.937s">And</a>  there were a lot of good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3642.679s">And</a>  it was well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3645.18s">But</a>  I would definitely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3646.521s">If</a>  you can put something on cable access, I think even <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3649.563s">almost</a>  like an infomercial, just kind of describing what it's about, you know, how people can, you know, apply the process, who to contact with questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3658.39s">I</a>  think that would be definitely beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3661.133s">You</a>  know, people do, people do watch programs on that station, so I think it's something that, it's a great mode to, of communication to actually get a message out to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3669.8s">So</a>  I think that, I would definitely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3671.782s">I</a>  think that, you know, a lot of, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3676.195s">successful</a>  programs, it all comes down to communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3678.717s">And</a>  I think that this is the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3681.959s">But</a>  I had a quick question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3683.62s">Can</a>  you talk a little bit about the small projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3687.303s">I</a>  think it was 25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3688.623s">You</a>  talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3689.364s">I</a>  know that question came up last Monday as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3691.605s">So</a>  if you could just shed a light on that, that would be great.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3693.587s">So</a>  when Roberta and I attended a CPC forum that was run by the city of Somerville a couple months back, the other towns that have already implemented the CPA said that they had set aside a little bit of funding <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3705.975s">for</a>  really small projects, your gardens or that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3710.38s">And</a>  I think what we said was the request would be up to $5,000 per project if the total project was 10, so really small projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3719.389s">We</a>  just don't want the little guy feeling like they're going to get taken over by the big project that comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3724.354s">We</a>  wanted to set something aside for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3727.387s">So</a>  that's pretty much what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3728.728s">It's</a>  a trial. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3729.208s">We're</a>  going to see how it works.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3730.67s">And</a>  I think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3731.931s">So</a>  the total project has to be $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3736.734s">Is</a>  the total budget for that piece $25,000?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3739.036s">The</a>  total request for CPA funding would be $5,000, as long as the total project was $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3743.039s">So</a>  you put in $5,000 from some other source. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3745.961s">We'd</a>  put in $5,000.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3747.694s">If</a>  I could echo on that, one of the evaluation criteria is for matching funds as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3754.197s">Not</a>  100 percent, but it always, I think, and this is quite common in any grant application, if the applicant brings some money to the table to show that there's public support for it and that money will go further, obviously, if we can spread that money and get matching. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3772.385s">It</a>  could be a one-to-one, or it could be a partial match. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3774.586s">I</a>  think that is one of the criteria that we evaluate, which most grant applications do, to benefit to the money to stretch as far as it can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3783.251s">We</a>  urge people, if they're looking for a $20,000 project, maybe they bring $5,000, $10,000, or even another $20,000 to the table, because it will obviously help the process and stretch the money further for the whole city.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3797.509s">And</a>  again, everything is a trial for this first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3800.391s">We've</a>  seen what other towns have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3802.012s">We're</a>  going to try it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3802.813s">If</a>  it works, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3803.473s">If</a>  it doesn't, we'll try something else.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3805.615s">And</a>  as far as in the other cities and towns that you've talked to, that small piece of the budget that was allocated to small projects, is that something that's been successful?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3814.021s">Very</a>  successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3814.982s">Very</a>  successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3815.703s">That's</a>  why we wanted to implement it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3817.204s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3817.564s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3817.944s">I</a>  like it.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3818.465s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3820.129s">Councilor</a>  Nice.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3821.23s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3823.451s">I</a>  just want to say, keep doing what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3824.913s">You</a>  guys are doing an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3826.494s">This</a>  is a group that's been very dedicated to this initiative and endeavor since collecting the signatures for the ballot drive back in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3833.199s">And</a>  to date, we've seen some great progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3836.221s">So</a>  I just want to thank you for your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3837.682s">This</a>  really is a marathon, not a sprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3839.744s">And</a>  you guys have really been holding government's feet to the fire to make sure that this is done appropriately and in a fashion that's going to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3846.749s">So</a>  I want to thank you for your efforts and your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3848.927s">Again,</a>  keep doing what you're doing, because I think it's work, and the word's getting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3852.089s">People</a>  are talking about it, and people are excited to see the fruits of the labor that has been put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3857.273s">So</a>  thank you very much for your work.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3859.835s">Roberta</a>  Cameron, who's not here, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3861.696s">She's</a>  right behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3862.617s">She's</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3863.617s">Who's</a>  hiding behind me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3864.638s">She's</a>  hiding behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3866.159s">Has</a>  been the driving force of this, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3868.26s">The</a>  credit should go to her and the rest of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3870.202s">But</a>  she's been fantastic on this.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3872.138s">Yes,</a>  and we appreciate all the help that you are giving us because, again, we're new at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3876.799s">The</a>  more we communicate, the better the product is going to be at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3880.44s">These</a>  progress reports will come on occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3883.181s">We're</a>  not going to keep you in the dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3884.321s">We</a>  want to keep you involved as to what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3886.962s">Guide</a>  us, help us, and it's going to be a collaborative effort.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3893.319s">I</a>  thank you, Mr. President, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3895.725s">I</a>  thank Typical Roberta sitting in the back and sitting down, but again, this is <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3903.504s">what</a>  people would be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3905.325s">She's</a>  definitely not the lazy one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3907.086s">But</a>  I will tell you, if you see what's going on in neighboring communities that have implemented the Community Preservation Act, and you see the small projects that are happening, it makes such a huge impact on the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3918.832s">And</a>  it really makes a neighborhood a true neighborhood again. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3921.073s">So</a>  I'm really excited to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3923.654s">I</a>  think that one of the conversations I've had with different organizations, a lot of the youth organizations, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3931.497s">It's</a>  something as simple as getting the word out to their organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3934.16s">For</a>  instance, Little League, Babe Ruth, Girls Softball, Youth Socket. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3940.085s">Those</a>  organizations talk about fields and some questions they've had because I know they've been trying to capture some funding through the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3949.334s">But</a>  everybody that voted for the CPA had talked about, well, this could be a viable source. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3956.605s">So</a>  I think this is another avenue that maybe we can tap into and reach out to those organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3964.597s">There's</a>  one group that contacted me and I directed them right to the site so I know that they're coming with a, it's not a huge project, but it's also a project that what I like to hear and like to see is that you have organizations that come <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3979.038s">coming</a>  in that will be asking for something that they'll work for as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3982.581s">It's</a>  not just my hands out give it to me so we can take care of this one group and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=3987.926s">It's</a>  I think that what's nice to see is the the partnership to say hey listen this is what our community voted on and this is what how people have worked on to get make this happen but at the same time we want to we want to do something great for our community <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4002.24s">But</a>  we're willing to put in the work with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4004.261s">So</a>  it's impressive to see the community stakeholders now as we move forward with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4011.083s">So</a>  I'm, for one person who worked very hard with the recreation group and this being one of the pieces that when you talked about arts and not just sports and fields but <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4023.988s">the</a>  whole gamut of what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4025.609s">I</a>  think it's really exciting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4027.171s">So,</a>  again, I thank you for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4029.092s">I</a>  know Roberta's still sitting back there, but thank you for everything you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4032.555s">And</a>  I'm, for one counts, I'm very excited to see what's coming in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4036.298s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4037.919s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4038.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4039.701s">If</a>  we could just request a copy of the email that went out to the 200 organizations and people from. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4052.331s">Devens,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4052.912s">Devens.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4054.977s">Danielle</a>  Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4055.637s">Oh,</a>  Danielle Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4056.658s">If</a>  we could get that email. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4058.039s">And</a>  then I request that you just take another look and potentially, possibly push the first date two weeks just to get a little more, two to three weeks just to get a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4071.016s">let</a>  the public know a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4072.417s">I</a>  feel like I get the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4074.178s">I</a>  didn't know of this date. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4075.819s">And</a>  I feel like I just want to make sure that it is potentially $1.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4082.144s">And</a>  I want to make sure that everybody and every organization is fully aware of this application date. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4088.808s">That's</a>  just my only request. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4090.61s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4090.89s">Respectfully.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4091.43s">Roberta,</a>  did you want to say anything?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4097.527s">Unfortunately,</a>  I didn't have the opportunity to hear everything that was said. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4101.692s">I</a>  kind of walked in in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4103.194s">But</a>  just in response to your last statement or request about the timeline is that we're squeezing the first round in because we're already a year overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4117.61s">And</a>  we worked backwards from when we needed you to be able to approve the funds, and worked backwards to give ourselves the minimal time that we felt that we needed to be able to consider each of the applications fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4131.776s">And</a>  that's what drove the December 15 date. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4134.477s">So</a>  we worked very hard to have the plan completed in time to be able to roll out the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4143.2s">We've</a>  been doing the best that we can to get the word out about that, but as Doug mentioned earlier, the first hurdle, the eligibility determination form is a very brief form. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4156.168s">So</a>  if people are aware of it, if they have a project that they think is ready to go for the first round, submit the form immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4163.852s">If</a>  you have a project that needs a little bit more time to cook, submit for the second round. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4168.855s">We'll</a>  take your eligibility application form any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4172.638s">And</a>  we can work with you to figure out which funding round you best fit into. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4178.605s">But</a>  there's a second funding round coming up this coming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4183.21s">So</a>  really the deadline is, if you look at it, March is your next chance to get in line.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4193.211s">Also,</a>  if you submit an eligibility form, it does not commit you to doing that project immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4198.839s">It</a>  could be done in the second round. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4200.441s">You</a>  just want to know, is it eligible? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4201.663s">You</a>  don't have to do it as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4204.086s">I</a>  can tell you that I know the Berkshire State is going to submit like seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4208.912s">They're</a>  not going to do seven in one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4210.213s">We're</a>  going to do that over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4211.714s">We</a>  want to know if they're eligible just to get in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4214.557s">Might</a>  be only one or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4215.537s">And</a>  then, of course, we don't even know if they're going to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4217.199s">And</a>  obviously, I have a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4219.281s">And</a>  I will recuse myself, as the councilor just did right now, earlier this evening on the evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4225.846s">So</a>  just getting the eligibility form is just the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4228.648s">But</a>  it doesn't mean you're going to start building this in March of next year at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4233.312s">There'll</a>  be time to properly vet things.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4238.281s">To</a>  the chair, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4239.382s">Because</a>  maybe that's where I'm confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4241.543s">So</a>  the eligibility, the way I'm looking at the key dates, I think it's different than what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4246.486s">Because</a>  December 15th, it says that simple form is due for round one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4252.27s">And</a>  then it says March 2nd, full applications are due for round one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4256.812s">But</a>  I asked the question, when will they be awarded? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4258.914s">And</a>  I thought you said March.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4261.815s">No,</a>  they will be awarded in, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4264.957s">May</a>  so okay, so that's my problem.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4267.739s">So</a>  may isn't on this key date, which is confusing Yeah, and that is a key date for you.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4272.241s">So</a>  I should have put that on the memorandum for you This is it the key date for the public is to know that they'll be asked if they're applicants They'll be asked to present to us publicly in April so that we can vet those projects before we recommend them to you and then we would ask for your We'll give that <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4292.732s">the</a>  round of recommendations for your approval in May.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4296.855s">Okay,</a>  so if an organization does not have the simple form done by the end of next week or December 15th, they are not eligible to fill out a full application for March 2nd?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4310.083s">Correct,</a>  but they will be eligible to submit the full application in September, or I'm sorry,</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4322.093s">For</a>  round two? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4322.753s">For</a>  round two, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4324.094s">Okay,</a>  so that's where I just find it an issue with regards to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4329.195s">This</a>  is the first we've publicly kind of learned of the December 15th date. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4333.936s">Like</a>  I said, I try to stay on top of the politics on social media and the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4340.458s">This</a>  is the first I'm learning of the December 15th date. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4343.567s">which</a>  even though there's going to be a round two, a lot of organizations may want to get in on that first round. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4349.908s">I</a>  mean, they're going to know there's going to be less applicants, they're going to have more ability to potentially get some part of the CPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4359.79s">If</a>  you don't plan on meeting, you know, the week of Christmas and New Year's, I respectfully ask, I know it's time crunch and I know how hard you work, but I just ask that we give this, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4372.589s">you</a>  know, full transparency to the public and definitely publicize this a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4377.453s">That's</a>  really my only concern.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4379.756s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4383.739s">Did</a>  you mention that we also have a process where we will be willing to accept off-cycle applications? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4391.787s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4393.244s">So</a>  if there is an applicant who has an urgent need for funding for a high priority project that doesn't fall within our timeline that we've laid out, we are willing to work with the applicant for those urgent high priority projects to meet the timeline that they need to consider their application. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4418.955s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4419.475s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4421.197s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4422.658s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4423.539s">One</a>  quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4424.219s">So</a>  as far as those projects go, those urgent projects, what will be an example of an urgent project that would be eligible for this type of funding?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4431.373s">A</a>  common example is property acquisition. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4434.175s">If</a>  there's an opportunity to make a property acquisition, it can't wait months. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4438.778s">They</a>  would need to be able to line up the funding in a timely manner so that they can close on a property acquisition in the time that the market demands.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4450.865s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4454.047s">So</a>  like something that was maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4456.702s">potentially</a>  gonna be developed, but the city had the option to buy it and prevent development, something like that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4463.029s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4464.211s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4465.572s">Councilor</a>  Knights?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4466.233s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4467.755s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4469.177s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knights to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4473.141s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4474.222s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4475.644s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4479.033s">Name</a>  and address of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4479.914s">Thank</a>  you, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4483.156s">Good</a>  evening, honorable Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4484.677s">This</a>  is Tuesday, it must be Medford City Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4489.981s">I</a>  have an idea for CPA fixed, if they could do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4495.024s">It</a>  may seem trivial to some of you, but presentation, I believe, is everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4501.569s">And</a>  I'm talking about the staple that's missing at 30 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4505.852s">As</a>  you're coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4508.227s">from</a>  Route 93, north or south, the only Route 16 exit, through the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4516.594s">In</a>  front of, or next door, I should say, to the Methodist Cinema, which is now Elizabeth Grady, there's a church there at 30 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4526.001s">It's</a>  been missing the steeple for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4530.645s">And</a>  it is the gateway into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4534.768s">Now,</a>  I would think <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4538.889s">It</a>  would be a good idea to place some sort of finial on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4543.61s">It</a>  doesn't have to be a full-blown, heavy-duty, original staple. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4549.471s">However,</a>  anything would be better than a flat top. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4555.352s">I</a>  think it would be appropriate in our downtown center as it is in most other downtowns I've been to, whether it's Chelsea, Malden, or especially Winchester.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4564.394s">You</a>  should contact that group and have them file with the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4569.781s">that</a>  you contact the church and have the church file an application.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4573.722s">Just</a>  feel for at least 25 years, it seems to me that I shouldn't be the one that brings it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4579.364s">It</a>  should have been done a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4581.504s">If</a>  it was structurally sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4583.805s">Thank</a>  you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4584.725s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4587.226s">Communications</a>  from the mayor, 17787. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4591.519s">Dear</a>  Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the appropriation of retained earnings in the amount of $268,000.00 to fund repairs to Douglas Road due to a leak in the water main line causing flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4607.582s">The</a>  balance of retained earnings before this vote is $7,389,422.00. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4612.983s">DDBW</a>  Commissioner Brian Kerins is present to answer any questions for the council regarding this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4621.762s">Mr.</a>  Kearns, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4624.525s">Brian</a>  Kearns, Milton Terrace Hyde Park.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4628.408s">Do</a>  we have any questions for Mr. Kearns?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4630.59s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4631.711s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4632.632s">Mr.</a>  Kearns, just a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4634.213s">Can</a>  you just tell us a little bit about the water leak, the cause of the water leak, when it happens?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4639.85s">It</a>  was brought to my attention by a constituent a little over a month ago that he was getting water in his basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4649.495s">At</a>  that point in time, I had our water and sewer department dispatched out there to see where the source was potentially coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4658.5s">And</a>  okay, the long and short of it is we narrowed it down to the actual main itself on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4667.425s">All</a>  right, and we had our own leak detection equipment out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4671.608s">We</a>  also called in MWRA, all right, to come in and assist us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4675.97s">They</a>  have a more elaborate setup. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4678.291s">Off</a>  peak time, daytime, nighttime, to try to narrow down exactly where this leak was occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4685.435s">And</a>  we've actually isolated it down to a 400-foot section of main that the leak is in, but we can't narrow it down any further than that because that whole area is impacted with clay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4698.804s">Clay</a>  is actually acting as an insulation around the existing pipe that's there, and we're losing the sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4705.849s">It's</a>  almost like sonar gear for a submarine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4709.611s">We</a>  can hear it, but then it stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4712.053s">Now,</a>  we've shut off the actual main itself, all right, in both directions, and when we do that, the leak in the home stops, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4722.055s">So,</a>  as a result of that, we know that there is a leak that has occurred and is occurring within this 400-foot section. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4729.997s">Now,</a>  going back through the history, all right, obviously, this is Douglas Road, by the way, between Summer and George, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4736.999s">The</a>  water main that exists today was installed in 1927. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4742.26s">It's</a>  a six inch main and given the age factor with tuberculation has occurred, there's probably maybe only a three inch clearance going through the existing pipe as it stands today, which is not uncommon in the water and sewer business. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4762.5s">The</a>  main service is 32 homes on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4768.707s">Going</a>  through all the records and everything, it was just several years ago, the gas main was replaced on that entire street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4778.858s">Well,</a>  as a result of the age and the condition of this pipe, the amount of pipe that we already have to replace, meeting with the mayor, we both agreed to replace the entire main on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4795.432s">And</a>  to do it right away, because even if we just replace that 400 foot section, through my experience in this business, once you touch something, it spreads. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4807.198s">And</a>  let's do it one stop shopping here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4810.96s">Replace</a>  the entire main right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4814.182s">We</a>  already have a contractor in the city who's actually working down on <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4819.164s">I</a>  think it's one of the side streets down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4822.227s">I</a>  can have them start as early as next week, okay, to put the new main in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4826.751s">Now,</a>  we put a winter binder on the main, okay, once it's installed, all right, then return in the spring because, okay, with the money that the DPW has requested, the $268,000, that's also going to do curb-to-curb repaving in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4844.948s">some</a>  casting adjustments and some new castings as needed, curbing adjustments as needed, and sidewalk replacement panels as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4854.155s">All</a>  right, we're gonna go full, full width down the entire length of that street, and that will, you know, to completely upgrade the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4863.041s">Actually,</a>  in addition to that, we're probably also gonna install an additional fire hydrant, okay, even though there's adequate fire suppression there, an additional one while we're installing, okay, the new main.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4874.45s">It</a>  sounds like there's two parts to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4877.957s">As</a>  far as replacing the main, putting in the new hydrant, how long will that take?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4883.898s">The</a>  new main, if he were to get the green light from the council this evening, he probably would be starting maybe actually a week from today, all right, or next Wednesday he'd start. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4896.328s">And</a>  he could probably go within a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4898.729s">Again,</a>  with weather, you know, that would also have to be the concern as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4904.273s">But,</a>  you know, we want to, you know, go right ahead and do it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4908.617s">And,</a>  you know, within two weeks he'd have the new main in.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4912.414s">So</a>  when they're actually installing the new main, what can the residents expect as far as, will they be without water periods during the day, I imagine?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4922.617s">No,</a>  there'd be no loss of water service, Council, because what we would do is we would install a temporary line that would be on the surface of the roadway, in the gutter line, going to the individual homes, and then at that point, we shut the main down, and then excavate and start replacing it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4941.783s">So</a>  I actually took a ride down the street the other day just to kind of check out the situation and view it firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4948.392s">And</a>  there's markings all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4951.236s">And</a>  actually at one point the street looks like it comes up on a mound. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4955.661s">It</a>  looks like something's going on underneath.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4958.465s">Yeah,</a>  it's the soil, Councilor, like I said, it's heavily loaded with clay in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4965.727s">And,</a>  you know, it's probably one of the worst types of soil you want to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4971.889s">But,</a>  you know, when we come back in in the spring, all right, and we, you know, scarify and do repaving, we'd be eliminating it at that point in time.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4980.866s">Is</a>  there any concern, so when you connect that main on Douglas, that's connecting then to?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4987.569s">Yeah,</a>  it's Summer and George. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4989.009s">Summer</a>  and George, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4990.27s">Okay,</a>  and they're okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4992.09s">Those</a>  are newer mains? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4992.93s">Right,</a>  yeah, no problems there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=4995.051s">But</a>  this will also include new tees, valves, shutoffs, be the full gamut on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5003.095s">We</a>  can take advantage of it because, like I said, it was only several years ago the new gas main was installed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5009.022s">So</a>  I'm not concerned with the utility companies coming in for an emergency at any point in time in the near future.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5015.476s">I</a>  mean, it sounds like, I mean, it's almost 100 years old, so it sounds like the whole thing probably should be replaced, but thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5021.578s">Okay,</a>  thank you, sir.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5022.738s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5024.579s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5027.32s">If</a>  I could, through the chair, say thank you, Commissioner, for bringing this forward and taking the course of action that you're taking in repairing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5037.863s">I</a>  think it's an appropriate use of this money, and it's going to go a long way in giving a good quality of life to the citizens there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5048.252s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5048.692s">I</a>  know your staff does excellent work in communicating to the neighbors what they're going to encounter in these projects, and I can only foresee this going well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5062.764s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5063.944s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5064.365s">Mr.</a>  President, Mr. Chairman, move approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5068.197s">On</a>  the motion of approval, Council Member Curran. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5070.038s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5071.719s">If</a>  you could just explain, Commissioner Cairns, a little bit more about how you're going to potentially start the work very shortly, and then you're going to finish it in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5080.806s">Will</a>  the road be closed back up and then reopened?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5084.424s">Yeah,</a>  okay, right now the contractor, as a matter of fact, he's on, I think it's Linden Street, actually putting a new water main in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5093.011s">What</a>  we would do is we would put in the temporary water lines that would go into the homes, the 32 homes in that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5102.838s">And</a>  then at that point in time, saw, cut, and excavate a trench exposing the existing pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5109.864s">Excavate</a>  it, remove it, and install the new pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5114.712s">backfill</a>  with clean fill and not clay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5117.316s">Alright,</a>  tamper it down, put a winter patch on it, energize it, chlorinate it, and then remove the temporary pipe that we had installed in the homes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5128.451s">And</a>  that will be done now?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5129.671s">Yeah,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5131.472s">That's</a>  the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5133.912s">If</a>  they're going to be without water at any point in time, it's when we're going to be connecting up the temporary line from the permanent line. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5141.374s">Probably</a>  an hour's job, OK, they'd be without water. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5144.635s">But</a>  they would certainly get plenty of notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5147.595s">And</a>  it would happen at an off-peak time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5150.476s">So</a>  that way, we're not concerned with people trying to get to work in the morning, lacking water for showers, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5155.917s">At</a>  the same time, we don't want to inconvenience people at night.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5159.72s">You</a>  had mentioned there's going to be no loss of water, so I believe you on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5165.831s">Could</a>  you just clarify, could you have mentioned doing some of the work now and then doing the rest in the spring? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5172.386s">so</a>  the street will remain open?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5174.467s">The</a>  street will remain passable at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5178.168s">The</a>  only time that the street may be shut down will be in the spring when we coal plane it and repave the entire street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5187.892s">So</a>  depending on the location of the equipment at the time when they resurface it in the spring, it'll only be like a temporary shutdown till we either remove the old existing asphalt or install the new asphalt.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5201.273s">and</a>  the reason we can't do the whole project now.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5204.915s">The</a>  weather is coming upon us, Council, that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5208.978s">So</a>  too cold to repave.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5210.479s">Okay,</a>  that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5211.879s">That's</a>  the only step that needs to be done in the spring.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5213.881s">That's</a>  correct, yeah, okay, and some casting adjustments, okay, manholes, all right, is, you know, another term, manhole either adjustments or replacements, all right, and then also curbing realignment, and then possibly some sidewalk work.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5229.885s">So</a>  how will Douglas Road be left from when you finish the first portion until the spring?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5235.551s">It'll</a>  be a long, fresh patch, trench patch, down the center of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5246.122s">And</a>  then in the springtime, we'll return.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5249.087s">and</a>  pave the whole streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5250.569s">But</a>  the trench patch will be safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5253.133s">Or</a>  are we going to be blocking it off?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5254.515s">No,</a>  it will be up to street grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5256.077s">It</a>  will be a winter hot tub.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5258.521s">That's</a>  what I'm trying to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5259.803s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5260.664s">Winter</a>  hot tub.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5262.126s">DPW</a>  has its own language on some of these terms.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5265.01s">Okay,</a>  so there'll be a winter hot tub, everything will be safe, and then in the spring we're going to repave the whole street, do any sidewalk repair.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5270.673s">That's</a>  correct, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5272.533s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5273.274s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5273.974s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5275.235s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5278.076s">I</a>  can feel my phone blowing up already from Parris Street and Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5283.638s">This</a>  is being done because there's a major water leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5287.32s">and</a>  those projects are still on course as we've talked about for the spring, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5293.281s">Yeah,</a>  nothing's been compromised. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5296.302s">I</a>  can just only imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5298.103s">So,</a>  again, this is because there's a major water leak in that area that needs to be done.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5302.544s">That's</a>  correct, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5303.704s">Matter</a>  of fact, I have almost weekly dialogue with two of the homeowners out there, and they've been very, very patient and understanding, but they also know there's a process that we have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5314.226s">I</a>  can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5314.967s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Carrings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5315.967s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5316.607s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5317.808s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5318.848s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5319.609s">Mr.</a>  Kearns, can you tell me who the contractor is that's been selected to perform the work, if the money is appropriate?</p>

    <p>[BBC Broadcast]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5934.597s">corporate</a>  tax havens, places like Ireland, where companies will stash lots of money that Trump would rather have repatriated here to the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5942.323s">And</a>  so that seems to be a main focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5944.125s">And</a>  whatever focus we did have on cracking down on this kind of activity revealed in the Panama or the Paradise Papers has kind of fallen off the map a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5952.771s">Andrew,</a>  is there a case for saying that all this protest is not only pointless, but also perhaps counterproductive, and that actually tax havens are a way almost of the free market of nations, you know, if I give less tax, if I take less tax from you, you'll come and be in my country, that's my benefit, that's the game I'm playing, and any country can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5974.89s">I</a>  think that's an important point that you make there, Roger, and I think that that's where we sort of have to be realistic about this debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5981.733s">You're</a>  always going to get countries that have higher or lower tax rates for particular reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5988.095s">It</a>  seems to me, therefore, that the debate around tax havens has to be around <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5993.397s">getting</a>  international standards around transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=5996.079s">So</a>  you look at a place like Hong Kong, we have tax here around 15% personal taxes, 16.5% for companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6003.242s">That's</a>  low, but it's not the lowest in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6006.003s">What</a>  the real concern about Hong Kong is the transparency of the tax system. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6010.145s">And</a>  in particular, it's the ownership of companies here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6013.506s">We</a>  have a lot of shell companies, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6015.147s">the</a>  allegation, the suspicion is that a lot of those are used for tax avoidance and money laundering as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6023.477s">Now</a>  that's where potentially you can work to get international standards of disclosure and transparency around tax and companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6034.03s">The</a>  idea that you're going to get some sort of harmony over actual tax rates, I think, you know, that's just not realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6039.832s">And</a>  also maybe not desirable. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6041.513s">Is</a>  it even right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6042.693s">I</a>  mean, shouldn't there be an element of competition in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6046.835s">You</a>  know, I think there should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6047.875s">And</a>  I think developing nations, if part of their, sort of, the pitch they're making to international investors is we have low taxes here and that's how we're going to develop our country, that to me should be fair enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6062.181s">But</a>  what I think you can say to developing nations and developed countries alike is we want to know more about, you know, who exactly is stashing money in your country so that we can combat tax avoidance and we can combat money laundering and all the problems that come with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6080.438s">Yeah,</a>  but Tony, we know, don't we, that in a place like Switzerland, the actual ability not to be seen is a big part of the attraction for a lot of countries, isn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6090.874s">A</a>  lot of investors, they want to go places where whatever they're doing isn't in the public gaze. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6097.275s">Yeah,</a>  that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6097.936s">It's</a>  a feature, not a bug. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6099.739s">And</a>  it's interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6102.262s">It</a>  makes me think back to our conversation about Deutsche Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6106.589s">Right</a>  now we have a president whose finances are pretty opaque, and I don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6112.317s">where</a>  President Trump's money is tied up, but it's kind of a recurring problem throughout, at least here in the US, trying to manage and debate the issue of tax savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6122.304s">A</a>  lot of the people who are in power are a lot of the people who are squirreling money away in these countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6128.368s">And</a>  Tanya, we talked about Delaware and Nevada. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6130.55s">Do</a>  Americans and other states resent the fact that these states use that mechanism, or do they just think that's fine, that's just the way it works? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6139.106s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6139.626s">I</a>  think, you know, like you said, there's a free market between countries, between states. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6144.189s">They</a>  can really do whatever they want to remain competitive, and I think those states would tell you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6150.614s">I</a>  think a lot of the resentment that you've seen build up here is more, you know, when jobs move overseas, when money is stashed away overseas, or at least that's what, you know, the current political climate has gotten people riled up about. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6163.502s">Maybe</a>  there should be more resentment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6164.502s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6165.503s">Andrew,</a>  let me come back to you finally on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6167.185s">I</a>  mean, is there a moral case for saying actually these companies should be able to avoid tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6173.012s">They</a>  should just be able to, they have to pay tax at perhaps a normal standard rate wherever they are in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6180.236s">Well,</a>  I just, I mean, you know, if there is a moral case for that, it's unfortunately not a realistic case. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6185.699s">I</a>  mean, some people would say, in fact, the most sensible thing to do is not tax companies at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6190.961s">And</a>  then you, you avoid the problem altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6193.663s">And</a>  you tax individuals, because, you know, at the end of the day, if you don't tax companies, that means they can pay out more in dividends and payouts to their shareholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6202.027s">And</a>  that should <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6202.967s">increase</a>  the wealth of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6204.308s">Now,</a>  I think, you know, there are plenty of arguments against that as well, but the idea that you can harmonize tax across the world, I think, is slightly for the birds, and that's why I say I think that transparency and disclosure is the way forward here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6219.675s">That's</a>  probably where, more realistically, you can get some international pressure and you can get some international cooperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6227.678s">Well,</a>  I guess it's an argument that's going to roll on for an awful long time in lots of places and not just in the EU. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6233.003s">Thanks</a>  very much to both of you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6235.305s">Let's</a>  bring ourselves up to date with the business matters headlines with Jerry Smith.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_81]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6239.548s">Reports</a>  say that Donald Trump's account with a major investment bank is being investigated as part of an inquiry into possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 US presidential election. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6250.558s">President</a>  Trump has previously taken out a multi-million dollar loan with Deutsche Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6256.41s">The</a>  European Union has published its first blacklist of tax havens, naming 17 territories, including Saint Lucia, Barbados and South Korea. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6265.736s">It's</a>  also published a grey list of 47 additional countries which say they're on the way to changing to EU standard tax rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6273.702s">These</a>  include Hong Kong, Turkey, Bermuda and Switzerland. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6277.304s">Both</a>  lists have been criticised as omitting the most notorious tax havens.</p>

    <p>[BBC Broadcast]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6282.087s">Jerry,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6282.788s">Now,</a>  it's that moment in the programme where we link up with one of our reporters. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6285.432s">Today,</a>  it's Rahul Tandon joining us live on the line from Kolkata. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6289.276s">Now,</a>  Rahul, smog, cricket, they don't go together, do they?</p>

    <p>[Rahul Tandon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6294.033s">No,</a>  they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6294.614s">I</a>  mean, an extraordinary test match that has been taking place in Delhi. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6298.817s">Really</a>  not for what was happening on the pitch, but what was happening off it, Roger, where we had play stopped but for pollution. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6306.363s">First</a>  ever, I think, in the history of cricket. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6310.266s">We</a>  had the Sri Lankans saying they couldn't continue the match because the breathing conditions were so difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6315.69s">you</a>  know on yesterday on the last day of the test match we had an Indian bowler vomiting on the pitch we've had Sri Lankan bowlers doing the same and I think what this is bringing into focus is a much bigger debate about the huge problem that pollution now poses not just in Delhi I'm in Kolkata this morning where there is smog around the city we have <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6336.68s">pollution</a>  levels that rival Delhi at this particular point in time, 15 to 20 sometimes, 25 times above the recommended levels that the World Health Organization says that we should be breathing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6349.943s">And</a>  I think this is affecting Indians, but I think for business as well it's going to affect it in a big way, because I think a lot of people are going to think long and hard about whether they want to come and visit India's big cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6360.766s">To</a>  give you an idea of how big the problem is, I've been speaking to a couple of sports people in Kolkata.</p>

    <p>[BBC Broadcast]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6367.035s">I'm</a>  absolutely struggling to breathe today. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6368.737s">I</a>  can feel, like, the pollution, like, clogging up in my throat as I'm breathing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6372.521s">And</a>  I'm an athlete, so I'm out in the open a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6375.825s">I'm</a>  finding it absolutely difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6377.146s">I</a>  wake up every morning just, like, gasping for air.</p>

    <p>[Rahul Tandon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6380.43s">Does</a>  it make you think about going out?</p>

    <p>[BBC Broadcast]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6382.272s">I</a>  wish I could not, but I play golf every day and I can't help it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6385.393s">I</a>  have to play through everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6386.854s">You</a>  know, whenever we travel, you know, we play outside and we can feel the difference in our performance or the amount we can run and how much easier it is to run outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6395.797s">You</a>  know, even with the temperature change or in higher altitudes, we still do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6400.399s">Whereas</a>  here, it should be easier for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6403.0s">And</a>  we are used to this temperature, but we still find it tougher because the pollution is increasing by the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6407.949s">The</a>  difficulties of sports people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6410.414s">Rahul,</a>  what about you? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6411.496s">In</a>  Kolkata, you say there is smog there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6413.179s">Do</a>  you notice? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6413.94s">Do</a>  you find yourself coughing? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6415.263s">Do</a>  you find it's a problem on a day-to-day basis?</p>

    <p>[Rahul Tandon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6419.981s">It's</a>  a huge problem, Roger. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6421.242s">I</a>  mean, I would say over the last week, I, like most people in Kolkata, is the pollution has really got a lot worse because as the temperatures drop, you know, it can't basically expand. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6430.627s">It</a>  can't move up in the air and it stays and hovers around. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6434.109s">Yeah,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6435.29s">I</a>  mean, sore throats all the time, coughing a lot of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6440.033s">You</a>  just don't feel particularly well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6441.734s">You</a>  can taste it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6442.594s">I</a>  mean, I'm on my balcony this morning and you can see the haze and you can sort of taste it in your <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6447.757s">in</a>  your mouth and I think it is such an issue here now and it's an issue that really doesn't seem to be getting any better. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6455.139s">I</a>  was talking to doctors the other day who say you know they see a lot more children coming in with asthma, they see a lot more older people coming in now with severe lung problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6463.8s">I</a>  mean some of the stats are incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6465.381s">Look</a>  at an issue of premature death which in most countries as medical care you know improves is getting much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6472.822s">In</a>  India over the last 10 years it's almost doubled and it's worse and a lot of people are now <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6477.403s">putting</a>  it down to pollution. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6478.484s">So</a>  yeah, it really does affect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6480.105s">And</a>  I think there is a big economic consequence that India could face. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6484.248s">I</a>  mean, a recent report last year by the World Bank said it could affect GDP by up to 8% a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6489.872s">Unless</a>  India tackles this, I think the economic and health consequences are going to be huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6494.616s">But</a>  because India needs to generate more power and people want to travel in cars and public transport systems are not good here, we don't seem to be on the verge of improving the air quality here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6504.943s">You</a>  know Delhi at one stage recently, Roger, was I think a hundred times above what the World Health Organization recommended and it reached a point where doctors were saying you should probably evacuate the city.</p>

    <p>[BBC Broadcast]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6516.191s">Well</a>  let's go from finally and briefly one of the, obviously a real bad taste in the mouth, perhaps a metaphorical one, which is the Vijay Malaiya case, one of India's most high-profile businessmen, extradition question mark.</p>

    <p>[Rahul Tandon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6530.573s">Yeah,</a>  well that's taking place very close to you in London at this particular point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6534.115s">Getting</a>  a lot of coverage here in India. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6535.816s">India's</a>  most flamboyant businessman. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6538.097s">He's</a>  basically accused of misleading banks to loan money to his collapsed airlines and that he then wasted that basically on his own personal lifestyle. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6547.222s">A</a>  very important case, I think, because a lot of questions were being asked about how he was allowed to leave the country <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6553.185s">in</a>  the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6554.065s">So</a>  if the government can get Mr. Malia back, and the last date of this hearing is on the 14th of December, maybe they're going to have a good Christmas, maybe not going to be such a good one for him.</p>

    <p>[BBC Broadcast]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6562.968s">Alright,</a>  well we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6563.908s">Just</a>  before you go there, Rahul, just very quickly, a difficult question for you, but how would you define happiness?</p>

    <p>[Rahul Tandon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6572.42s">Oh,</a>  how would I define happiness? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6575.321s">There's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6576.341s">I'll</a>  tell you what. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6577.301s">I'll</a>  tell you, Roger. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6577.941s">When</a>  I experience it, I'll let you know.</p>

    <p>[BBC Broadcast]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6579.942s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6580.282s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6580.522s">We'll</a>  let you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6581.182s">Thanks</a>  very much indeed, Rahul. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6582.742s">Now,</a>  the reason I was asking Rahul that rather strange and fairly philosophical question is that we are interested in a case that's come up in Nigeria. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6592.625s">Now,</a>  the governor of Nigeria's Imo state, Rojas Okorocha, has appointed his sister as commissioner for happiness and couples fulfillment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6602.787s">The</a>  governor's spokesman said there wasn't anything unusual about the appointment, as Mr. Okorocha always wanted to make people happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6609.148s">Well,</a>  I've been speaking to Yemi Adamokolekun, who is one of the founders of the campaign called Enough is Enough Nigeria. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6616.61s">It's</a>  a good governance advocacy group based in Lagos. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6621.091s">Now,</a>  she says a minister of happiness isn't perhaps as absurd as it sounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6626.715s">The</a>  UAE actually has one, and the role of the Minister of Happiness is a person who oversees the UAE's plans, programmes and policies to achieve a happier society. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6638.047s">So</a>  there's a clear mandate for a Minister of Happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6640.85s">But</a>  we need to define what happiness is, I suppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6643.373s">I</a>  mean, you and I might agree, we might disagree on what happiness exactly is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6647.838s">Well,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6648.598s">According</a>  to the lady who was tweeting earlier today, she's been responsible for hospitality for the Imo State government for the last six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6656.822s">So</a>  it was considered it was a natural fit for her to continue to make provisions for large Christmas tree, catering for statewide events. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6664.925s">So</a>  things that relate to fun occasions that the state organizes she was responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6670.887s">So</a>  in their definition, it's just fun events. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6675.429s">Fun</a>  events equals happy society. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6678.11s">I</a>  mean, fun and happiness, I suppose, again, philosophically, you might not think of the same thing, but I mean, maybe if people had more money or didn't have to worry about illness, I mean, those kind of things might bring them happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6689.7s">Most</a>  definitely, especially in this context. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6691.582s">So</a>  the governor of Imo, for example, is owing pensioners, I think, either 14 or 16 months of salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6697.987s">So</a>  I would agree with you that if those ones actually were able to meet their basic needs they will be quite quite happy rather than having a Christmas tree to go and look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6708.237s">I'm</a>  detecting you don't think this is a particularly well that this is in the end a fairly absurd thing to do to a Minister for Happiness when that kind of thing's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6717.045s">Yeah</a>  in this context I mean the UAE it's quite okay for them to have a Minister of Happiness because if you have <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6722.71s">The</a>  GDP per capita that they do and sort of income inequality is not a major issue in the UAE. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6729.214s">In</a>  Nigeria it is a huge issue and especially in the state in question where there are evidence that the governor is not spending the state's resources judiciously. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6739.12s">So</a>  large Christmas tree, lavish events. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6741.661s">I</a>  think for his birthday there were like 25 cakes stacked on top of each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6746.884s">And</a>  then in recent months, he's done a statue of Jacob Zuba, and Jacob Zuba flew in to commission the statue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6753.33s">Spending</a>  state resources on things like that, to me, are just quite absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6757.834s">And</a>  you don't really need a Minister of Happiness to make people happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6760.496s">You</a>  just need to respond to their needs to be able to meet their basic needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6765.32s">But</a>  it's made this lady quite happy, I suppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6767.522s">I'm</a>  indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6768.163s">She's</a>  actually the minister, the governor's biological sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6771.169s">So</a>  she's quite comfortable in the role that she's been given and she, according to her tweet, is looking forward to doing more to make the people of Imo happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6779.835s">Yemi,</a>  that set us all to thinking about whether governments or that kind of thing could actually talk about happiness in this sort of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6788.881s">Is</a>  it quantifiable? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6790.062s">I</a>  mean, Andrew, I do remember it was Bhutan, I think, started talking about the gross national happiness and somehow they could go towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6796.967s">I</a>  mean, do you believe that's possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6799.808s">I'm</a>  pretty skeptical, I'm afraid, Roger. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6802.17s">My</a>  concern here is, I remember a few years ago, David Cameron, former UK Prime Minister, when he was in opposition, during the years running up to the financial crisis, he would say, well, you know, we've got to start thinking beyond GDP growth, and we've got to start thinking about the happiness of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6818.783s">And</a>  then, of course, the financial crisis hit, and everyone was <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6821.485s">thinking,</a>  crikey, we've got to sort out the economy here first. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6824.546s">And</a>  it seems to me that when people start talking about this sort of thing, it's a it's a sort of worrying counter cyclical sign that we're getting a bit complacent about things and that actually government should stick to the knitting of just running the country competently. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6839.633s">And</a>  whether I'm happy or not, I'll decide for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6843.697s">But</a>  as long as the country is run well, that's what I want from my government. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6847.461s">Well,</a>  that's an interesting one, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6849.222s">Tony,</a>  isn't the problem his definition? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6851.865s">I</a>  mean, what is happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6852.866s">Some</a>  people are happy with one thing, other people are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6856.569s">You</a>  can't really quantify or measure it, can you? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6859.737s">No,</a>  you can't, although I'm sure I'm not the only one who's thinking about it here at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6865.662s">This</a>  is a fascinating story. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6867.844s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6868.304s">I</a>  think I come down on Andy's side with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6871.407s">I</a>  think stability, consistency in government would make me very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6878.793s">Well,</a>  there we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6879.253s">You</a>  see, now you have defined it a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6880.894s">I</a>  mean, surely, Tony, there must be other things that make you happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6883.155s">For</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6883.695s">Yeah,</a>  which perhaps, you know, you could make a list and say, right, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6887.697s">Now</a>  I can get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6888.638s">I</a>  can even ask the government for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6890.178s">And</a>  then I shall achieve happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6891.719s">Isn't</a>  that the way forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6894.46s">Yeah,</a>  I suppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6894.941s">I</a>  don't know if you need a commissioner for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6898.262s">All</a>  right, then, come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6899.143s">What</a>  would make you happy, Tony? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6901.804s">Just</a>  a few achievable things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6903.385s">Come</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6904.005s">It's</a>  getting towards the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6905.846s">People</a>  might be thinking what to give you for Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6907.467s">You</a>  never know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6908.863s">A</a>  giant Christmas tree sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6910.623s">I</a>  think if our government could get right on that for me or for whoever, you know, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6916.425s">Andrew,</a>  it's an interesting, the part of the world you are, there is in some ways a more, I don't know, a mechanical attitude perhaps to some of the things that can bring happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6926.947s">People</a>  think, well, we will get this and that and the government can bring it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6930.328s">and</a>  they can make it happen and then we will have a nice utilitarian kind of paradise. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6935.792s">I</a>  mean, do you think that's particularly something that in your part of the world, in Asia, is more of a thing people think about? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6942.535s">I</a>  think people in this part of the world, particularly in Hong Kong, happiness is quite associated with wealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6949.78s">Let's</a>  put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6951.902s">And</a>  I think certainly in Hong Kong, as long as the government kind of gets out of the way and lets people get on and make money, then that's what makes the people here generally happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6963.129s">I</a>  mean obviously on the mainland in China you have a slightly different approach where the government sort of is responsible for most things including the delivery of happiness to the people and I just worry that that is not exactly the way that countries are best run. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6979.315s">Is</a>  that because it's a very materialistic way? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6981.316s">I</a>  mean we think of a lot of course of philosophy coming out of Asia as well but is there a certain materialism you know that happiness is measurable as you say in wealth terms it's clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=6994.528s">You</a>  could argue that these are quite heavy topics for a Thursday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7001.271s">I</a>  think, look, I don't want to generalize too much about Hong Kongers in the sense that I don't want to tar them with just being interested in money. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7009.254s">But</a>  I do think that it is a feature of the society out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7016.757s">And</a>  perhaps that comes from historical background where <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7020.258s">you</a>  know, people have had to work hard for a living here and in this part of the world and so the attainment of a certain level of standard of living is something that's associated with happiness and you can't blame people for that if, you know, they've come from a generally poor background and a poor historical background. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7039.428s">All</a>  right, well finally then, Andrew, what would constitute happiness for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7042.529s">Come</a>  on, I've put Tony through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7044.57s">I</a>  was pretty happy over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7045.911s">I</a>  was sat watching England play Australia in Adelaide. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7049.573s">What</a>  would have made me happier is if England had been playing a bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7052.515s">I</a>  was going to say the outcome, but we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7054.677s">I'm</a>  a simple guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7056.338s">Good</a>  game of cricket, but England winning is what makes me happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7059.76s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7060.6s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7060.68s">Well,</a>  we'll send you on your way happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7062.442s">And</a>  Tony, we hope we send you on your way too. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7064.763s">Perhaps</a>  you will get that large Christmas tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7066.784s">And</a>  as for me, well, it's the end of the programme and I get to go to bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7069.686s">What</a>  could be a better happiness? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7070.747s">Thank</a>  you very much for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7072.028s">That's</a>  it from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7072.968s">Back</a>  same time tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_106]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7329.075s">In</a>  Ventura County, to the north of Los Angeles, a wildfire which broke out on Monday intensified with terrifying speed, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by arid and gusty Santa Ana winds. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7341.812s">Scores</a>  of homes were gutted and a mental health hospital was destroyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7346.157s">Here,</a>  on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the charred ruins of houses are still smoking, while dark, choking smoke has closed a major moat away. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7354.781s">Ash</a>  is blowing through the air, and there is a firefighting helicopter overhead. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7359.183s">And</a>  with forecasters warning that ferocious winds and low humidity will continue for several days, this could yet get a lot worse.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7508.417s">Thanks</a>  very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7509.017s">You're</a>  listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service with Oliver Conway. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7513.619s">Despite</a>  warnings from Arab leaders about the possible dangerous repercussions, it seems Donald Trump is planning to move the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7520.961s">embassy</a>  in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7524.662s">White</a>  House officials have briefed journalists that the president will announce in a speech at 18 Hours GMT on Wednesday that the US is recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, making it the first and only country to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7537.873s">Here's</a>  his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_124]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7541.248s">Finally,</a>  I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding the President's decision on Jerusalem. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7545.77s">Tomorrow,</a>  the President will deliver remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7548.251s">Has</a>  the President made up his mind about this, or is this decision still in flux? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7553.514s">The</a>  President, I would say, is pretty solid in his thinking at this point.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7558.976s">Both</a>  the Palestinians and the Israelis claim Jerusalem as a capital of any current or future state. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7565.721s">President</a>  Trump has tried to ease concerns with a series of phone calls to Arab leaders in the Middle East, including the Palestinian leader, as we heard from Yolande Nel in Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7575.878s">In</a>  their phone call, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is said to have warned Mr. Trump that moving the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7582.002s">embassy</a>  would have an impact on the peace process with Israel and regional stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7587.486s">Mr.</a>  Abbas has since spoken to the Pope and the leaders of Russia, France and Jordan, asking them to intervene. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7594.671s">King</a>  Abdullah of Jordan was also called by Mr. Trump and is said to have spoken of possible dangerous repercussions of his plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7602.877s">Egypt's</a>  President Sisi is reported to have told him there was no need to complicate matters in the Middle East.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_83]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7620.348s">Well</a>  yes, although with the caveat that unless until he actually delivers the speech we can't predict entirely what he's going to say and specifically his thinking behind this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7633.416s">It</a>  would be highly contentious, it already is, in terms of what we have heard in moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem effectively <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7644.603s">acknowledging</a>  Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the first country to do so since the foundation of the state of Israel since 1948, and it would mark a sea change in certainly US policy towards the region.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7659.608s">And</a>  the briefings we're getting from White House officials suggest though that it will take some time to move the embassy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_83]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7669.174s">Yes,</a>  what we understand is that there will be some form of waiver written into Mr. Trump's announcement that will keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for at least six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7680.799s">Now,</a>  my understanding is that much of this is simply logistics, the moving of staff between the two cities, which is clearly going to take some time, but perhaps also it is a little bit of breathing space to see what the reaction <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7696.685s">is</a>  going to be and the policy may well change over coming months depending on how things unravel in the weeks and months to come.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7705.594s">And</a>  why, what is the attraction of doing this for President Trump?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_83]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7711.17s">Well,</a>  certainly it was part of his campaign pledge that he wanted to do this and it was one of his major foreign policy planks and perhaps domestic policy comes into this a little bit in terms of the president wanting to be seen to be making good on those big promises in his first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7731.709s">I</a>  mentioned domestic politics because it hasn't necessarily all gone his way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7735.232s">in</a>  terms of those big promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7736.753s">So</a>  I think he wants to get something done, and I think he is known as quite an impatient character in this respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7743.218s">But</a>  in terms of doing it now, I think there are quite a few people here who are rather mystified by the timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7750.563s">We</a>  know that the White House, the Trump administration, has been working on a peace plan for several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7754.966s">We</a>  don't know the detail of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7757.047s">So</a>  why to make this announcement now, perhaps ahead of a bigger plan and bigger negotiations, I think we remain to see, because it does show the US's hand, and if the US is going to play a role as a mediator in negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, it perhaps makes things rather awkward, because it's certainly not what the Palestinians wanted to hear.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7784.76s">Peter,</a>  many thanks indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7786.022s">Peter</a>  Bowes there and hopefully we'll get more details in that speech apparently from Donald Trump tomorrow at lunchtime in the US. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7795.0s">While</a>  he focuses on that big change in U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7797.762s">foreign</a>  policy, Donald Trump could be facing an investigation at home into his finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7803.587s">I</a>  say could because there's some dispute over whether the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7806.689s">special</a>  counsel Robert Mueller has issued a subpoena for Mr. Trump's financial records at Deutsche Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7813.014s">Many</a>  media outlets in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7814.495s">reported</a>  that he had, but it was denied by the president's legal team, as relayed by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_124]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7821.905s">Look,</a>  I think it's important to note, and hopefully you guys have seen this statement, that Jay Sekulow, a member of the president's legal team, has put out within the last hour that they confirmed that the news reports that the special counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are completely false. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7838.713s">No</a>  subpoena has been issued or received. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7841.054s">We've</a>  confirmed this with the bank and other sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7843.695s">I</a>  think that this is another example of the media going too far too fast, and we don't see it going in that direction.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7850.378s">So,</a>  do we know if a subpoena has indeed been issued? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7853.58s">A</a>  question for our correspondent Anthony Zerke in Washington.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_87]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7857.081s">We</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7857.521s">We</a>  had multiple news outlets reporting that the documents had been subpoenaed by the special counsel Robert Mueller, subpoenaing Deutsche Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7867.446s">But</a>  since then, the White House lawyers have pushed back fairly vociferously, saying there was no subpoena request. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7874.549s">They</a>  checked with Deutsche Bank and other sources that have <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7879.071s">said</a>  these reports are false, but the sources that these news outlets are citing are standing by their contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7885.939s">So</a>  it's basically up in the air whether this actually has happened or not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7891.524s">And</a>  why would the special counsel want those records?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_87]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7895.228s">Well,</a>  that's the interesting thing here, because so far Robert Mueller has, say, looked into the foreign lobbying of Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7904.712s">He</a>  has reached a plea agreement with Michael Flynn, who was a confidant of Donald Trump's and his first national security adviser, and George Papadopoulos, who was a foreign policy adviser on the campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7916.878s">Those</a>  are all kind of outside the main purview of the inspection of whether there's ties between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7925.103s">Well,</a>  here you have Robert Mueller directly looking at the president himself, if it's true, and his finances, looking at Deutsche Bank, because Donald Trump owes Deutsche Bank about $300 million when he came into the presidency. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7939.231s">The</a>  bank has loaned Donald Trump about $4 billion over the course of the past 20 years, so they have very close financial ties.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7949.096s">And</a>  this all raises the question of whether Robert Mueller will be allowed to continue his investigation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_87]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7957.662s">Well,</a>  when Donald Trump was interviewed about this a few months back, they asked whether it would be a red line, whether it would be going too far beyond his mandate if Robert Mueller started looking into his business dealings prior to being a presidential candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7974.137s">And</a>  Donald Trump was fairly clear that he thought that would be going too far, and perhaps this would instigate a more aggressive response from the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7983.726s">possibly</a>  even trying to get rid of Robert Mueller, which, as president, he could do if he orders people in his Justice Department to do so, although that would create quite a controversy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=7996.172s">But</a>  there may be some uneasiness on the part of Donald Trump to having someone poking around in his business dealings long before he was a serious candidate for political office.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8008.098s">Anthony</a>  Zerker in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8010.68s">Let's</a>  go across now to Los Angeles, because since wildfires started there just over a day ago, the flames have spread across some 180 square kilometres. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8021.107s">People</a>  in California have already experienced a number of bad wildfires this year, but now 27,000 residents have suddenly been forced to evacuate, with no sign of when the fires will be put out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8033.175s">James</a>  Cook is in LA.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_105]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8035.356s">This</a>  wildfire exploded overnight, trembling in size in just a few hours, driven by ferocious Santa Ana winds. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8044.662s">Devastation,</a>  with nothing to salvage. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8048.064s">Families</a>  had just minutes to scramble their belongings together and flee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_49]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8053.008s">Good</a>  friends up the street lost their homes, and I'm just so sad for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8058.071s">I'm</a>  happy for myself and those of us that kept their homes, but it's awful.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_105]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8066.24s">There</a>  is, though, little hope of the winds easing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8068.522s">They</a>  are dry, gusty and erratic, the most dangerous conditions possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8073.667s">Ventura</a>  is home to more than 100,000 people, and with more than 1,000 firefighters struggling to protect the city, a second blaze broke out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8082.775s">This</a>  fire is closer to L.A., and millions of Angelenos awoke to find the skies to the north thick with smoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8091.239s">Helicopters</a>  have struggled to fly in the wind, making it much harder to contain the fires. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8097.023s">With</a>  forecasters warning that the dangerous weather will continue for several days, the governor of California declared an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8104.287s">And</a>  with a third fire now burning, the most devastating wildfire season on record in this state just got a lot worse.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8111.952s">James</a>  Cook reporting from Los Angeles. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8114.294s">Quick</a>  bit of breaking news from France. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8117.317s">The</a>  country's best-known rock star, Johnny Hallyday, often known as the French Elvis, has died at the age of 74 after a battle with lung cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8126.466s">And</a>  we'll bring you more on that before the end of the programme. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8129.709s">This</a>  is the Newsroom from the BBC World Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8132.572s">Gareth</a>  has our headlines.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8152.689s">Yes,</a>  this was state TV in Russia announcing the news.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8178.436s">Some</a>  Russian athletes will be able to compete in 2018 as neutral competitors under the Olympic flag, but Russia's Olympic Committee says it will appeal against the ban. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8189.201s">For</a>  reaction from Moscow, we heard from Steve Rosenberg.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_101]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8192.082s">There's</a>  a sense of deep disappointment here, a sense of injustice too, and an unwillingness to accept that Russia has committed a crime here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8201.267s">The</a>  Deputy Speaker of the Russian Parliament, Igor Lebedev, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8204.228s">said</a>  this was a humiliation for our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8207.05s">I</a>  spoke to Dmitry Svishchev. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8209.612s">He's</a>  a Russian MP and the president of Russia's Curling Federation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8213.255s">He</a>  told me this was unjust, not based on any evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8216.758s">He</a>  said collective responsibility was unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8219.96s">He</a>  suggested this was a political decision and said sport should be outside of politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8224.722s">And</a>  then I went to a ski slope on the edge of Moscow, just to speak to ordinary Muscovites.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_44]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8229.204s">First</a>  of all, it's a political decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8231.325s">It's</a>  a very bad decision and I disagree with the position of the World Olympic Committee and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8239.968s">because</a>  I think that for Russian sportsmen it will be great and very important to show their results under the Russian flag.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_101]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8248.796s">In</a>  recent weeks a number of Russian politicians have suggested that if the IOC was to take that decision and allow clean Russian sportsmen to take part under the Olympic flag that they should not do so, that this would be almost treachery on the part of the sportsmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8265.93s">Everything</a>  will depend, I think, on what <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8268.572s">Vladimir</a>  Putin says, because there is one man who will decide this question, that is the Russian president, and we expect that he will announce his decision on whether Russian sportsmen should go and take part under the neutrofag. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8282.077s">This</a>  will decide what kind of participation there will be from Russia in the Olympic Games.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_79]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8322.686s">The</a>  aftermath of the latest airstrikes is like a scene from hell. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8328.089s">The</a>  sky is dark with dust and debris as rescuers rush into buildings to scoop up children. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8335.493s">Among</a>  the injured was five-year-old Yusuf with a head wound. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8339.435s">The</a>  doctors patch him up as best they can, but they're desperately short of medical supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8348.315s">A</a>  rebel stronghold, Eastern Rota, has been bombed and besieged by the Syrian government for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8356.371s">Many</a>  families are now on the brink of starvation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8362.186s">Eight-year-old</a>  Noor and his seven-year-old sister, Ghazal, sit round a wood-burning oven. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8368.469s">It's</a>  their first and only meal of the day, a thin piece of bread made from barley, which is normally fed to donkeys. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8377.813s">Their</a>  father, Abu Ahmed, was seriously injured when out gathering firewood.</p>

    <p>[BBC Broadcast]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8392.379s">I'm</a>  in a pretty bad shape, and I have three kids to look after.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_79]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8398.444s">That</a>  means his children are left carrying the burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8402.027s">Here,</a>  they're fetching drinking water. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8405.23s">It's</a>  no surprise, then, that Ghazal dreams of freeing herself from her prison, Eastern Ghouta.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8412.54s">I</a>  wish I could have cookies, sweeties, or any other delicious foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8417.546s">And</a>  I wish someone could send me a pair of slippers and some new clothes and shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8424.133s">I</a>  really miss food, like chicken, cheese, tea, and juice.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8526.604s">Ukraine's</a>  prosecutor general says Georgia's former president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has 24 hours to hand himself over to the Ukrainian authorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8535.869s">Mr.</a>  Saakashvili was invited to Ukraine by its president, Petro Poroshenko. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8540.012s">But</a>  the two men have fallen out, and Mr. Saakashvili has become a prominent opposition politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8545.495s">On</a>  Tuesday, Mr. Saakashvili's supporters helped him escape from security officers in dramatic scenes, as our correspondent in Kiev, Jonah Fisher, reports.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_91]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8556.965s">This</a>  was a remarkable day in the extraordinary career of Mikhail Saakashvili. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8561.547s">It</a>  started on the roof of his apartment block in central Kiev. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8565.329s">He</a>  spoke to his supporters below as security agents climbed up the stairs to arrest him. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8571.092s">Then,</a>  having been detained, Saakashvili's supporters first blockaded, then hours later broke open the police van he was inside, enabling the former Georgian president to escape triumphantly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_91]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8608.891s">Do</a>  you think you really have the support of the people here in your bank?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_74]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8611.793s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_91]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8612.654s">You</a>  saw it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8613.774s">Ukraine's</a>  Prosecutor General says Mr. Saakashvili should be detained for allegedly receiving funds from businessmen connected to the former President Viktor Yanukovych. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8623.527s">Mr.</a>  Saakashvili says he's being targeted for his increasingly vocal campaign against Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8632.077s">It</a>  was Mr. Poroshenko who granted Mr. Saakashvili Ukrainian citizenship in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8638.144s">But</a>  the relationship soured as Mr. Saakashvili accused his former friend of not being serious about tackling corruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8646.113s">Jonah</a>  Fisher in Ukraine.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8648.015s">There's</a>  been political chaos and protest in Honduras since the presidential election on November 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8654.441s">The</a>  opposition has now demanded a full recount of the votes, which ended up in favour of the incumbent president, Juan Orlando Hernández, after initially looking promising for the opposition candidate and former TV star Salvador Nasralla. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8667.734s">Candace</a>  Peards, our America's editor, told me the latest.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_78]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8670.765s">They</a>  haven't declared a winner yet and now what we're seeing is the opposition are now demanding a full recount of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8678.15s">Now</a>  why are they doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8680.012s">Earlier</a>  the electoral tribunal had agreed to a partial recount of around a third of all the ballot papers in the elections and now it looks like the opposition have taken this opportunity to extend their demand even further. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8694.042s">They</a>  might have been emboldened by <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8695.943s">very</a>  recent, quite surprising events. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8699.204s">On</a>  Monday, hundreds of members of the riot police refused to carry out orders to enforce a nighttime curfew ordered by the government to keep order after widespread street protests organized by the opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8713.809s">Now,</a>  the police spokesman said they didn't want to clamp down on peaceful protest. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8720.091s">It's</a>  really unusual in Latin America to see ordinary voters out on the streets, as we saw on Tuesday, holding placards thanking the riot police. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8730.316s">And</a>  then the opposition also had support from international observers, who've been urging the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to agree to a wider recount, arguing there'd be numerous inconsistencies, including ballot boxes that arrived opened or incomplete.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8746.244s">So</a>  is it possible we could get <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8748.205s">a</a>  full recount or even a rerun of the election?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_78]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8751.766s">That's</a>  certainly something that the opposition, Salvador Nasralla and the opposition coalition are calling for. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8758.989s">They're</a>  calling now for a very wide recount, 18,000 ballot boxes, and he has already been tweeting about possibly it would be better to have a full election again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8769.693s">Candace</a>  Peart said on the news that Johnny Alliday, the French rocker, has died at the age of 74. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8774.098s">He</a>  sold more than 110 million records and made 30 films. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8779.784s">Yet</a>  outside the French-speaking world, he was virtually unknown. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8783.748s">Emma-Jane</a>  Kirby looks back at Johnny Alliday's life.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8791.307s">It</a>  was a career that spanned five decades and three generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8795.969s">Born</a>  as plain Jean-Philippe Smet, Johnny Halliday first hit the limelight aged 16 as an Elvis wannabe who sang rock in French. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8806.312s">His</a>  early concerts caused riots, but then French President Charles de Gaulle accused him of being a corrupter of youth who was spreading dangerous American values throughout France. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8821.284s">Yet</a>  despite having more than 900 songs under his belt and 100 live tours, his fame never really spread beyond the French-speaking world. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8833.086s">Most</a>  rock and roll stars, Johnny's life had its ups and downs. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8837.208s">For</a>  nearly 50 years, France's gossip and celebrity magazines were full of the details of his three failed marriages, his tax evasion scandals and his cocaine addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8848.833s">But</a>  his fans remained loyal, and his concerts were always sellouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8858.297s">Johnny</a>  Halliday announced his semi-retirement in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8862.7s">France's</a>  greatest rock star said he was tired of the limelight, and he yearned to return to the days when he was just plain old Jean-Philippe Smet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_110]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8879.309s">Johnny</a>  Halliday, who has died at the age of 74, the Lycée Palace has paid tribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=8884.672s">That's</a>  it for now from the newsroom.</p>
