33
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:19,835
[SPEAKER_03]: As we're all aware, Timothy Brennan passed away some years ago with some complications to a health issue, but he was the consummate professional public servant, and he's someone that dedicated his life to the fire safety of the residents in the community of Medford.

34
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:20,976

44
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:47,505
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on tonight's agenda.

45
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:55,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim was a good friend of mine, and as Councilor Knight mentioned, the Brennan family is synonymous with

46
00:02:56,638 --> 00:03:09,048
[SPEAKER_14]: public safety in this community and have been providing the residents of this community with great public safety for many decades in this community.

47
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:17,314
[SPEAKER_14]: And with the loss of Tim at such a young age and someone that had a very promising future, it was real devastating.

48
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:25,040
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on tonight in remembrance of not only a great firefighter, but a good friend.

49
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:26,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

50
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,672
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

51
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:31,973
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

52
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,357
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it, motion passes.

53
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:39,819
[SPEAKER_06]: 17488, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

54
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:51,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Director of Public Works update the Medford City Council with regards to the stop sign that is down with a cone on top of Brookside Parkway.

55
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:52,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

56
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:54,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President.

57
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:59,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Caraviello, I did receive an email complaining about this.

58
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:02,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the stop sign was left in the middle of the street.

59
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And a resident of Medford had to move it over to the side.

60
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:08,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I did contact the Department of Public Works.

61
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:09,736
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they would take care of it.

62
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to just get an update on that.

63
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:15,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Because after they said they'd take care of it, I think there was just a cone on top of it.

64
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:20,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been noticing a lot of cones and big barrels in different places around the city.

65
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:24,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not sure if that means, I'm assuming that means we're getting to it.

66
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:32,157
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously that stop sign needs to go up where it needs to go and or it needs to be taken off the side of the road.

67
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:37,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Public safety issues obviously when you have things either in the middle of the street or the side of the road.

68
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:43,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we just could get an update with regards to when this is going to be reinstalled or removed, that would be appreciated.

69
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:46,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council Member O'Karn.

70
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:48,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for suspension of rules.

71
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for suspension by Vice President Mox.

73
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:56,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

74
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,071
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Lego Kern, seconded by Councilor Knight.

75
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:01,792
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

76
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:03,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

88
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:53,746
[SPEAKER_14]: There were three petitions that appeared before the council the week prior.

89
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:59,633
[SPEAKER_14]: all which were denied by the Community Development Board for a number of reasons.

90
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:09,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Paper 17-452 was the Evangelical Haitian Church, which is located at 400 High Street in Method.

91
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:14,267
[SPEAKER_14]: They asked that we keep the committee, the paper and committee because

92
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:17,147
[SPEAKER_14]: They weren't ready to present that night.

93
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:24,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Paper 17-450 is Global Health Care, located at 5 High Street.

00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:28,955
[SPEAKER_14]: The owner and president of Global Health was present.

95
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:34,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, his signed person was unable to be there that night and asked us to keep the paper in committee.

96
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,906
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one report that we did happen to report out, 17-451, petition of a signed reversal by Richard DiTullio,

97
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:48,701
[SPEAKER_14]: property manager for Wayside Youth and Family, 5 High Street, Medford, Mass.

98
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:57,965
[SPEAKER_14]: The application 2017-11A exceeds allowable size, secondary sign, and window signage.

99
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,326
[SPEAKER_14]: The committee reported out, Mr. President, unanimously.

100
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:12,871
[SPEAKER_14]: The first one was paper 2017-11A, the secondary sign in conformity with the primary sign with the designated colors of burgundy

101
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:18,749
[SPEAKER_14]: and flat, in addition that the sign be placed in window bay five.

102
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:33,754
[SPEAKER_14]: The second denial, which was 201711B, we asked that the window sign be a flat color and that the window sign be located in window bay number three only.

103
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:41,996
[SPEAKER_14]: And the petitioner was present at that meeting, Mr. President, and agreed with what the recommendations were by this council.

104
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:49,783
[SPEAKER_14]: and stated that he was also, which was approved, his primary sign, which was approved.

105
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:53,225
[SPEAKER_14]: He was looking for a secondary sign.

106
00:07:54,326 --> 00:08:00,430
[SPEAKER_14]: He stated that he was going to have his primary sign match the color of the secondary sign.

107
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:10,977
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would have his signs both be burgundy along with the awnings that are on that side of High Street, which are burgundy.

108
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:13,388
[SPEAKER_14]: to match and have a flow, Mr. President.

109
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:19,809
[SPEAKER_14]: And the petitioner stated that he would do so with this primary sign that was already approved by the council.

110
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:29,472
[SPEAKER_14]: So based on our meeting and based on the input from Councilor Del Russo, yourself, Mr. President, Councilor Scarpelli, I would move approval tonight on paper 17-451.

111
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:29,512

[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

148
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:17,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.

149
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,390
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all set.

150
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:19,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

151
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to revert back to regular business.

152
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:25,557
[SPEAKER_08]: While we're under suspension.

153
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:26,598
[SPEAKER_06]: While we're under suspension.

154
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:30,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo has withdrawn his motion.

155
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,762
[SPEAKER_06]: While we're under suspension, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

156
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,403
[SPEAKER_08]: To take paper 17485 regarding Evans Street.

157
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:34,403
17.

158
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:35,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Second by Councilor Knight.

159
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:36,664
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favour?

160
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:56,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes, 17485, petition by Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street, to address the City Council on Evans Street Water and Pipe Repair and Reservicing.

161
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:57,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

162
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:00,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let the petitioner speak.

163
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:01,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record.

164
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:03,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

165
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:05,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

166
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:12,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the Chair, thank you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn for taking this out of order under suspension of the rules.

167
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:26,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to seem selfish about Evans Street coming up here again, because I know there's a lot of streets and sub water and gas systems across Medford that need to be looked at.

168
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:33,622
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm a little disheartened before this body tonight to come and speak on this matter yet again.

169
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:41,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the administration's office, through the DPW, a letter came out saying that

170
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:57,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Contracts would go out in May for the work that needs to be done on Evan Street that members of this body have said in the past is in the top five of worst condition streets in the city of Medford.

171
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:09,880
[SPEAKER_11]: When that letter came out, it prompted some city councilors, when they saw it, in good faith, to tell neighbors of mine and myself that work is gonna be done this spring

172
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:11,629
[SPEAKER_11]: specifically this May.

173
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:31,877
[SPEAKER_11]: So a week and a half ago, one of my neighbors, Mr. Rob McGuire, knowing how often I come to the council meetings and discussions I have with the honorable members of this body, asked me point blank on Facebook, hey, well my nickname's Booch, hey Booch, when are they gonna do the repairs on Evans Street?

174
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:36,699
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, I'm not sure, I only know what we were told, what you were told.

175
00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:42,746
[SPEAKER_11]: And then another neighbor of mine in the discussion on Facebook posted the picture of the letter that came out.

176
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:48,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was said that last week somebody was going to bring it up for discussion on this body.

177
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:52,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And for whatever reason, probably a good reason, it didn't come up for discussion.

178
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:54,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was going to speak last week on it.

179
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:59,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So the next day, last Wednesday after work, I came right to City Hall.

180
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:02,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went into the engineer's office, Cassandra.

181
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,356
[SPEAKER_11]: And I asked point blank.

182
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Neighbors are asking me.

183
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,257
[SPEAKER_11]: We were told.

184
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:09,309
[SPEAKER_11]: that work was going to be done this spring, this May.

185
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:14,950
[SPEAKER_11]: She told me, and this is no offense, but these are the slow wheels of government.

186
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:24,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford has been waiting over six decades, not Medford, but Evans Street, for repairs that really need to be done.

187
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:29,455
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a water pipe that burst just before Christmas, this past Christmas, on Evans Street.

188
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:40,234
[SPEAKER_11]: But what the engineer told me, who also I know is constrained by a lot of projects that are going on, but what she said was, I'm finalizing the contract now.

189
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it goes to the purchaser's office.

190
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Once it gets approved there, then it goes out for bids.

191
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:49,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Then once the bids come in, the mayor has to choose the best one.

192
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,962
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, well, my neighbors are asking me, when is this work going to be done?

193
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:55,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly July.

194
00:14:56,117 --> 00:15:01,558
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Mr. President, but with all due respect, I really don't see it happening this year.

195
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:13,760
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you have to account for there's 26 houses, four on the corner, that's 30 houses, paying at least $1,200 in property taxes, paying God knows what in water taxes.

196
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Even the people that rent there, their rent's going up because of property taxes, the surcharges on property taxes.

197
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:21,621
[SPEAKER_11]: We're paying a lot.

198
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:24,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I did a ballpark figure.

199
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,850
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking over six decades.

200
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,771
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking millions of dollars in taxes from this one street.

201
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:41,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here tonight to tell you that I spoke to my fellow residents, and I'm not even here to ask for the work to be done anymore, Mr. President.

202
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:51,222
[SPEAKER_11]: A year and a half ago, this administration ran on a promise on her platform that she was going to dust off the master plan.

203
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:56,467
[SPEAKER_11]: A year and a half later, Mr. President, there's another inch of dust on the master plan.

204
00:15:56,828 --> 00:16:00,511
[SPEAKER_11]: The citizens on Evans Street are disappointed, Mr. President.

205
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

206
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:03,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

207
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:04,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

208
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:06,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

209
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:08,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I just want to speak in support of this.

210
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:16,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a number of us councilors have brought up Evans Street and I believe it was last spring and even before that, that we started complaining about it.

211
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And last spring when a number of residents

212
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:23,854
[SPEAKER_08]: came before us begging, I mean, basically begging for some relief on the street.

213
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:35,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Children who I see in the audience today can't even ride their bikes without, I mean, when I drove down it after I got the complaints, it's like torn up with rocks and it's unsafe.

214
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were told it was going to be done by now.

215
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:43,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I did reach out to the city engineer on the 8th of May just to ask for an update.

216
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:47,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I was told that Evans is in queue for later this year.

217
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,577
[SPEAKER_08]: as we need to replace the water main first.

218
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:53,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the information I got on the 8th.

219
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping sooner than later this year.

220
00:16:55,858 --> 00:17:02,860
[SPEAKER_08]: What seems is you're getting information that it's going to be done sooner than the end of the year, which would be great if it could be done by July.

221
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:12,442
[SPEAKER_08]: But how many times, you know, can we be told, just keep being pushed off and pushed off when it's, top five, I think it's one of the worst streets.

222
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:18,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might be top one or two in Medford from me just driving around and witnessing what's going on.

223
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just think we need some definite answers.

224
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,167
[SPEAKER_08]: And that needs to come from the mayor's office, who's going to be footing the bill.

225
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,088
[SPEAKER_08]: The engineer is probably doing what she needs to do.

226
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:29,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's being responsive.

227
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, July is better kind of than the answer I got.

228
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,271
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, when is it going to be done?

229
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,212
[SPEAKER_08]: When is the bid going to be accepted?

230
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:39,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And are we going to pay for it?

231
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:45,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's something we all need to demand come a few weeks from now when we are asked for a vote on the budget.

232
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:51,142
[SPEAKER_08]: We all need to think about a number of different things, including Evans Street, before we can vote on a budget.

233
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:58,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the potholes and paint striping of our streets and the sunken manholes that aren't taken care of needs to be priority number one.

234
00:17:58,829 --> 00:17:59,910
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a safety concern.

235
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:12,381
[SPEAKER_11]: If you drive around the corner on Pinkett Street, the potholes there, you have to navigate around them to not put damage on your car.

236
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:14,102
[SPEAKER_11]: The potholes on Evans Street,

237
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:19,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there were baseball size rocks coming out of the, out of the gravel, out of the street.

238
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been by there.

239
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:28,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Next Tuesday night at six o'clock, we will be having a council of the whole meeting with the city engineer on a lot of these issues.

240
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:33,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And I urge you to come to that meeting at six o'clock.

241
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,222
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of disappointed people on Evans street.

242
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:36,963
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is my name.

243
00:18:37,043 --> 00:18:38,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

244
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:39,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

245
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:41,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

246
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Shawna Smith, 91 Evans Street.

247
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was here last year.

248
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:48,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was around this same time.

249
00:18:49,013 --> 00:19:04,018
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was told the exact same thing about the budget and approving the budget and not approving a certain amount of money for her until she said that.

250
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:05,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're here a year later.

251
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,660
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's still exactly the same.

252
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,780
[SPEAKER_09]: And I keep hearing.

253
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:37,318
[SPEAKER_09]: later on this year, later on this year, next spring, next spring, and here we are, and it's summertime, and we're hearing later on this year, and then we're hearing July, and it's been, I've lived on that street for 41 years, and that street hasn't been repaved, and I, she said it, I have an eight year old daughter, she can't ride her bike, I have to put a bike rack on the back of my car and drive her to the bike path for her to ride her bike,

254
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,492
[SPEAKER_09]: In that neighborhood, because the rocks are on the sidewalk, the rocks are on the street.

255
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:45,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinkett Street is probably worse than Evans.

256
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:47,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry for saying that, because I live on Evans.

257
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:48,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But Pinkett Street is pretty bad, too.

258
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:50,119
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't ride your bike in that neighborhood.

259
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:52,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know what has to happen.

260
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:56,224
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you get the street fixed?

261
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:58,386
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you get the street fixed?

262
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,348
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody, I think.

263
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:18,841
[SPEAKER_09]: except for him, said that it's really bad, it's a really bad street, so everybody knows that it's really bad, aside from whoever's on C-Click Fix checking it off as repaired, because it's the furthest thing from repaired, but everybody knows that it's really bad, and I... And you were promised that it was gonna be fixed.

264
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:20,783
[SPEAKER_09]: For a long time.

265
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:22,157
[SPEAKER_06]: for a long time.

266
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:25,598
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know what else to do.

267
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:31,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anybody, I asked my neighbors, I asked my really sweet neighbors if they wanted to come and they don't want to come.

268
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,140
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want to come.

269
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,441
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want to deal with it anymore.

270
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:35,341
[SPEAKER_09]: They, they, they, they gave up.

271
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:38,002
[SPEAKER_09]: They, they gave up and that's sad.

272
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:39,083
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

273
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:40,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

274
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,484
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

275
00:20:44,364 --> 00:20:44,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

276
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:45,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

277
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:46,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

278
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:48,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

279
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:51,226
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to thank Mr. Cappucci and Ms.

280
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:52,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Smith for being here this evening.

281
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:54,768
[SPEAKER_03]: On St.

282
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:59,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick's Day, 3-17-17, we received a response to paper 17209 from the administration.

283
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:07,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And this paper clearly said that the contract will be in place in mid-May, and construction will proceed with the schedule thereafter.

284
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:12,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we put this paper initially on the agenda in October.

285
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at a loss to figure out how long it takes to get the contract in place.

286
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But this all should have been done well before the construction season started, Mr. President.

287
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:26,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And not a week goes by now that I don't scratch my head and wonder what's going on inside that engineering office.

288
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:32,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I really have significant concerns about the way that that office is being managed and what's going on in the community.

289
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:43,982
[SPEAKER_03]: For us to have to wait 18 months for a response to a paper, for residents to have to wait six, seven, eight, nine months for a contract just to go out so that the work can be done that they said they've been scheduling for three years.

290
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,440
[SPEAKER_03]: is ridiculous.

291
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not one to go out on these rants, Mr. President, about the administration doing — not doing this and not doing that.

292
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not my style.

293
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:52,263
[SPEAKER_03]: But enough is enough.

294
00:21:53,063 --> 00:22:05,687
[SPEAKER_03]: This office has got to keep its eyes on the prize, because the engineering office is far too vital to the delivery of the requisite services that we're here to provide, to be asleep at the switch.

295
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:07,988
[SPEAKER_03]: The President.

296
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:08,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

297
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:12,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

298
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:12,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

299
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

300
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:21,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to go on the record, too, that Parris Street was also listed as a street that was supposed to be addressed this year.

301
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:26,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't get into a debate about what street is worse.

302
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:36,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I think on our side of Medford, we have a lot of very what I call depressed streets that haven't really been attended to, the street nor the sidewalks.

303
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,993
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hole that has been in front of my house for 46 years.

304
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:46,973
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't been able to, I mean, it's kind of laughable, but it isn't.

305
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:49,594
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps getting larger and larger and larger.

306
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:54,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Our elderly community on our street won't walk, cannot walk down the sidewalks.

307
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,375
[SPEAKER_01]: It's abhorrent.

308
00:22:56,695 --> 00:23:06,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And often when we attend these dialogues and discussions about development, we hear these developers tell us that our neighborhoods are depressed and blighted.

309
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,022
[SPEAKER_01]: It really boils down to our streets not being able to be taken care of.

310
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:13,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we've got a committee of the whole meeting.

311
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:21,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd ask that you consider Parris Street and maybe a few more of those surrounding streets in our neighborhood.

312
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:25,571
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite a while since they've been attended to.

313
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:34,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would go a long way for a number of elderly people we have, as well as mobily challenged folks in our neighborhood.

314
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:48,798
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our area of Medford, I think the last time I checked, we have like 45% of the people who live in North and East Medford that are senior and disabled and lower income.

315
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:53,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's harder for them to get around because not all of them do have cars and they like to walk.

316
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I know you've got a meeting coming up Tuesday.

317
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to attend as well.

318
00:23:58,742 --> 00:24:00,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking forward to that dialogue.

319
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:04,184
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you could consider our area as well, that would be great.

320
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:05,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

321
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:06,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

322
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

323
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:15,432
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it's a shame when you have to have residents come up over and over again on the same issue.

324
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:24,434
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's even more of a shame, Mr. President, when department heads tell residents that something's going to be done and then there's no follow-up.

325
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:29,145
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, sometimes the schedule doesn't work according to how it was planned.

326
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:40,630
[SPEAKER_14]: And all you need to do is reach back out to residents and say, you know what, I might have told you it was May, but now because of the RFP or whatever went through, it took us a little longer, now we're looking at July or August.

327
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,793
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think residents would feel happy that the communication was there, Mr. President.

328
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:52,856
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what happens is, the fact that there is a lack of communication, the fact, Mr. President, that this council

329
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:58,664
[SPEAKER_14]: has been asking for a master plan from this mayor for the past year and a half.

330
00:24:59,384 --> 00:25:04,750
[SPEAKER_14]: A master plan, Mr. President, not because we want a master plan for the sake of a master plan.

331
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,852
[SPEAKER_14]: It's to address issues like this.

332
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:13,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Within a master plan, you would have someone that would go out and do a street audit and say, what are the top

333
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Dozen streets, two dozen streets, three dozen streets that need to be repaired.

334
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:21,449
[SPEAKER_14]: When is the last time they were repaired or resurfaced?

335
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:22,450
[SPEAKER_14]: You heard from Ms.

336
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,196
[SPEAKER_14]: White that mentioned she's been on the street for 41 years, four decades.

337
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:29,699
[SPEAKER_14]: That street has never been repaved.

338
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,903
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm referring to Evans Street, Mr. President.

339
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:44,810
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really think, Mr. President, the fact that we don't have any type of master plan, the fact is that we don't have a full assessment of our streets, we're always chasing our tail.

340
00:25:45,832 --> 00:25:47,053
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't even keep track.

341
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:48,755
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about repaving roads.

342
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:50,577
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't even fill potholes.

343
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Forget about repaving roads.

344
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:57,090
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't even do the basic fundamentals of filling potholes.

345
00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:05,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Our staff is so undersized in the DPW that we can't even stay on top of a basic, basic city service.

346
00:26:07,397 --> 00:26:20,807
[SPEAKER_14]: And then people are coming up asking about their roads, and they have every right, Mr. President, as Mr. Capucci mentioned, paying tens of thousands of dollars in property tax, and you have to look out and see your street look like Beirut, Mr. President.

347
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:27,680
[SPEAKER_14]: You got small potholes that could be swimming pools.

348
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,842
[SPEAKER_14]: It's unacceptable, rocks that could get kicked up when a car drives over them.

349
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:35,823
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a public safety concern.

350
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:40,585
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not, if it was one or two streets, I'd say, you know what, we're in pretty good condition.

351
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:43,826
[SPEAKER_14]: We're seven square miles, we're a big city, we're in good condition.

352
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,527
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not one or two streets.

353
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:49,348
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost every street in the city, Mr. President.

354
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have no game plan.

355
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,713
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I attend events, Mr. President, and you see the mayor walking around with all her assistants.

356
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:10,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Rather than have a pen and paper in their hand, taking down notes when people say, I need my street done, they have a camera, because all they want to do is capture the mayor with a picture.

357
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:13,704
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not looking for anything else, Mr. President.

358
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,725
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't want to hear your gripes and your concerns.

359
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:19,028
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to capture the mayor at events by taking her picture.

360
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:20,869
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we have now.

361
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:24,632
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a photo op mayor that walks around and only looking for a picture.

362
00:27:25,748 --> 00:27:27,748
[SPEAKER_14]: when the real nitty gritty needs to take place.

363
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:34,750
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can't provide basic city services in this city, we might as well lock the door at City Hall.

364
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,810
[SPEAKER_14]: We might as well lock it, Mr. President.

365
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:43,331
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm equally as disappointed with this administration, and you know what?

366
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:47,472
[SPEAKER_14]: When a department's not doing their job, I'll call them out, and I've been doing it for years.

367
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:51,353
[SPEAKER_14]: But as I stated before, a fish rots from the head down.

368
00:27:52,667 --> 00:28:06,054
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you want to look at who's not doing their job, Mr. President, and who ultimately is responsible, the chief executive officer of this community that runs the day-to-day operations, it's the mayor of this community, Mr. President.

369
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:14,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to point fingers at departments that are a shell of departments that barely have enough staff to do a day's worth of work.

370
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:16,959
[SPEAKER_14]: It comes from the top, Mr. President.

371
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,001
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and I'd ask our council liaison

372
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:25,185
[SPEAKER_14]: that the mayor appointed, but she happens not to be here tonight.

373
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, she hasn't attended since she was appointed a year and a half now.

374
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:39,317
[SPEAKER_14]: The council liaison, someone that would be here to sit in the audience, go back to the mayor and say, Madam Mayor, this was brought up tonight.

375
00:28:39,597 --> 00:28:41,179
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the concerns at the council.

376
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:43,340
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the concerns I heard from residents.

377
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:51,278
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why that position was made, Mr. President, to address issues like this and bring them to the mayor's attention.

378
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:56,660
[SPEAKER_14]: I realize the mayor can't be everywhere, and that's why she has assistance, Mr. President, to help.

379
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:01,203
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what's rotten within this community, Mr. President.

380
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:07,886
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm tired of talking about we can't go on to new issues when we talk about the same old issues over and over again.

381
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,001
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel the residents' frustration.

382
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:21,065
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I agree with Parris Street and all the host of other streets, Mr. President, because I receive the phone calls and the emails, as we all do, when people say, what about my road?

383
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:22,165
[SPEAKER_14]: What about my street?

384
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:24,406
[SPEAKER_14]: And what do you tell them?

385
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,107
[SPEAKER_14]: You tell them to call the mayor's office and they laugh.

386
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:29,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Say, I don't even get a call back.

387
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:36,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we have to be more, Mr. President, than just a sounding board, this council.

388
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:38,852
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to be able to hold the mayor's feet to the fire.

389
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:47,751
[SPEAKER_14]: And if people behind this reeling are going to give the mayor unconditional support all the time, that's why we're not getting anywhere.

390
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:51,512
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we're not holding the mayor's feet to the fire, Mr. President.

391
00:29:53,052 --> 00:30:03,856
[SPEAKER_14]: We have plenty of enablers behind this reel that allow this mayor to go off and do what she wants to do, and then want to talk a big game after the fact.

392
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's hold the mayor's feet to the fire.

393
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:10,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's hold her accountable to the job she was elected to do, Mr. President.

394
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:11,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

395
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

396
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:14,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

397
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:16,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

398
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:21,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd also like to thank Mr. Capucci for bringing this issue forward tonight.

399
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:27,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been down in that neighborhood a number of times over the past year, and the street is in deplorable condition.

400
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been like that for a long time.

401
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,582
[SPEAKER_10]: And promises were made that this was going to be fixed.

402
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:37,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's extremely disappointing that it seems like it's

403
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:40,848
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it really might not even be on the radar.

404
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:43,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it should be, but it seems like nothing's getting done.

405
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's long overdue.

406
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:48,093
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to get done.

407
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,215
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, too, question why is it delayed?

408
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:52,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is it being delayed?

409
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:52,997
[SPEAKER_10]: What has happened?

410
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,438
[SPEAKER_10]: And when is the work going to be done?

411
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:57,720
[SPEAKER_10]: And what exactly is going to be done?

412
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:07,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could get an official correspondence back from the engineer's office, I'd like to see something officially from her basically telling us why it has been delayed.

413
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:11,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this will be something we'll discuss next Tuesday at the council meeting also.

414
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:16,321
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure we will, but I want to see something in writing, something officially as to why it was delayed.

415
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:26,031
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to find out when it's, when they plan on actually getting this kicked off and going in a process it has to go through because everyone should be on the same page.

416
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:30,916
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, it was mentioned earlier communication and a lot of this comes down to communication.

417
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:43,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they actually sent the memo to us saying, you know what, this was promised last year, but it's going to be delayed, at least when the calls come in, we can say, you know what, we received the communication back from the engineer's office.

418
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:49,933
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be delayed because of reasons A, B, and C. But we haven't received anything back.

419
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:52,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And the neighbors haven't received any news.

420
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:55,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And therefore, we're all kind of standing around looking at each other.

421
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,240
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of it comes down to communication.

422
00:32:00,621 --> 00:32:04,042
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as this issue goes, there really hasn't been any communication.

423
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:10,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can get an official correspondence from the engineer's department with those details, I'd greatly appreciate it.

424
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:11,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, if you could make that note, please.

425
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:12,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

426
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:14,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

427
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:16,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Rec Cycle 21 Ridgeway Road, Medford.

428
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't going to speak tonight.

429
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:22,646
[SPEAKER_13]: I just came down to witness the council meeting.

430
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:28,628
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm going to go back a few years, just a few.

431
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:33,284
[SPEAKER_13]: At one time, we had a paper, it was called the Method Mercury.

432
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:44,871
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I remember correctly, every year the city would go out, like Councilor Marks would say, they'd go out and they'd gauge these streets.

433
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:48,153
[SPEAKER_13]: In other words, they prioritize what streets are going to be done.

434
00:32:49,554 --> 00:32:52,015
[SPEAKER_13]: For instance, not this year, not this fiscal year.

435
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:59,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Fiscal year 2018, they knew five streets, five critical streets.

436
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:06,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Those streets were published in the newspaper, and they were prioritized.

437
00:33:07,124 --> 00:33:19,654
[SPEAKER_13]: So the citizens on those streets, a year before the street was even going to be reconstructed, those citizens knew that they were going to be in for a new street, new sidewalks, whatever the construction is.

438
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:25,779
[SPEAKER_13]: That gave the administration plenty of time if they had to put a water line in, or they had to put a gas line in, or whatever they had to do.

439
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:30,363
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems today that the planning, it's like

440
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:32,952
[SPEAKER_13]: The cart is going before the horse.

441
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:35,433
[SPEAKER_13]: They plan the street.

442
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,513
[SPEAKER_13]: They get the street planned.

443
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:37,353
[SPEAKER_13]: They go out and do it.

444
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:39,754
[SPEAKER_13]: And then about six months later, oh, we've got to put a water line in.

445
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:44,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Very frustrating, poor planning.

446
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:55,036
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to bring up that this is the way the citizens of Medford knew where they stood with their streets, the condition of their streets.

447
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:57,337
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a very simple thing to do.

448
00:33:57,357 --> 00:33:59,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm not sure.

449
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:03,390
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could ask the council now, do you know what the top five streets are in Medford that have to be paved?

450
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:06,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anybody know the top five?

451
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:09,974
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, you're close, okay?

452
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:11,715
[SPEAKER_13]: You're the city council.

453
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,256
[SPEAKER_13]: I live on Ridgeway Road.

454
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:17,158
[SPEAKER_13]: My street's in great shape, okay?

455
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:21,620
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go up the top of Fell's Eve, you know Fell's Eve.

456
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:23,901
[SPEAKER_13]: You know Fell's Eve.

457
00:34:24,922 --> 00:34:25,902
[SPEAKER_13]: They tore that street up.

458
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:28,844
[SPEAKER_13]: It's washing away.

459
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:33,829
[SPEAKER_13]: You come down Fells Ave to Murray Hill, one hole on the left side, it's gone.

460
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:35,249
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all being washed away.

461
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,690
[SPEAKER_13]: The contractor did a horrible job.

462
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, where's the penalty there on these reconstructions on these streets?

463
00:34:43,073 --> 00:34:43,853
[SPEAKER_13]: That's another issue.

464
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,773
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to get into that.

465
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:48,315
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's something that the council maybe should look at.

466
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:56,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they should go back to the DPW, go back to the mayor's office and say, listen, when we do the budget, we want to know what streets are going to be done.

467
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,960
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to know not only what streets are going to be done,

468
00:35:00,384 --> 00:35:03,285
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to know, number one, Evans is going to be number one.

469
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:05,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two is going to be Mystic Ave.

470
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:07,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Number three, whatever, OK?

471
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:13,909
[SPEAKER_13]: That way you know, going into that budget meeting, five streets, $2 million, OK?

472
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:19,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And it gives everybody right up front what has to be done.

473
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:25,612
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no going back saying, well, we're going to have to put in gas, we have to put in a water line, or whatever we have to do on that street.

474
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:30,094
[SPEAKER_13]: That also eliminates a lot of going back in and tearing up our streets.

475
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:35,256
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called planning, master planning, OK?

476
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:39,177
[SPEAKER_13]: It might not include a building of a police station, but it's critical.

477
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,478
[SPEAKER_13]: It's our infrastructure.

478
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:43,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, simple things.

479
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,641
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just talking to the councilor tonight.

480
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:46,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Go down Salem Street.

481
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:51,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Felsway to Medford to Salem, all the way down.

482
00:35:52,264 --> 00:35:55,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Not one crosswalk is striped, not one.

483
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:56,926
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't even see them.

484
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:01,308
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our main street, highly visible,

485
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:05,139
[SPEAKER_13]: highly pedestrian areas, OK?

486
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Simple little things, all right?

487
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,681
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, I just want to throw that out.

488
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you are aware of it.

489
00:36:12,941 --> 00:36:15,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of your councilors might have been aware of it.

490
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:21,044
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are things that you can do to make the citizens aware where they stand, OK?

491
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:29,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And it gives the citizens plenty of time to make any adjustments and contact the councilors, contact the mayor's office, the DPW.

492
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,901
[SPEAKER_13]: There might be a tree that has to be taken down or something.

493
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:34,742
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called planning.

494
00:36:35,302 --> 00:36:36,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all I have to say.

495
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:37,903
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the time.

496
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:39,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Sackler.

497
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:42,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

498
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:43,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

499
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:43,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, Gene.

500
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:45,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm news at 35 Harris Street.

501
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:52,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to add one thought after hearing the gentleman before me speak so eloquently about planning.

502
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:55,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, still can't hear me.

503
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:56,149
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

504
00:36:56,229 --> 00:36:56,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to talk up.

505
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:57,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this better?

506
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:06,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Recognizing that budget is always a concern in this day and age, and recognizing that some streets need to be put off.

507
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:16,834
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could even be successful in our pothole repair, so currently what they'll do if you're fortunate enough to have a pothole filled, they'll do that.

508
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:19,075
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll fill it, and they'll tamp it down.

509
00:37:19,535 --> 00:37:21,977
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not actually the right way to repair a pothole.

510
00:37:22,357 --> 00:37:26,840
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to actually cut so many inches, a surgeon would call it the clear margin,

511
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:31,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut so many inches and then you re-tamp and you fill with a square.

512
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:36,945
[SPEAKER_01]: If we made those types of repairs, the roads would look less like patchwork.

513
00:37:37,661 --> 00:37:43,584
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'd feel potholes less, because when they're patched, they'd be patched more appropriately.

514
00:37:44,184 --> 00:38:01,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the secondary, and possibly more important thing we could do, and occasionally I hear it, when different developers step before you, when they fall under your purview, but what we should do overall, is we should never let anybody who's opening our street

515
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,060
[SPEAKER_01]: open up a one-foot trench.

516
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:26,507
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to open up a minimum width for a minimum duration so that they have the appropriate space to reset and tamp down, put in the subsoil, put in the proper layers of the different products that are required depending upon where they're working at the right grade so that you don't wind up with the puddle and all of that stuff.

517
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:27,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can forward

518
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:28,948
[SPEAKER_01]: to all of you.

519
00:38:29,028 --> 00:38:34,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may be aware, but I'm happy to share with you some general links to help you get a little bit more up to speed.

520
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:42,933
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think regardless of where we go with our repair of streets, we can do no harm, right?

521
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:51,456
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we open up our streets and we're working in our streets, if we require folks that are doing this work, and they know how to make those repairs because in other cities

522
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,022
[SPEAKER_01]: they wouldn't dare open up the street for a foot and a half for, you know, four or five feet.

523
00:38:57,082 --> 00:39:04,866
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd open it up properly and they'd, you know, reset to existing or better condition the same way.

524
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:12,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also wouldn't use hot top patches on the sidewalk where there's concrete, where we've had some upgrades done.

525
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:13,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that

526
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might have been NSTAR that did the gas upgrades.

527
00:39:18,493 --> 00:39:26,739
[SPEAKER_01]: They would cut out the street, the sidewalk, dig that hole out, and they wouldn't properly set the patch and put concrete back in.

528
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,521
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd just tamp in hot top like someone was going to come later.

529
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:34,364
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got some of those on Paris Street that go down the street.

530
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:35,165
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably

531
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:41,089
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 or 40 of them at least, maybe even one for every single address where they tie into the different homes.

532
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:48,115
[SPEAKER_01]: But those few measures don't really reside back with us, our budget, taxpayer money.

533
00:39:48,528 --> 00:39:50,689
[SPEAKER_01]: It resides to the projects that are being done.

534
00:39:51,189 --> 00:40:07,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a city, if we require those things, then our streets are going to look better because we're requiring that people working in them maintain and return them to us in a condition that we're not going to have to be doing repair work in two or three years.

535
00:40:07,515 --> 00:40:08,735
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to raise that.

536
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:11,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone's interested, I'm happy to share some of those links.

537
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:11,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

538
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:11,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

539
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:13,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

540
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

541
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:16,918
[SPEAKER_08]: President Caraviello, if we could just amend the paper and ask

542
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:29,473
[SPEAKER_08]: point blank to the mayor's office, will this be in this money for Evans Street and possibly Paris and Pinker, two other streets that we were promised, will this be in our next year's budget?

543
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:43,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really just the ultimate answer that we need because I truly feel if the mayor's office wanted it done, they would have told the engineer's office to go out to bid months and months ago like we were promised.

544
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's really unfortunate we have to

545
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:56,762
[SPEAKER_08]: ask questions at this stage of the game when, in two weeks, we're going to be asked for a vote on a budget, and we haven't even seen any part of the budget whatsoever.

546
00:40:57,442 --> 00:40:58,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's a little late for that.

547
00:40:58,942 --> 00:41:04,923
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at the last meeting in May, and we haven't even, like you said last week, they won't even answer you.

548
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:07,564
[SPEAKER_06]: You will have your budget book on Tuesday.

549
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:09,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Next Tuesday.

550
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:11,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to meet on the week after, the 12th, 13th.

551
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:12,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Tuesday, come here.

552
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:14,445
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

553
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:16,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, I agree with Council Member Marks.

554
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:19,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget about a master plan.

555
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,771
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't even have the budget book.

556
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:23,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think you see some frustration tonight.

557
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:27,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And you definitely see it from the Evans Street residents, Paris Street.

558
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:29,655
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're seeing it all over.

559
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:34,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a gentleman today threaten on Dune and threatened he's going to call the Globe.

560
00:41:35,698 --> 00:41:37,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he called the news channels.

561
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:40,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Because simple potholes are just everywhere.

562
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:45,083
[SPEAKER_08]: On my way to work, to eat dinner at home, and then come here, I think I saw

563
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:56,100
[SPEAKER_08]: eight cones and one big barrel just plopped on, and my heights friends will know, plopped on manholes and sewer grates that are just sunken in so deep.

564
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget about it if a child veered off.

565
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:00,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, somebody's going to get really, really hurt.

566
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:06,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully, most of the grates and sewers that I'm seeing are on the side of the road, but it's terrible.

567
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:11,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And these cones have been there for so long, they're not even standing up straight to let people know.

568
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:12,794
[SPEAKER_08]: They're falling over.

569
00:42:14,543 --> 00:42:23,406
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, for one, I did not vote for the budget last year, and I think I gave like a 20 or 30 minute speech why, and Evans Street, I believe, was one of the reasons, one of the many reasons.

570
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:24,727
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's what we need.

571
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:37,811
[SPEAKER_08]: We need, you need four votes for the budget, and I think we need to send a loud and clear message to the mayor's office that, number one, the simple things need to be in this budget, whether we have to use outside contracting or not.

572
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:42,873
[SPEAKER_08]: We need our sidewalks, we need potholes filled, we need

573
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:46,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Some work on our manholes that are sunken in.

574
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:51,946
[SPEAKER_08]: We need our streets repainted with regards to crosswalks for simple safety.

575
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:58,328
[SPEAKER_08]: We had children, a child almost get hit up near the Brooks School, I believe, months ago.

576
00:42:58,468 --> 00:43:02,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, that's just repaint our crosswalks.

577
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:07,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind fulfilling promises that were made last year with regards to Evans Street.

578
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:12,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we just really need to come together and figure out what the goals are of this city.

579
00:43:12,712 --> 00:43:14,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And the simple things need to be done.

580
00:43:14,353 --> 00:43:22,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really, it's very frustrating driving around this community the last month or two and getting the phone calls and the emails.

581
00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:25,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And people just stopping me while I'm walking in my neighborhood.

582
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,321
[SPEAKER_08]: What is going on with this pothole or that pothole?

583
00:43:28,341 --> 00:43:30,082
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, cars are bumping over them.

584
00:43:31,182 --> 00:43:33,083
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something we need to get a handle on.

585
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:37,366
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we need some outside contracting to help us do that.

586
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:41,468
[SPEAKER_08]: But that comes at budget time when we need to be able to hire somebody to do it.

587
00:43:43,337 --> 00:43:44,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Council.

588
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:49,903
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

589
00:43:50,784 --> 00:43:51,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote.

590
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote has been requested.

591
00:43:58,232 --> 00:44:04,498
[SPEAKER_06]: As amended by Councilor Knight that we get the information by next week for the subcommittee meeting.

592
00:44:23,736 --> 00:44:24,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Dela Rousseau?

593
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:24,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

594
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:27,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco?

595
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:27,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

596
00:44:28,257 --> 00:44:28,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

597
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:29,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

598
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:30,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lockhart?

599
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:30,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

600
00:44:31,238 --> 00:44:31,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Marks?

601
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:32,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

602
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:33,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

603
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:33,958
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

604
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:35,358
[SPEAKER_15]: President Caraviello?

605
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:35,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

606
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

607
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Marks to revert back to regular business, seconded by Councilor Knight.

608
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:47,681
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

609
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:47,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

610
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:49,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

611
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:49,561
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-489.

612
00:44:53,445 --> 00:45:17,476
[SPEAKER_06]: offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the city ordinance be drafted that requires any store furnishing shopping carts to patrons to transport items purchased from this store be required to develop and implement the plan to prevent the removal of shopping carts from this property and create a specific plan to retrieve the shopping carts that are found on public property.

613
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:18,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

614
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:20,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

615
00:45:21,377 --> 00:45:29,825
[SPEAKER_14]: I offer this resolution tonight to address an issue that exists in many areas in our community that are but business districts.

616
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:35,510
[SPEAKER_14]: In particular, stores that have shopping carts that are allowed to leave the premise.

617
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:38,012
[SPEAKER_14]: And you only need to drive up

618
00:45:38,910 --> 00:46:07,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Salem Street or Riverside Ave, and you'll see these cots throughout neighborhoods, just abandoned on a sidewalk in front of someone's home, and I offer this tonight, Mr. President, to allow the city to, first of all, get a handle on what ordinance would make sense in our community, and also, secondly, for enforcement, and to provide an arm of enforcement within our community when it comes to this.

619
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:12,423
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm offering this tonight, Mr. President, and hope it goes to one of the subcommittees.

620
00:46:12,463 --> 00:46:18,010
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not opposed to it going to the public works subcommittee or any other subcommittee, Mr. President.

621
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:20,867
[SPEAKER_14]: It definitely is an issue that needs to be looked at.

622
00:46:21,728 --> 00:46:36,910
[SPEAKER_14]: The responsibility of the owner, which would be the store, Mr. President, it shall be unlawful for any owner of any cart to permit any cart to be removed from the store premise and left unattended or abandoned on any city street or public place within the city.

623
00:46:38,051 --> 00:46:45,452
[SPEAKER_14]: This would also require mandatory implementation and ongoing use of measures to prevent removal of shopping carts.

624
00:46:46,475 --> 00:46:55,883
[SPEAKER_14]: And shopping cart owners shall implement and enforce on an ongoing basis measures to contain the shopping carts within the premise of its business establishment.

625
00:46:56,924 --> 00:47:03,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a couple of businesses we worked with over the last several years, Sharp and Sharp to be one in the Wellington area.

626
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:12,856
[SPEAKER_14]: They put on a wheel locking mechanism that prevents the cart from exiting the barrier of their premise.

627
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:15,839
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is one mechanism

628
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:23,124
[SPEAKER_14]: You install those locking mechanisms along with an electronic barrier which stops the carts.

629
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:33,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Another one is shopping carts equipped with a protruding arm or a similar device prohibiting the cart from leaving the interior of the business.

630
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:37,078
[SPEAKER_14]: That seems to be very effective.

631
00:47:38,095 --> 00:47:41,058
[SPEAKER_14]: and a retrieval plan, Mr. President.

632
00:47:41,938 --> 00:47:59,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Any ordinance that's worth its weight would require the store to submit a retrieval plan to the building commissioner and they would have a system where they have prompt removal of carts that are located on city property.

633
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:09,126
[SPEAKER_14]: In order to do this, we would require any of the business establishments that have shopping carts to put identification on their carts.

634
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:18,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, you may see some faint identification on certain carts based on the store, but that's all you may see, Mr. President.

635
00:48:19,494 --> 00:48:29,302
[SPEAKER_14]: What I would ask is that the carts be affixed with the name, address, and phone number of the cart, the owner of the cart.

636
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:45,040
[SPEAKER_14]: and also that every establishment that has a shopping cart have a sign at the beginning of their store location that lets patrons know that this cart cannot leave the premise.

637
00:48:45,942 --> 00:48:49,126
[SPEAKER_14]: and that there are means to protect this cot from leaving the premise.

638
00:48:49,546 --> 00:49:06,205
[SPEAKER_14]: That way, people that do want to take the cot for a walk to their home know that that's no longer going to be allowed, Mr. President, based on the fact that many of these cots are just finding their way on city streets and ending up in front of someone's home for weeks at a time.

639
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:11,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And really, there's been no relief under any city ordinance to address this issue.

640
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:21,668
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Wegmans coming in, Bob Sporting Good, PetSmart, Aldi's in Wellington has a pretty creative way of doing it.

641
00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:27,153
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to put a quarter in to get the shopping cart, and when you bring it back, you get your quarter back.

642
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:35,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, there are people that are not worried about their quarter, and taking the carts and using them to

643
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,604
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, traverse around the community.

644
00:49:38,084 --> 00:49:48,589
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's a good way, but I also think they should put a locking mechanism, Mr. President, or another way of retrieving these carts so they don't get off their property.

645
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:54,732
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that this paper be sent to the Subcommittee on Public Works.

646
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,813
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's probably the most likely.

647
00:49:56,873 --> 00:49:58,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Public safety, Mr. Vice President?

648
00:49:59,014 --> 00:50:00,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Public safety would be fine.

649
00:50:00,394 --> 00:50:01,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Public safety and public works.

650
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,296
[SPEAKER_14]: To me, it seems like a public work issue because it's,

651
00:50:04,873 --> 00:50:06,853
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a card on a city street.

652
00:50:07,774 --> 00:50:08,394
[SPEAKER_14]: The public works?

653
00:50:08,994 --> 00:50:27,898
[SPEAKER_14]: I would ask that it be sent to public works, Mr. President, in that similar to the issue with having these big metal boxes for drop-off that are popping up all over the city, there's one, Mr. President, in the Fells Plaza now that's actually manned.

654
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:32,310
[SPEAKER_14]: The box is probably 15 feet long by 8 feet wide.

655
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:35,314
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's someone there at the entrance of the box.

656
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:38,017
[SPEAKER_14]: They open up the big gate to the box during the day.

657
00:50:38,437 --> 00:50:42,061
[SPEAKER_14]: And someone sits out there in a lounge chair accepting items.

658
00:50:43,062 --> 00:50:45,044
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't know where we're going with this, Mr. President.

659
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:49,768
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, homeowners shouldn't have to see this across the street from their homes, Mr. President.

660
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:54,813
[SPEAKER_14]: They shouldn't have to look at an abandoned mattress where it says we accept books.

661
00:50:55,333 --> 00:51:03,760
[SPEAKER_14]: They shouldn't have to look at items that are left out there on days on end, Mr. President, that is just a public nuisance.

662
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:13,849
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I'm hoping that we can address the shopping cart issue and the drop-off boxes pretty soon, Mr. President, so we can

663
00:51:14,747 --> 00:51:16,228
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, tackle this very important issue.

664
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:21,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're recommending that this be sent, referred to the Public Works Committee, correct?

665
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:22,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct, Mr. President.

666
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Public Works Committee, which is chaired by Councilor Knight, and yourself, Vice President Marks, are on it, and Councilor Dello Russo is also on that committee, so I would hope that your committee would call a subcommittee meeting as soon as possible.

667
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:40,097
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Marks.

668
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo.

669
00:51:42,378 --> 00:51:44,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President, for recognizing me.

670
00:51:44,890 --> 00:52:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And just if the council could refresh my memory, and I certainly don't want to belabor the laborious presentation that we've already had, but I was, for some reason I have in my mind that there's already an ordinance on this, or did we not discuss one and it went nowhere?

671
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:10,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember some, it might be a decade ago that this matter was before us for quite lengthy discussion.

672
00:52:12,702 --> 00:52:13,222
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could.

673
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:19,226
[SPEAKER_06]: The clerk has informed me that a motion was made on this about a year ago when it was received and placed on file.

674
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:20,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

675
00:52:20,447 --> 00:52:22,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember something even further back.

676
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:26,171
[SPEAKER_04]: If the clerk would let us know where that is.

677
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Nonetheless, thank you, Mr. President.

678
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:30,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to addressing this in subcommittee.

679
00:52:30,974 --> 00:52:31,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

680
00:52:32,075 --> 00:52:38,099
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Knight.

681
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:38,899
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

682
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

683
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:57,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered 17490, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the pothole on Short Street that is filled with sand be filled in the interest of public safety.

684
00:52:57,652 --> 00:52:58,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

685
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:01,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

686
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:07,982
[SPEAKER_08]: This pothole, I think I brought up a few weeks ago, is filled with sand, it's bowed,

687
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Two feet by two feet, I feel like.

688
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:13,443
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big pothole and just looking to get it filled.

689
00:53:14,003 --> 00:53:23,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate they did some pothole filling on Rita and a few other streets that I've noticed, but Short Street needs to be done.

690
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:27,672
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a few others, if I can amend this paper, on Bell Ave that I got a call on today.

691
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:28,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Bell Ave also?

692
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:28,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

693
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

694
00:53:35,263 --> 00:53:42,346
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended, to add Bell Ave on there, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

695
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:43,486
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

696
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:48,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

697
00:53:48,648 --> 00:53:56,611
[SPEAKER_06]: 17491, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the protection of our city shade trees be discussed.

698
00:53:56,731 --> 00:53:57,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

699
00:53:58,752 --> 00:53:59,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

700
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:04,714
[SPEAKER_14]: As I mentioned a few weeks back, for the last several years, maybe 10 years,

701
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:31,133
[SPEAKER_14]: We've received the distinct award of being recognized as Tree City USA in this community, and we received that award based on the number of trees that we plant on an annual basis, the fact that a certain percentage of our per capita budget is spent on shade trees, and the fact that we have a tree department with the tree warden, which is all great news, Mr. President.

702
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:43,970
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what we first have to do is recognize that the trees that are lining our streets are an important resource for the whole community and provide shade and protection to our pedestrians.

703
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:46,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Street trees help clean air.

704
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,994
[SPEAKER_14]: They help lower heating and air conditioning costs.

705
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:54,798
[SPEAKER_14]: They provide environmental benefits by filtering and reducing storm water runoff.

706
00:54:55,638 --> 00:54:57,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Trees reduce noise and create a visual buffer.

707
00:54:58,104 --> 00:55:04,545
[SPEAKER_14]: between streets and private homes, and they also boost property value and enhance the character of a neighborhood.

708
00:55:05,686 --> 00:55:27,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently right now, Mr. President, when work is done in the community, I think everyone would be surprised that you would think the first person that a contractor would have to go to or anyone that's doing work around a city tree on a city street would have to contact or be in touch with a tree warden,

709
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,906
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the case, Mr. President.

710
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:45,573
[SPEAKER_14]: For most construction work that's performed in our city, around city shade trees, the construction company or whoever's doing the work is typically required to go to OCD or the engineering office.

711
00:55:46,534 --> 00:55:54,577
[SPEAKER_14]: So they don't have to go to our great tree warden, Aggie Tooden, to get her professional opinion as an arborist.

712
00:55:56,234 --> 00:56:14,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Mr. President, the work that was done recently on Boston Ave, where contractors did a lot of work on sidewalks that contain trees, the OCD and engineering department sometimes will consult or get the opinion of our tree warden.

713
00:56:16,023 --> 00:56:17,663
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a problem with that, Mr. President.

714
00:56:18,484 --> 00:56:21,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Aggie Tudin was a very capable person

715
00:56:21,638 --> 00:56:31,028
[SPEAKER_14]: and has done a tremendous job in this city on our shade trees in the community, should be the go-to person as far as I'm concerned.

716
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:43,562
[SPEAKER_14]: When a utility company comes into this community and start veeing out our trees because the branches are getting too close to their wires, that's a concern if Aggie Tudin's not aware of this.

717
00:56:44,202 --> 00:56:47,805
[SPEAKER_14]: if our tree wardens not there to oversee the veeing out.

718
00:56:48,165 --> 00:56:53,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen trees, Mr. President, that really don't look like a tree anymore when the utility companies are done with them.

719
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:55,572
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how bad it is.

720
00:56:55,952 --> 00:57:05,700
[SPEAKER_14]: These are long-established shade trees that have been in our community for 40, 50, 60 years that are being desecrated, Mr. President, across our community.

721
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:18,553
[SPEAKER_14]: So I ask tonight, Mr. President, and I think we can do this in two ways, an administrative policy which can be done through the administration or city ordinance, but oversight of construction work.

722
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:24,518
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would ask that any approval by the tree warden required for construction work

723
00:57:25,078 --> 00:57:42,745
[SPEAKER_14]: including work by the city or its contractors or by any utility company that will impact a public shade tree or the roots within a defined distance of a tree stem, impose a fine if the approval is not obtained ahead of time, exception in the case of an emergency work, Mr. President.

724
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:45,206
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be the first recommendation that I offer.

725
00:57:45,787 --> 00:57:48,109
[SPEAKER_14]: And we could send it to the administration.

726
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:49,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe the mayor will pick up on this.

727
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:55,997
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, I think it deserves merit in one of our fine subcommittees.

728
00:57:56,677 --> 00:58:00,901
[SPEAKER_14]: And also the establishment, Mr. President, which we don't currently have right now.

729
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:07,647
[SPEAKER_14]: We have revolving accounts in this city, which is money that's earmarked and dedicated for certain purposes.

730
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:11,929
[SPEAKER_14]: For everything under the sun, you name it, we have a revolving account.

731
00:58:12,509 --> 00:58:16,070
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have one currently for our shade trees, Mr. President.

732
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:32,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of trees in this community that, as you know, provide a direct benefit not only financially but physically to the residents of this community, and we don't have any type of dedicated revolving fund.

733
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:36,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So I ask that a tree fund revolving account

734
00:58:37,176 --> 00:59:03,415
[SPEAKER_14]: be earmarked for tree plantings, Mr. President, and also to any fines that are issued by the city for any damage to public shade trees, and believe it or not, we do issue fines every so often for damage to our shade trees, not go into the general fund where the money goes now, that's similar to when our police write tickets, the money goes into the general fund,

735
00:59:04,313 --> 00:59:12,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanwhile, we need police cruises, we need new equipment, we need radar signs, we need a host of things, but it goes into the general fund and gets swallowed up.

736
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:33,637
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm asking for, Mr. President, is that any fines issued on behalf of our trees and also any other money that's recovered within the tree program go into a revolving account, and any donations that people may want to make to the trees in this community go into a dedicated account, Mr. President, for the preservation,

737
00:59:34,013 --> 00:59:36,795
[SPEAKER_14]: and protection of our city shade trees.

738
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:50,644
[SPEAKER_14]: It just so happens, and myself, I think it was Councilor Lungo, and you, Mr. President, we received an email today regarding a tree that was damaged at Columbus Park.

739
00:59:51,444 --> 00:59:55,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And a picture was sent, and I'll pass it around to my colleagues, Mr. President,

740
00:59:56,011 --> 01:00:11,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the weekend, someone took, I would assume some type of hatchet or carving knife, and carved all the bark off the tree from the base of the tree to about six feet up on the tree at Columbus Park.

741
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:15,355
[SPEAKER_14]: And this looks like a pretty young tree.

742
01:00:16,266 --> 01:00:18,047
[SPEAKER_14]: And I reached out to Aggie Tudin.

743
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:20,927
[SPEAKER_14]: She did go out because she received the same email.

744
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:27,509
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, based on her observation, she doesn't believe the tree will survive.

745
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:31,151
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is only one thing, Mr. President.

746
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:36,112
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just so happens I put this on the agenda prior to even getting this email.

747
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:42,174
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it shows you that, you know, we really need to step up our game.

748
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:44,893
[SPEAKER_14]: when it comes to the shade trees in our community.

749
01:00:45,373 --> 01:00:46,314
[SPEAKER_14]: We're a big asset.

750
01:00:46,954 --> 01:00:53,356
[SPEAKER_14]: For many years, you know, you've heard people say, the only thing that separates us from Somerville is we're Somerville with trees.

751
01:00:54,137 --> 01:00:56,098
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, some of it's true, Mr. President.

752
01:00:56,538 --> 01:01:01,520
[SPEAKER_14]: The trees in this community, Mr. President, do a lot for our community.

753
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,901
[SPEAKER_14]: And it makes a neighborhood what it is.

754
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:06,896
[SPEAKER_14]: and I don't think we should take them for granted.

755
01:01:07,336 --> 01:01:17,159
[SPEAKER_14]: This council was very strong for years when the city was posting signage on trees, using our trees to post all sorts of metal signs.

756
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:34,525
[SPEAKER_14]: It was this council, through its persistency, Mr. President, that stopped that policy of using trees to post signage, and the administration came out with a policy that prohibits that now, and it was this council, and it's something I'm very proud of, Mr. President,

757
01:01:34,745 --> 01:01:46,394
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this council should be very proud of, because, you know, it's important as a community, you know, that we appreciate and respect all living things.

758
01:01:47,254 --> 01:01:51,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, you may not realize the different animals that live in a tree.

759
01:01:52,078 --> 01:01:52,818
[SPEAKER_14]: That's their home.

760
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:58,002
[SPEAKER_14]: You may not like squirrels that run around or birds that are doing their duty on your car.

761
01:01:58,483 --> 01:02:02,786
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, they live in the trees, Mr. President, and we have to respect them.

762
01:02:03,135 --> 01:02:18,145
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to have administrative policies and ordinances that allow us as a community to protect them and to stop utility companies and any other private company that's coming in and doing work on a public street, Mr. President, from desecrating our trees.

763
01:02:18,686 --> 01:02:31,995
[SPEAKER_14]: So I offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that this be sent to the administration for administrative policy and that I guess if public works, again, we're going to be a busy committee with Chairman Knight as the chairman,

764
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:57,043
[SPEAKER_14]: that the Public Works Committee looks at the creation of a city ordinance that provides oversight to construction work, that gives the tree warden, Aggie Tudin, more authority over work that's being done and approval by the tree warden, and also that we create a dedicated revolving urban forestry fund to fund our shade trees in the community, Mr. President.

765
01:02:57,503 --> 01:02:58,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

766
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:00,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the opportunity to drive by that tree.

767
01:03:02,396 --> 01:03:04,456
[SPEAKER_06]: It had to take some time to chop all their back off.

768
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:07,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how somebody didn't drive by to see that happening.

769
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:12,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, you know, if other people see something, please say something.

770
01:03:13,538 --> 01:03:14,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Name and address of the record, please.

771
01:03:15,819 --> 01:03:18,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Council President Andrew Castagnetti, Christian Street Method Mass.

772
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:20,420
[SPEAKER_00]: The trees are very nice.

773
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, maintenance can be a problem.

774
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:31,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard the terminology, difference between Somerville and Medford would be where a city

775
01:03:32,781 --> 01:03:34,041
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're a city without trees.

776
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:35,282
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.

777
01:03:36,322 --> 01:03:42,063
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern is we've got to maintain and take care of our basics.

778
01:03:43,223 --> 01:03:46,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain what we have, let alone building anew.

779
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:55,286
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, behind by Riverbend, I'm sorry, the term would be Ring Road.

780
01:03:56,086 --> 01:04:00,887
[SPEAKER_00]: That parking lot back there, this hunks of cement that are supposed to

781
01:04:01,408 --> 01:04:06,109
[SPEAKER_00]: be in place to stop cars from encroaching upon the sidewalks.

782
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:09,470
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over the place, from the snow plowing.

783
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,850
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't see them when they plow.

784
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:15,391
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one on the other side, almost in the river, mind you.

785
01:04:16,251 --> 01:04:19,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned someone's gonna get seriously, seriously hurt.

786
01:04:20,532 --> 01:04:23,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potholes, as Councilor Del Russo calls them,

787
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:24,700
[SPEAKER_00]: potholders.

788
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:29,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure if there is a better way to build a mousetrap.

789
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:41,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should talk to Montreal or some other locale where they have pothole problems big time, and maybe we can learn from the engineering process what would actually hold up.

790
01:04:41,568 --> 01:04:49,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it has to be cut in a V or an opposite angle and filled maybe with cement if the tire is not going to stay.

791
01:04:49,371 --> 01:04:51,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not that savvy in this area.

792
01:04:53,049 --> 01:05:01,877
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my concern is, if you don't take care of our basics, I don't know about some of them, but I'm concerned that we're gonna have like a weekend in Chelsea here.

793
01:05:04,219 --> 01:05:13,848
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my concern, with your massage parlors, or your hawk shops, and there is some plane noise also.

794
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

795
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lococoon.

796
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

797
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to go on record as seconding the motion.

798
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:22,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great resolve.

799
01:05:23,031 --> 01:05:25,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to see if we could maybe take it one step further.

800
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:37,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Back maybe eight years ago, there was a number of residents, and I remember clearly Roberta Cameron was pushing hard for a tree ordinance to be put in place.

801
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:46,116
[SPEAKER_08]: We met in committee a few times, and I drafted maybe a two or three page ordinance from some research I did.

802
01:05:46,816 --> 01:05:50,898
[SPEAKER_08]: with regards to a few different cities and towns.

803
01:05:51,478 --> 01:05:55,160
[SPEAKER_08]: We met a committee on it, and then it was sent to the city solicitor for review.

804
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:06,144
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been eight years reviewing, but I believe it didn't go anywhere because the votes really weren't there to create a tree ordinance back eight, 10 years ago, and the administration was not for it.

805
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:16,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it kind of died down because right around the same time, maybe three, six months, nine months later, Aggie Tudin was hired, and she obviously came in and gave us

806
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:20,724
[SPEAKER_08]: great spiel of what she's going to do and how good she's going to do it.

807
01:06:20,784 --> 01:06:26,405
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that kind of has appeased the citizens, especially over the last several years.

808
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:42,367
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think, especially after seeing this, and I agree with Councilor Marks with regards to everything he spoke about, I think it's time that maybe we bring that back and try to create an ordinance if our city solicitor would try to dig that up.

809
01:06:42,467 --> 01:06:46,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I have it on my old computer, but dig that up, see if he has done any review.

810
01:06:47,276 --> 01:06:52,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this council is a good example of making the changes that need to be changed.

811
01:06:52,439 --> 01:06:56,982
[SPEAKER_08]: We've changed more ordinances and done more work in the last year and a half.

812
01:06:57,202 --> 01:07:00,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I think changed more ordinances than I ever remember doing in a term.

813
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:10,910
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's, and I think it would have support now to review an entire ordinance and make it so we do a number of changes and make a number of positive

814
01:07:11,982 --> 01:07:18,363
[SPEAKER_08]: take positive steps moving forward, and a tree ordinance is something that's gonna give Aggie Tootin Teeth, it is gonna give her more power.

815
01:07:18,863 --> 01:07:28,665
[SPEAKER_08]: It may cause her a little bit more aggravation with having, you know, the way we set it up, obviously, which I believe the prior tree warden was against an ordinance because of that fact.

816
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:39,547
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is something that will protect our trees, and I think it's, now is a really good time, especially if we can get the budget done in the next few weeks, maybe meet on it at the end of June and try to

817
01:07:39,943 --> 01:07:45,267
[SPEAKER_08]: get the language to review over the summer, I think it's something that this council definitely can move forward and should move forward.

818
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:47,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Donahue-Grimm.

819
01:07:47,788 --> 01:07:48,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address for the record, please.

820
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:51,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Neuzil, 35 Parrish Street, Medford.

821
01:07:53,252 --> 01:07:56,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am thrilled to hear the phrase tree ordinance.

822
01:07:56,815 --> 01:08:03,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had some conversations both online and sidebar with various people

823
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:14,772
[SPEAKER_01]: who are concerned both for our public shade trees, but also for some of the old majestic beauties that are being torn out that we'll never see again.

824
01:08:14,912 --> 01:08:16,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is great.

825
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:26,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the idea of those fines going to a fund that people can also voluntarily contribute to if it's a topic that's near and dear to their heart.

826
01:08:26,094 --> 01:08:28,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it's a great thing to be looking at.

827
01:08:28,714 --> 01:08:32,935
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to thank you all for considering it and put my citizenry support behind it.

828
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:34,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

829
01:08:35,348 --> 01:08:36,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

830
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:45,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important to point out that our tree warden, Maggie Tooden, was the two-time tree warden of the year, consecutive years in a row.

831
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:53,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we'd be remiss in moving forward without first getting some input and some feedback from Maggie as to what direction she'd like to see this going as well.

832
01:08:54,265 --> 01:08:56,667
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to amend the paper and request that the tree warden provide input.

833
01:08:59,123 --> 01:09:04,107
[SPEAKER_03]: what you would like to see, an administrative procedure, an ordinance, and if she can make some recommendations thereof.

834
01:09:05,928 --> 01:09:06,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

835
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:17,878
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Vice President Marks, as seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Knight.

836
01:09:18,278 --> 01:09:18,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I get them all?

837
01:09:21,581 --> 01:09:27,746
[SPEAKER_06]: To be sent to Public Works and to the Mayor's Office, and again, all those in favor?

838
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:29,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

839
01:09:29,574 --> 01:09:31,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, again, this came out today.

840
01:09:32,797 --> 01:09:35,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody had to take an hour or two to cut all this down.

841
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe nobody saw this happen.

842
01:09:39,443 --> 01:09:41,145
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, this was right in the middle of the park there.

843
01:09:41,505 --> 01:09:42,667
[SPEAKER_06]: People go by it all the time.

844
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:45,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm shocked no one saw anything happen there.

845
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:45,690
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-492.

846
01:09:54,102 --> 01:10:02,326
[SPEAKER_06]: offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the manhole cover on the bottom of Rita Drive with cones on it be fixed in the interest of public safety.

847
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:03,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

848
01:10:03,606 --> 01:10:04,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

849
01:10:04,907 --> 01:10:11,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even sure if it's a manhole cover or a sewer grate, but it's on the side of the road.

850
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:12,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned it earlier.

851
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:19,193
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could get an update with regards to when that's going to be fixed, because it does have two cones on it.

852
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:20,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I could amend the paper.

853
01:10:21,557 --> 01:10:34,720
[SPEAKER_08]: With regards to Belle Ave, there is another sewer cover that is probably two feet deep with a cone and a barrel on it that if we could get an update when they're going to be fixed and that they'd be fixed as soon as possible in the interest of public safety.

854
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:35,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote, please.

855
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:43,802
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Knight, with Belle Ave being added there too.

856
01:10:45,062 --> 01:10:45,782
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

857
01:10:46,983 --> 01:10:48,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

858
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:51,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ask for a roll call, ma'am?

859
01:10:52,864 --> 01:10:53,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk.

860
01:10:56,128 --> 01:10:58,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, the councillor has asked for a roll call.

861
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:02,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I mistakenly did a voice vote.

862
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:06,400
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could please call the roll.

863
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:08,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Dello Russo.

864
01:11:09,274 --> 01:11:09,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco?

865
01:11:10,114 --> 01:11:10,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

866
01:11:10,775 --> 01:11:11,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

867
01:11:11,395 --> 01:11:11,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

868
01:11:12,115 --> 01:11:12,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Kerr?

869
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:13,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

870
01:11:13,616 --> 01:11:14,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Monk?

871
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:14,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

872
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:15,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

873
01:11:16,057 --> 01:11:16,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

874
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:17,618
[SPEAKER_15]: President Caraviello?

875
01:11:17,678 --> 01:11:17,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

876
01:11:18,619 --> 01:11:20,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

877
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

878
01:11:22,081 --> 01:11:25,782
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies, Councilor.

879
01:11:25,802 --> 01:11:34,807
[SPEAKER_06]: 17494, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the City Council discuss the street work that was performed on Clifton Road.

880
01:11:35,547 --> 01:11:36,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

881
01:11:37,685 --> 01:11:38,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

882
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:42,768
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this, uh, it seems like there's a common thread here.

883
01:11:43,208 --> 01:12:04,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I know I've been talking about this since I first arrived here in this council and, uh, the resident that called and I took a ride down to Clifton and, uh, witnessed the street that was, uh, dug up for utility work, uh, is now, uh, has been patched and now sinking.

884
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:05,740
[SPEAKER_12]: So again,

885
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:18,439
[SPEAKER_12]: If we can ask the, I believe it was Councilor Knight who asked the, correct me if I'm wrong, asked for the city engineer to give us an update of all the utility work that was done.

886
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:36,083
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we can ask the city engineer to please bring that, if she can bring that to the meeting next week, I think it'll be pretty eye opening to see the concerns and the calls and the issues we've got, we've received from our constituents about the biggest areas

887
01:12:37,372 --> 01:12:53,347
[SPEAKER_12]: of concern were mainly because of our utilities not doing what they've been promised to us to maintain a level that our constituents deserve.

888
01:12:53,407 --> 01:13:02,375
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I think I made a motion a while back that I wanted to halt all work for public utilities.

889
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:12,556
[SPEAKER_12]: that are asking, coming to this rail and asking for a permit to start work in our community.

890
01:13:13,196 --> 01:13:32,526
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I don't, for one council, if I don't get the information that I need next week and we don't have a sit down with the public utilities and talking about our roads and our streets, I think that something has to be done with this council.

891
01:13:33,551 --> 01:13:49,798
[SPEAKER_12]: motioning moratoriums or delays for those organizations, because when they can't work and they can't perform the duties that brings the money to their businesses, and I think that's when they'll start to listen.

892
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:57,282
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate the opportunity to address our council with this concern.

893
01:13:58,182 --> 01:13:59,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

894
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:00,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

895
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:05,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up.

896
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:20,586
[SPEAKER_03]: When we passed the resolution, 16404, we asked for all of the work that was done on our roadways and sidewalks by public utilities for the years 2014, 15, 16, and to date.

897
01:14:21,146 --> 01:14:31,870
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been 16 months since that resolution was passed, Mr. President, so I'd like to update it so that the engineer can come to our meeting next week prepared with this information to date.

898
01:14:32,751 --> 01:14:33,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'd also have 2017 included

899
01:14:35,628 --> 01:14:36,688
[SPEAKER_03]: in this report that we're seeking.

900
01:14:37,109 --> 01:14:47,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request that, um, the administration provide us with all the C-Click fix reports related to work done by public utilities on the roadways, uh, in preparation for the meeting on Tuesday as well.

901
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:56,037
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Knight.

902
01:14:56,097 --> 01:14:58,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, do you have all those changes?

903
01:14:59,518 --> 01:15:02,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

904
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,020
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

905
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:08,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

906
01:15:08,193 --> 01:15:11,136
[SPEAKER_06]: 17 four nine five offered by councilor Scarpelli.

907
01:15:11,616 --> 01:15:14,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Be resolved at the city council.

908
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:18,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Discuss the gas station hood located on Winthrop street.

909
01:15:19,263 --> 01:15:20,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

910
01:15:21,044 --> 01:15:22,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

911
01:15:22,746 --> 01:15:32,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I've received a few phone calls, emails and, um, uh, concerns about, uh, the hood that this is the canopy.

912
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:56,701
[SPEAKER_12]: that is being built over on the gas station on Winthrop Street and the concerns of how large it is and concerns of what that canopy makes the changing of the neighborhood and what it looks like today.

913
01:15:56,841 --> 01:16:00,663
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did contact the city

914
01:16:03,873 --> 01:16:06,915
[SPEAKER_12]: City administration talked to Paul Moki, talked to Jeff Fargo.

915
01:16:07,816 --> 01:16:10,778
[SPEAKER_12]: They were very, very involved, although they didn't have to be.

916
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:17,983
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that Mr. Moki was out that site many times looking at the canopy.

917
01:16:18,063 --> 01:16:25,088
[SPEAKER_12]: They realized that it's actually smaller than what is actually passed, which brings me to my number one concern.

918
01:16:25,108 --> 01:16:27,470
[SPEAKER_12]: And we hear it over and over again.

919
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:30,532
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like every council meeting we talk about this is,

920
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,981
[SPEAKER_12]: what happens when it comes to our zoning.

921
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:39,563
[SPEAKER_12]: This was something that was passed at a meeting with the neighbors that were on site.

922
01:16:39,983 --> 01:16:43,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And there were two, I believe there were two issues on that agenda.

923
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:49,246
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one that called for another bay, which was denied, and then the canopy.

924
01:16:50,286 --> 01:16:53,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Some neighbors said that they didn't realize the canopy was on that, so they left the meeting.

925
01:16:54,447 --> 01:17:00,349
[SPEAKER_12]: But the biggest concern I have is really not that

926
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:03,735
[SPEAKER_12]: we can do anything about this now because the cat's out of the bag.

927
01:17:03,795 --> 01:17:13,021
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been approved is again the way we're looking at our ordinances that our zoning board, uh, their tools they're given to make decisions.

928
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:26,230
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, some questions, some of our residents were, did they see specs where they're, um, do they understand how, how big this would be and how much it would change the appearance of the neighborhood?

929
01:17:26,831 --> 01:17:29,152
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, I don't know if that was, that's the case.

930
01:17:29,192 --> 01:17:30,113
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that,

931
01:17:31,227 --> 01:17:43,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Our city departments did their due diligence when it came to the fire department giving permission for that canopy that needed to be there.

932
01:17:44,157 --> 01:17:58,548
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the new laws state that there has to be some sort of fire apparatus that extinguishes any type of gas fire, and it's actually powdered form that extinguishes blazes to do with gasoline.

933
01:17:58,988 --> 01:18:01,509
[SPEAKER_12]: So public safety is number one.

934
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:18,839
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I think that we need to, again, I know I mentioned the Metropolitan Planning Council and working with them to try to start a dialogue in our zoning and reviewing our zoning so we can control or support

935
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,310
[SPEAKER_12]: what's going on in our neighborhoods.

936
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:34,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And so things like this issue aren't brought up after the fact, and the concerns of our neighbors are heard too late.

937
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:48,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything was done, the up and up, and the due diligence of our city departments maintained, making sure that the residents were contacted.

938
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:49,570
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one of the

939
01:18:50,164 --> 01:19:15,793
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the concerns that was brought to my attention and from what I was told and shown that that was covered and the neighbors were at the meetings, but I think that we really have to, again, bring up the discussion of our zoning and our ordinances because it's issues like this that change the face of our neighborhoods.

940
01:19:15,934 --> 01:19:19,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And until we do that, and this council does that and finds a way to get that done,

941
01:19:20,603 --> 01:19:23,206
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to keep hearing the same issue over and over again.

942
01:19:23,286 --> 01:19:25,408
[SPEAKER_12]: So, again, thank you.

943
01:19:25,868 --> 01:19:30,512
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that I'm rambling, but it's an issue that was brought to our attention.

944
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,574
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you again.

945
01:19:32,954 --> 01:19:35,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all received phone calls on that.

946
01:19:36,297 --> 01:19:37,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got the same answer.

947
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:38,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

948
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:39,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Mr. President.

949
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a question for the gentleman.

950
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:46,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if, because it's new construction and the canopy was put in, is that the new code?

951
01:19:46,877 --> 01:19:48,297
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the Fire Chief, yes, it is.

952
01:19:48,357 --> 01:19:48,998
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the new code.

953
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:50,018
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't abuse the new code.

954
01:19:50,278 --> 01:19:52,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gas station has been there for many, many years.

955
01:19:52,438 --> 01:19:57,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And the matter was brought before the Zoning Board of Appeals because they were looking for a non-conforming use of the existing city zoning.

956
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

957
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Move approval, Mr. President.

958
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:02,521
[SPEAKER_03]: They were supposed to.

959
01:20:03,421 --> 01:20:04,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli, do you have any more?

960
01:20:05,082 --> 01:20:06,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, no, that was just to answer.

961
01:20:06,462 --> 01:20:06,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

962
01:20:07,685 --> 01:20:08,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

963
01:20:08,965 --> 01:20:10,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street.

964
01:20:11,466 --> 01:20:36,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only advise you, as I have in the past, having attended these community development meetings and zoning board meetings, when you attend, there's no real effort made to make sure that residents are able to see the documentation, can clearly hear the documentation, presenters are regularly advised, speak to the board,

965
01:20:38,265 --> 01:20:41,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And often, when you're sitting in the audience, you'll have a back.

966
01:20:42,808 --> 01:20:57,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone with experience in transformational change and change management understands that the best way to deal with pushback and resistance is to make sure that expectations are set.

967
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:06,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is another example of the right equipment in these rooms and the right opportunities presented to make sure that

968
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,532
[SPEAKER_01]: abutters in neighborhoods get to hear what's happening.

969
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:14,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this could have been avoided and people could have been less upset about it.

970
01:21:16,016 --> 01:21:22,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's also a good case for more transparency in this documentation.

971
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:30,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, if a resident wanted to know about that project, they would have to go down to the Office of Community Development.

972
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:33,388
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have to request to see the documentation.

973
01:21:34,051 --> 01:21:36,733
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have to be allowed to have that documentation.

974
01:21:36,753 --> 01:21:39,515
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have to be readily available and not under review somewhere.

975
01:21:40,356 --> 01:21:42,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would have to do it right there in the space.

976
01:21:42,718 --> 01:21:47,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lot of people, they're not out of work and home before four or five o'clock at night.

977
01:21:47,481 --> 01:21:49,463
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes very difficult for us to see this.

978
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:53,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know previously we've had some conversations.

979
01:21:53,486 --> 01:21:57,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was in one of the subcommittee meetings about some

980
01:21:58,282 --> 01:22:00,863
[SPEAKER_01]: software that's available that would make some of these things.

981
01:22:01,003 --> 01:22:15,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Just so I know, Jeanne's going on, but tomorrow we have a meeting, a committee of the whole meeting, at 6 o'clock, the purpose of the meeting is to view presentation of Acela Corporation on the government legislative management program agenda minutes and video streaming.

982
01:22:15,611 --> 01:22:17,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the product you're talking about.

983
01:22:17,692 --> 01:22:18,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Just so you know, that's happening tomorrow.

984
01:22:18,753 --> 01:22:19,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, perfect.

985
01:22:19,473 --> 01:22:22,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe one of the things people might want to ask them is if there's

986
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:27,599
[SPEAKER_01]: module that would allow for a mechanism for these documents.

987
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:34,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some surrounding cities, even Melrose and Malden, have a good portion of theirs readily available.

988
01:22:34,222 --> 01:22:43,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's through Google Docs or Excel, but I think it would go a long way because most people, if they have the opportunity to see it, their expectations are set.

989
01:22:43,945 --> 01:22:50,607
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not surprised driving home from work, and it keeps from having emotions elevated because they have that information.

990
01:22:50,647 --> 01:22:51,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the

991
01:22:52,988 --> 01:23:09,563
[SPEAKER_01]: software or some Google Docs solution, maybe temporarily, coupled with maybe some technology, simple technology in the room so that people can hear a little better, even if it's a lapel microphone and a speaker, could go pretty far with some of these meetings.

992
01:23:09,703 --> 01:23:16,128
[SPEAKER_01]: But just so you have that information, because I've attended a lot, and I know you guys have other ones you go to, and you don't always get to be at those.

993
01:23:17,429 --> 01:23:17,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

994
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:18,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Member O'Karyn.

995
01:23:20,606 --> 01:23:24,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, and thank you to Councilor Scarapelli for bringing that up.

996
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:37,579
[SPEAKER_08]: On topic, with regards to maybe just a little more information on what the Zoning Board of Appeals had to approve, I think I did see people discussing this issue, and people were a little upset with the way it went down.

997
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:45,045
[SPEAKER_08]: But what Gene Nuzzo had brought up, not only does it have to be a resident

998
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:49,743
[SPEAKER_08]: come down to City Hall between 9 and 5 or 9 and 4.30, depending on the day.

999
01:23:49,783 --> 01:24:01,072
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also heard complaints from residents who aren't allowed to see the plans unless somebody specific is in the office, or they may have to come back another day at another time.

1000
01:24:01,132 --> 01:24:13,742
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that is kind of hampering residents' ability to view plans and to actually, we talk about transparency, but that's kind of cutting people off from seeing what should be honestly posted online.

1001
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:29,733
[SPEAKER_08]: a proposal, I think of any sort, with regards to building or construction or anything that's going to need a variance or OCD approval, that should be something that's readily available to anybody that wants to view it, whether they're at City Hall or not.

1002
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:32,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that would be helpful to the council, too.

1003
01:24:33,113 --> 01:24:34,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I've come down and reviewed plans.

1004
01:24:34,773 --> 01:24:42,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And I went from, I believe I ended up at the engineer's department, but I went to OCD first.

1005
01:24:42,355 --> 01:24:43,015
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't there.

1006
01:24:44,559 --> 01:24:48,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Are people not allowed to see it unless the director's in the office?

1007
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,841
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to kind of go through City Hall and try to figure out where the plans even are.

1008
01:24:52,941 --> 01:25:07,164
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe whether it be tomorrow night or be a separate amendment to this paper, I think proposed plans should be online and accessible to anybody that wants to view them so they know, should I go to this OCD meeting?

1009
01:25:07,224 --> 01:25:09,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I go to the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting?

1010
01:25:09,485 --> 01:25:13,346
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll be able to see it on their computer while they want to decide.

1011
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:17,400
[SPEAKER_08]: rather than searching through City Hall or kind of just giving up on the fight.

1012
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:20,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's extremely important.

1013
01:25:20,142 --> 01:25:21,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank Gene for bringing that up.

1014
01:25:21,442 --> 01:25:23,743
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up, too.

1015
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:27,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I was unaware of exactly what was going on with the zoning or with this one.

1016
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:39,289
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe you can just enlighten, if you know what zoning, what they needed, what type of permit or override, variance, I'm sorry.

1017
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:40,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Scarpelli.

1018
01:25:41,076 --> 01:25:45,318
[SPEAKER_12]: The non-conforming, I believe, was one for code.

1019
01:25:45,438 --> 01:25:49,379
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other one was for the addition of a bay.

1020
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that was denied.

1021
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:52,140
[SPEAKER_07]: That was denied.

1022
01:25:52,421 --> 01:26:09,847
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that, like I said, I think that the due diligence from our department, city departments, and making sure and understanding that that being an issue of fire apparatus, that I know there might have been, the question was that

1023
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:18,731
[SPEAKER_12]: A few phone calls that I got were questions about could there have been something that was maybe smaller or more tasteful for that area.

1024
01:26:18,751 --> 01:26:21,172
[SPEAKER_12]: But from what I was told, there isn't.

1025
01:26:21,432 --> 01:26:22,172
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's what?

1026
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:23,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too late.

1027
01:26:24,273 --> 01:26:25,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's not that it was too late.

1028
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:39,117
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I gather is that, just from a phone call I just received before I came in, is that the understanding of that type of canopy, you need that for existing gas stations, being that it's always been permanent and always been a gas station.

1029
01:26:42,726 --> 01:26:44,268
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what they had to maintain, so.

1030
01:26:45,489 --> 01:26:45,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1031
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:47,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

1032
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:48,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1033
01:26:48,691 --> 01:26:54,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward because this is an important issue.

1034
01:26:54,516 --> 01:27:00,441
[SPEAKER_10]: And zoning and ordinances, you know, it's really, it's one of our biggest responsibilities.

1035
01:27:00,701 --> 01:27:05,565
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had a lot of discussions over the past term with regard to zoning and ordinances and a lot of changes.

1036
01:27:06,265 --> 01:27:07,506
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a lot of,

1037
01:27:08,635 --> 01:27:16,220
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when we talk a lot about zoning in ordinances, a lot of it is about communication, but a lot of it is also about transparency.

1038
01:27:16,401 --> 01:27:25,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And Gene Nozzo brings up a good point, which goes into the meeting tomorrow night with regard to legislative software.

1039
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:33,193
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was a resolution that I brought up about a year ago with regard to legislative software.

1040
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:35,474
[SPEAKER_10]: And finally, the meeting is going to happen tomorrow night.

1041
01:27:35,514 --> 01:27:36,195
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's important.

1042
01:27:37,365 --> 01:27:39,366
[SPEAKER_10]: It brings everyone onto the same page.

1043
01:27:39,526 --> 01:27:45,028
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone has any questions or any issues, what they can do is they can find all that information online.

1044
01:27:45,528 --> 01:27:59,054
[SPEAKER_10]: All the boards and commissions can put all of their minutes, agendas, meeting minutes, all of their, anything that has to do with plans or documents, they can all be scanned to PDF and seen online.

1045
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:06,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, all the information that we receive every week, all kinds of memos, reports, all that detail, we get it behind the reel.

1046
01:28:07,835 --> 01:28:12,097
[SPEAKER_10]: But out in the community, no one really gets to see that.

1047
01:28:12,657 --> 01:28:14,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the unfortunate part.

1048
01:28:14,078 --> 01:28:18,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Because really, it's your government.

1049
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:21,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you should be able to see everything with the click of a mouse.

1050
01:28:21,962 --> 01:28:23,502
[SPEAKER_10]: All the data should be at your fingertips.

1051
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:26,724
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what this legislative software is going to do.

1052
01:28:26,804 --> 01:28:30,786
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's well worth the money to actually invest in that.

1053
01:28:30,866 --> 01:28:37,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it really puts everyone on the same playing field, the same level playing field.

1054
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:39,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone has access to the data.

1055
01:28:39,594 --> 01:28:41,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'd use a perfect example.

1056
01:28:42,196 --> 01:28:46,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilman Marks had asked for a number of times for a public safety summit.

1057
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:54,746
[SPEAKER_10]: And if someone wanted to go in and research that, they could actually take a look, plug in public safety summit, and see every time it was mentioned during a council meeting.

1058
01:28:55,807 --> 01:28:57,548
[SPEAKER_10]: So they could actually go back and look at the detail.

1059
01:28:58,329 --> 01:29:00,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a look at the report.

1060
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:02,152
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about the FEMA document a few weeks ago.

1061
01:29:02,552 --> 01:29:03,152
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a 138-page document.

1062
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:06,557
[SPEAKER_10]: really probably shouldn't be printing that.

1063
01:29:06,598 --> 01:29:08,698
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not very green, but everyone should have a copy.

1064
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:10,559
[SPEAKER_10]: The public should have access to it too.

1065
01:29:10,959 --> 01:29:12,319
[SPEAKER_10]: And it should be easy to access.

1066
01:29:12,919 --> 01:29:17,081
[SPEAKER_10]: All you have to do is put that PDF online and everyone has access with the click of a mouse.

1067
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:21,722
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, it's important that we do more in zoning and ordinances.

1068
01:29:21,762 --> 01:29:28,124
[SPEAKER_10]: We have, I think, thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this issue up tonight, but really it's one of our biggest responsibilities.

1069
01:29:28,304 --> 01:29:29,264
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to do more there.

1070
01:29:29,845 --> 01:29:31,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're heading in the right direction.

1071
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:36,776
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think really one of the big things tomorrow night is that meeting with regard to legislative software.

1072
01:29:37,236 --> 01:29:44,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it really will make us an informed council, but it also makes us an informed community.

1073
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:51,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Because all the boards and commissions will have access to that data and have access to put all that information out there for the community to see.

1074
01:29:52,084 --> 01:29:53,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you very much.

1075
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:53,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1076
01:29:53,645 --> 01:29:57,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope everyone who wants to come will be there at 6 o'clock tomorrow evening.

1077
01:29:58,848 --> 01:30:01,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to receive and place on file.

1078
01:30:02,217 --> 01:30:03,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1079
01:30:03,217 --> 01:30:05,338
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1080
01:30:05,599 --> 01:30:06,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1081
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:07,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1082
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,440
[SPEAKER_06]: 17.496 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1083
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:18,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the City Council discuss scheduled work and blasting hours for the construction work located on Winthrop Street.

1084
01:30:19,225 --> 01:30:20,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1085
01:30:20,545 --> 01:30:21,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1086
01:30:21,726 --> 01:30:25,187
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how much my fellow colleagues love to discuss.

1087
01:30:26,528 --> 01:30:31,430
[SPEAKER_12]: The last piece is that the blasting that was conducted last week

1088
01:30:32,109 --> 01:30:35,852
[SPEAKER_12]: over at the new site on the ledge over on Winthrop Street.

1089
01:30:38,213 --> 01:30:52,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving forward, I know that I believe that it's the fire chief in his department that issues the permits and I believe they notify, is it their department that notifies the neighborhood?

1090
01:30:52,884 --> 01:30:54,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they have a detail there also.

1091
01:30:54,565 --> 01:30:59,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, so I just wanted to make sure that as I made my phone calls,

1092
01:31:01,477 --> 01:31:04,398
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I gather, there will be more blasting down the line.

1093
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:12,740
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we can, if we could just ask the chief, making sure that the school department was notified.

1094
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:24,162
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Six Acres, with today's crazy world that we live in, that they know when they hear that type of work going on, that something's happening.

1095
01:31:24,202 --> 01:31:27,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing is the timeline, when that's going to happen.

1096
01:31:27,517 --> 01:31:33,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that some of the residents are a few senior residents that like to sleep in a little bit.

1097
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:36,121
[SPEAKER_12]: We're walking with a big boom.

1098
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:44,624
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we can just make sure that everybody again is notified with any upcoming blasting if that needs to occur.

1099
01:31:45,044 --> 01:31:45,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1100
01:31:45,604 --> 01:31:45,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1101
01:31:47,665 --> 01:31:48,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1102
01:31:48,566 --> 01:31:54,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I just would like to amend the paper to request that the notice be given no less than 48 hours in advance.

1111
01:32:25,528 --> 01:32:26,288

1115
01:32:42,656 --> 01:32:45,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, this is a rather self-explanatory resolution.

1116
01:32:45,618 --> 01:32:54,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to ask my council colleagues to join me in wishing former Mayor McGlynn and his wife, Sheila, a very happy and exciting

1117
01:32:54,897 --> 01:32:55,898
[SPEAKER_03]: 40th wedding anniversary.

1118
01:32:55,918 --> 01:33:04,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the opportunity to see Mayor McGlynn and his wife in CB Scoops over the weekend, and they seem to have started off this celebration with good fun, Mr. President.

1119
01:33:04,461 --> 01:33:06,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the resolution.

1120
01:33:08,703 --> 01:33:09,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1121
01:33:10,904 --> 01:33:14,025
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1131
01:33:40,112 --> 01:33:43,815

1132
01:33:45,437 --> 01:33:49,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we said before, you know, he's very involved in the troop.

1133
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:54,264
[SPEAKER_10]: A troop that produced many Eagle Scouts.

1134
01:33:54,864 --> 01:34:04,813
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember going on camping with my son in the troop, and he was very involved with the youth down in that Troop 416.

1135
01:34:05,353 --> 01:34:07,335
[SPEAKER_10]: He did a great job, and he will be missed.

1136
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1137
01:34:08,216 --> 01:34:09,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like a moment of silence?

1138
01:34:09,337 --> 01:34:09,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

1139
01:34:09,717 --> 01:34:12,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

1140
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:38,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Vice President Marks, be it resolved that the potholes on Parris Street on the Felsway end, along with the corner of Commercial and Riverside Ave, be filled in the interest of public safety.

1141
01:34:39,207 --> 01:34:40,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks.

1142
01:34:40,788 --> 01:34:41,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1143
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:50,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a few potholes, if we could send that to our DPW Highway Department to have them repaired immediately in the interest of public safety.

1144
01:34:51,158 --> 01:34:55,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1145
01:34:55,722 --> 01:34:56,382
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1146
01:34:57,323 --> 01:34:58,243

1147
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:11,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the city engineer report back to the city council on when the portion of 4th Street from Riverside Avenue into Felsway be repaved.

01:35:12,354 --> 01:35:13,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

1149
01:35:14,296 --> 01:35:15,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1150
01:35:16,057 --> 01:35:18,419
[SPEAKER_14]: This portion of 4th Street, if anyone's familiar,

1151
01:35:18,938 --> 01:35:21,039
[SPEAKER_14]: has been under construction for almost two years.

1152
01:35:22,099 --> 01:35:28,202
[SPEAKER_14]: It's directly behind the Sunoco from Riverside, and it leads to the Felsway.

1153
01:35:28,942 --> 01:35:37,286
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have done gas utility work there back, and I believe it was finished in October, November of last year.

1154
01:35:37,906 --> 01:35:41,768
[SPEAKER_14]: A small portion behind the Sunoco station was repaved,

1155
01:35:42,419 --> 01:35:47,360
[SPEAKER_14]: And the rest of the street that was dug up is still gullies and potholes, Mr. President.

1156
01:35:48,120 --> 01:36:07,504
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would ask that the city engineer report back to us immediately on the status of the street, when it's going to be repaved curb to curb, and why is it taking so long, Mr. President, on a stretch of road that may be 100 yards, 250 yards, why is it taking so long, Mr. President, to put that

1157
01:36:12,826 --> 01:36:14,927
[SPEAKER_14]: back to the condition it was originally found.

1158
01:36:15,287 --> 01:36:16,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1159
01:36:16,828 --> 01:36:17,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1160
01:36:18,069 --> 01:36:20,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for putting this resolution on.

1161
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:26,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to ask this matter be added to next week's agenda as well when we request that the city engineer come prepared to discuss this matter.

1162
01:36:27,733 --> 01:36:28,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1163
01:36:28,414 --> 01:36:34,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councilor, if I could amend that to also repair the sidewalks that were damaged during that work also.

1164
01:36:39,459 --> 01:36:41,380
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Vice President Marks.

1165
01:36:42,279 --> 01:36:47,041
[SPEAKER_06]: as amended by Councilor Knight and President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1166
01:36:47,261 --> 01:36:47,961
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1167
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:50,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1168
01:36:51,003 --> 01:36:57,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the sidewalk in front of 39 Stearns Avenue be replaced.

1169
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:02,207
[SPEAKER_06]: The sidewalk was dug up for utility work and never replaced.

1170
01:37:02,747 --> 01:37:03,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

1171
01:37:04,288 --> 01:37:05,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1172
01:37:05,428 --> 01:37:09,650
[SPEAKER_14]: The sidewalk in front of 39 Stearns Avenue had utility work some time back

1173
01:37:10,445 --> 01:37:22,131
[SPEAKER_14]: For whatever reason, the utility company left after the work was completed and the sidewalk was never restored, Mr. President, which creates a slip and fall hazard in that particular area.

1174
01:37:22,452 --> 01:37:30,016
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask that the sidewalk in front of 39 Stearns Ave be replaced immediately, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

1175
01:37:30,296 --> 01:37:30,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1176
01:37:32,057 --> 01:37:32,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1177
01:37:32,857 --> 01:37:36,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I'd like to thank Councilor Marksx for putting this resolution

1178
01:37:36,629 --> 01:37:37,650
[SPEAKER_03]: on the agenda this evening.

1179
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:43,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd request that this matter be added to next week's agenda with the city engineer, and we'd request that the city engineer be prepared to discuss it next week as well.

1180
01:37:44,113 --> 01:37:44,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1181
01:37:45,154 --> 01:37:50,537
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Vice President Marks as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1182
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:51,298
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1183
01:37:51,718 --> 01:37:51,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1184
01:37:52,358 --> 01:37:53,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1185
01:37:56,481 --> 01:38:03,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Vice President Marks be it resolved that the debris from the catch basin located at the corner of 2nd and Middlesex Avenue

1186
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,911
[SPEAKER_06]: be removed in the interest of public safety.

1187
01:38:07,551 --> 01:38:08,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

1188
01:38:09,112 --> 01:38:10,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1189
01:38:10,232 --> 01:38:16,975
[SPEAKER_14]: The state was out within the last several weeks cleaning the catch basins on state roads.

1190
01:38:17,776 --> 01:38:30,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the corner of Middlesex and Second Street, they cleaned out the catch basin, threw it on the sidewalk, the dirt and debris, and never picked up the dirt and debris.

1191
01:38:30,421 --> 01:38:31,421
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's sitting out there.

1192
01:38:31,821 --> 01:38:33,582
[SPEAKER_14]: It smells awful, Mr. President.

1193
01:38:33,978 --> 01:38:34,858
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks awful.

1194
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:38,640
[SPEAKER_14]: And I put in a request to our state delegation.

1195
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:40,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully they'll attend to it.

1196
01:38:41,101 --> 01:38:51,184
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, Mr. President, I realize it's on a state road, but it's still a road that has residents, taxpaying residents of this community.

1197
01:38:51,564 --> 01:39:01,988
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask that our DPW go out there, Mr. President, and clean up whatever was left behind by this particular contractor in the interest of public safety.

1198
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:05,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Connor 2nd Street and Middlesex Ave.

1199
01:39:05,452 --> 01:39:06,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1200
01:39:07,774 --> 01:39:11,516
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1201
01:39:12,416 --> 01:39:13,157
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1202
01:39:14,137 --> 01:39:15,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1203
01:39:20,561 --> 01:39:22,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have anything else.

1204
01:39:23,923 --> 01:39:24,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lococo.

1205
01:39:25,143 --> 01:39:27,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is something the council voted on a few weeks ago.

1206
01:39:27,985 --> 01:39:28,285
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a

1207
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:39,144
[SPEAKER_08]: response on 17383, where we asked for council litigation monies.

1208
01:39:39,964 --> 01:39:48,166
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor responded, the council legislative budget currently has approximately 4,300 available funds and other expense accounts that could be used for legal fees.

1209
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:58,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to move that we take a vote to transfer these funds into, obviously, that account.

1210
01:40:01,238 --> 01:40:02,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, that's all she's going to give us right now, so.

1211
01:40:03,681 --> 01:40:04,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1212
01:40:04,982 --> 01:40:05,542
[SPEAKER_06]: All set, thank you.

1213
01:40:06,183 --> 01:40:08,045
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion by Council Member O'Brien.

1214
01:40:08,065 --> 01:40:12,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that should be okay to get us through the next several months because the motion is pending.

1215
01:40:25,757 --> 01:40:31,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Ordinary expense stuff is going to be, you know, you don't have anything for your budgets, you know, just to let you know.

1216
01:40:33,363 --> 01:40:33,903
Okay.

1217
01:40:34,804 --> 01:40:36,025
[SPEAKER_03]: One information, Councilor Knight.

1218
01:40:36,385 --> 01:40:46,493
[SPEAKER_03]: What impact would this have on the ability to meet our requirements and posting in the newspapers, so on and so forth, if we exhaust our ordinary expense account?

1219
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,140
[SPEAKER_02]: As required by the law.

1220
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,401
[SPEAKER_02]: The advertising budget comes out of the clerk's budget.

1221
01:40:54,401 --> 01:41:02,802
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is, is that all your meeting expenses that you're going to have for budgets and stuff like that, you won't have any funds available for that.

1222
01:41:02,822 --> 01:41:10,284
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't have any supplies coming up, which is all this paper that you came up with.

1223
01:41:10,344 --> 01:41:10,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Letterhead.

1224
01:41:10,964 --> 01:41:11,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Business guides.

1225
01:41:11,584 --> 01:41:12,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's what it is.

1226
01:41:12,384 --> 01:41:14,925
[SPEAKER_15]: A few million dollars for free cash.

1227
01:41:15,905 --> 01:41:16,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's free.

1228
01:41:19,005 --> 01:41:20,226
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1229
01:41:20,246 --> 01:41:30,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we should hold off on the vote and we should ask, let the mayor know that we need some of that money come budget time and obviously our ordinary expenses are used for that.

1230
01:41:31,609 --> 01:41:36,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And see if we can get some money just to hold us over for six months because discovery.

1231
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:44,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I did speak to the mayor and I think she was going to give us enough money to hold us over until the budget time.

1232
01:41:46,004 --> 01:41:48,066
[SPEAKER_08]: What's she considering at this though, I think.

1233
01:41:48,246 --> 01:41:48,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1234
01:41:48,486 --> 01:41:53,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, again, and then we'll revisit, uh, and that'll be in the next budget.

1235
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:55,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1236
01:41:56,472 --> 01:42:02,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, normally, normally when our budget debates start, the first item that we discuss is the legislative budget.

1237
01:42:02,456 --> 01:42:03,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to get our budget books.

1238
01:42:03,597 --> 01:42:06,218
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, hopefully by Tuesday for next week's meeting.

1239
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:06,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1240
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:07,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so.

1241
01:42:08,942 --> 01:42:16,429
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe we can set up the meeting for the legislative portion of the budget ASAP because once that's submitted to us, that's the budget.

1242
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:22,575
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get that wrapped up and potentially maybe get an increase in funds there if it's not already included there in.

1243
01:42:23,276 --> 01:42:24,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to hold that till?

1244
01:42:24,678 --> 01:42:24,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1245
01:42:24,978 --> 01:42:29,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I could, while we're discussing the budget, we're going to plan on doing like a pulse.

1246
01:42:30,738 --> 01:42:30,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1247
01:42:31,318 --> 01:42:34,179
[SPEAKER_08]: But on that, are we going to plan on just for scheduling purposes?

1248
01:42:34,219 --> 01:42:35,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to be thinking the week of the 12th?

1249
01:42:35,799 --> 01:42:42,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, after the meeting, if we could talk about it before we, before we go home this evening, if we could just stay a second and we can talk about that.

1250
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:42,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

1251
01:42:43,901 --> 01:42:44,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1252
01:42:44,161 --> 01:42:45,881
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1253
01:42:47,221 --> 01:42:47,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott.

1254
01:42:48,602 --> 01:42:59,404
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can, before we go to the records, if my council members can indulge me and know that there's a couple of, um, um, announcements, uh, multi-use path project, there'll be a meeting.

1255
01:43:00,107 --> 01:43:03,508
[SPEAKER_12]: on Thursday, June 8th, 7 to 8.30 at the Andrews Middle School.

1256
01:43:04,108 --> 01:43:08,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that that's been a very interesting topic all over our community.

1257
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:25,015
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a connector for, this is so the meetings of DCI will present and obtain feedback on concept design alternatives to this clipper ship connector, a proposed multi-use pathway to be located along the north bank of the Mystic River, downstream of Method Square.

1258
01:43:25,655 --> 01:43:27,196
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a very important meeting.

1259
01:43:27,216 --> 01:43:28,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to give everybody

1260
01:43:28,818 --> 01:43:34,659
[SPEAKER_12]: a little extra time to make sure they're involved in such a important meeting.

1261
01:43:34,999 --> 01:43:42,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that the residents of Ship Ave were very concerned about being notified for these meetings.

1262
01:43:42,141 --> 01:43:43,721
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's very important that they hear it.

1263
01:43:45,362 --> 01:43:51,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, talking to the residents, one of the biggest issues, the path being so close to their

1264
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,521
[SPEAKER_12]: their decks and backyards.

1265
01:43:53,921 --> 01:44:06,146
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to make sure that the DCR, one of their proposals might be a path moved all the way to the water.

1266
01:44:06,246 --> 01:44:10,108
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's actually over the Mystic.

1267
01:44:10,148 --> 01:44:18,451
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's something they've done down the line, down the road near Assembly Row, and it's a really nice addition.

1268
01:44:19,272 --> 01:44:20,232
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that might give

1269
01:44:20,676 --> 01:44:26,339
[SPEAKER_12]: the residents that freedom and that they were asking for, for privacy.

1270
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:30,682
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's one, that I wanted to make sure.

1271
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:44,249
[SPEAKER_12]: The other, I know that my, a few months back, former president Dello Russo pointed me to the mayor for the recreation commission, recreation focus group.

1272
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm proud to say that the pilot program is,

1273
01:44:49,753 --> 01:45:14,845
[SPEAKER_12]: out and for print and online for all of our residents to now sign up for summer recreation programs, which have sports and arts and adventures in space programs, Lego programs, and detailed times where now the city administration has changed where we can purchase our pool and pond passes.

1274
01:45:15,706 --> 01:45:18,147
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's more accessible for our constituents.

1275
01:45:19,092 --> 01:45:20,773
[SPEAKER_12]: and so on and so forth.

1276
01:45:20,813 --> 01:45:23,214
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a lot of detail and work that was done.

1277
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:34,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that, you know, special thanks to Joe Russo, Allie Fist from the mayor's office did a great job for all the countless meetings for the last eight months.

1278
01:45:34,379 --> 01:45:44,163
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Julia Damon and Rachel Perry who have been instrumental getting these programs in place so our residents can now register.

1279
01:45:45,962 --> 01:45:52,287
[SPEAKER_12]: We will be having meetings soon and discussion for a full-time program that the mail will present to us.

1280
01:45:53,628 --> 01:45:58,512
[SPEAKER_12]: We're now meeting talking about job descriptions and mission statements.

1281
01:45:58,552 --> 01:46:00,133
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's pretty exciting.

1282
01:46:00,313 --> 01:46:08,479
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that we heard our constituents cry out and say that they really needed and wanted it.

1283
01:46:08,679 --> 01:46:12,182
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm glad to say that it's happening and it's right in front of us.

1284
01:46:12,222 --> 01:46:14,744
[SPEAKER_12]: So please start registering for your programs.

1285
01:46:15,593 --> 01:46:21,035
[SPEAKER_12]: and send any questions or concerns our way so we can move things forward.

1286
01:46:21,235 --> 01:46:21,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1287
01:46:21,896 --> 01:46:23,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for all your hard work on that.

1288
01:46:23,637 --> 01:46:24,857
[SPEAKER_03]: You did an outstanding job.

1289
01:46:25,797 --> 01:46:26,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1290
01:46:26,718 --> 01:46:27,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1291
01:46:28,038 --> 01:46:30,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank my colleagues for indulging me this evening as well.

1292
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:38,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Medford in the Office of Outreach and Substance Abuse Preventage, Mr. President, has done a great job over the past year.

1293
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:43,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Just last year, we funded their office, and since that time, they've made great strides.

1294
01:46:44,303 --> 01:46:50,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Just last year in the city of Medford, there were 19 opiate-related overdose deaths in 02155, Mr. President.

1295
01:46:50,787 --> 01:47:02,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And through the work of Penny Funny Alley, our outreach coordinator, and through the work of Paul Spencer, one of the citizens in the city of Medford who's been helping out with her office, they're doing what's called hidden in plain sight, Mr. President.

1296
01:47:02,134 --> 01:47:03,775
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a training for parents.

1297
01:47:04,873 --> 01:47:09,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And right next door to the council chambers, actually, we have what's set up, looks like a high school kid's bedroom.

1298
01:47:09,875 --> 01:47:16,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And they teach you what to look for and where to look for illicit substances in your home if you feel as though your child may be experimenting or abusing drugs.

1299
01:47:17,377 --> 01:47:22,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to let everyone out there know that this program will be running through the end of the week.

1300
01:47:22,578 --> 01:47:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anyone would like to set up an appointment that they can give the substance abuse office a call at 393-2408.

1301
01:47:28,568 --> 01:47:32,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll be happy to speak with you and let you know when they're going to be meeting down there.

1302
01:47:32,171 --> 01:47:38,656
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this is a great step and a great stride, Mr. President, in helping parents identify and cope with the issue of addiction in the community.

1303
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:43,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've done an excellent job in breaking the stigma that's associated with addiction here in Medford.

1304
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:49,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to thank them for their work and really appreciate what they've done and how they're going about doing it.

1305
01:47:49,564 --> 01:47:52,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you to Penny and Paul and the rest of Team Medford.

1306
01:47:52,653 --> 01:47:55,234
[SPEAKER_03]: But this hidden in plain sights, it's really something else.

1307
01:47:55,254 --> 01:47:56,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in there earlier this evening.

1308
01:47:56,355 --> 01:47:58,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was too, and I... Councilor Marks was in there.

1309
01:47:58,836 --> 01:47:59,496
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at it.

1310
01:47:59,536 --> 01:48:01,157
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a very good, very, very good job.

1311
01:48:02,097 --> 01:48:02,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1312
01:48:02,437 --> 01:48:02,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1313
01:48:03,338 --> 01:48:03,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Meetings.

1314
01:48:05,419 --> 01:48:06,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

1315
01:48:06,419 --> 01:48:09,861
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may really quick, just one more announcement.

1316
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:15,703
[SPEAKER_10]: This Saturday night, June 3rd, at the Chevalier Theater is the Medford High School Band fundraiser.

1317
01:48:17,644 --> 01:48:20,125
[SPEAKER_10]: The theme is A Night on Broadway.

1318
01:48:22,292 --> 01:48:23,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Tickets are pretty inexpensive.

1319
01:48:23,832 --> 01:48:26,053
[SPEAKER_10]: They're $15 for an adult, $10 for a student.

1320
01:48:26,513 --> 01:48:28,053
[SPEAKER_10]: But all the money goes to the high school band.

1321
01:48:28,093 --> 01:48:31,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe they have a competition maybe coming up in Florida.

1322
01:48:31,394 --> 01:48:32,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think they're trying to raise funds.

1323
01:48:32,634 --> 01:48:35,995
[SPEAKER_10]: So if anyone can make it, that'd be greatly appreciated.

1324
01:48:36,575 --> 01:48:38,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure it'll be a great show.

1325
01:48:38,495 --> 01:48:39,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

1326
01:48:40,216 --> 01:48:41,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1327
01:48:41,476 --> 01:48:42,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

1328
01:48:43,096 --> 01:48:48,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Mr. President, this Thursday evening is senior prom night at Medford High School.

1329
01:48:49,297 --> 01:48:51,958
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to wish all our seniors a safe

1330
01:48:52,993 --> 01:48:54,755
[SPEAKER_14]: an enjoyable prom night, Mr. President.

1331
01:48:55,035 --> 01:48:56,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1332
01:48:57,156 --> 01:48:58,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lockhart?

1333
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:01,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunday is Medford Day, behind, I believe, the Andrews.

1334
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,540
[SPEAKER_08]: One to four.

1335
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:03,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's invited.

1336
01:49:03,681 --> 01:49:05,082
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a great time last year.

1337
01:49:05,322 --> 01:49:06,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Hundreds of people.

1338
01:49:06,563 --> 01:49:08,364
[SPEAKER_08]: A number of different events for the whole family.

1339
01:49:08,664 --> 01:49:10,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hopefully people will join us.

1340
01:49:10,406 --> 01:49:11,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1341
01:49:11,446 --> 01:49:12,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else?

1342
01:49:12,707 --> 01:49:13,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Any more public service?

1343
01:49:15,529 --> 01:49:17,431
[SPEAKER_06]: The record is we're past the Council at night.

1344
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:19,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1345
01:49:19,372 --> 01:49:21,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight finds the records in order, Mr. President.

1346
01:49:21,741 --> 01:49:22,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Move for approval thereof.

1347
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:27,121
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight for adjournment.

1348
01:49:27,181 --> 01:49:27,964
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1349
01:49:29,831 --> 01:49:29,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1350
01:49:30,634 --> 01:49:31,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.
