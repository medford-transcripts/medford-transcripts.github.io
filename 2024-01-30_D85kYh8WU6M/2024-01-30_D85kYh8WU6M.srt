[SPEAKER_13]: First up is our superintendent giving updates and comments, Dr. Reese Edward Vincent.

47
00:04:59,112 --> 00:04:59,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

48
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:07,980
[SPEAKER_12]: After a rainy weekend, we're back for another week of school, the storm that wasn't last night.

49
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to our building and ground staff for diligently monitoring the forecast for snow this weekend.

50
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:25,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure that some of us are grateful that this weekend did not bring a major snowstorm in the end, and others truly are disappointed that today was not a snow day.

51
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:30,348
[SPEAKER_12]: I can reassure all of you that there are many weeks of winter remaining,

52
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,394
[SPEAKER_12]: and that I'm sure there will still be more opportunities for a possible snow day in the coming months.

53
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:44,938
[SPEAKER_12]: This evening, I'd like to extend a special congratulations to Dr. Vilma Bobo.

54
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations to Dr. Bobo.

55
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:51,802
[SPEAKER_12]: She is Medford's Coordinator of World Language.

56
00:05:54,504 --> 00:06:00,648
[SPEAKER_12]: She was elected as the 50th President of the Massachusetts Foreign Language Association.

57
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:18,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Bobo began her term this month as the 2024 President of MAFLA, M-A-F-L-A, a statewide professional association of world language teachers.

58
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:31,024
[SPEAKER_12]: MAFLA was founded in 1967 with a mission to empower language educators through advocacy, learning, and support of world-class language instruction.

59
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:43,884
[SPEAKER_12]: The organization's work is focused on professional development for world language educators and advocacy for language education opportunities for Massachusetts students.

60
00:06:45,677 --> 00:07:01,345
[SPEAKER_12]: The entire Medford School community should be very proud that world language educators throughout our state trust Dr. Brabeau to lead their collective efforts to prepare students for global citizenship.

61
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:04,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Once again, congratulations, Dr. Brabeau.

62
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:17,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Also another important highlight that I'd like to share this evening, which is a free opportunity for all of our students, is the crash prevention training for student drivers.

63
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:29,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Hands-on crash prevention training is available for free to all Medford High School students with a learner's permit or driver's license.

64
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:43,754
[SPEAKER_12]: In Control Crash Prevention has partnered for years with Medford High School and the Medford Police to offer driver safety and crash prevention training to novice drivers.

65
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:52,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Graduates have a much lower chance of crashing and qualify for auto insurance discounts, up to 10%.

66
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:57,404
[SPEAKER_12]: More information is available on our website.

67
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:01,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I also wanna highlight kindergarten registration.

68
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:18,770
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you know a caregiver of a child who will be starting kindergarten next year, please let them know they are invited to attend one of our two remaining informational sessions to learn about our kindergarten program here in Medford.

69
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:23,392
[SPEAKER_12]: They have the opportunity to ask questions directly.

70
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:28,483
[SPEAKER_12]: On Tuesday, February 27th, that will be a Zoom session.

71
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:34,225
[SPEAKER_12]: And our next in-person session will be on March, Thursday, March 28th.

72
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Both sessions will take place at 6.30 p.m.

73
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:48,649
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to thank the 60 plus families who attended our first informational session at Medford High School about a week, last week.

74
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:55,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Childcare and interpretation services are available at these meetings.

75
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:59,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to highlight this week, today was day one.

76
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:14,527
[SPEAKER_12]: DESE, our Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is in Medford, and they are conducting their triennial special education and civil rights tiered focus monitoring review.

77
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:23,896
[SPEAKER_12]: It started today, and this special review that DESE is conducting is reviewing all of Medford public schools.

78
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:38,199
[SPEAKER_12]: DESE visits each public school in Massachusetts every three years to monitor compliance with federal and state special education and civil rights regulations.

79
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,780
[SPEAKER_12]: So all districts are visited, and this is our turn.

80
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,381
[SPEAKER_12]: They're here today, tomorrow, and Wednesday.

81
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:55,881
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank all of our special educators, our special education faculty and staff for their important work in supporting this review.

82
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:09,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Lastly, I want to bring two key dates for you to keep in mind this year, February 6 will be day 100 of school or 100 day of school barring that there are no snow days.

83
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:18,069
[SPEAKER_12]: So as of right now February 6 will be a very enjoyable day for many of our youngest learners celebrating day 100.

84
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:30,041
[SPEAKER_12]: And also mark your calendars February 19 through the 23rd is our February break vacation week so there's no school during that entire week.

85
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:33,345
[SPEAKER_12]: So, at this evening school committee meeting.

86
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:42,512
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to cover a variety of topics, including a presentation from the Curtis Tufts High School, presented by Ms.

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Cushing will be providing that presentation this evening.

92
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:10,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

93
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:16,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Superintendent Edward-Vincent.

[SPEAKER_17]: We also have Miss Gates here as well, so we welcome her as well.

101
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,592
[SPEAKER_17]: So model United Nations is

103
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,112
[SPEAKER_17]: on these topics.

104
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:43,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Thus far, our students, our high school students, have attended two conferences, one at Catholic Memorial and one at St.

00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:45,079
[SPEAKER_17]: John's Preparatory School.

106
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:54,127
[SPEAKER_17]: And they've secured numerous awards, including the People's Choice Award, which apparently is extremely coveted, as well as a Best Delegate Award as well.

107
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Which Darren got, actually.

108
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:57,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.

109
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:03,753
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have the names of the students, if we could read them briefly, is that okay?

110
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:08,059
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we wanted to move just to recognize their hard work thus far, and then we'll move to the request.

111
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, you can read them.

112
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:15,481
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have about 20 or 30 students in the club.

[SPEAKER_17]: And so we hope to provide them with certificates towards the end of the year to recognize formally, but we did want to recognize their hard work thus far.

116
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,823
[SPEAKER_17]: I also, it goes without saying, want to thank

117
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:02,328

00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:07,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Gates and Mr. Brophy for all their hard work really taking this club and doing quite a bit with it this year.

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,611
[SPEAKER_17]: So based on their, so thank you.

120
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:16,713
[SPEAKER_17]: Based on their performances, they would like permission to participate in the Dartmouth College Model United Nations Conference.

121
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:27,237
[SPEAKER_17]: You do have the packet that outlies all of the details regarding the field trip, regarding the trip, which would be held April 5th to the 7th in Dartmouth, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire.

122
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:31,438
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you have any questions for us, but we are seeking your approval,

123
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,218
[SPEAKER_17]: for this out-of-state field trip.

124
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:36,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

125
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:37,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

126
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:41,746
[SPEAKER_22]: It's nice to see the form actually show up before we have to ask for it.

127
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:46,170
[SPEAKER_22]: I greatly appreciate that.

128
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:50,695
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't recall exactly the details, but I didn't see the nurse's signature yet.

129
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:55,760
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know that there's no nurse required, but I think the nurse at least has to sign off that things are good.

130
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,405
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure that'll happen.

131
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:58,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

132
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:02,828
[SPEAKER_17]: We were advised that first that we need approval of school committee, then we know who's coming.

133
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:06,411
[SPEAKER_17]: And then of course, we've already been in contact numerous times with the nurse regarding that.

134
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:06,851
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

135
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:07,551
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

136
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:11,394

[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,340
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:22,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for the presentation.

143
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:23,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Have fun.

144
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:23,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

145
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:34,520
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a number three math placement presentation presented by Ms.

146
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Faiza Khan, Director of Mathematics.

147
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:37,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

148
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:38,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

149
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:41,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for having me here.

150
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:51,775
[SPEAKER_19]: And yes, today I'm here to give an update on the continued implementation of the integrated math pathways.

151
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:58,138
[SPEAKER_19]: We will be piloting the integrated mathematics three program at the high school.

152
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:08,263
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm also here to talk about pushing the acceleration that happens at the end of the sixth grade to now be happening

153
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:10,924
[SPEAKER_19]: at the end of the seventh grade.

154
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:17,186
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's slide one and two that I just mentioned.

155
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:22,048
[SPEAKER_19]: Once again, there are two purposes to this presentation.

156
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:30,471
[SPEAKER_19]: First is that the placement exam that usually takes place at the end of sixth grade will now be taking place at the end of the seventh grade.

157
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:37,013
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll be going in much details as to why that seems to be a better route for

158
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,256
[SPEAKER_19]: the math department and for the students in Medford.

159
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:45,581
[SPEAKER_19]: And the second objective is that I'll give you an update on how integration is going.

160
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,823
[SPEAKER_19]: We used to have the traditional pathway.

161
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:53,928
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we have started going down the path of integrated math instead.

162
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,972
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that leads us to slide three.

163
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:10,100
[SPEAKER_19]: So the current landscape at the secondary level, which starts at sixth grade, we know that both our schools have two math teachers at each grade level.

164
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,663
[SPEAKER_19]: So that makes a total of 12 mathematics teachers.

165
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,665
[SPEAKER_19]: At the sixth grade level, students learn only six

166
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:23,248
[SPEAKER_19]: grade math standards.

167
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:42,582
[SPEAKER_19]: But when we do the acceleration decisions at the end of sixth grade, many factors, we look at many of them, and then one of them is the end of the year placement exam that's conducted right about end of May, beginning of June.

168
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:56,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Once that exam is done and the teachers have looked at the overall pictures, students are placed in accelerated or the standard sections.

169
00:17:57,612 --> 00:18:10,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Parent wishes are always honored and we recommend as to where the student shall be, but at the end, we always honor the parent wishes and the students are placed in the desired section.

170
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:17,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of the requests come for the student to be in the accelerated or advanced course.

171
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:26,730
[SPEAKER_19]: There are three sections of grade level math and one section of accelerated advanced math in grades seven and eight.

172
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,611
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, there is no acceleration at the sixth grade level.

173
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:38,737
[SPEAKER_19]: So all teachers teach the same and students get the same illustrative mathematics curriculum as per DESE standards.

174
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:49,544
[SPEAKER_19]: The last bullet says that the 7th and 8th grade accelerated slash advanced math sections each cover a year and a half worth of math content.

175
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that's the content that's given to us by DESE.

176
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:59,212
[SPEAKER_19]: We follow their math standards being a public school and when we

177
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:10,380
[SPEAKER_19]: teach students in the two accelerated sections of seventh grade and subsequently in eighth grade, the students can take geometry in their freshman year.

178
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:14,583
[SPEAKER_19]: We move on to the next slide.

179
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:18,026
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is slide number five.

180
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:24,932
[SPEAKER_19]: We discussed the impact of the current math acceleration on student learning at MHS.

181
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:29,394
[SPEAKER_19]: So Desi calls it the race to calculus.

182
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:31,017
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what I will call it.

183
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:36,205
[SPEAKER_19]: The race to calculus mindset prioritizes quantity.

184
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:38,847
[SPEAKER_19]: over quality.

185
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:51,471
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we mean by that is that we have to teach students a year and a half of math standards in seventh grade, which is seventh grade standards plus half of eighth grade standards.

186
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:59,714
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when students go to eighth grade, they have to learn the rest of the half of eighth grade standards plus all of algebra one.

187
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:17,985
[SPEAKER_19]: When that happens, performance on the procedural 6th grade math standards has continued to become an integral determining factor for students' ability to learn conceptual math in a fast-paced and rigorous 7th and 8th grade

188
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:19,367
[SPEAKER_19]: environment.

189
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:25,817
[SPEAKER_19]: So what happens is that the sixth grade standards are very procedural in mathematics, there's no denying it.

190
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:34,350
[SPEAKER_19]: So when students are learning a year and a half of seventh slash eighth grade, and then eighth grade slash algebra one,

191
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:48,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Many times students are not ready for the reasons we have mentioned before and for the main reason that we are testing them on procedural concepts and placing them in the accelerated section.

192
00:20:49,497 --> 00:21:06,185
[SPEAKER_19]: So due to this structure, and then the structure at the high school, several AP calculus and calculus honors students exhibit widening gaps in their mathematical foundations, and it impacts their class assessments and college board exam results.

193
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:34,813
[SPEAKER_19]: We see on our next slide that the demographic enrollment data at the high school also provides an opportunity to have, you know, for us to be able to provide them equitable access to accelerated courses if we push seventh grade, if we push the acceleration to the end of seventh grade, and if we follow the integrated pathway rather than the traditional pathway.

194
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:47,978
[SPEAKER_19]: So the next slide is when you look at the demographics from the school year 2022-2023 and school year 2023-2024.

195
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:56,321
[SPEAKER_19]: We see that we have seen a small shift, but we would like to open it up to more of our students.

196
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:01,247
[SPEAKER_19]: And how do we do that?

197
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:13,875
[SPEAKER_19]: And even before how we get to it, we look at how advanced placement calculus AB plays out in colleges for the acceptance.

198
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:15,657
[SPEAKER_19]: That slide says it all.

199
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:24,683
[SPEAKER_19]: When a student gets a score of five on the college board exam, number of colleges accepting the five AP scores only

200
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:36,775
[SPEAKER_19]: are 22, those are the Ivy Leagues, those are the colleges that some students strive to go to, and they get a five and they make it there.

201
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:39,837
[SPEAKER_19]: And their scores are accepted.

202
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:46,642
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we see how many colleges accept four or more AP scores, and we go down that list.

203
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:55,653
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we see that only one college, or rather three colleges accept a score of one only on the college board exam.

204
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:22,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide takes us into what is the impact of the middle school placement exam on our students' learning, actual learning, not just rushing through and covering the standards so that teaching is not just, its concepts are not just being taught, they're also being learned.

205
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:40,037
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we are proposing is that the acceleration be pushed by one more year and the placement exam takes place at the end of seventh grade and the students can go into eighth grade math and eighth grade math accelerated.

206
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:49,921
[SPEAKER_19]: And what that'll do is that that'll give the teachers an opportunity to challenge the students without having to cover all of algebra one.

207
00:23:50,521 --> 00:24:01,936
[SPEAKER_19]: in eighth grade and they will get a solid pre algebra foundation in seventh grade because that's where conceptual understanding and teaching of concepts actually starts is the

208
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:03,576
[SPEAKER_19]: is in seventh grade.

209
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:07,941
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on, here is some input from the middle school teachers.

210
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:23,577
[SPEAKER_19]: These are our own teachers that they are saying that the best way to go is that students get a solid seventh grade foundation before they go the accelerated path.

211
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:36,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on to the integrated pathways, because one thing impacts the other, it's like a chain reaction kind of thing.

212
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:54,731
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have on our slide 12, you see the way DESE, Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and the Department of Higher Education, how they have proposed the courses, the sequence to go.

213
00:24:55,271 --> 00:25:00,655
[SPEAKER_19]: So they say pre-K through eight, there should be not any acceleration.

214
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:11,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Acceleration should happen at the high school, either through the traditional pathway or through the integrated path that students can take.

215
00:25:11,383 --> 00:25:14,105
[SPEAKER_19]: That will open up their fourth year

216
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:25,775
[SPEAKER_19]: to be able to take calculus AP or calculus honors, pre-calculus, quantitative reasoning, and statistics, either standard or AP.

217
00:25:26,355 --> 00:25:34,282
[SPEAKER_19]: And then students, when they go to the post-secondary courses, they have a much more solid foundation.

218
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:47,810
[SPEAKER_19]: On the next slide, number 13, we see the difference between the traditional pathway, which we used to have and now we are slowly weaning away from, and the integrated pathway.

219
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, the end result is the same.

220
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:53,152
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just that the integrated pathway

221
00:25:54,733 --> 00:26:07,861
[SPEAKER_19]: covers the concepts in an integral way, as in students will learn geometry and algebra in integrated math one and in integrated math two, and to a degree also in integrated math three.

222
00:26:10,522 --> 00:26:14,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide is directly, again, from the pathways.

223
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:34,491
[SPEAKER_19]: curriculum that Desi has given us, and this is how they have envisioned mathematical rigor to happen, is that it's basically a byproduct of the three pieces that you see around it.

224
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:50,424
[SPEAKER_19]: So many times we are asked why we have been shifting away from the traditional pathways of teaching algebra, geometry and algebra two as standalone courses and why are we shifting towards integrated one, two and three.

225
00:26:51,224 --> 00:26:55,688
[SPEAKER_19]: The biggest advantage that the teachers are seeing is that they constantly

226
00:26:56,228 --> 00:27:00,509
[SPEAKER_19]: do not have to review right before they teach a concept.

227
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:10,232
[SPEAKER_19]: It's being interwoven, it's spiraling, and that review kind of happens as part of teaching the previous concept.

228
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:15,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Another thing that we have noticed is that it's very task-oriented.

229
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:19,235
[SPEAKER_19]: It has become task-oriented versus just procedural.

230
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:22,996
[SPEAKER_19]: You master the algorithm and you'll go and move on.

231
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:43,750
[SPEAKER_19]: Another thing is that students have been developing strong problem solving skills and reasoning skills because they have to make a decision as to if they will use one kind of form to solve the problem or another kind of form.

232
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:50,757
[SPEAKER_19]: So far, it seems that NCTM has been backing it up.

233
00:27:50,897 --> 00:28:04,270
[SPEAKER_19]: NCTM is the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and they are claiming that they have seen better results in the classroom and district and state when it comes to the assessments.

234
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do we adjust?

235
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:11,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are we adjusting Medford High School math pathways?

236
00:28:12,368 --> 00:28:14,409
[SPEAKER_19]: It's because we wanna open it up.

237
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:19,351
[SPEAKER_19]: We wanna open up our highest level courses to a lot more students.

238
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:35,818
[SPEAKER_19]: And we don't wanna, you know, box students in that if you did not take, if you did not get on the accelerated pathway at the end of sixth grade, which is too early for many students to make a decision that now you are

239
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:42,466
[SPEAKER_19]: going to be in the standard pathway for the rest of the high school math career.

240
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:50,876
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is a high school teacher's input on slide 16.

241
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,300
[SPEAKER_19]: And moving on.

242
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,703
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the flowchart that we currently have.

243
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:13,213
[SPEAKER_19]: When you look at it, you see that there is geometry being honored, being offered at the ninth grade level, and we have algebra two.

244
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:24,640
[SPEAKER_19]: There was no algebra one that was being offered this year because we are, as I said, we are on our trajectory of adopting integrated math

245
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:27,281
[SPEAKER_19]: to the fullest.

246
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:44,585
[SPEAKER_19]: When we go to slide 18, the difference between slide 17, which is what we are currently offering, to slide 18, which we will be offering in this coming year, is that there will be no geometry at the ninth grade level.

247
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:51,126
[SPEAKER_19]: All students, whether they are coming from the accelerated pathway, accelerated eighth grade,

248
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:58,750
[SPEAKER_19]: or standard eighth grade will be taking integrated math one honors or CP.

249
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:17,019
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll go down that path and the teachers of the honors path will be infusing the standards that are necessary for students to be able to take calculus.

250
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:21,121
[SPEAKER_19]: AP and calculus honors in their fourth year.

251
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:28,628
[SPEAKER_19]: What that will also help with is that students will be able to take more computer programming courses eventually.

252
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:37,116
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is also shown on the next slide, which will be the subsequent year, 25-26 on slide 18.

253
00:30:41,235 --> 00:30:45,762
[SPEAKER_19]: It will give them a selected list of courses to choose from.

254
00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:51,150
[SPEAKER_19]: All of them will be computer science courses and possibly statistics course.

255
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,072
[SPEAKER_19]: We are still in the exploration phase.

256
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:57,098
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, the mathematics department's goal has always been

257
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:19,685
[SPEAKER_19]: and we'll stay as to making more courses accessible to most of our students, if not all of our students, to ensure that we keep rigor, that we prepare our students for the rigorous courses, and to ensure that students continue to get courses like personal finance,

258
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:29,771
[SPEAKER_19]: and consumer math to be able to, you know, be equipped with real life skills.

259
00:31:30,752 --> 00:31:35,375
[SPEAKER_19]: And after slide 19 is 20, which is basically

260
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:43,118
[SPEAKER_19]: a table form of the flowchart that you saw earlier for the school year 24-25.

261
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,399
[SPEAKER_19]: And then with that, I thank you.

262
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:55,203
[SPEAKER_19]: And there is an appendix of many slides that I have presented in the past year, years, last two years.

263
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:56,783
[SPEAKER_19]: I have been coming here in January.

264
00:31:57,223 --> 00:32:04,226
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can take a look at them and I'm happy to answer any questions at this time.

265
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:07,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

266
00:32:10,118 --> 00:32:10,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld.

267
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:12,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

268
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm new to school committee, so I haven't seen the presentations other than in passing.

269
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:23,907
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a couple of questions and I'll start with the accelerated math.

270
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:24,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

271
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:35,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So my big question here is what is differentiation gonna look like in the seventh grade now that there's going to be a broader range of skills and abilities and comfort with math?

272
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:40,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And how are teachers going to be supported in meeting those wider needs without the trust?

273
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Wonderful, that's a great question.

274
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:51,225
[SPEAKER_19]: So at least two of our veterans, seventh grade teachers, have been piloting this differentiation already.

275
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:54,427
[SPEAKER_19]: I have been giving them strategies.

276
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:57,129
[SPEAKER_19]: We do a lot of observations in the department.

277
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:05,593
[SPEAKER_19]: So through that, we are able to give good suggestions and ideas of what to do.

278
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:10,256
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have a few PD courses that we, you know,

279
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,238
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, refer them to.

280
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:28,913
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the ways that teachers have been differentiating is, and that I had suggested, and I'm happy to see that it's that they have used it, they've been using it, is having a problem of the week.

281
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:33,471
[SPEAKER_19]: for the students who can handle a challenge and have it at different levels.

282
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:39,956
[SPEAKER_19]: So that when students are done, they're not just doing rote worksheet work, and I'll give you another worksheet.

283
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:44,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Or if that has to happen, then there needs to be level of problems as well.

284
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,402
[SPEAKER_19]: And students use choice work.

285
00:33:47,462 --> 00:33:55,528
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can handle a higher level problem, then there should be that accessible in the classrooms.

286
00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:00,614
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I know that our teachers are working on it.

287
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:05,620
[SPEAKER_19]: It's always going to be a work in progress, but at least that's where we have started.

288
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:05,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

289
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have the opportunity to do some of the vertical integration talking to the grade below and the grade ahead.

290
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:12,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

291
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:30,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of our department meetings, we get some time to do that, but definitely our June meeting and our beginning of the year meeting is all about it, to realign and to look at the pacing guides and to look at what one teacher is doing that's working in one classroom and to bring it to all the teachers.

292
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:31,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

293
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:38,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have questions about the integrated math, but if any of my colleagues have things on the middle school, I want to make sure we can keep that together.

294
00:34:41,837 --> 00:34:42,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

295
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:43,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I think member.

296
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:45,560
[SPEAKER_13]: So I saw you late next and then member Graham.

297
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,761
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

298
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:56,167
[SPEAKER_22]: Um I love all of this as I have since you started down this path three years ago at this point, four years.

299
00:34:56,848 --> 00:35:07,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Um and when I'm looking at the proposed 2526, one thing that's a little confusing to me is that pre calculus does not appear to be a prerequisite to calculus.

300
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,058
[SPEAKER_22]: Um and um

301
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:20,644
[SPEAKER_22]: I will admit it's been so long since I took pre-calculus or calculus that I, like, is the title pre-calculus actually just a poorly named course?

302
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:48,026
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, there are actually many views about it, but what we do notice, and in many conversations, not just with the in-district teachers, but in the other, what's happening around the district, when we talk to them and when we get together at the DESE meetings, what we hear a lot and what we know, I taught pre-calculus here, is that many of it can be infused in

303
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:49,326
[SPEAKER_19]: all levels.

304
00:35:49,366 --> 00:36:00,191
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we have done on the honors path is that we have taken that pre-calculus and a lot of it is actually a repetition of algebra 2 honors.

305
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:07,835
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are going to be teaching it as integrated math 3 honors

306
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:24,783
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, some mixed in and then some of those standards of integrated met three honors can be brought down pushed down to algebra to honors are not as a bridge to I'm sorry integrated met two honors and then subsequently some of those standards.

307
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,126
[SPEAKER_19]: can be pushed down to integrated math one honors.

308
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:35,915
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have charted this path also, although we will continue to tweak it and look at it every May and June.

309
00:36:37,176 --> 00:36:46,706
[SPEAKER_19]: But that was the that was the idea is that to take out pre calculus and see how our students do with

310
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:53,748
[SPEAKER_19]: just having those standards, a lot of those standards being part of integrated MAT 3.

311
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:54,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

312
00:36:54,828 --> 00:36:58,709
[SPEAKER_22]: I figured you had figured this out, but I just was curious.

313
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

314
00:36:59,069 --> 00:36:59,649
[SPEAKER_19]: We're trying.

315
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:00,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

316
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

317
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:02,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham.

318
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:09,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you provide us some comparable districts that have fully implemented this?

319
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:10,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

320
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:12,593
[SPEAKER_19]: Waltham

321
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,152
[SPEAKER_19]: is one of them.

322
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:17,553
[SPEAKER_19]: Cambridge has been working on it.

323
00:37:18,774 --> 00:37:23,755
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Natick was also looking into this pathway.

324
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:34,698
[SPEAKER_19]: And last year when I attended Desi's big thing on math, there were so many districts who were very interested in this.

325
00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:36,759
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think they are now

326
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:55,369
[SPEAKER_19]: getting on this, so I'll be happy to get more names, but I do know that we talked to the Waltham department head and she came and did a presentation for our committee and was able to give the way in the pros and the cons both.

327
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:58,271
[SPEAKER_19]: So that one I know is one who I followed.

328
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:00,612
[SPEAKER_19]: Arlington was also working on it.

329
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:04,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see where they are now, but they all kind of started

330
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:14,081
[SPEAKER_19]: probably a year later, but there was a lot of interest in this pathway just because algebra geometry and algebra standalone was not working out for so many districts.

331
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:14,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

332
00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:24,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, um, I think my middle school question is really about the kids that are like more than ready for the acceleration.

333
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:33,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I understand that the delay helps lots of kids, but there are kids who are more than ready for the acceleration and

334
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:49,045
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like, like my seventh grader right now, if I like did the jump the math around this, these charts, he's, he's an accelerated math this year, which is like a one and a half, one and a half, which he'll do next year.

335
00:38:49,686 --> 00:38:58,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in school year 25, 26, he'll take integrated math, which sounds like it will basically be repetition of what he learned in eighth grade.

336
00:38:58,974 --> 00:38:59,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that true?

337
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:07,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Some concepts will be, but a year and a half worth of standards whenever they are taught.

338
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:21,008
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes even to the kids who can really take the challenge, the teacher never gets a chance to go in as much depth as they possibly can.

339
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:28,494
[SPEAKER_19]: So the integrated math one honors is being taught by a veteran teacher who also teaches AP calculus.

340
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:34,439
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have been in talks with her and seems like

341
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:44,938
[SPEAKER_19]: Some students are basically yes, they are there and she is trying her level best to do the differentiation, but this is the first year.

342
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,920
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, I think as it evolves.

343
00:39:47,981 --> 00:40:00,010
[SPEAKER_19]: We will know more ways to differentiate, not just at the seventh grade level, but also at the integrated math one honors level and just this that integrated math one honors has

344
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:06,338
[SPEAKER_19]: the standards that were infused, that were brought down from integrated math too.

345
00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:10,760
[SPEAKER_19]: And that shall be able to be the new piece of it.

346
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:13,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Because, yeah.

347
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:28,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the other thing that I've noticed in my house in terms of like the value of now, both my kids having gone through this, and they're totally different, they're very different students in lots of ways, is it was the first time they had to work.

348
00:40:29,248 --> 00:40:29,389
[SPEAKER_06]: And

349
00:40:30,885 --> 00:40:39,572
[SPEAKER_06]: What that taught them was that they can't just mail it in all the time, which they frankly had been able to do for lots and lots of years.

350
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:45,838
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was conditioning for them to make a pretty seamless transition to the high school.

351
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:54,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my ninth grader sort of learned about rigor in a way largely because of this accelerated class.

352
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:56,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't as easy for her.

353
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,682
[SPEAKER_06]: She had to figure out how to like work through it.

354
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,182
[SPEAKER_06]: She had to figure out how to advocate for herself and ask for help.

355
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:03,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And the coursework was more intensive.

356
00:41:03,723 --> 00:41:11,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it is in part why she's made a pretty seamless transition to the high school where the work is more intense.

357
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:22,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I love the idea of differentiation and I just also know how very hard it is to execute that in a classroom with

358
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:25,189
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 different kids who are doing lots of different things.

359
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:28,050
[SPEAKER_06]: So I love this concept.

360
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:38,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't want people to hear about it and think their kid is no longer going to be challenged because we're slowing this down.

361
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:44,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's lots of parents who went through algebra one and then geometry and then calculus, right?

362
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:47,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they went through that path that hear this and think that's not how I did it.

363
00:41:49,438 --> 00:42:03,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I am supportive of all of this, but I think the district needs to do a really crisp job of communicating to parents like why this is better for their students wherever their student might be in their like learning progression in math.

364
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:13,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I could I could see and I have heard from lots of parents who say like I'm not interested in that I want my kid to be able to like be challenged in math and.

365
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:18,044
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of the flip side of that is they're not going to be in this model.

366
00:42:18,064 --> 00:42:31,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think that's necessarily true, but I think the district really has to be clear about how that happens so that parents can rethink about math in a way that they've not had to do.

367
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:34,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And because this is completely different

368
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:37,721
[SPEAKER_06]: math sequence than we all grew up with.

369
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:42,225
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yes, you are 100% right.

370
00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:47,150
[SPEAKER_19]: Communication plays a major role, and that definitely needs to be out.

371
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:59,402
[SPEAKER_19]: And we are working on it, on parent letter, doing another presentation in April for the parents, or even sooner, but that the goal is to do it at our

372
00:43:00,463 --> 00:43:02,384
[SPEAKER_19]: beginning of April timeline.

373
00:43:03,424 --> 00:43:10,669
[SPEAKER_19]: One thing that I will say is that there are many concepts out there for acceleration.

374
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:13,390
[SPEAKER_19]: One is to teach more content.

375
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:23,977
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the other concept of acceleration is really go in depth about the problem and really understand why and be able to apply it.

376
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:25,478
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel that

377
00:43:26,418 --> 00:43:35,803
[SPEAKER_19]: we tend to take, most of us tend to take this approach that if we, if my child is learning a lot, then, you know, they are being accelerated.

378
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:43,767
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a parent also, I can speak to it that, you know, I have four kids, one of them was that way, and the other one needed more depth.

379
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:53,332
[SPEAKER_19]: So I feel that hopefully our students and our teachers will, you know, be able to

380
00:43:54,195 --> 00:43:59,618
[SPEAKER_19]: get to that level, that's our hope and dream, but we will continue to work towards it.

381
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:11,763
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the best that we can do is that provide guidance, provide, you know, have high expectations from both parties and provide, you know, clear communication to the parents.

382
00:44:12,544 --> 00:44:21,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if Waltham has completed their implementation and could share with you how it has impacted their students,

383
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:44,945
[SPEAKER_06]: like across the spectrum in terms of access to calculus and AP class success and all of those things, I think that kind of comparable information would be really helpful because you really are having to retrain a bunch of adults who have only known math one way.

384
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:51,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think being able to show them like, see, here's how it's working and here's why it's better, I think

385
00:44:52,182 --> 00:44:57,504
[SPEAKER_06]: that kind of exemplar would be really important and powerful for families to hear.

386
00:44:57,964 --> 00:44:58,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Sounds good.

387
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:07,347
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be in touch to get more ideas on how to, you know, do it so that it's more obvious.

388
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:11,829
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, clearly we are doing it, but it's not out there, but happy to discuss.

389
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,729
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, perfect.

390
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:13,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

391
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,090
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

392
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,850
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

393
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:16,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you so much for this.

394
00:45:16,971 --> 00:45:18,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.

395
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:20,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a quick question on slide 19.

396
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:34,535
[SPEAKER_02]: with the proposed course flow chart for 25-26 school year, it's the errors are pointing to integrated math three or going up towards computer programming and those types of maths and computer science principles and things like that.

397
00:45:34,955 --> 00:45:47,142
[SPEAKER_02]: My question, I guess, is that if a student decides to go that way instead of integrated math three and then decides to continue on in grade 12, are they going to be missing some of the more foundational principles that we may be more used to?

398
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's, it sounds exciting.

399
00:45:49,644 --> 00:45:50,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I'm a little concerned about,

400
00:45:51,795 --> 00:46:01,262
[SPEAKER_02]: on misunderstanding about how a student will be able to still learn the principles that they would need, I think, to get you on into any other secondary school or any other type of thing post high school.

401
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:03,464
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a great question.

402
00:46:03,624 --> 00:46:08,528
[SPEAKER_19]: And I didn't realize that maybe the flowchart may be giving that idea.

403
00:46:09,168 --> 00:46:18,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, what I wanted to indicate through is that students should be taking integrated math three and taking a computer programming course with it.

404
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,398
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not an or, it's an and.

405
00:46:25,998 --> 00:46:26,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

406
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:28,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Redfield.

407
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:32,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Member Graham touched on my questions about education for families.

408
00:46:33,662 --> 00:46:40,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a small question is, what kind of support is going to be available for students coming in from other districts who have had

409
00:46:40,575 --> 00:46:44,077
[SPEAKER_05]: who were coming from the traditional path into the integrated?

410
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,539
[SPEAKER_19]: That's again, a wonderful question.

411
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:50,421
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have to think about that population because it happens every year.

412
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:59,506
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we do do is that we have a placement exam for students who are coming in from private school.

413
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,347
[SPEAKER_19]: That's one thing.

414
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:03,409
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll adjust our placement exam

415
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:11,671
[SPEAKER_19]: to test them now on both concepts in one test like algebra and geometry so there will be a placement exam for each

416
00:47:12,941 --> 00:47:17,103
[SPEAKER_19]: level, the students who are coming in from other districts.

417
00:47:17,563 --> 00:47:23,985
[SPEAKER_19]: We have had this discussion as a committee and I believe the teachers are ready for it.

418
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:25,546
[SPEAKER_19]: We will meet them where they're at.

419
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:29,127
[SPEAKER_19]: They will not be placed any lower just because of that.

420
00:47:29,207 --> 00:47:33,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, when we look at the student's transcript and we see

421
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:52,259
[SPEAKER_19]: algebra one on it only and now the student is going to go to integrate it to it is what it is, and so that piece will be covered if the student comes to us in June some assignment of some sort or the teachers will be providing some.

422
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,780
[SPEAKER_19]: support of that kind.

423
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,381
[SPEAKER_19]: But then again, this is to, we are working on it.

424
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:00,422
[SPEAKER_19]: We are working on all of those pieces.

425
00:48:00,602 --> 00:48:04,903
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to take us time to iron those out, but they are on our mind.

426
00:48:04,964 --> 00:48:07,945
[SPEAKER_19]: We have been thinking about what's the best way to do it.

427
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:13,387
[SPEAKER_19]: But for now, teachers have given their commitment to ensuring that students will get it.

428
00:48:13,507 --> 00:48:14,267
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm really happy to hear it.

429
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say, I love the spiral model of education.

430
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:18,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's much more effective than the latter.

431
00:48:20,225 --> 00:48:23,606
[SPEAKER_05]: So my next question is around that kind of interdisciplinary perspective.

432
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:49,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know you've had a lot of conversation within the math department and digital learning, and how does this intersect with, say, the science courses, you know, chemistry, physics, where a lot of these concepts are coming into play, and at the vocational school, things like metalwork and carpentry, where that geometry foundation, and as much as I hate to reference standardized tests, academic milestones like the SATs, which lean really hard into the geometry.

433
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:58,911
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is that being integrated kind of beyond the math department and making sure that those intersections, those alignments are matching up?

434
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:17,774
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, so right now what we, so currently teachers are, so just a couple of years ago, we ensured that we go back to our older model of having a project every quarter in each

435
00:49:19,178 --> 00:49:27,921
[SPEAKER_19]: course, so the teachers through these projects, they have the, you know, they

436
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:35,957
[SPEAKER_19]: are into that kind of thing that they have already started taking initiative on making it interdisciplinary.

437
00:49:36,837 --> 00:49:43,401
[SPEAKER_19]: For others that are not, because we are on our way, again, it's a work in progress.

438
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:49,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of us need a little bit more of, okay, they did it and I can do it too kind of thing.

439
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:53,867
[SPEAKER_19]: Others are like, I'm a daredevil, I'm gonna give it a try anyhow.

440
00:49:54,307 --> 00:50:04,449
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are at different places in the department, and I'm hoping that our daredevils will be able to say, you know, this is working out.

441
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:05,229
[SPEAKER_19]: That's okay.

442
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:06,889
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's where we're at.

443
00:50:06,929 --> 00:50:07,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

444
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:11,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And will they have the opportunity to do that peer-to-peer professional development in this?

445
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:12,770
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what worked for me.

446
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:13,711
[SPEAKER_05]: This was my challenge.

447
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:14,931
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we help each other?

448
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:16,351
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, they already are.

449
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:21,712
[SPEAKER_19]: So in the mathematics department, we have this peer observation and strategy implementation.

450
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:29,094
[SPEAKER_19]: that you go observe a peer, and then you take down notes, and then you adopt one of their strategies, and you do it.

451
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:32,617
[SPEAKER_19]: So that can be easily geared toward the projects as well.

452
00:50:33,157 --> 00:50:51,771
[SPEAKER_19]: And I must admit our newer crew, we have three new math teachers this year, and all of them work very nicely in this way that they always collaborate together, even at their own time to come up with such projects to keep student engagement

453
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:54,150
[SPEAKER_19]: up and that's the goal.

454
00:50:54,611 --> 00:50:55,231
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

455
00:50:55,412 --> 00:50:56,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you so much.

456
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:58,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to your work and thank the committee as well.

457
00:50:58,414 --> 00:51:02,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a lot on top of teaching to be thinking about that at this level.

458
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:03,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

459
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:05,320
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also very grateful to them.

460
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,182
[SPEAKER_19]: This work wouldn't have happened without them.

461
00:51:08,322 --> 00:51:12,986
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll be in touch with some of you and thank you for your time.

462
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:14,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Any questions?

463
00:51:14,227 --> 00:51:15,028
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

464
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:16,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

465
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:27,065
[SPEAKER_13]: We have number four school update, the Curtis-Tufts High School, presented by Laurie Hodgdon, principal, and Brooks Elementary School, presented by Ms.

466
00:51:27,145 --> 00:51:29,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Shannon Demos, also principal.

467
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:31,106
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll start with the Curtis-Tufts, please.

468
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:33,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

469
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:33,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

470
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:34,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

471
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:35,168
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

472
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:38,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's been a year since I've seen some of you, and some of you are new.

473
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:41,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I first want to acknowledge

474
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:46,691
[SPEAKER_04]: My student, teacher, and a parent who's here supporting Curtis-Tufts tonight.

475
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:55,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Dad's supporting because Anthony Seekman, who's a junior, wanted to be here to support his school and to support me.

476
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:59,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kate Wellard, who teaches math at Curtis-Tufts.

477
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:05,562
[SPEAKER_04]: This is her first year, but she's been in the district for 10th year, 10th year.

478
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:10,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So first I wanna say, all of the things that you're talking about, we do every day.

479
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you apply rigor and you apply relevance and you build good relationships with kids, you're able to differentiate in a way and meet kids where they are.

480
00:52:25,622 --> 00:52:33,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Because rigor is about how you ask the question, how you ask yourself the question as a learner and how the teacher does.

481
00:52:33,644 --> 00:52:40,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to have good relationships and know what students are interested in so you can apply that to their learning.

482
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:47,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just resonated with me when Faisal was talking about math and all the work that they've done as a committee.

483
00:52:47,814 --> 00:52:56,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the work that our teachers do every day because the kids they see in front of them are at varying abilities.

484
00:52:57,305 --> 00:52:58,885
[SPEAKER_04]: and need more support than others.

485
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:03,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And some are like going gangbusters and know exactly what they want to do.

486
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:06,147
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just traveling at different rates.

487
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:08,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just, I had to just kind of point that out.

488
00:53:09,528 --> 00:53:18,770
[SPEAKER_04]: So since you don't have the slide, if you look at slide two, this is celebrating our students of the month based on attendance and academic achievement.

489
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to give props to Anthony.

490
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:25,092
[SPEAKER_04]: He has the best attendance at Curtis Tufts this year.

491
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:35,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we know, when you go to school, it's about attending and learning and being in every class.

492
00:53:36,939 --> 00:53:40,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the most part, that's what he's doing and we can see progress.

493
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:48,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you all know, and I'm on slide three, Curtis Tufts is a therapeutic day school that supports diverse learners.

494
00:53:49,568 --> 00:53:54,211
[SPEAKER_04]: We currently serve 12 students on IEPs with varying disabilities.

495
00:53:55,532 --> 00:54:06,520
[SPEAKER_04]: We have three academic teachers, two counselors, one paraprofessional, one nurse, and one expressive arts intern that I'll talk more about later in the presentation.

496
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:12,975
[SPEAKER_04]: We work as a team and we work around our students, the students at the center.

497
00:54:13,656 --> 00:54:27,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel very fortunate that I have a team that we work with at the high school in Joan Bowen, Kim Clinton, all of my colleagues there who support and at the high school who support learning at Curtis Tufts.

498
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:29,829
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't do it without them.

499
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:33,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I'm the school director and principal.

500
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:36,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I also chair all of the IEP meetings

501
00:54:36,716 --> 00:54:39,337
[SPEAKER_04]: and help to write the IEPs.

502
00:54:40,058 --> 00:54:44,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to give a shout out to my colleagues at the Missittuck, the Andrews, and the McGlynn.

503
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:54,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Suzanne Galussi set it up so that we could have our electives in music, art, PE, and digital literacy.

504
00:54:55,525 --> 00:55:02,368
[SPEAKER_04]: So they come in their busy days and they support our students with enriching their learning.

505
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:12,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see slide four, you see Anthony and Nikki, students working collaboratively in Kate's class in order to meet learning targets and to achieve success.

506
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:26,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're at different places in terms of math, but she's planning and thinking about how each of the students learn best and where she can target their learning to support them so they move forward.

507
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:32,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I like to say to everyone, you have to move back to move forward and vice versa.

508
00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:54,932
[SPEAKER_04]: On the demographics of Curtis tough high school currently we currently serve 12 students to African American students one multi race to Hispanic and seven white students in varying disability areas of health autism and emotional.

509
00:55:56,482 --> 00:56:02,084
[SPEAKER_04]: There are currently eight referrals from the high school that will be placed either in the spring or next fall.

510
00:56:02,824 --> 00:56:08,125
[SPEAKER_04]: What we like to do is we like to see students who transition from eighth to ninth grade try the high school.

511
00:56:08,605 --> 00:56:12,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it doesn't work for them because the learning environment is too large.

512
00:56:13,027 --> 00:56:17,028
[SPEAKER_04]: They travel through each of the different areas.

513
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:22,815
[SPEAKER_04]: To see if they need to go to Curtis Tufts, they have to work to get there.

514
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:26,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can I can talk a little bit more about that.

515
00:56:26,561 --> 00:56:30,146
[SPEAKER_04]: We just had a student join us today at the end of quarter two.

516
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:33,691
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very excited to have her to join us.

517
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:41,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're very careful in the middle of the year of making sure that students feel comfortable transitioning.

518
00:56:41,334 --> 00:56:50,036
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard in a high school situation to think about leaving all of your friends and what you've known and go to a different learning environment.

519
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:56,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've worked really hard with our students and the faculty to ensure that that kind of transition is seamless.

520
00:56:57,598 --> 00:57:02,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing is, is when a student is making progress, thinking about a student moving back to the high school.

521
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:18,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that comes success plans, behavior plans, support, sitting down and ensuring that kids have a personalized learning plan in front of them about how they can meet those goals.

522
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:22,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Important to note that we had two graduates in 2023.

523
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in touch with both.

524
00:57:25,464 --> 00:57:32,069
[SPEAKER_04]: One is applying to be unionized or go through the union of pipe fitters, which is very exciting.

525
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:37,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And another one is looking at community college and thinking about nursing.

526
00:57:38,514 --> 00:57:42,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So in their transition plans, they worked on all of those things.

527
00:57:42,497 --> 00:57:46,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Some go at a slower rate, some at a quicker rate,

528
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:50,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are always open to work with them and support them.

529
00:57:51,247 --> 00:57:57,052
[SPEAKER_04]: They never are not our students, as I speak in a double negative, they're always our students.

530
00:57:57,793 --> 00:58:00,675
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two potential graduates in June.

531
00:58:02,517 --> 00:58:04,659
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to just celebrate.

532
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:10,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do it without the people around you.

533
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:12,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is slide six.

534
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:21,336
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, in collaboration with the arts department, we have an expressive arts rotation.

535
00:58:21,356 --> 00:58:25,378
[SPEAKER_04]: A Lesley intern is at Curtis Tufts.

536
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,539
[SPEAKER_04]: She's there for the year.

537
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:33,662
[SPEAKER_04]: She's there three days a week, working with our students, and I explain it even more so in the slide.

538
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:36,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We have many students who are interested in dance,

539
00:58:37,628 --> 00:58:42,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we'd like to get is a dance therapy intern for next year.

540
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:46,276
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been very additive for our students.

541
00:58:47,217 --> 00:59:03,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say that she has been able to work with our students individually and she sees them and their expression in very different ways than we do academically or just sitting down with them in a counseling session.

542
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:09,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Curtis Tufts, with the help of Melanie McLaughlin.

543
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: received a grant from the Federation of Special Needs under the statewide mass family and community engagement program, an award of $5,000 last October.

544
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:28,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're working on service learning opportunities in the community.

545
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:35,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had asked our superintendent if I could come back and have our students present.

546
00:59:35,314 --> 00:59:36,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at STEM learning,

547
00:59:37,214 --> 00:59:40,339
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at volunteering at the Miss Attack reading.

548
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:51,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthony wants to do a basketball program with some of our grades three through fifth graders and really giving back in a way that's very enriching.

549
00:59:53,961 --> 01:00:03,388
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that we did after my first year was we moved all academic classes to the beginning of the day, which has helped us to support a stronger culture of achievement.

550
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:07,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Students need to get to school, need to be there, need to be on time.

551
01:00:07,331 --> 01:00:21,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And this allows for many of our juniors and seniors who may have exhausted their credits and want work-study to leave and go get work or do an internship or

552
01:00:22,063 --> 01:00:25,986
[SPEAKER_04]: create a work study program that is in their area of interest.

553
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:37,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So, working as a team around our students, you know, it really is cooperation, collaboration, and commitment to our kids.

554
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:49,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that across the district, but I have to say that I work with a team of individuals from our custodian, Bobby Hawkins, to our paraprofessional,

555
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,442
[SPEAKER_04]: to all of our teachers to our kids and our parents.

556
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:54,043
[SPEAKER_04]: No one works harder.

557
01:00:55,403 --> 01:01:00,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a professional learning community that puts students at the forefront of our work.

558
01:01:01,447 --> 01:01:05,350
[SPEAKER_04]: We meet every day, we meet every day after school four times a week.

559
01:01:06,737 --> 01:01:08,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

560
01:01:08,578 --> 01:01:17,001
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for 10 to 15 and oftentimes our teachers are left and we're talking and we're saying what should we be doing differently?

561
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:20,962
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the opportunities for success to support students?

562
01:01:21,542 --> 01:01:23,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesdays are hour long day.

563
01:01:23,623 --> 01:01:29,805
[SPEAKER_04]: We usually have conversations about students, but also planning and what are we doing next?

564
01:01:31,526 --> 01:01:33,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Teachers and learning is at the heart of our work.

565
01:01:35,148 --> 01:01:38,790
[SPEAKER_04]: The creation of plans that support school avoidance and therapeutic needs.

566
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,571
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen attendance go up.

567
01:01:41,971 --> 01:01:43,632
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen attendance wane.

568
01:01:44,372 --> 01:01:46,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on the time of year.

569
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:48,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on where a student is.

570
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:51,076
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do is we sit down, we come up with a plan.

571
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:53,997
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we get that student into school and we support them?

572
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:58,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Personalized learning plans that support student success.

573
01:01:58,359 --> 01:01:59,680
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to be when you grow up?

574
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,300
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that look like?

575
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,901
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of internship do you want to do?

576
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:04,462
[SPEAKER_04]: What work experience do you need?

577
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:11,039
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're also into communication that meets them where they're at in terms of their reality.

578
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:15,545
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're not coming to school, how are they going to hold down a job?

579
01:02:16,787 --> 01:02:20,913
[SPEAKER_04]: The team approach to all thoughtful and purposeful work begins

580
01:02:21,778 --> 01:02:23,980
[SPEAKER_04]: as a team, and we model that for our students.

581
01:02:25,122 --> 01:02:27,364
[SPEAKER_04]: This afternoon, we talked about electives.

582
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:29,947
[SPEAKER_04]: We met as a team with students there.

583
01:02:29,967 --> 01:02:40,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a purposeful and thoughtful conversation where kids knew exactly what they need to do tomorrow, and they were part of the decision making.

584
01:02:42,102 --> 01:03:09,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's really important that we do our best to work in partnership with our caregivers, that we know that our caregivers are very busy, they have challenges themselves, and the more that we can communicate with them, cooperate with them, and collaborate with them, even when we have conflict, is really, really important, that what we do is what we say we're gonna do, and we move forward.

585
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,781
[SPEAKER_04]: The next slide is about the Expressive Arts Room.

586
01:03:13,821 --> 01:03:23,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to necessarily read it to you, but really, we took one of the classrooms and we've made it a place where kids can go create music.

587
01:03:23,785 --> 01:03:24,966
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an old piano.

588
01:03:25,506 --> 01:03:31,929
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two keyboards, where one of our music teachers wrote a grant and got us keyboards.

589
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,812
[SPEAKER_04]: They can express themselves visually.

590
01:03:34,832 --> 01:03:40,558
[SPEAKER_04]: One of their lasting impacts is a mural that's going to go in the classroom around the border.

591
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:50,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also think it's looking and expressing oneself in a different way that isn't necessarily sitting down and having that conversation.

592
01:03:52,045 --> 01:04:02,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the other thing is too is having Anthony here as being part of, as an authentic audience member is really important.

593
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:05,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one day he'll become a school committee member.

594
01:04:06,272 --> 01:04:09,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one day he'll be advocating for his children.

595
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:16,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think the more that we can serve our community, and that is why we wrote the grant, the better.

596
01:04:17,584 --> 01:04:23,508
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also know that we have to do skill building and this is something that we need to continue working on.

597
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we want for our students.

598
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:37,276
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who are at the graduation, and I appreciate those who are there, I think you saw at its best when our two graduates stood on their chairs and they couldn't stop smiling.

599
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:43,420
[SPEAKER_04]: They had done something and it was, they had tackled something knowing that maybe

600
01:04:44,713 --> 01:04:49,495
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something that they never thought they could actually do, and their parents were so proud too.

601
01:04:50,455 --> 01:05:02,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So opportunities for improvement, because that's the kind of leader I am, and that's the kind of team I've created, is we need to move daily attendance from 70% to 85% total student attendance.

602
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:10,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we need to drill down, and we need to create those plans, and we gotta figure out how to get them to school and get them to school on time.

603
01:05:11,727 --> 01:05:18,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working, it's a lot of conversation, and what they're seeing is they're achieving when they're getting it.

604
01:05:18,258 --> 01:05:21,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the one plus one equals, I'll get good grades.

605
01:05:22,903 --> 01:05:46,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to move to project-based units two times a year, you were talking about that, where you intersect content areas, social studies, English, science, and math, so the kids have a question, students have a question, we're answering the question, and we're able to integrate all of their areas of learning.

606
01:05:47,316 --> 01:05:56,563
[SPEAKER_04]: so that they see it differently, and they don't see it as rote work, but they think about how they ask the question, and it also personalizes their learning.

607
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:59,646
[SPEAKER_04]: It supports the teacher in differentiating.

608
01:06:00,186 --> 01:06:01,287
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is our goal.

609
01:06:01,968 --> 01:06:05,390
[SPEAKER_04]: We also believe in incentive-based learning.

610
01:06:05,571 --> 01:06:08,433
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it mean when this happens?

611
01:06:08,813 --> 01:06:10,614
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it mean when I have straight A's?

612
01:06:11,035 --> 01:06:12,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel good about myself.

613
01:06:12,596 --> 01:06:13,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a growth mindset.

614
01:06:14,215 --> 01:06:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a fixed mindset.

615
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:28,621
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna continue to partner with area colleges and universities to provide opportunities for pre-service teachers like our expressive arts intern to be trained at Curtis Tufts.

616
01:06:30,302 --> 01:06:32,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a great little laboratory.

617
01:06:33,664 --> 01:06:43,028
[SPEAKER_04]: You can learn so much about yourself as a teacher, a clinician, a principal, when you're working with our students who learn differently.

618
01:06:44,618 --> 01:06:50,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to create, we want to create more work study opportunities and internships for our older students.

619
01:06:51,102 --> 01:06:53,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the last page, I just want to thank you.

620
01:06:54,504 --> 01:07:03,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Our goal obviously is to ensure that all students have a safe learning environment that supports them in achieving their academic potential and therapeutic needs.

621
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really is balanced.

622
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:09,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's more therapeutic than academic and vice versa.

623
01:07:11,257 --> 01:07:16,981
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at our two graduates who graduated last year, it all became equal.

624
01:07:17,882 --> 01:07:20,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when you know you've been successful.

625
01:07:20,824 --> 01:07:22,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna just say thank you.

626
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:26,307
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope to get more students.

627
01:07:27,088 --> 01:07:39,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to go out with Joan's support to find students in other districts to come into Curtis Tufts and support with revenue.

628
01:07:40,543 --> 01:07:50,186
[SPEAKER_04]: so that we continue this program and that we actually are a place that everyone wants to be outside of Medford.

629
01:07:51,046 --> 01:07:55,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanna thank you and I'm happy to answer any questions.

630
01:07:56,828 --> 01:07:57,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

631
01:07:58,529 --> 01:08:01,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, thank you Dr. Hutchins for the presentation.

632
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:07,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I know your commitment to the work and I know the students' commitment to the work as well.

633
01:08:07,732 --> 01:08:08,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanna clarify,

634
01:08:08,973 --> 01:08:14,335
[SPEAKER_09]: just in terms of the grant, this was the community funds grant through the city.

635
01:08:14,575 --> 01:08:32,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And really it was an introduction to a 501c3 as a fiscal sponsor that we were able to connect you with so that that money could go to the Curtis Tufts directly based on some of the work that you wanted to do in the community, which I think is so important as we think about this particular student population.

636
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:38,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the questions I have is how are we helping our students and our families

637
01:08:38,712 --> 01:08:50,094
[SPEAKER_09]: at the Carter's Tufts feel part of our community, part of the bigger community, because I think that certainly last year we heard a lot around, you know, othering, right?

638
01:08:50,734 --> 01:09:07,357
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that as we're thinking about equity and inclusivity, I really want us to be thinking about how are we being inclusive of all of our students and helping them to feel like they're part of our community because they very much are a part of our community while respecting, obviously, their individualized needs.

639
01:09:09,497 --> 01:09:10,558
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question.

640
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:13,400
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a dissertation.

641
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:28,890
[SPEAKER_04]: But in terms of other, I would say our students this year, and I'm speaking for them, and maybe I shouldn't be, feel more recognized than they ever have.

642
01:09:30,491 --> 01:09:34,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say that it's because of they've bought in

643
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:36,904
[SPEAKER_04]: to what we're trying to do.

644
01:09:36,984 --> 01:09:41,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there are some students who haven't and we're still working with them and we're not gonna give up on them.

645
01:09:42,606 --> 01:09:54,131
[SPEAKER_04]: But the more we work with the high school and the more we work with the community, the Kiwanis wants to work with us.

646
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:58,353
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been very supportive of us in terms of their leadership program.

647
01:09:59,093 --> 01:10:03,955
[SPEAKER_04]: The more that I can build bridges for our students with our students,

648
01:10:04,622 --> 01:10:07,003
[SPEAKER_04]: the more they're gonna be recognized in the community.

649
01:10:08,164 --> 01:10:20,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think there's an opportunity to ensure that our students who attend Curtis Tufts feel seen by all of you and continue to feel seen by the high school.

650
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:25,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's hard because we're so far away.

651
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,560
[SPEAKER_04]: In some ways, that's a really good thing.

652
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some ways, that's really hard.

653
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,621
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we get them more involved?

654
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:37,262
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something we constantly are talking about and improving upon.

655
01:10:37,282 --> 01:10:47,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say that our relationship in terms of how we receive students and how we think about students from high school has changed in really positive ways.

656
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:53,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say it's a work in progress and we will continue with that mindset.

657
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:57,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

658
01:10:57,506 --> 01:10:57,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

659
01:10:57,986 --> 01:10:58,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

660
01:10:58,766 --> 01:11:00,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would love to see more.

661
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:09,752
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess just more specifically, how are families being engaged as well in the community, in the Curtis Tufts community?

662
01:11:10,052 --> 01:11:11,653
[SPEAKER_09]: One, I guess, just for specifics.

663
01:11:12,153 --> 01:11:23,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And then two, is there transportation available for students to go between the Curtis Tufts and the high school, for example, for science labs or that sort of thing with their teachers?

664
01:11:24,102 --> 01:11:28,023
[SPEAKER_04]: not currently, but if you want to invest in a cheap van, we'd take it.

665
01:11:28,723 --> 01:11:30,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's budget time.

666
01:11:33,804 --> 01:11:34,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

667
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:38,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, you know, I mean, I think there are opportunities.

668
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:38,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

669
01:11:39,026 --> 01:11:44,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they get specialized transportation to get to and from school, but not necessarily between the yes.

670
01:11:48,128 --> 01:11:48,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

671
01:11:49,068 --> 01:11:52,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they were in the life of the so yes, thank you, Miss Bowen.

672
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:53,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, we're talking across the room.

673
01:11:54,045 --> 01:11:57,586
[SPEAKER_09]: So every student, as I'm sure you know, is entitled to the life of the school.

674
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,347
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what I understand Ms.

675
01:11:59,367 --> 01:12:10,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen is saying, for others who may not have heard, was she was saying that students are entitled to extracurricular activities, what have you, and so the transportation would be provided for students that needed that.

676
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:22,815
[SPEAKER_09]: And during the day, if students, you know, using science labs and things like that, because our students at the Curtis Test are entitled to all of the services, including our swimming pools, our science labs, all of those things, I think

677
01:12:23,474 --> 01:12:32,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to ask my colleagues to be thinking about how we're making that happen for all of our students, because I think that's really important that they're accessing everything that they can access.

678
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:35,363
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to sort of elaborate on that.

679
01:12:35,383 --> 01:12:38,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to let another colleague go, and then I have a couple more questions if you don't mind there.

680
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:40,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds good.

681
01:12:40,668 --> 01:12:42,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

682
01:12:42,449 --> 01:12:43,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you.

683
01:12:45,503 --> 01:12:52,772
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I know that there's a shortage of space for students in and out of district placements.

684
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:56,096
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a serious shortage.

685
01:12:56,717 --> 01:12:59,380
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I'm excited that you're thinking about

686
01:13:00,444 --> 01:13:03,286
[SPEAKER_22]: becoming a place where we could accept students from other districts.

687
01:13:04,406 --> 01:13:15,072
[SPEAKER_22]: If we have the capacity, it seems morally appropriate, not to mention fiscally a good idea, to use the capacity we have, because there are wait lists everywhere.

688
01:13:15,092 --> 01:13:18,094
[SPEAKER_22]: And all those kids on wait lists are not being served.

689
01:13:18,214 --> 01:13:19,895
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for thinking about that.

690
01:13:22,716 --> 01:13:27,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Olapare, then Member Branley, then Member McLaughlin.

691
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:29,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for being here.

692
01:13:30,137 --> 01:13:35,660
[SPEAKER_02]: A quick question about the service learning, and I think the partnership programs in the community.

693
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:55,593
[SPEAKER_02]: As someone who really benefited from service learning when I was in college, and as someone who really appreciates what it's intended for, what is the process, if there is an immediate formal process on how you develop those programming with community groups, or is there a way for community groups to, I think, reach out to the Curtiseps and offer their partnership capabilities?

694
01:13:55,913 --> 01:13:56,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's both.

695
01:13:57,614 --> 01:13:58,314
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things,

696
01:13:59,514 --> 01:14:03,700
[SPEAKER_04]: that I really want to work on are those relationships in the city.

697
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:08,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think it's time and professional development for our teachers.

698
01:14:09,228 --> 01:14:12,112
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, service learning is embedded in the learning.

699
01:14:12,472 --> 01:14:17,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just community service you go and you, you know, you serve your community.

700
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:19,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is about learning.

701
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:23,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, our history teacher wants to study the city of Medford.

702
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:29,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, what does that mean for our senior citizens in terms of doing an oral history project.

703
01:14:30,805 --> 01:14:36,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if they tell us their stories, our students can help them with their technology.

704
01:14:36,547 --> 01:14:37,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that idea of giving back.

705
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:38,948
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just one idea.

706
01:14:39,868 --> 01:14:45,810
[SPEAKER_04]: They're thinking about the FALS and STEM, STEAM learning that can be happening.

707
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:57,214
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have a van during the day, we can take those students and we can commit to kind of looking at our schedule differently and having our volunteer day or afternoon.

708
01:14:57,635 --> 01:14:58,355
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are just,

709
01:14:59,414 --> 01:15:03,256
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a leader has to be five years ahead, and that's what I'm thinking about.

710
01:15:03,656 --> 01:15:05,017
[SPEAKER_04]: But I appreciate the question.

711
01:15:05,537 --> 01:15:07,278
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have anyone, they can reach out to me.

712
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:09,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

713
01:15:09,599 --> 01:15:10,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Branley.

714
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you so much for being here.

715
01:15:13,581 --> 01:15:19,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a question on, you said there are eight referrals from the high school that we placed in the spring or next fall.

716
01:15:19,844 --> 01:15:22,545
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means eight more students coming in addition to your 12.

717
01:15:23,265 --> 01:15:24,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I right when I hear that?

718
01:15:24,997 --> 01:15:27,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on, I don't want to speak individually.

719
01:15:27,338 --> 01:15:37,960
[SPEAKER_04]: There are eight referrals currently, which means they are having conversations at their IEP meetings where they may or may not commit to Curtis Tufts.

720
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,681
[SPEAKER_04]: We want kids to be there who need to be there and who want to be there.

721
01:15:42,281 --> 01:15:45,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's right now, I have eight referrals.

722
01:15:46,262 --> 01:15:47,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, we accepted one.

723
01:15:48,263 --> 01:15:48,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Staffing.

724
01:15:50,283 --> 01:15:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Staffing.

725
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:57,106
[SPEAKER_04]: We just hired a science teacher, which we're very excited about.

726
01:15:57,126 --> 01:16:03,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we have the resources with that science teacher to have more students.

727
01:16:04,372 --> 01:16:05,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the average usually 12 students?

728
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been last year and this year.

729
01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:11,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year it was 15 at a max.

730
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:14,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to make sure you're supported.

731
01:16:14,281 --> 01:16:15,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

732
01:16:15,702 --> 01:16:16,763
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, thank you.

733
01:16:19,766 --> 01:16:20,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, thank you.

734
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the art therapy program.

735
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:24,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's awesome.

736
01:16:24,811 --> 01:16:25,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would love to see more of that.

737
01:16:26,012 --> 01:16:30,434
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially now that we have our new arts building, we have a lot of arts work in the community.

738
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:39,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there is very likely folks if they're out there listening and certainly folks that we can talk to that could be interested in more of the arts learning.

739
01:16:39,057 --> 01:16:44,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's such a great way to do learning and also the community building around the project-based learning.

740
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,281
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'm hearing you talk a lot about and what I'm getting excited about

741
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:56,027
[SPEAKER_09]: is the project-based learning, the personalized learning, the differentiated curriculum, the unique learning, you know, unique universal design for learning.

742
01:16:56,067 --> 01:17:01,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all of these advanced, you know, opportunities to really be able to teach to the individual.

743
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:05,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like you guys are really doing that there, and I'm excited about that.

744
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:08,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to ask about the subject teachers that are there.

745
01:17:08,053 --> 01:17:09,513
[SPEAKER_09]: You said there are three academic teachers.

746
01:17:09,553 --> 01:17:16,737
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the... We currently have three academic teachers, one history, one English, and one math, and we've just hired a science teacher.

747
01:17:17,318 --> 01:17:20,579
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also certified as a special educator.

748
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:21,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

749
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,860
[SPEAKER_09]: So for top and special educator.

750
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And what about like social studies, current events?

751
01:17:27,361 --> 01:17:29,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that sort of part of that?

752
01:17:29,882 --> 01:17:34,024
[SPEAKER_04]: He has both history, history endorsement and special ed.

753
01:17:34,124 --> 01:17:34,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

754
01:17:34,924 --> 01:17:35,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

755
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:38,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, um, thank you.

756
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:43,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, Oh, transition programming.

757
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:48,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So transition to adulthood, I know that we have, obviously, the whole transition program at the high school.

758
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:52,642
[SPEAKER_09]: So what does the transition program at Curtis Tufts look like?

759
01:17:53,322 --> 01:18:09,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So each counselor in the liaison works with a student who's, throughout their career, freshman through senior year, we can certainly improve upon it, asking the question, although it can change with teenagers six and seven times throughout the year.

760
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:12,808
[SPEAKER_04]: But the goal always is, I wanna graduate first,

761
01:18:13,723 --> 01:18:25,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna have a future that's either in the world of work, military, or thinking about college, and then rolling back and working on that every year with the counselor.

762
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:32,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have two counselors currently, and they each have a caseload of six right now.

763
01:18:32,716 --> 01:18:42,062
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're able to work with students in a very individualized way, and to create opportunities that can support them in what they're thinking about,

764
01:18:42,588 --> 01:18:47,812
[SPEAKER_04]: but also working with parents, as you know, through the IEP process and having those conversations.

765
01:18:48,372 --> 01:18:48,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

766
01:18:49,113 --> 01:18:49,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

767
01:18:49,493 --> 01:18:51,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And then last two questions.

768
01:18:51,414 --> 01:19:00,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the students, is there any opportunity currently that exists for teaching advocacy skills to the students and families?

769
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:03,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly, what kind of MCAS supports do the students get?

770
01:19:05,104 --> 01:19:06,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll take the first question.

771
01:19:06,965 --> 01:19:11,288
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of teaching advocacy for themselves personally,

772
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we do that through each class.

773
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:18,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we weave it through whatever we're teaching.

774
01:19:18,972 --> 01:19:22,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also think the counselors do a really good job of supporting that.

775
01:19:22,774 --> 01:19:39,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I think because of our kind of commitment to the team, we're having constant conversations about student needs and how they can advocate for themselves and kind of having that reality therapy where we're sitting down with kids and we're saying, this is what you need to be doing.

776
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:40,881
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we get there?

777
01:19:42,567 --> 01:19:53,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with our parents, I think we do it through the IEP meetings, but certainly, I mean, I have conversations with parents via email, telephone, et cetera.

778
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:55,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can do it better.

779
01:19:55,310 --> 01:20:03,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I can do a better job advocating or teaching kind of those skills for our parents.

780
01:20:03,192 --> 01:20:05,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we would like to do a parent support group.

781
01:20:06,113 --> 01:20:10,794
[SPEAKER_04]: The issue is, is when we've offered it, our parents are working two and three jobs.

782
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:12,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to get them there.

783
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:28,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes it's through the telephone, sometimes it's through an email, sometimes it's at the IEP meeting, sometimes it's after the meeting, and we're just talking and it's informal, but I do think there needs to be some sort of formalized process for supporting parents.

784
01:20:29,848 --> 01:20:32,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the second question, if you have- MCAS supports.

785
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:33,591
[SPEAKER_04]: MCAS support.

786
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:45,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Kate is providing MCAS prep in math because we have several students who need to pass MCAS math, but she also infuses it in the teaching.

787
01:20:45,682 --> 01:20:49,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So with our new science teacher coming on board, we'll also do it for biology.

788
01:20:51,004 --> 01:21:04,251
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to do it as much as possible, but as you know, our students struggle with the MCAS, but I will say they did very well on English, which I'm happy to report, but as much as we can.

789
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:19,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I also didn't mention credit recovery, those opportunities to recover grades or recover credits, either through online learning or doing an independent study with someone like me or a content area teacher.

790
01:21:20,347 --> 01:21:21,488
[SPEAKER_04]: That really is the goal.

791
01:21:21,868 --> 01:21:22,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

792
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:23,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

793
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:32,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And so lastly, if the community members that are watching or listening or reading the minutes or anything like that, wanted to contact you to figure out how they might be able to support

794
01:21:33,673 --> 01:21:35,214
[SPEAKER_09]: The Curtis Tufts, how can they do that?

795
01:21:35,354 --> 01:21:37,014
[SPEAKER_04]: They can call me at Curtis Tufts.

796
01:21:37,174 --> 01:21:38,614
[SPEAKER_04]: They can email me.

797
01:21:38,854 --> 01:21:39,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's your email?

798
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:45,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It's lhodgdon at medford.k12.ma.us.

799
01:21:45,896 --> 01:21:47,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's H-O-D-G-D-O-N.

800
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:48,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

801
01:21:48,977 --> 01:21:49,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

802
01:21:52,218 --> 01:21:53,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for the presentation.

803
01:21:53,318 --> 01:21:53,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

804
01:21:53,879 --> 01:21:57,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me tonight on behalf of our students and teachers.

805
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

806
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for coming.

807
01:22:02,469 --> 01:22:03,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Miss Deimos, welcome.

808
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:04,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on up.

809
01:22:12,056 --> 01:22:12,536
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

810
01:22:13,196 --> 01:22:13,757
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

811
01:22:14,517 --> 01:22:16,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for having me tonight.

812
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:31,669
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to just start out by letting you know from the slide one that our four core principles at the Brooks Elementary School is to be kind, to be safe, to be responsible,

813
01:22:32,068 --> 01:22:32,788
[SPEAKER_23]: and to be you.

814
01:22:33,509 --> 01:22:35,130
[SPEAKER_23]: That be you is very important to us.

815
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:42,514
[SPEAKER_23]: We celebrate the individuals that are before us every day, and we celebrate their strengths every day.

816
01:22:44,035 --> 01:22:55,762
[SPEAKER_23]: Our second slide, I think it's important before we go any further about celebrating what is good at the Brooks, is a great big shout out to the staff that I am surrounded by.

817
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:58,010
[SPEAKER_23]: and have the pleasure to work with every day.

818
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,410
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't say enough about this staff.

819
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:04,912
[SPEAKER_23]: It's an honor to work with them and to lead these individuals each and every day.

820
01:23:05,832 --> 01:23:08,273
[SPEAKER_23]: They create a safe learning environment for all students.

821
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:14,775
[SPEAKER_23]: They instill inclusivity and kindness through modeling lessons and clear and consistent expectations.

822
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:24,018
[SPEAKER_23]: Students are following those four kind values of being kind, safe, responsible, and you'll see

823
01:23:24,474 --> 01:23:32,136
[SPEAKER_23]: Our class picture from this year does not encompass all the staff there, but that is our most current.

824
01:23:32,756 --> 01:23:32,996
[SPEAKER_23]: Ms.

825
01:23:33,056 --> 01:23:36,937
[SPEAKER_23]: Burke, my assistant principal, is here tonight as support.

826
01:23:37,578 --> 01:23:45,420
[SPEAKER_23]: And a big core part of my leadership is collaboration and teamwork.

827
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,181
[SPEAKER_23]: Everything is sort of a we, so I would invite Ms.

828
01:23:49,221 --> 01:23:52,702
[SPEAKER_23]: Burke up to be part of the team here for the presentation because

829
01:23:54,619 --> 01:23:58,301
[SPEAKER_23]: We do a lot together and it's more of a we than an I. Thank you.

830
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:03,783
[SPEAKER_23]: Our first slide here is the 2023-2024 school year.

831
01:24:04,283 --> 01:24:08,925
[SPEAKER_23]: You'll see our enrollment as of October 1st is 537 students.

832
01:24:10,806 --> 01:24:15,508
[SPEAKER_23]: I have broken up the demographics for you and our special populations are there for you as well.

833
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:25,062
[SPEAKER_23]: We have the developmental program for K-2, the language-based programs, and the learning group programs for the district, which is a total of four classrooms.

834
01:24:25,902 --> 01:24:29,283
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have two half-day MEEP preschool programs.

835
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:41,106
[SPEAKER_23]: The program details you'll find on the next slide that describes what is the MEEP program, the developmental program, language-based, and learning group.

836
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,006
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't feel as though I should take your time to read these.

837
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:48,982
[SPEAKER_23]: Handouts may look a little bit different.

838
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:50,522
[SPEAKER_23]: Lisa was printing it for you today.

839
01:24:50,983 --> 01:24:56,165
[SPEAKER_23]: Because when I had hit share to Dr. Cushing, I realized the description wasn't included.

840
01:24:56,225 --> 01:25:00,027
[SPEAKER_23]: So just know Lisa has them for you, and you will be getting them.

841
01:25:03,108 --> 01:25:04,028
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanted to stop.

842
01:25:04,068 --> 01:25:04,388
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry.

843
01:25:04,408 --> 01:25:05,109
[SPEAKER_23]: Am I going too quickly?

844
01:25:07,206 --> 01:25:16,272
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanted to start with, first back to school night, we had a diversity and inclusion night that welcomed back the staff and the students.

845
01:25:16,733 --> 01:25:17,754
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a real big hit.

846
01:25:17,874 --> 01:25:23,678
[SPEAKER_23]: We talked about You Belong because the bees are our, we're the Brooks bees.

847
01:25:24,859 --> 01:25:29,382
[SPEAKER_23]: We had all the students and the families come and decorate the grounds together.

848
01:25:30,243 --> 01:25:30,683
[SPEAKER_23]: We had,

849
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:44,268
[SPEAKER_23]: the students drawing themselves out in the chalk all around the school, out in the back lower playground so that every student that came could see themselves at the Brooks.

850
01:25:45,054 --> 01:25:56,780
[SPEAKER_23]: and that everyone felt in that inclusion in that community, because that is really what we're all about, that everyone belongs and everyone is recognized.

851
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,181
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a popular event.

852
01:25:59,261 --> 01:26:03,343
[SPEAKER_23]: We had popsicles and it was very well attended.

853
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:12,787
[SPEAKER_23]: The next slide you'll see is our famous fall fest, where I know a lot of people had, oh, sorry, I went ahead of myself, sorry.

854
01:26:13,049 --> 01:26:14,210
[SPEAKER_23]: That was our first day of school.

855
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:16,671
[SPEAKER_23]: Bumbles the bee is our mascot.

856
01:26:18,252 --> 01:26:22,595
[SPEAKER_23]: And you'll see Mrs. Hardy, our secretary there, welcoming the students in on that first day.

857
01:26:24,336 --> 01:26:31,800
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, can't stress enough that you belong in our hive rules of being positive, happy, being yourself.

858
01:26:33,581 --> 01:26:38,564
[SPEAKER_23]: When you go down to slide seven, it's all about the academics and rigor.

859
01:26:39,504 --> 01:26:42,066
[SPEAKER_23]: We are right now implementing

860
01:26:42,918 --> 01:26:47,039
[SPEAKER_23]: the inter-reading as the rest of the district is for our new reading program.

861
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:53,521
[SPEAKER_23]: ECRI, Investigations, FOSS, ST Math, Hill for Literacy.

862
01:26:54,061 --> 01:27:03,004
[SPEAKER_23]: We are privileged to have several of the staff members, including myself as part of active members of the district literacy team, the DLLT.

863
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:12,921
[SPEAKER_23]: that really does help us when we come back as a PLC together and we're talking and sharing good strategies.

864
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:23,023
[SPEAKER_23]: We have different grade levels of staff members that can come back and actually just teach the teachers and have that peer-to-peer collaboration during their common planning times.

865
01:27:25,604 --> 01:27:30,525
[SPEAKER_23]: We really take advantage of the wind blocks, what everyone needs, so that we

866
01:27:31,155 --> 01:27:35,457
[SPEAKER_23]: Differentiation is just an eight and built into those daily blocks.

867
01:27:35,737 --> 01:27:48,722
[SPEAKER_23]: And so the students during the wind blocks, they're going out to receive services, they're going to reading specialists, or they're being engaged with their classroom teacher at grade level or above.

868
01:27:49,863 --> 01:27:59,487
[SPEAKER_23]: We focus a lot on the tiered model of instruction and putting in those supports to all students from enrichment to include everybody.

869
01:28:01,203 --> 01:28:04,625
[SPEAKER_23]: We're participating in district-wide early literacy screening right now.

870
01:28:04,805 --> 01:28:13,071
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a busy time for the dibbles and for our reading specialists getting to all 537 kiddos, minus the preschools, actually.

871
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,694
[SPEAKER_23]: We have library this year, special thanks this year.

872
01:28:18,734 --> 01:28:22,558
[SPEAKER_23]: The students are loving having a librarian and as a specialist.

873
01:28:23,219 --> 01:28:25,501
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate that as an instructional leader.

874
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:33,230
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you all that were involved in getting us that sixth special because now I can have meaningful common planning time with my staff.

875
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:47,203
[SPEAKER_23]: And it really is driving the instruction to be able to just have their undivided attention once a week and sort of look at our, right now we're looking in tearing apart map data and looking and saying, okay, what is the common thread here?

876
01:28:47,383 --> 01:28:48,383
[SPEAKER_23]: Where can we do better?

877
01:28:48,403 --> 01:28:49,763
[SPEAKER_23]: Where are our strengths?

878
01:28:49,943 --> 01:28:51,004
[SPEAKER_23]: Where are our weaknesses?

879
01:28:51,644 --> 01:28:55,305
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was really hard to schedule before we had that sixth prep.

880
01:28:55,385 --> 01:28:57,325
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you again for that.

881
01:28:58,185 --> 01:29:01,786
[SPEAKER_23]: It really does help me to help the teachers learn.

882
01:29:03,117 --> 01:29:14,022
[SPEAKER_23]: The full-time librarian has that space in the library that's a maker space that she's doing a lot of the STEM and the STEAM activities with them after they're getting out their library books and things.

883
01:29:14,862 --> 01:29:26,928
[SPEAKER_23]: And then my staff really enjoyed their professional development earlier this year when we had a bullying prevention, professional development for them.

884
01:29:29,451 --> 01:29:36,517
[SPEAKER_23]: I know you've been here a long time today, so I'm trying to go through these fairly quickly, but giving you some details as well, so please slow me down if you think I'm going too quickly.

885
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:38,799
[SPEAKER_23]: Into reading, I can't say enough about.

886
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,721
[SPEAKER_23]: I love our new program.

887
01:29:41,222 --> 01:29:48,588
[SPEAKER_23]: I love being a part of the district team that is meeting with Hill quite often and being part of these professional developments.

888
01:29:49,209 --> 01:29:53,793
[SPEAKER_23]: I love that the staff has great opportunities to meet with them today.

889
01:29:54,313 --> 01:30:03,856
[SPEAKER_23]: My special ed team, my grade four team and my grade five team during their comment planning time, instead of meeting with me, we're zooming into their professional development.

890
01:30:04,256 --> 01:30:06,477
[SPEAKER_23]: And then tomorrow is the rest of the grade levels.

891
01:30:06,797 --> 01:30:08,197
[SPEAKER_23]: That's an amazing opportunity.

892
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:15,379
[SPEAKER_23]: They're asking in a small group meaningful questions about activities that are happening in their classrooms and saying, how can I do this better?

893
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:17,360
[SPEAKER_23]: Is anyone else seeing this happen?

894
01:30:17,805 --> 01:30:19,546
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there something I'm not seeing in this?

895
01:30:19,626 --> 01:30:22,267
[SPEAKER_23]: Because it is voluminous.

896
01:30:22,347 --> 01:30:24,448
[SPEAKER_23]: It is a big program to take in.

897
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:28,110
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is their first year, you know, and they're really giving it their all.

898
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:35,414
[SPEAKER_23]: But sometimes it just, to be able to have that contact, you know, that is coming and talking to you and saying, I can't find this.

899
01:30:35,694 --> 01:30:36,454
[SPEAKER_23]: Where can I see it?

900
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:38,915
[SPEAKER_23]: And she's, oh, go over here to this book.

901
01:30:38,955 --> 01:30:40,896
[SPEAKER_23]: And this, it makes a huge difference.

902
01:30:40,956 --> 01:30:43,898
[SPEAKER_23]: It takes a lot of time and effort off of the staff.

903
01:30:44,685 --> 01:30:47,647
[SPEAKER_23]: I am just very grateful to have that opportunity.

904
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:53,831
[SPEAKER_23]: The stories within this curriculum are just so much more diverse than they were in the past.

905
01:30:54,332 --> 01:30:59,255
[SPEAKER_23]: The students are able to be reflective of themselves in these stories.

906
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,897
[SPEAKER_23]: They're seeing themselves more often.

907
01:31:02,717 --> 01:31:04,058
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's huge.

908
01:31:05,339 --> 01:31:07,100
[SPEAKER_23]: That is a huge plus for us.

909
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:14,405
[SPEAKER_23]: The differentiation is really interwoven into the lesson planning here.

910
01:31:15,396 --> 01:31:26,563
[SPEAKER_23]: It takes a lot of that away from the teachers because it's already planned out for them and takes that time away from having to do that on their own.

911
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:31,666
[SPEAKER_23]: I've also included the next two slides.

912
01:31:32,067 --> 01:31:38,751
[SPEAKER_23]: I won't necessarily read them to you, but it's all about the culturally responsive teaching that's embedded into

913
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:58,387
[SPEAKER_23]: The inter-reading, and I think it's just important to share that and to let you see what this new reading program looks like for the students and for the staff, and all the best practices and good teaching that is actually just readily available at their fingertips.

914
01:31:58,867 --> 01:32:04,972
[SPEAKER_23]: All these activities, differentiation, good teaching practices, it really is at their fingertips.

915
01:32:08,274 --> 01:32:09,796
[SPEAKER_23]: That's our inter-reading.

916
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:16,642
[SPEAKER_23]: The next slide here I thought was really something we should be celebrating as a fun activity that we had up in the fifth grade.

917
01:32:17,043 --> 01:32:19,605
[SPEAKER_23]: They were zooming into a NASA astronaut.

918
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:24,390
[SPEAKER_23]: Walked into that classroom and I saw him on the screen and I thought,

919
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:26,312
[SPEAKER_23]: That's pretty cool.

920
01:32:27,093 --> 01:32:31,956
[SPEAKER_23]: As someone my age and I was thinking, wow, I've never had an opportunity like this.

921
01:32:32,016 --> 01:32:34,098
[SPEAKER_23]: The fifth graders were just in awe.

922
01:32:34,418 --> 01:32:37,781
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's something that sort of I hope they get to do it again.

923
01:32:37,901 --> 01:32:39,542
[SPEAKER_23]: But to me, it was a once in a lifetime.

924
01:32:39,602 --> 01:32:42,144
[SPEAKER_23]: I've never had a chance to talk to an astronaut in space.

925
01:32:43,996 --> 01:32:52,523
[SPEAKER_23]: Our social emotional learning, I really wanna stress the fact of how proud I am that this is really a strength in our school.

926
01:32:52,963 --> 01:33:00,309
[SPEAKER_23]: We do a lot of responsive classroom training for others around the district and I find that we're a great model for that.

927
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:08,997
[SPEAKER_23]: The responsive classrooms, the zones of regulation, the Michigan model, our grade level morning meetings, Ms.

928
01:33:09,037 --> 01:33:09,277
[SPEAKER_23]: Burke,

929
01:33:09,777 --> 01:33:15,240
[SPEAKER_23]: has done a great job this year with taking some grade level morning meetings on her own.

930
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,180
[SPEAKER_23]: The kids have really loved going down.

931
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:20,182
[SPEAKER_23]: I love when we do the whole school morning meetings.

932
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:27,905
[SPEAKER_23]: We had a parent last year write a song with the third graders for the Brooks School.

933
01:33:29,586 --> 01:33:31,487
[SPEAKER_23]: I added in the link there so that you will see it.

934
01:33:32,147 --> 01:33:34,328
[SPEAKER_23]: And the third grade students are teaching

935
01:33:34,793 --> 01:33:47,562
[SPEAKER_23]: the rest of the school, actually the fourth grade students this year, are teaching the rest of the school our Brooke School song so that each morning meeting that we have together up at the gym, we can start by singing the Brooke School song.

936
01:33:47,742 --> 01:33:48,822
[SPEAKER_23]: It just brings us together.

937
01:33:48,963 --> 01:33:53,045
[SPEAKER_23]: And as a community, it just kind of fills your bucket, if you'll say.

938
01:33:54,847 --> 01:34:00,971
[SPEAKER_23]: I really do encourage the students to participate in that.

939
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:02,792
[SPEAKER_23]: They really do seem to be enjoying it.

940
01:34:04,397 --> 01:34:09,661
[SPEAKER_23]: The ILTs, which are Instructional Leadership Teams, have been going very well at the Brooks.

941
01:34:10,141 --> 01:34:26,672
[SPEAKER_23]: We meet every week, and I have a group of various stakeholders into these meetings, and it really does make a difference when we are looking at different pieces of the school day.

942
01:34:26,752 --> 01:34:31,636
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've done everything from the culture and the climate to what kind of spirit days we should have

943
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:35,687
[SPEAKER_23]: our data as far as testing goes.

944
01:34:36,487 --> 01:34:37,788
[SPEAKER_23]: We have common planning times.

945
01:34:38,388 --> 01:34:45,950
[SPEAKER_23]: Like I mentioned, the common planning times sometimes have been with Hill for literacy and sometimes with us.

946
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:56,873
[SPEAKER_23]: And then one time a month, they get to meet on their own as a grade level, and they share the notes with me so that the next week when we meet, I can answer and go over any questions they have as well.

947
01:34:56,913 --> 01:35:02,215
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that's important too, to empower our teachers and to allow them to have time to plan together

948
01:35:02,574 --> 01:35:03,815
[SPEAKER_23]: which they didn't have in the past.

949
01:35:06,897 --> 01:35:16,805
[SPEAKER_23]: Our school, social, emotional, and our school culture, I pride myself in the fact that open and frequent communication is just how to go.

950
01:35:17,066 --> 01:35:19,668
[SPEAKER_23]: You cannot over-communicate, in my opinion.

951
01:35:20,568 --> 01:35:29,175
[SPEAKER_23]: I send out a morning message that I call The Hive every day, and it has all my resources that I need the students to, I mean, sorry, the staff to have.

952
01:35:31,437 --> 01:35:41,585
[SPEAKER_23]: At the end of the week, I send out a s'mores weekly update to the community, and so that they'll have all the information, just a different platform.

953
01:35:41,845 --> 01:35:49,531
[SPEAKER_23]: The s'mores goes out to the caregivers and to the community, and I use just email for inside the school.

954
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:52,794
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a grade level morning meetings, we have spirit days.

955
01:35:53,723 --> 01:35:56,707
[SPEAKER_23]: Miss Burke is famous for her staff shout outs.

956
01:35:57,448 --> 01:36:06,299
[SPEAKER_23]: Principal of the day, students like to earn their Brooks Bees and they get to be principal of the day with us one day.

957
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:09,583
[SPEAKER_23]: I've had a lot of people want to have lunch with me this year.

958
01:36:09,623 --> 01:36:11,325
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've had a lot of lunches with the principal.

959
01:36:12,504 --> 01:36:21,347
[SPEAKER_23]: We earn Brooks Bees and our parents, our families, caregivers, they are all been invited to our coffee with the principals.

960
01:36:22,787 --> 01:36:25,768
[SPEAKER_23]: We're hoping in the spring to do tea.

961
01:36:26,428 --> 01:36:28,229
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll have an afternoon instead of a morning.

962
01:36:28,269 --> 01:36:33,611
[SPEAKER_23]: So we can try to get, you know, some people have the afternoons free versus the mornings.

963
01:36:33,671 --> 01:36:37,932
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll kind of see what we can do about making it accessible to all.

964
01:36:38,988 --> 01:36:40,790
[SPEAKER_23]: The next is our Great Kindness Challenge.

965
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:41,730
[SPEAKER_23]: We do this every year.

966
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:42,891
[SPEAKER_23]: It's near and dear to my heart.

967
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:49,297
[SPEAKER_23]: It's one of my favorite school culture buildings that we do each year.

968
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:57,844
[SPEAKER_23]: The students this year, on February 6, they have up until then to show their 100 acts of kindness.

969
01:36:57,884 --> 01:37:01,567
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're going to celebrate those in a grade level school-wide morning meeting.

970
01:37:02,543 --> 01:37:13,127
[SPEAKER_23]: We are very proud of the fact that these students are just really should be commended for their kindness that they are exuding throughout the school day.

971
01:37:15,368 --> 01:37:19,049
[SPEAKER_23]: We have some school events and cultures that we are proud of.

972
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:22,651
[SPEAKER_23]: The Winter Olympics, I did share on the next couple slides.

973
01:37:23,151 --> 01:37:28,213
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say to you that about halfway through there is a tissue

974
01:37:28,837 --> 01:37:33,360
[SPEAKER_23]: Competition between Mrs. Burke and myself, that is my favorite part of the Winter Olympics.

975
01:37:34,061 --> 01:37:39,184
[SPEAKER_23]: If you're not going to have time to watch the whole thing, I would suggest those first 30 seconds of that.

976
01:37:41,046 --> 01:37:42,727
[SPEAKER_23]: Not that I'm competitive or anything.

977
01:37:43,849 --> 01:37:45,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be practicing for next year.

978
01:37:48,833 --> 01:38:03,765
[SPEAKER_23]: So we are going to be to all school events that we've done we have had Winter Olympics we've had where your Brooks be gear or your blue and white kindness day halfway day was a fun day we did this year, we did on the 90th day of school, and we did math

979
01:38:04,685 --> 01:38:07,946
[SPEAKER_23]: problems in celebrating your math with the halfway day.

980
01:38:08,426 --> 01:38:11,526
[SPEAKER_23]: We did pajama day and sports day.

981
01:38:11,546 --> 01:38:15,047
[SPEAKER_23]: Our Brooks PTO couldn't be more generous and helpful.

982
01:38:15,207 --> 01:38:16,327
[SPEAKER_23]: They are excellent.

983
01:38:16,407 --> 01:38:21,108
[SPEAKER_23]: They help us with enrichment and planning and field trips and anything we ask them.

984
01:38:21,208 --> 01:38:32,610
[SPEAKER_23]: Some of the examples include trivia night, mystery readers, buses, enrichment, k-mini day, you belong events that we did back to school, the fall fest, open mic nights, which we have one on Friday,

985
01:38:33,688 --> 01:38:37,152
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyone want to come and have some karaoke time, you're welcome to join us.

986
01:38:37,613 --> 01:38:40,616
[SPEAKER_23]: Food drives, Election Day bake sales, book fairs.

987
01:38:41,797 --> 01:38:44,700
[SPEAKER_23]: The next page there, you'll see the fun that we had at the Fall Fest.

988
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:47,423
[SPEAKER_23]: That is always a big hit.

989
01:38:47,904 --> 01:38:52,188
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a lot of alumni come back, and we have a lot of community members stop by and join us.

990
01:38:52,249 --> 01:38:52,949
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a great day.

991
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:59,776
[SPEAKER_23]: And like I said, I did enter in those winter Olympics, the next couple of slides.

992
01:39:00,456 --> 01:39:01,276
[SPEAKER_23]: They really are.

993
01:39:01,576 --> 01:39:12,620
[SPEAKER_23]: This year, the third grade staff has been planning this for years and having the assistant principal and principal come down and compete against each other for the third grade.

994
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:16,621
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, this year, the third grade teachers planned it for the entire school.

995
01:39:17,065 --> 01:39:28,828
[SPEAKER_23]: And then instead of having just the assistant principal and principal participating in this throughout, we did a few, three or four of the activities, and then they invited the teachers to volunteer to come up.

996
01:39:29,008 --> 01:39:40,131
[SPEAKER_23]: And that I think really kind of engaged the students and they were excited to see their teachers up there and rolling down the Oreos in their mouths and see if they could get it in.

997
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:45,312
[SPEAKER_23]: And it was just very, very kind of the third grade teachers to do that for us.

998
01:39:46,044 --> 01:39:55,049
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to say also the students were included in between different competitions.

999
01:39:55,909 --> 01:39:58,491
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a trivia question for each grade level.

1000
01:39:58,571 --> 01:40:03,834
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really was inclusive of administration, staff, and the students.

1001
01:40:03,874 --> 01:40:06,075
[SPEAKER_07]: It was extremely well run, very well run.

1002
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:09,097
[SPEAKER_23]: So the next slide, you're gonna see the halfway day.

1003
01:40:09,817 --> 01:40:10,818
[SPEAKER_23]: That was the 90th day.

1004
01:40:10,858 --> 01:40:11,938
[SPEAKER_23]: They had math centers.

1005
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:14,540
[SPEAKER_23]: That was all about the 90th day of school.

1006
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:18,213
[SPEAKER_23]: Then we had community outreach and involvement.

1007
01:40:18,234 --> 01:40:20,257
[SPEAKER_23]: We are always excited to have the mystery reader.

1008
01:40:20,297 --> 01:40:26,928
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you all that came in and helped to celebrate read-a-thon with us and read to the students.

1009
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:36,216
[SPEAKER_23]: Each year, our students around Veterans Day write letters to thank them for the service for the country.

1010
01:40:36,376 --> 01:40:42,601
[SPEAKER_23]: And so it was really impressive this year to see the number of letters that went out and to read the content of those heartfelt letters.

1011
01:40:42,682 --> 01:40:51,389
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thought that it was deserving of a shout out here tonight of celebrating the kindness that they exuded towards those veterans.

1012
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:54,732
[SPEAKER_23]: We have some student leadership opportunities at the Brooks.

1013
01:40:55,973 --> 01:40:59,575
[SPEAKER_23]: Our CCSR is up and running with Mr. Coates and Ms.

1014
01:40:59,916 --> 01:41:00,236
[SPEAKER_23]: Rose.

1015
01:41:00,836 --> 01:41:07,141
[SPEAKER_23]: They are in the middle of finalizing their projects and will be carrying them out this spring.

1016
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:15,587
[SPEAKER_23]: We have fifth grade student council and we have kindergarten buddies in which the fifth grade go and they read to

1017
01:41:16,463 --> 01:41:20,766
[SPEAKER_23]: the kindergarten once a week, or they do any kind of projects or centers.

1018
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:25,229
[SPEAKER_23]: And they also do help with some bus buddies as well.

1019
01:41:25,889 --> 01:41:34,515
[SPEAKER_23]: And this year, because we have five kindergarten, we also have a fourth grade class that's helping as well with the kindergarten buddies.

1020
01:41:36,089 --> 01:41:42,994
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a new rock wall, thanks to some PTO funding from our fall fest and all the fundraising that we had.

1021
01:41:44,255 --> 01:41:46,457
[SPEAKER_23]: The students are so excited.

1022
01:41:46,957 --> 01:41:47,758
[SPEAKER_23]: They really are.

1023
01:41:48,098 --> 01:41:53,783
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a couple of pictures on here with the gym teacher helping the students up on that.

1024
01:41:54,243 --> 01:42:02,289
[SPEAKER_23]: And I will have to say, I was really a little bit nervous about, you know, people keeping it,

1025
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:07,636
[SPEAKER_23]: So nobody was getting hurt, but it's amazing.

1026
01:42:08,176 --> 01:42:16,908
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. Sacco has it up and running, and the protocol is set, and the kids just love it, and I just love to see them getting all their energy out and enjoying it.

1027
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:23,051
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to end the year strong with a specialist showcase in May, our trivia night.

1028
01:42:23,251 --> 01:42:25,372
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to have a fundraiser at the Ford Tavern.

1029
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:30,133
[SPEAKER_23]: We're right now pushing out new Brooks merchandise.

1030
01:42:30,794 --> 01:42:35,395
[SPEAKER_23]: One of our PTO members has created new merchandise and is going to send them out.

1031
01:42:35,895 --> 01:42:45,938
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a kindergarten meet and greet coming up, moving on ceremony, field day, field trips, kindergarten end of the year celebration, ice cream socials, enrichment programs, and our concerts.

1032
01:42:46,798 --> 01:42:55,961
[SPEAKER_23]: But I just want to thank you, school committee, mayor, superintendent, central administration, and the whole community for allowing me to share this information with you.

1033
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:58,962
[SPEAKER_23]: It truly is a pleasure working for the Medford Public Schools.

1034
01:42:59,822 --> 01:43:02,943
[SPEAKER_23]: And I will take any questions you have at this time.

1035
01:43:03,824 --> 01:43:04,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

1036
01:43:04,264 --> 01:43:04,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Simos.

1037
01:43:04,644 --> 01:43:05,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

1038
01:43:05,064 --> 01:43:05,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Burke.

[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin?

1040
01:43:07,985 --> 01:43:08,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, thank you.

1041
01:43:08,845 --> 01:43:14,467
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really comprehensive and exciting as a former Bricks

1042
01:43:15,051 --> 01:43:16,472
[SPEAKER_09]: parent three times over.

1043
01:43:16,812 --> 01:43:21,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I can attest to all the fun that happens at the school.

1044
01:43:22,136 --> 01:43:26,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering about your I know you said you're at 537.

1045
01:43:26,579 --> 01:43:29,681
[SPEAKER_09]: What is space looking like for you guys?

1046
01:43:29,741 --> 01:43:30,181
[SPEAKER_23]: It's tight.

1047
01:43:30,501 --> 01:43:31,322
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's tight.

1048
01:43:31,902 --> 01:43:33,083
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't have any extra classrooms.

1049
01:43:33,764 --> 01:43:33,924
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

1050
01:43:33,944 --> 01:43:44,251
[SPEAKER_23]: So you know, we had 110 that we we had one classroom that we used to use for like our lunch with the principal and

1051
01:43:45,171 --> 01:43:49,333
[SPEAKER_23]: any type of meetings, overflow, there aren't any classes like that anymore.

1052
01:43:49,393 --> 01:43:53,675
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, strings and bands are in the PTO room now because there's no space for them.

1053
01:43:54,336 --> 01:44:00,199
[SPEAKER_23]: We had such a high number of students sign up for it that we just couldn't fit them in one area.

1054
01:44:00,559 --> 01:44:02,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're really at your max capacity right now.

1055
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:03,621
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely.

1056
01:44:04,201 --> 01:44:04,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1057
01:44:04,941 --> 01:44:05,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1058
01:44:05,421 --> 01:44:06,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for the

1059
01:44:06,854 --> 01:44:10,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Program details, I know you didn't get to that slide, it was added on to our handout.

1060
01:44:10,697 --> 01:44:13,819
[SPEAKER_23]: That was my fault, I didn't realize it wasn't in the packet when we got shared, I'm sorry.

1061
01:44:13,839 --> 01:44:15,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's great, and it's really helpful information.

1062
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:16,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you mind sharing that too?

1063
01:44:17,521 --> 01:44:18,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you already share that?

1064
01:44:18,942 --> 01:44:19,983
[SPEAKER_23]: We had gone through it quickly.

1065
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:21,584
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I missed it.

1066
01:44:21,624 --> 01:44:22,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1067
01:44:22,505 --> 01:44:22,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1068
01:44:23,185 --> 01:44:24,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So can I ask a question about that?

1069
01:44:24,887 --> 01:44:24,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1070
01:44:25,307 --> 01:44:29,390
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the developmental program, what grades are those?

1071
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:30,991
[SPEAKER_23]: K to two.

1072
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:32,730
[SPEAKER_09]: K to two, okay.

1073
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:34,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And how many students do you know generally?

1074
01:44:34,551 --> 01:44:35,791
[SPEAKER_23]: Right now, there's three of them in there.

1075
01:44:36,251 --> 01:44:36,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Three?

1076
01:44:36,731 --> 01:44:36,931
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1077
01:44:37,271 --> 01:44:39,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And one teacher?

1078
01:44:39,432 --> 01:44:39,892
[SPEAKER_23]: One teacher.

1079
01:44:40,132 --> 01:44:40,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And any power?

1080
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:42,472
[SPEAKER_23]: There is a shared power.

1081
01:44:42,872 --> 01:44:44,813
[SPEAKER_09]: One teacher and a shared power, okay, thank you.

1082
01:44:45,253 --> 01:44:48,674
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for the language-based, what grades are those?

1083
01:44:49,334 --> 01:44:56,155
[SPEAKER_23]: So language-based, we have two fifth grades this year that have a power and a teacher in each classroom.

1084
01:44:56,695 --> 01:44:58,576
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we have a classroom that has grades

1085
01:44:59,431 --> 01:45:03,733
[SPEAKER_23]: who three and four or just three and four with the teacher and a parent there.

1086
01:45:04,213 --> 01:45:04,513
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1087
01:45:04,693 --> 01:45:04,833
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1088
01:45:04,853 --> 01:45:05,373
[SPEAKER_23]: Three and four.

1089
01:45:05,413 --> 01:45:05,653
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry.

1090
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:10,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So three language based classrooms, two or two or fourth and fifth grade, no two or fifth grade.

1091
01:45:10,835 --> 01:45:12,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And one is, um, two fifth grade.

1092
01:45:12,696 --> 01:45:12,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1093
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,796
[SPEAKER_09]: And one, three, four, one, three, four.

1094
01:45:15,137 --> 01:45:15,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1095
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:16,177
[SPEAKER_23]: A developmental.

1096
01:45:16,937 --> 01:45:17,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1097
01:45:17,537 --> 01:45:19,778
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, uh, the learning learning group.

1098
01:45:20,198 --> 01:45:21,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So what grade is learning group?

1099
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:25,320
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, that one has two, three and four, two, three and four.

1100
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:26,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1101
01:45:27,461 --> 01:45:27,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1102
01:45:29,884 --> 01:45:32,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, we have our student rep that would like to speak, Darren.

1103
01:45:32,525 --> 01:45:35,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, I just had a quick question.

1104
01:45:35,486 --> 01:45:35,906
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1105
01:45:36,006 --> 01:45:41,948
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just wondering if I could get some more details regarding the student council at the Brooks Elementary School.

1106
01:45:42,408 --> 01:45:42,668
Sure.

1107
01:45:43,028 --> 01:45:46,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Regarding the roles, the number of students, and contact information.

1108
01:45:47,369 --> 01:45:48,249
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, sure.

1109
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:52,171
[SPEAKER_23]: So our fifth grade is who is involved in our student council.

1110
01:45:52,191 --> 01:45:54,191
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. Allen, M-A-L-L-E-N,

1111
01:45:57,566 --> 01:46:07,549
[SPEAKER_23]: at medford.k12.ma.us, and Nicole Sulo, N-S-U-L-L-O, at Medford.

1112
01:46:08,649 --> 01:46:12,370
[SPEAKER_23]: They're the two fifth grade teachers that would be your contacts for it.

1113
01:46:13,591 --> 01:46:24,374
[SPEAKER_23]: They run this program during lunch and recess time, and the students are coming up with different ways to improve the Brooks School.

1114
01:46:26,187 --> 01:46:42,402
[SPEAKER_23]: After they vet different ideas through the school, they come and they sit with Mrs. Burke and myself, and we have conversations about how they would like to see us better the school in the school day.

1115
01:46:43,543 --> 01:46:51,390
[SPEAKER_23]: They will also put voting boxes or questions or surveys out.

1116
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:58,205
[SPEAKER_23]: so that they're making sure that all the students are represented when they come to see us.

1117
01:46:58,725 --> 01:47:03,649
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's actually really a good quality of what they're doing for us.

1118
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:08,353
[SPEAKER_23]: And we welcome that because the student voice really is important to us.

1119
01:47:08,433 --> 01:47:11,135
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is that first line of it.

1120
01:47:12,796 --> 01:47:20,702
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say right now, I'd have to get back to you with an exact number, but they typically have three to four that are,

1121
01:47:22,188 --> 01:47:26,549
[SPEAKER_23]: from each class, so that would give you right around like 15 to 20 students that are meeting with them.

1122
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:37,332
[SPEAKER_23]: But if you want to reach out to me at the Brooks, S-D-M-O-S, D-E-M-O-S, I'm more than happy to get you that information.

1123
01:47:37,352 --> 01:47:39,633
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, thank you.

1124
01:47:39,973 --> 01:47:41,453
[SPEAKER_23]: Very well, very, very welcome.

1125
01:47:41,553 --> 01:47:41,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1126
01:47:42,153 --> 01:47:43,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for the presentation.

1127
01:47:43,574 --> 01:47:45,014
[SPEAKER_13]: We have- Oh, sorry.

1128
01:47:45,074 --> 01:47:46,494
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, I have another one.

1129
01:47:46,514 --> 01:47:48,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Olapare, then Member McLaughlin.

1130
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:48,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1131
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for being here.

1132
01:47:49,901 --> 01:47:50,582
[SPEAKER_23]: No, absolutely.

1133
01:47:50,702 --> 01:47:51,602
[SPEAKER_02]: A quick question.

1134
01:47:51,703 --> 01:47:54,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to the 537 students, it's a two part question.

1135
01:47:55,165 --> 01:48:04,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have an idea of the teacher educational professional in the classroom to student ratio at this time, as well as do we feel like we're being supported with the amount of education professionals in the schools in total.

1136
01:48:06,475 --> 01:48:08,456
[SPEAKER_23]: So, the number of teach.

1137
01:48:08,737 --> 01:48:10,318
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry it wasn't the number of

1138
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:13,122
[SPEAKER_23]: teachers to students ratio, is that what you said?

1139
01:48:13,162 --> 01:48:17,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers, paras, aides, however you want to quantify the educational thresholds in the classroom.

1140
01:48:17,164 --> 01:48:18,765
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so not every classroom has an aide.

1141
01:48:18,785 --> 01:48:34,155
[SPEAKER_23]: It just, it depends on, right now it's whatever our learning, we have the five sub-separate classrooms, and those sub-separate classrooms will have a para within them, and then the kindergarten will also have a kindergarten aide in those, so I have those five.

1142
01:48:35,942 --> 01:48:42,126
[SPEAKER_23]: Our classes run anywhere from about 17 to 20 with the teacher in front of them.

1143
01:48:44,408 --> 01:48:45,909
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, was there a second part to that?

1144
01:48:46,069 --> 01:48:51,793
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one would be partly like, do we feel like we're being supported in the school with the amount of professionals that are in the building right now?

1145
01:48:51,833 --> 01:48:55,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we feeling we're struggling to have the coverage we need and things like that?

1146
01:48:56,516 --> 01:49:04,121
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I'll tell you, if I had a wish list, I would wish for a substitute bank

1147
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:27,057
[SPEAKER_23]: so that we could, you know, fill those classrooms and, you know, not, you know, poor Mrs. Burke is running here, there, and everywhere, you know, oh, I'm gonna be this parent today, I'm gonna be that, you know, just so that we make sure that we're meeting the individual needs of each student, because it's what we're here for and what we're, it's important.

1148
01:49:27,437 --> 01:49:29,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Everything else can get done after three o'clock, right?

1149
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:31,641
[SPEAKER_23]: But,

1150
01:49:32,853 --> 01:49:42,835
[SPEAKER_23]: If I might just sneak another piece of that in about being supportive is that I would love to see bus monitors in Medford.

1151
01:49:43,795 --> 01:49:53,837
[SPEAKER_23]: The amount of time out of the day that we are policing the videos on the bus, I would love to be able to turn into instructional leadership.

1152
01:49:54,677 --> 01:49:56,498
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just, it's a lot.

1153
01:49:57,098 --> 01:50:00,139
[SPEAKER_23]: And you know, these bus drivers have 77 students out of 79 seats or 80 seats.

1154
01:50:02,349 --> 01:50:03,530
[SPEAKER_23]: they're full of capacity.

1155
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:14,117
[SPEAKER_23]: And so it's a lot to ask to keep your eye on the road, keep these, you know, and by the way, there's 77 behind you that I also need you to manage.

1156
01:50:14,718 --> 01:50:31,490
[SPEAKER_23]: So I am yet in my former district when I was sitting in the seats that you are, we had come up with a plan on how to fill those roles that I'd be more than happy to share with you.

1157
01:50:32,105 --> 01:50:33,566
[SPEAKER_23]: But I don't want to take your time tonight.

1158
01:50:33,626 --> 01:50:34,847
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a lot on your agenda.

1159
01:50:35,347 --> 01:50:41,030
[SPEAKER_23]: But I just wanted to, as I have this opportunity, just sort of seize it since you asked a question.

1160
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:55,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to share that in my few months at the Brooks, as Shannon has said, I've spent quite a bit of time digesting and viewing bus tape for

1161
01:50:55,818 --> 01:50:58,019
[SPEAKER_07]: minor infractions to major infractions.

1162
01:50:58,499 --> 01:51:07,423
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's really notable is I've had at least four students over the last month ask me if we can procure bus monitors.

1163
01:51:07,864 --> 01:51:11,825
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't use the word procure, but Mrs. Burke, can we get bus monitors?

1164
01:51:12,406 --> 01:51:23,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And today I had a student in my office, I was asking some questions about the bus and he said, do you think we could get someone to ride the bus for say a week?

1165
01:51:24,531 --> 01:51:29,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe I could just let you know after that week how things are going every day.

1166
01:51:30,513 --> 01:51:32,334
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're talking about a second grader.

1167
01:51:32,854 --> 01:51:34,455
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what the second grader wants to do.

1168
01:51:34,815 --> 01:51:39,737
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's just something that the students also are recognizing.

1169
01:51:40,177 --> 01:51:42,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the complaints are small, but they're important.

1170
01:51:43,118 --> 01:51:44,138
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just so loud.

1171
01:51:44,318 --> 01:51:48,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really unavoidable when you have that many students on a bus.

1172
01:51:49,521 --> 01:51:55,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think that the students themselves are now recognizing that, and I think that that's notable.

1173
01:51:55,264 --> 01:51:57,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1174
01:51:57,906 --> 01:51:58,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1175
01:51:58,246 --> 01:51:58,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin?

1176
01:52:11,175 --> 01:52:11,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1177
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:18,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to say I wanted to thank my colleague for that question, because I think it's really important to know what people need and appreciate your candor.

1178
01:52:19,212 --> 01:52:21,333
[SPEAKER_09]: and let us know what those things are.

1179
01:52:21,553 --> 01:52:30,916
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had a question about the reading specialist and whether you have any Orton-Gillingham trained specialists at the school.

1180
01:52:31,376 --> 01:52:31,856
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, we do.

1181
01:52:32,036 --> 01:52:38,098
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have right now Landmark working with our special ed teachers who are training.

1182
01:52:38,558 --> 01:52:42,539
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going through a program with the Landmark teachers as well.

1183
01:52:43,379 --> 01:52:44,180
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll have even more.

1184
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:45,000
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1185
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:48,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you have one now or two for the Orton-Gillingham

1186
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:50,961
[SPEAKER_09]: got accredited.

1187
01:52:55,263 --> 01:52:56,543
[SPEAKER_23]: Can I get back to you on that?

1188
01:52:56,723 --> 01:52:57,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1189
01:52:57,384 --> 01:52:58,144
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'd love to hear more.

1190
01:52:58,184 --> 01:53:05,427
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm thinking in my brain, and I can come up with two or three that I want I want to say are already accredited.

1191
01:53:09,749 --> 01:53:11,169
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Joan will come up.

1192
01:53:11,249 --> 01:53:11,650
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry.

1193
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:13,350
[SPEAKER_23]: They will send I was thinking, Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

1194
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:14,751
[SPEAKER_23]: This is why I wanted to get back to you.

1195
01:53:14,791 --> 01:53:14,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1196
01:53:15,011 --> 01:53:16,812
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to hear more about the landmark program.

1197
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:17,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1198
01:53:18,308 --> 01:53:20,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so we have two.

1199
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:28,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Teachers who are Wilson trained right now and two teachers who are in the process of completing their Orton Gillingham.

1200
01:53:28,135 --> 01:53:35,000
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll be done at the end of this school year, so they will be able to start using implementing the program next year.

1201
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:37,021
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you and so the Wilson.

1202
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:38,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that balance literacy?

1203
01:53:39,443 --> 01:53:41,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, yeah, thank you.

1204
01:53:43,986 --> 01:53:44,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1205
01:53:44,967 --> 01:53:46,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

1206
01:53:47,335 --> 01:53:50,039
[SPEAKER_22]: I just have one clarifying question about the bus monitors.

1207
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:55,606
[SPEAKER_22]: In the district that you're referring to, did you have your own busing or did you have a vendor?

1208
01:53:56,287 --> 01:53:56,848
[SPEAKER_23]: We had a vendor.

1209
01:53:57,349 --> 01:53:58,570
[SPEAKER_22]: You did have a vendor, excellent.

1210
01:53:59,011 --> 01:53:59,271
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1211
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:06,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary, I also say just, you know, special shout out to the bus drivers with 77 kids behind them.

1212
01:54:06,924 --> 01:54:09,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the image is just really harrowing.

1213
01:54:09,886 --> 01:54:11,747
[SPEAKER_23]: No disrespect to them by any means.

1214
01:54:11,908 --> 01:54:16,170
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just a matter of it's a cumbersome job to do both monitor and drive.

1215
01:54:17,011 --> 01:54:23,535
[SPEAKER_23]: And so, like I said, I was just seizing the moment, sharing my thoughts and my hopes and dreams.

1216
01:54:24,536 --> 01:54:25,177
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1217
01:54:25,217 --> 01:54:25,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

1218
01:54:25,697 --> 01:54:26,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks so much.

1219
01:54:28,331 --> 01:54:36,994
[SPEAKER_13]: And our last presentation by Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment Innovation Operations, and Ms.

1220
01:54:37,094 --> 01:54:41,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Avery Hines, Director of Health Services on the excessive heat protocol.

1221
01:54:42,076 --> 01:54:42,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Cushing.

1222
01:54:43,476 --> 01:54:47,498
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there any chance we could get some excessive heat in here?

1223
01:54:50,339 --> 01:54:52,339
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got a coat on and I'm freezing to death.

1224
01:54:52,899 --> 01:54:53,540
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm wearing my... 67.

1225
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that is?

1226
01:55:03,928 --> 01:55:04,228
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.

1227
01:55:12,352 --> 01:55:14,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

1228
01:55:14,053 --> 01:55:14,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1229
01:55:15,034 --> 01:55:23,198
[SPEAKER_03]: My co-presenter, unfortunately, is not able to be here with us tonight as it's that time of year with things moving around.

1230
01:55:23,838 --> 01:55:28,641
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do want to thank Avery for her really partnership

1231
01:55:29,321 --> 01:55:31,802
[SPEAKER_03]: in delivering this to you.

1232
01:55:32,022 --> 01:55:37,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I sent it out to you about two weeks ago, so you had enough time to read and come up with any questions.

1233
01:55:37,384 --> 01:55:39,725
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll run through it for the general public.

1234
01:55:39,785 --> 01:55:44,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're considering using inclement weather protocols in the event of excessive heat.

1235
01:55:44,967 --> 01:55:48,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So excessive heat, this is very different than a snow emergency, which is

1236
01:55:48,949 --> 01:55:52,891
[SPEAKER_03]: primarily about the safety of getting people to and from school.

1237
01:55:54,052 --> 01:55:56,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is considering what the heat might be.

1238
01:55:56,573 --> 01:55:59,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the definitions of excessive heat.

1239
01:56:00,475 --> 01:56:14,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So heat index of 102 degrees for more than three hours per day for two consecutive days, or heat index between 90 degrees and 100 degrees for three consecutive days or more, or a heat index of more than 105 degrees for any period of time.

1240
01:56:15,284 --> 01:56:17,565
[SPEAKER_22]: And do you want questions now or at the end?

1241
01:56:19,091 --> 01:56:20,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Cushing, at the end, is that helpful?

1242
01:56:20,996 --> 01:56:22,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, at the end would be great.

1243
01:56:22,559 --> 01:56:23,000
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't mind.

1244
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:23,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1245
01:56:23,882 --> 01:56:24,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1246
01:56:25,746 --> 01:56:31,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Metropolitan Public Schools recognizes that students are often safest and most secure when in the schoolhouse.

1247
01:56:32,208 --> 01:56:38,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Caregivers have jobs to report to, as we were considering, and students potentially being left home alone.

1248
01:56:39,530 --> 01:56:51,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, among a great many other things, many students receive two meals daily, in addition to nursing, counseling, care, in addition to the academics they get from our wonderful educators.

1249
01:56:53,808 --> 01:57:01,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the grid put out by the National Weather Service that shows the heat index and relative humidity.

1250
01:57:01,653 --> 01:57:05,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are we using heat index instead of just temperature?

1251
01:57:05,796 --> 01:57:08,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is heat index is your real field temperature.

1252
01:57:09,738 --> 01:57:14,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And the body has a significantly harder time cooling itself as the heat index gets higher.

1253
01:57:17,463 --> 01:57:21,566
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've created an excessive heat operations team in the protocol.

1254
01:57:22,173 --> 01:57:33,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent, myself, Director of Health Services, Facilities Director, Director of Athletics, Communications Director, Board of Health Director for the City of Medford, and our District Physician.

1255
01:57:34,815 --> 01:57:40,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So we came up with several steps, several levels for heat control steps.

1256
01:57:40,976 --> 01:57:49,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So caution, scheduled rest and hydration breaks, during outdoor playtime, scheduled recess prior to lunch,

1257
01:57:49,838 --> 01:57:52,420
[SPEAKER_03]: move outdoor activities to shaded areas or inside.

1258
01:57:53,000 --> 01:58:13,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Athletics will follow the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, MIAA heat protocol, and then family notification of proper care during excessive heat that will work with our communications director and the director of health services, Avery, for the families and students to access.

1259
01:58:15,465 --> 01:58:40,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Extreme caution has all of the elements of the caution section, but adding no outdoor activities, encourage hydration, encourage the wearing of light clothing, the use of fans and air conditioning, and the athletics protocol will be implemented on a sport by sport, sport by sport, case by case, sorry for that error, with consideration of time of day and activity involved.

1260
01:58:43,210 --> 01:58:54,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Danger is all elements of caution and extreme caution sections above, and a determination of early release or school closure, if necessary.

1261
01:58:54,616 --> 01:59:01,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, taking into consideration students are generally speaking best within the schoolhouse, as mentioned earlier.

1262
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:07,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And then extreme danger, all elements of the caution, extreme caution and danger sections above.

1263
01:59:08,263 --> 01:59:11,165
[SPEAKER_03]: School closed for academic and extra activities.

1264
01:59:11,265 --> 01:59:23,213
[SPEAKER_03]: However, consultation with the Board of Health and Office of the Mayor concerning facility use as cooling centers, and then meal preparation for students in need for families to pick up meals.

1265
01:59:23,773 --> 01:59:33,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So to still provide those services as necessary, especially from those buildings in our district that have cooling in kitchens.

1266
01:59:35,101 --> 01:59:44,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And then communication, I can read that all to you, but we will have prepared messages ready to go, as mentioned earlier, with our communications director.

1267
01:59:45,209 --> 01:59:59,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have some equipment considerations that do have a budgetary impact, but purchasing shade structures, purchasing some misting devices, the shade structures can see a reduction about 15 degrees.

1268
02:00:00,592 --> 02:00:01,932
[SPEAKER_03]: in perceived temperature.

1269
02:00:03,133 --> 02:00:16,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Misting devices can reduce air temperature up to 30 degrees in various dry environments, increase the number of water coolers available to students, and increase number of drinking water.

1270
02:00:17,423 --> 02:00:24,066
[SPEAKER_03]: maintain on hand a supply of 10,000 waters, where we have about 5,000 students and staff in the district.

1271
02:00:24,547 --> 02:00:34,832
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be two per day, and we'd be looking to restock as necessary, but have an initial on-hand capacity of 10,000 waters specifically designated for this.

1272
02:00:35,874 --> 02:00:37,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Air conditioning is being reviewed.

1273
02:00:38,858 --> 02:00:54,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an extensive project partnering with the city and repaired to operational readiness in all locations and fans purchased for Medford High School classrooms to make sure we have air movement and we're exploring other options as necessary.

1274
02:00:58,110 --> 02:01:01,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, as requested, the excessive heat protocol.

1275
02:01:02,493 --> 02:01:05,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to hear any questions, suggestions, comments, or other things.

1276
02:01:05,894 --> 02:01:06,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1277
02:01:06,255 --> 02:01:07,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1278
02:01:08,076 --> 02:01:10,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham, then Member Branley.

1279
02:01:11,197 --> 02:01:11,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1280
02:01:11,457 --> 02:01:12,298
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Member McLaughlin.

1281
02:01:13,298 --> 02:01:20,023
[SPEAKER_22]: On the first page, the heat index, the definition for excessive heat, we may want to take a look at that.

1282
02:01:20,383 --> 02:01:21,524
[SPEAKER_22]: It's 101 degrees.

1283
02:01:21,584 --> 02:01:23,945
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not considered excessive heat according to the protocol.

1284
02:01:24,746 --> 02:01:27,908
[SPEAKER_22]: There's missing data in that what's excessive heat.

1285
02:01:28,989 --> 02:01:34,392
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, you know, there's in the first item there, it's like for three hours for two consecutive days.

1286
02:01:35,113 --> 02:01:36,614
[SPEAKER_22]: But then in the other two, it's

1287
02:01:37,452 --> 02:01:53,484
[SPEAKER_22]: there's no like amount of time required, like in the third option there, if it's 105 for one minute at noon and one day, that's considered a excessive, like we should just tighten that up so that it actually makes sense for all of the scenarios that would happen.

1288
02:01:53,524 --> 02:01:57,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now there's some gaps, but we don't need to rehash those right now.

1289
02:01:58,287 --> 02:02:03,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to work with Avery on those because she definitely had the specific information.

1290
02:02:03,683 --> 02:02:16,254
[SPEAKER_03]: pertaining to those, but I think, honestly, when the heat index is more than 105 for any period of time, it's that the overall heat environment is going to be so detrimental.

1291
02:02:16,274 --> 02:02:24,601
[SPEAKER_22]: The 105 does seem sort of the, I mean, 105's crazy times, but 101 is also kind of weird that it's missing.

1292
02:02:24,621 --> 02:02:27,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, can definitely work with her on that.

1293
02:02:27,523 --> 02:02:29,986
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, oh, I printed it.

1294
02:02:30,306 --> 02:02:31,247
[SPEAKER_22]: Where are my notes?

1295
02:02:40,601 --> 02:02:49,196
[SPEAKER_22]: is there's there's a couple of references essentially to the MIA heat protocol and without seeing it I just want to

1296
02:02:51,701 --> 02:03:02,544
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not going to put down the MIAA, but every single year we see a news story of athletics that lets or forces kids to participate in sports until they die.

1297
02:03:03,865 --> 02:03:07,566
[SPEAKER_22]: So I want to know what that MIAA heat protocol looks like.

1298
02:03:07,886 --> 02:03:11,567
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it more conservative, less conservative than our heat protocol?

1299
02:03:12,007 --> 02:03:13,248
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's less conservative,

1300
02:03:15,269 --> 02:03:27,575
[SPEAKER_22]: that I think we need a conversation around that because the science around what's healthy and all that other stuff isn't different for students that happen to be participating in sports.

1301
02:03:27,915 --> 02:03:41,903
[SPEAKER_22]: And we see that every single year in this country where it's like, you gotta play your football in a well, you know, and with coaches and other places, not here necessarily, but coaches that don't let you take water breaks

1302
02:03:42,663 --> 02:03:54,788
[SPEAKER_22]: really some pretty egregious stuff that I'm not suggesting we have here, but whenever I hear about another protocol that is not mentioned, I'm nervous that it's not aligned with ours.

1303
02:03:55,469 --> 02:03:58,290
[SPEAKER_22]: And if it's not aligned with ours, we need a real conversation around

1304
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:00,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

1305
02:04:00,628 --> 02:04:14,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And member Ruseau just also, one of the critical things with football and lacrosse, and if there are other sports that wear helmets outside, it's really making sure that you remove the helmet so that heat can escape the body as opposed to being trapped in.

1306
02:04:14,641 --> 02:04:18,906
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the modifications that we would expect our coaches to make.

1307
02:04:19,786 --> 02:04:24,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And lacrosse, as we look into late May and June as our climate shifts.

1308
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:25,661
[SPEAKER_22]: Great, thank you.

1309
02:04:25,761 --> 02:04:31,906
[SPEAKER_22]: And then there's a reference to our policy EBCD emergency closings.

1310
02:04:32,607 --> 02:04:34,028
[SPEAKER_22]: I took a look at that and read it.

1311
02:04:34,168 --> 02:04:35,389
[SPEAKER_22]: It looked fine.

1312
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:42,075
[SPEAKER_22]: I just think that, did you all take a look at it or just reference it?

1313
02:04:42,874 --> 02:04:44,695
[SPEAKER_03]: but we definitely took a look at it.

1314
02:04:45,355 --> 02:04:48,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be honest, we did this back in October and November.

1315
02:04:49,496 --> 02:04:53,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So my exact recollections of how deep we looked at it, but we definitely did.

1316
02:04:53,477 --> 02:04:56,678
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's not the longest policy, but it's pretty good.

1317
02:04:57,058 --> 02:05:04,381
[SPEAKER_22]: I do like a couple of the other things that aren't relevant, so I won't make us stay here all night long, but thank you.

1318
02:05:04,421 --> 02:05:09,062
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate you getting this going.

1319
02:05:10,923 --> 02:05:11,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1320
02:05:11,243 --> 02:05:11,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

1321
02:05:13,183 --> 02:05:13,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1322
02:05:14,043 --> 02:05:15,184
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of questions.

1323
02:05:17,244 --> 02:05:25,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the intent of this was not that when it gets hot, we'll consider doing things, but instead that we will do things.

1324
02:05:25,287 --> 02:05:36,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the lead off sentence needs to change so it doesn't sound like we're going to maybe do it if we sort of feel like it, instead of saying this is actually what you can expect from us when these things happen.

1325
02:05:37,929 --> 02:05:54,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think like, as I read it, I got a little bit sort of spun around across the document because I feel like the heat index is super clear and the table, like the set of bullets around caution, extreme caution, danger, and extreme danger is like the right framework.

1326
02:05:55,374 --> 02:06:02,316
[SPEAKER_06]: What got muddy for me is like, we'll do this if these other set of things exist.

1327
02:06:02,376 --> 02:06:04,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as I was thinking about it,

1328
02:06:05,552 --> 02:06:11,636
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's too hot on one day, we should do these things based on what we're saying we're going to do if we're in caution.

1329
02:06:12,076 --> 02:06:20,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And it shouldn't have to rise to the level of it being many days, but instead, if it hits caution, then we should do the caution things.

1330
02:06:20,942 --> 02:06:24,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it hits extreme caution, we should do the extreme caution things.

1331
02:06:24,925 --> 02:06:32,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like those three bullets are just throwing me off because I don't see it as,

1332
02:06:33,650 --> 02:06:39,998
[SPEAKER_06]: it feels like that sort of creates like a little bit of a game of like, well, we didn't know it was going to be this way for two consecutive days.

1333
02:06:40,058 --> 02:06:47,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think that was the intent, but I feel like it caused, like it caused me to sort of read the document a couple times and be like, how does this

1334
02:06:47,506 --> 02:06:51,888
[SPEAKER_06]: How does this map where I think it just added some confusion that doesn't need to be there?

1335
02:06:52,029 --> 02:06:56,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we're going to do caution things when it's caution, then that's super crystal clear.

1336
02:06:56,791 --> 02:06:59,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm definitely happy to change it.

1337
02:06:59,713 --> 02:07:02,374
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the committee sees fit with any suggestions.

1338
02:07:03,455 --> 02:07:06,917
[SPEAKER_03]: The only one we could find was in was from Arizona.

1339
02:07:08,017 --> 02:07:28,031
[SPEAKER_03]: as kind of a guidepost and what we were trying to figure out was those triggering events to establish the caution, extreme caution, danger, extreme danger, to try to identify those like triggering moments for when we would implement this as opposed to just implementing it.

1340
02:07:28,911 --> 02:07:32,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think in a sort of related comment,

1341
02:07:33,769 --> 02:07:42,158
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, there needs to be a set of things we'll do in a building that has air conditioning and a set of things that we'll do in a building that does not.

1342
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:54,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, so I think like your bullets around caution, extreme caution, like probably in my mind become a table of like, here's what's happening at our elementary schools, at our middle schools, where like where we have working air conditioning.

1343
02:07:55,526 --> 02:08:06,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would include things like three days before we expect this heat to come, we're going to execute a checklist that makes sure all of our systems are in operating order, or five days before, whatever the right timeline is.

1344
02:08:06,795 --> 02:08:15,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to say that we see it coming, and we're going to be on top of it as best we can, because I feel like we weren't back in the fall.

1345
02:08:15,242 --> 02:08:18,865
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew the heat was coming, and still we weren't quite ready for it.

1346
02:08:18,985 --> 02:08:25,130
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think part of this is about some trigger for us to say, we're going to go get ready for this

1347
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:29,541
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that we think is coming so that we can actually be ready.

1348
02:08:30,181 --> 02:08:44,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we have concerns about an air conditioning compressor, we know it three days in advance to do something alternative rather than it just not turning on on the really hot day and then having no backup plan.

1349
02:08:44,725 --> 02:08:49,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So to me, what do we reasonably expect with working air conditioning?

1350
02:08:49,367 --> 02:08:50,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And what will we do in those schools?

1351
02:08:51,428 --> 02:08:56,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other on the flip side, what are we going to do in the high school where there is no air conditioning?

1352
02:08:57,110 --> 02:09:07,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it appropriate to sort of say, if we have an air conditioning issue in a building, they're going to revert to like the high school plan because they essentially then don't have air conditioning.

1353
02:09:07,395 --> 02:09:19,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So that to me, that was sort of what I was thinking about as I was reading through this is like that piece needs to be like a little bit more fleshed out and clear so that it's,

1354
02:09:20,484 --> 02:09:37,516
[SPEAKER_06]: evident to people reading it that there are different plans because there has to be like, you know, what we're going to do at the Brooks with working air conditioning, it just doesn't, it's not going to work at the high school for a whole variety of reasons, you know, and, you know, someday we'll get to fix that.

1355
02:09:37,596 --> 02:09:45,622
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the meantime, we still have hot days and kids that are in teachers that are in buildings that are excessively hot.

1356
02:09:46,323 --> 02:09:46,503
[SPEAKER_06]: So

1357
02:09:47,250 --> 02:10:05,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that does sort of when we start talking about like canceling school, like I think that makes it a little bit more complicated because maybe like the answer is you can't, you don't cancel school for almost everybody, but you have to cancel school for the high school because it's oppressive and there's no air conditioning.

1358
02:10:05,205 --> 02:10:14,913
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what I want to see in terms of like that piece to be a little bit more fleshed out so that people can visualize like, what does this look like when it happens?

1359
02:10:16,107 --> 02:10:20,950
[SPEAKER_06]: we everyone can know that we here's what we're doing to get prepared when these things happen.

1360
02:10:21,010 --> 02:10:22,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what makes us get prepared.

1361
02:10:23,072 --> 02:10:29,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you know that there's a reasonable expectation that we have time to react when it happens.

1362
02:10:31,037 --> 02:10:45,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think the other question that I had is what is the cost of the items on the list so that we can react to those needs and

1363
02:10:46,892 --> 02:10:53,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you have those costs or how we get those costs, but that was the other thing I was wanting to see is what

1364
02:10:54,414 --> 02:10:57,916
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what does it, what will it cost to get these things completed?

1365
02:10:57,996 --> 02:11:07,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, in partnership with the city, have started pricing out, especially the air conditioning repairs, preventative maintenance contracts are on the table.

1366
02:11:08,443 --> 02:11:14,347
[SPEAKER_03]: The misting devices would be more of a rental from United Rentals or Taylor Rental.

1367
02:11:14,587 --> 02:11:16,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't really see that being an investment.

1368
02:11:17,389 --> 02:11:25,134
[SPEAKER_03]: for the district to make, given the limited deployment that they would see, and the difficulty at times to hook them up to water.

1369
02:11:26,615 --> 02:11:29,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Purchasing shade structures, we've looked into that.

1370
02:11:30,217 --> 02:11:35,540
[SPEAKER_03]: There's purchasing the shade structure, then the weights to make sure that they're secure in case there's wind.

1371
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:44,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes on these hot days, there may be high winds as well, as we've started to notice with just the ground level turbulence.

1372
02:11:46,267 --> 02:11:49,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, took a deep dive on this and educated myself.

1373
02:11:49,409 --> 02:11:53,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So making sure that those shade structures do not become projectiles.

1374
02:11:54,791 --> 02:12:05,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, just as an aside, in continuing the design of the McGlynn playground, one of the things that we were just on a call today was making sure that there's shade over the climber, various things along those lines.

1375
02:12:06,116 --> 02:12:07,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we move forward,

1376
02:12:07,617 --> 02:12:09,058
[SPEAKER_03]: with other renovations.

1377
02:12:09,578 --> 02:12:12,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can definitely get more hard numbers on those.

1378
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:17,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have priced out, we've started to price out the various air conditioning repairs.

1379
02:12:18,443 --> 02:12:23,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I, and I think first, we have to like know what those things will cost.

1380
02:12:24,027 --> 02:12:26,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have to procure them in some way.

1381
02:12:26,788 --> 02:12:30,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to me, they move out of this, like, this is equipment that we need.

1382
02:12:30,451 --> 02:12:36,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And they move into this is how we will deploy this equipment in our like set of caution, extreme caution

1383
02:12:36,676 --> 02:12:37,737
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1384
02:12:38,938 --> 02:12:47,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So that people can really reasonably understand what it looks like when these things are in motion and we can communicate about them in advance.

1385
02:12:47,844 --> 02:12:57,231
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think those were my big major questions is just to see a little bit of tightening up of that triggering event.

1386
02:12:57,611 --> 02:12:59,152
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we going to do?

1387
02:12:59,172 --> 02:13:03,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in Arizona, it's probably reasonable that everybody has air conditioning in Arizona.

1388
02:13:03,775 --> 02:13:05,897
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't exist there without air conditioning.

1389
02:13:07,511 --> 02:13:12,854
[SPEAKER_06]: that is like on top of, on top of, you know, that, but we're not in that position here.

1390
02:13:12,934 --> 02:13:17,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we don't have air conditioning at the high school and it's oppressively hot.

1391
02:13:17,957 --> 02:13:20,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have it in some locations, right.

1392
02:13:20,959 --> 02:13:24,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in most places in the high school that students and teachers are in.

1393
02:13:25,362 --> 02:13:25,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1394
02:13:26,122 --> 02:13:26,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1395
02:13:26,983 --> 02:13:32,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are some of the changes I would like to see to this document before we consider it final.

1396
02:13:32,366 --> 02:13:34,527
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think the other question is,

1397
02:13:35,705 --> 02:13:46,327
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, again, the cost, but also like what has to change about how our maintenance staff operates in order to make sure all these systems stay functioning.

1398
02:13:48,768 --> 02:13:49,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1399
02:13:50,128 --> 02:13:52,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Branley and then Member McLaughlin.

1400
02:13:53,329 --> 02:13:54,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, hello.

1401
02:13:54,449 --> 02:13:59,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think mine pretty much piggybacks off of what Member Graham had to say.

1402
02:14:00,970 --> 02:14:02,531
[SPEAKER_08]: On the first page, I'm just curious, these $102,005

1403
02:14:04,172 --> 02:14:05,454
[SPEAKER_08]: This is outside, correct?

1404
02:14:05,994 --> 02:14:06,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1405
02:14:06,796 --> 02:14:14,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So my concern with that being our level spot there, are we checking what's inside?

1406
02:14:15,587 --> 02:14:18,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm guessing the temperature inside is going to be much hotter.

1407
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:19,741
[SPEAKER_08]: temperature outside.

1408
02:14:19,761 --> 02:14:32,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it goes to Memogram's point of each building might be individual and making sure that we're able to accurately check certain spaces, yes.

1409
02:14:32,831 --> 02:14:35,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, because that makes me nervous, especially up at the high school.

1410
02:14:35,212 --> 02:14:46,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And then is there a way to link that MIA heat protocol with our protocol when the time comes so that somebody can just click on it and then we're there?

1411
02:14:47,313 --> 02:14:50,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Thank you.

1412
02:14:50,715 --> 02:14:51,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, yes.

1413
02:14:51,696 --> 02:14:58,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So my most questions were on the equipment needs, like when, how we paying for it.

1414
02:14:59,540 --> 02:15:00,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Rentals great.

1415
02:15:00,921 --> 02:15:05,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going to be across the district if we have a rental for a misting who's who's walking through the Mr.

1416
02:15:06,687 --> 02:15:07,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it like a vegetable mister?

1417
02:15:08,028 --> 02:15:09,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this is what I kept picturing.

1418
02:15:09,089 --> 02:15:10,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, are we just gonna walk through with our clothes on?

1419
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:11,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what is this?

1420
02:15:11,991 --> 02:15:13,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it outside?

1421
02:15:13,171 --> 02:15:13,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally speaking, yes.

1422
02:15:14,072 --> 02:15:14,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

1423
02:15:14,472 --> 02:15:15,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what's happening?

1424
02:15:15,933 --> 02:15:28,222
[SPEAKER_03]: If you search cool zone, that's one brand name, but it's essentially something you'd see on the sideline of athletic competitions that are fans and it would- I'm a football fan.

1425
02:15:28,322 --> 02:15:28,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that.

1426
02:15:28,882 --> 02:15:29,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

1427
02:15:29,402 --> 02:15:29,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with you.

1428
02:15:30,403 --> 02:15:30,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1429
02:15:30,944 --> 02:15:33,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't, it wouldn't necessarily soak a person.

1430
02:15:33,405 --> 02:15:34,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just provide an opportunity.

1431
02:15:34,266 --> 02:15:35,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just a little crate.

1432
02:15:37,048 --> 02:15:43,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the high school, obviously, I'm guessing one of the larger concerns overall for all the schools.

1433
02:15:43,853 --> 02:15:47,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know exactly how many schools have air conditioning and who doesn't.

1434
02:15:47,596 --> 02:15:49,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, are we supposed to talk about that?

1435
02:15:49,337 --> 02:15:51,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm assuming that that can be public knowledge, right?

1436
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:53,961
Absolutely.

1437
02:15:55,041 --> 02:15:58,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm assuming they all have it, but is it all functioning?

1438
02:16:01,417 --> 02:16:03,358
[SPEAKER_13]: We want me to speak to it.

1439
02:16:03,458 --> 02:16:08,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, right because I feel like that's, that's a good question.

1440
02:16:08,962 --> 02:16:27,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we're working on this I've grabbed hold of, like, I think the new council school committee has answers on some of the things I'm working on with the administration and the school department security cameras door locks and heat and air conditionings next so we had a senior work off tax work off.

1441
02:16:29,162 --> 02:16:32,964
[SPEAKER_13]: air conditioning professional come in and evaluate all of our air conditioners.

1442
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:39,428
[SPEAKER_13]: We need a great deal of work at the middle schools as well.

1443
02:16:40,188 --> 02:16:41,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Middle schools and high school.

1444
02:16:41,189 --> 02:16:44,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Middle schools and high school for the most part, but I'm talking millions and millions.

1445
02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:51,714
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is important that we do have the excessive heat protocol because it's not going to be something we're going to be able to fix by the spring.

1446
02:16:51,754 --> 02:16:52,935
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to take a group effort.

1447
02:16:52,975 --> 02:16:56,317
[SPEAKER_13]: It might even take regional collaboration with the MAPC

1448
02:16:57,096 --> 02:16:59,039
[SPEAKER_13]: based on the federal dollars that are coming down.

1449
02:16:59,159 --> 02:17:01,243
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are definitely working on it.

1450
02:17:01,543 --> 02:17:11,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Cushing, superintendents, as well as John McLaughlin have been in meetings with the city team, because it's going to take a big group effort.

1451
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:24,242
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've asked for I have asked for like do can we support it can the electrical support air conditioners, their standalone air conditioners at the window units can be that you know the windows don't accommodate window units.

1452
02:17:24,502 --> 02:17:28,907
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know Dr. Cushing and Mr. McLaughlin are trying to assess that.

1453
02:17:29,639 --> 02:17:38,289
[SPEAKER_13]: because I would hope that we would be able to spend some money to get something, especially in the upper classrooms of our middle schools and high school, especially.

1454
02:17:39,150 --> 02:17:47,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, we also got a report about what was functional and not functional, like in the fall.

1455
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:51,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you send it to the new committee members?

1456
02:17:51,539 --> 02:17:56,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I can also work to update it over the next week.

1457
02:17:56,602 --> 02:17:57,742
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

1458
02:17:57,842 --> 02:18:17,252
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we're also looking at if, again, United Rentals, it would be one, but we're pricing out what it might look like to provide supplemental to one of our facilities that's most in need.

1459
02:18:18,863 --> 02:18:21,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I was here during that meeting as an audience member.

1460
02:18:22,206 --> 02:18:28,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the conversation about the compressors and how depressed I was on the other side of the rail to hear some of the

1461
02:18:29,423 --> 02:18:30,905
[SPEAKER_08]: answers, sadly.

1462
02:18:31,065 --> 02:18:49,063
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I was just curious, you know, if we're doing an assessment at the high school or at the middle school, fans, air conditioning, you know, standalone units, whatever, is that going to be at least those things in place before the heat comes and we're not saying, oh, it's a hot day, like we didn't expect it to be hot in June?

1463
02:18:49,784 --> 02:18:51,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want us to be proactive.

1464
02:18:51,725 --> 02:18:52,966
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working diligently.

1465
02:18:53,106 --> 02:18:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: We are.

1466
02:18:53,587 --> 02:19:05,955
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working diligently to if we were to add air conditioning to certain spaces of the high school, it requires, first of all, the electrical, which we do, we do have that.

1467
02:19:06,075 --> 02:19:13,761
[SPEAKER_03]: But it requires the wiring to each individual room, the glass cuts to the windows, the brackets on the outside.

1468
02:19:14,781 --> 02:19:17,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a it's a substantial amount of

1469
02:19:18,624 --> 02:19:21,466
[SPEAKER_03]: lead time and work to do that.

1470
02:19:21,486 --> 02:19:23,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

1471
02:19:24,528 --> 02:19:24,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1472
02:19:25,308 --> 02:19:26,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau.

1473
02:19:27,629 --> 02:19:28,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1474
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:31,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate my colleagues asking about differentiation between the buildings.

1475
02:19:32,332 --> 02:19:34,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to ask about differentiation for students.

1476
02:19:34,613 --> 02:19:38,956
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are students obviously that are in our schools that are going to be much more vulnerable.

1477
02:19:38,976 --> 02:19:47,881
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm thinking of students with significant disabilities, CP, what have you, that are going to be really, really vulnerable to the heat index as well, and maybe at

1478
02:19:48,257 --> 02:20:03,546
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, buildings where there is or is not air conditioning and, you know, incorporated in the plan, I would like that included in terms of what are we doing with our significantly disabled population for the heat index, that there's cooling rooms, that there's gonna be cooling rooms there for students.

1479
02:20:03,566 --> 02:20:14,332
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, years ago, there was a lot of overheating and I remember community members were actually bringing independent cooling systems to the schools

1480
02:20:15,299 --> 02:20:17,240
[SPEAKER_09]: for students to be able to use.

1481
02:20:17,541 --> 02:20:19,362
[SPEAKER_09]: There were some rooms that were enclosed rooms.

1482
02:20:19,382 --> 02:20:29,809
[SPEAKER_09]: There was the, one of the rooms that they created that was a sort of like a sensory room that was like a relaxation area that they created cooling spaces.

1483
02:20:29,910 --> 02:20:44,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to really incorporate how we're differentiating some of the emergency planning for, you know, our kindergarteners obviously who don't regulate or may not be able to talk about when they're

1484
02:20:44,755 --> 02:20:49,522
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, really overheated and other students that populations that really need to be considered.

1485
02:20:49,932 --> 02:20:51,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to look at that with Avery.

1486
02:20:51,133 --> 02:20:58,456
[SPEAKER_03]: We did also discuss that the nurses in the buildings are usually very in tune with the students needing those.

1487
02:20:59,536 --> 02:21:10,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think at the time, I'm happy to go back to it, happy to put a section in, but that the nurses are the ones who are really in tune and knowing those students' needs.

1488
02:21:11,201 --> 02:21:12,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I would agree in some of the cases.

1489
02:21:12,582 --> 02:21:14,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that that's all.

1490
02:21:14,243 --> 02:21:19,425
[SPEAKER_09]: And so also there's individual health care plans that families can help create and that school

1491
02:21:19,969 --> 02:21:21,270
[SPEAKER_09]: educators know about.

1492
02:21:21,350 --> 02:21:31,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So individual health care plans can be addendums to IEPs, 504s, even individual, without a 504, an IEP can create an individualized health care plan.

1493
02:21:32,377 --> 02:21:38,900
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that should be something that families can know about and can be considered as part of this as well, because I think it's really critical.

1494
02:21:38,981 --> 02:21:44,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Because some of the nursing staff may or may not know some of the students, depending on their conditions.

1495
02:21:44,904 --> 02:21:49,587
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking particularly of a student maybe that doesn't communicate with words, but is getting overheated.

1496
02:21:49,997 --> 02:21:51,898
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not typically in the nurse's office.

1497
02:21:52,798 --> 02:21:58,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be, you know, someone that has a real issue and we're not really thinking about how we're being proactive in that.

1498
02:21:58,801 --> 02:22:02,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd really like that to be included in maybe in collaboration with Ms.

1499
02:22:02,563 --> 02:22:04,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen and her team would be great.

1500
02:22:05,745 --> 02:22:06,105
Thank you.

1501
02:22:06,385 --> 02:22:06,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1502
02:22:07,926 --> 02:22:08,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1503
02:22:08,246 --> 02:22:08,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

1504
02:22:09,687 --> 02:22:10,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1505
02:22:10,067 --> 02:22:12,468
[SPEAKER_22]: I just looked up the average length of heat waves.

1506
02:22:13,028 --> 02:22:15,009
[SPEAKER_22]: We're up to about four days now.

1507
02:22:15,990 --> 02:22:18,171
[SPEAKER_22]: The only time you will not be able to replace your 10,000

1508
02:22:20,226 --> 02:22:22,407
[SPEAKER_22]: water bottles is during a heat wave.

1509
02:22:22,467 --> 02:22:25,689
[SPEAKER_22]: So we don't need 10,000 on hand, we need 40,000 on hand.

1510
02:22:26,249 --> 02:22:29,631
[SPEAKER_22]: And God, I have no idea where you're going to put 40,000 bottles of water.

1511
02:22:31,011 --> 02:22:34,253
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll pretend that there's no environmental impact to that for the moment.

1512
02:22:35,894 --> 02:22:41,816
[SPEAKER_22]: But if you have 10,000, then you have to cancel school the next three days of the heat wave, because you have no water.

1513
02:22:42,337 --> 02:22:49,140
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, if that's part of the plan to have water bottles on hand, which I

1514
02:22:50,145 --> 02:22:56,227
[SPEAKER_22]: think might be worth talking about because, I mean, we're not assuming there's not gonna be water in the school functionally.

1515
02:22:56,607 --> 02:23:01,788
[SPEAKER_22]: If the water doesn't work in the schools, I assume we have to cancel anyways, because you can't flush the toilets.

1516
02:23:02,468 --> 02:23:16,672
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, that 10,000, that two bottles of water per person per day, if that's something that we really wanna stick with, we have to get a lot more water if there's really a strong rationale behind that.

1517
02:23:17,410 --> 02:23:23,716
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know the conversations that went into why, but, you know.

1518
02:23:24,476 --> 02:23:42,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's making sure that those students who don't come to school with a water bottle and other, like, that we'll be able to put these in our walk-in coolers, bring them down to temperature and at least give people something that will allow them that temperature relief, as well as hydration.

1519
02:23:42,952 --> 02:23:44,574
[SPEAKER_22]: No, yeah, I mean, I okay.

1520
02:23:45,655 --> 02:23:47,918
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do agree on the on the environmental impact.

1521
02:23:48,498 --> 02:23:54,565
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, there is that but also like, you know, we don't want to have day to be like, well, we used up our water supply.

1522
02:23:54,605 --> 02:23:58,449
[SPEAKER_22]: So now we our plan is that we have to now cancel school because we don't have water.

1523
02:23:58,489 --> 02:24:00,551
[SPEAKER_22]: So, and then the other thing was,

1524
02:24:02,568 --> 02:24:10,552
[SPEAKER_22]: You were mentioning, you know, the misting devices and the things that you would presumably set up rental agreements with.

1525
02:24:11,633 --> 02:24:25,920
[SPEAKER_22]: I assume when we do those rental agreements, we're going to make sure that those rental agreements include something that sort of gives us, you know, I assume that they don't have 100 of these things at every rental place.

1526
02:24:26,681 --> 02:24:28,702
[SPEAKER_22]: And when there's a heat wave coming,

1527
02:24:29,505 --> 02:24:31,006
[SPEAKER_22]: other people are going to be looking for them too.

1528
02:24:31,066 --> 02:24:39,091
[SPEAKER_22]: So like, we need to make sure that our rental agreement isn't just that this is going to be our price, but that we'll get first dibs on them.

1529
02:24:39,251 --> 02:24:48,016
[SPEAKER_22]: Because, again, having plans for things that then are not going to actually be available is not a spot anybody wants to be in.

1530
02:24:48,456 --> 02:24:53,740
[SPEAKER_22]: And then for the fans, you know, not that I want to spend a million dollars on fans.

1531
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:55,841
[SPEAKER_22]: But if the backup plan for

1532
02:24:56,926 --> 02:25:02,628
[SPEAKER_22]: the outside schools or the elementary and the middle schools is to use fans if the air conditioning isn't working.

1533
02:25:02,668 --> 02:25:06,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, then we need to have purchased enough fans for the entire high school.

1534
02:25:06,449 --> 02:25:13,832
[SPEAKER_22]: And then at least one of those other schools, if we assume one of them is possibly gonna go offline from air conditioning, it's a lot of fans.

1535
02:25:14,032 --> 02:25:23,035
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just, some, I mean, aside from the costs, like there's the storage, there's the distribution, there's the,

1536
02:25:23,902 --> 02:25:29,811
[SPEAKER_22]: build a new high school, we're probably not going to have the kind of massive amounts of space laying around to store stuff.

1537
02:25:30,332 --> 02:25:34,359
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, some of these things are perfectly logical, but they're also

1538
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:40,581
[SPEAKER_22]: in the actual implementation things that I'm wondering how they'll really work out.

1539
02:25:40,641 --> 02:26:03,147
[SPEAKER_03]: The fans are really only contemplated for the high school because the mission is to make sure that we have our air conditioning functioning and that we have preventative maintenance contracts in place that when something happens, we're able to appropriately service our facilities so that we're able to maintain the proper temperature coming out of the vent.

1540
02:26:04,628 --> 02:26:05,388
[SPEAKER_22]: If I may,

1541
02:26:06,283 --> 02:26:16,210
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't for a second doubt the intent of anyone on this particular point, but I would say that it is unlikely in the next two years for that to be a reality.

1542
02:26:16,230 --> 02:26:26,177
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, the millions of dollars that have to be spent to make that a reality, not to mention then the procurement, then the actual doing the work, that's not happening this summer.

1543
02:26:29,259 --> 02:26:33,201
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, we will have a heat wave this year.

1544
02:26:33,221 --> 02:26:35,543
[SPEAKER_22]: There's like a 0% chance we're not gonna have a heat wave.

1545
02:26:36,327 --> 02:26:39,648
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, it's maybe 0% is not the right amount.

1546
02:26:39,788 --> 02:26:46,471
[SPEAKER_22]: But, um, so I'm just worried because, you know, we started the last school year in a bad spot.

1547
02:26:47,171 --> 02:26:51,133
[SPEAKER_22]: And frankly, I mean, for the new members, you haven't quite experienced it yet.

1548
02:26:51,273 --> 02:27:01,077
[SPEAKER_22]: But most of us are pretty sick and tired of the same conversations about the fact that we had all summer long, and we didn't notice that the air conditioning was broken at an elementary school.

1549
02:27:01,977 --> 02:27:02,117
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm

1550
02:27:04,474 --> 02:27:05,496
[SPEAKER_22]: really tired of that.

1551
02:27:05,636 --> 02:27:17,933
[SPEAKER_22]: So while I understand we want to buy enough fans just for the high school, I want to buy enough fans to at least have one of the other schools not have functional air conditioning because I fully believe that's what's going to happen in the next couple of years.

1552
02:27:18,874 --> 02:27:20,256
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to be wrong.

1553
02:27:20,436 --> 02:27:21,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd really like to be wrong.

1554
02:27:21,932 --> 02:27:25,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I do also want to say that it may have already launched already.

1555
02:27:25,695 --> 02:27:51,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Brenda Pike from the Office of Sustainability, Economic Development, anything else I'm forgetting, was working with me and Fiona Maxwell to put out an RFQ as part of that RFQ, RFP, I always forget, my apologies, but is to, we added to it to make sure that the three, in designing the upgrades necessary for the Andrews and the McGlynn,

1556
02:27:52,772 --> 02:28:17,922
[SPEAKER_03]: it's an OPM design RFQ was to also make sure that the three other elementary schools outside of the McGlynn and the Andrews complex were also up to full operational readiness realizing that you know those systems are you know they're in much better situation from work that was done in 2019 but

1557
02:28:20,998 --> 02:28:25,022
[SPEAKER_03]: what all systems are, all systems have a lifespan, I should say.

1558
02:28:25,402 --> 02:28:25,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1559
02:28:25,983 --> 02:28:28,185
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just want also sort of a clarifying question.

1560
02:28:28,225 --> 02:28:41,397
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, I believe Medford does not usually do delayed start because of the number of days of actual education we provide is the minimum the state allows for other districts to have like 184,

1561
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:48,002
[SPEAKER_22]: that pay their teachers for 189 days like Cambridge.

1562
02:28:49,744 --> 02:28:52,826
[SPEAKER_22]: If they do that, it's a different conversation.

1563
02:28:53,306 --> 02:29:00,272
[SPEAKER_22]: So we don't do delayed starts, but if we need to close an elementary school, we close the district, is that correct?

1564
02:29:02,756 --> 02:29:13,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It closing one school poses just a challenge logistically when later in the year you're running buses for an additional day as just one example.

1565
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:14,541
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1566
02:29:14,561 --> 02:29:21,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And providing services for that one additional day can be costly for districts to be off cycle.

1567
02:29:21,923 --> 02:29:22,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not impossible.

1568
02:29:24,024 --> 02:29:25,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it is not impossible.

1569
02:29:25,346 --> 02:29:26,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just good.

1570
02:29:26,647 --> 02:29:34,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, what does it look like in the dollars and cents literally of just as one example, you're running buses for one additional day.

1571
02:29:34,233 --> 02:29:36,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, since it's not, it doesn't sound like it's a desi thing.

1572
02:29:36,935 --> 02:29:37,996
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just a financial thing.

1573
02:29:38,036 --> 02:29:39,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Then I'm not gonna be all worried about that.

1574
02:29:39,878 --> 02:29:41,319
[SPEAKER_22]: But okay, thank you so much.

1575
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:43,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr Cushing.

1576
02:29:43,341 --> 02:29:45,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

1577
02:29:45,743 --> 02:29:45,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1578
02:29:46,648 --> 02:29:47,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Reinfeld.

1579
02:29:47,268 --> 02:29:48,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Dr. Cushing.

1580
02:29:51,849 --> 02:30:02,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So most of my questions were addressed particularly around the triggering of, you know, is this predicted heat for three days or is this actual because after three days it's already been excessive heat.

1581
02:30:03,152 --> 02:30:08,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost can't believe I'm asking this and this is to Member Ruseau's point about conversations we keep having over and over.

1582
02:30:09,974 --> 02:30:12,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Encouraging hydration bathroom policies.

1583
02:30:15,208 --> 02:30:16,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there something built in there?

1584
02:30:16,389 --> 02:30:24,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this has been controversial across the district about access to bathrooms, but when we're encouraging hydration, this is going to impact that.

1585
02:30:25,536 --> 02:30:28,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there something we need to be considering on that front?

1586
02:30:29,739 --> 02:30:30,479
[SPEAKER_15]: At the high school, you mean?

1587
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:31,240
[SPEAKER_05]: At the high school.

1588
02:30:32,881 --> 02:30:39,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't heard problems at other schools, but I do know frequency of students using the bathroom.

1589
02:30:40,199 --> 02:30:41,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard it disruptive.

1590
02:30:41,319 --> 02:30:43,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know it's disruptive.

1591
02:30:43,320 --> 02:30:51,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone trying to leave the house with a child knows it's disruptive, but just what that looks like in the policy.

1592
02:30:51,822 --> 02:31:03,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my other point is the acknowledgement of the services that school provide, but also perhaps an acknowledgement that many home environments are also unsafe in excessive heat.

1593
02:31:04,568 --> 02:31:17,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I mean that is the other thing too is even though some air conditioning in the district may not be the greatest, it's still cooler than in many locations.

1594
02:31:17,756 --> 02:31:27,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cooler than it is in a child's home many times and it that I think I actually wrote we wrote that Avery and I wrote that in there as one of the things to consider when

1595
02:31:28,462 --> 02:31:29,743
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, making sure the kids are.

1596
02:31:29,763 --> 02:31:30,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I see it.

1597
02:31:30,564 --> 02:31:30,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1598
02:31:31,205 --> 02:31:31,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it's fine.

1599
02:31:32,486 --> 02:31:49,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's just a really good point is to really mention, is to mention that is that, again, the schoolhouse for a plethora of reasons, okay, is oftentimes the safest place for students to be on those days.

1600
02:31:51,544 --> 02:31:53,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And your bathroom point is well taken.

1601
02:31:55,239 --> 02:31:57,561
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're working right now.

1602
02:31:57,581 --> 02:32:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council gave us some money several years ago.

1603
02:32:01,204 --> 02:32:06,488
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually working to address some of our issues with the high school bathrooms.

1604
02:32:07,028 --> 02:32:16,996
[SPEAKER_03]: While not complete renovations, we'll hopefully in the coming weeks and months, really be able to provide a better experience for our students in those bathrooms.

1605
02:32:18,237 --> 02:32:19,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

1606
02:32:19,458 --> 02:32:28,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just ask that we look at an updated version of this with some of the cost information and an extra vision by beginning of March?

1607
02:32:28,642 --> 02:32:28,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1608
02:32:29,103 --> 02:32:31,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever you're ready, but by the beginning of March?

1609
02:32:31,504 --> 02:32:31,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1610
02:32:32,204 --> 02:32:32,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1611
02:32:32,504 --> 02:32:32,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1612
02:32:33,065 --> 02:32:35,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll aim to have it early again.

1613
02:32:37,307 --> 02:32:38,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for having it early.

1614
02:32:38,407 --> 02:32:39,348
[SPEAKER_13]: That was fantastic.

1615
02:32:40,029 --> 02:32:40,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, thank you.

1616
02:32:40,629 --> 02:32:51,458
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not have any presentations or continued business, but we do have new business under number 82024-2 offered by member Graham, member Rousseau, and Mayor Lungo-Koehn, myself.

1617
02:32:51,938 --> 02:33:05,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas Medford High School has been accepted into the eligibility phase of the Massachusetts School Building Authority Capital Project Pipeline, and whereas the Medford School Committee seeks to accelerate the time spent in the eligibility phase wherever possible,

1618
02:33:06,121 --> 02:33:30,366
[SPEAKER_13]: and whereas the building committee will require a substantial amount of information that only the superintendent's team can provide once it is established, we resolved the school committee requests the superintendent to begin working to collect the data necessary to complete key deliverables and the MSBA's eligibility process, including educational profile questionnaire, chapter 74 viability, and maintenance and capital planning questionnaire.

1619
02:33:30,486 --> 02:33:32,346
[SPEAKER_13]: We had further resolved that an initial draft

1620
02:33:32,847 --> 02:33:37,609
[SPEAKER_13]: of the information required to complete these documents is created no later than March 31st, 2024.

1621
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:42,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Submitted on January 24th, 2024 for tonight's agenda.

1622
02:33:42,372 --> 02:33:43,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion for approval?

1623
02:33:43,912 --> 02:33:45,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just say something first?

1624
02:33:46,374 --> 02:34:00,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I looked at these three deliverables, there's lots and lots of information that, you know, the building committee is going to need to receive and think about when we start to sort of finalize,

1625
02:34:01,704 --> 02:34:08,289
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just a lot of blocking and tackling that's gonna have to happen before the building committee can meaningfully engage with that.

1626
02:34:08,369 --> 02:34:13,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So the educational profile includes things like, what is the current configuration of your classrooms?

1627
02:34:13,173 --> 02:34:13,993
[SPEAKER_06]: How many are there?

1628
02:34:14,093 --> 02:34:15,495
[SPEAKER_06]: How many science labs are there?

1629
02:34:16,515 --> 02:34:17,896
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your teaching method?

1630
02:34:17,936 --> 02:34:20,398
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your class size in each of these classrooms?

1631
02:34:20,879 --> 02:34:27,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And on and on and on about the space that we use and the way that we educate kids.

1632
02:34:28,629 --> 02:34:31,772
[SPEAKER_06]: The vocational profile is even more detailed than that.

1633
02:34:31,872 --> 02:34:41,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wants to know our current programs, our current capacity, our desired capacity, any new programs that we're trying to create space for and

1634
02:34:42,813 --> 02:34:47,755
[SPEAKER_06]: like information that backs up our desire for capacity.

1635
02:34:47,835 --> 02:35:12,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would have to show, like if we were saying we want this program to be able to double in size, we would have to show evidence of demand that that is a reasonable thing to be asking for, as well as competitive, like data from the marketplace saying that there is demand in the marketplace for students with these skills coming out and where else we might educate students about these things.

1636
02:35:12,930 --> 02:35:18,597
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of variables going on in the vocational space that have to be collected and then in the maintenance plan.

1637
02:35:19,409 --> 02:35:20,710
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of important things.

1638
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:23,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 20 variable system.

1639
02:35:24,051 --> 02:35:29,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's 20 factors that they're going to evaluate us on in our maintenance plan.

1640
02:35:30,034 --> 02:35:46,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on our answers and our practices, we can receive up to two additional incentive points, which essentially means two percentage points of reimbursement over and above what they will set us at as a district based on all the other factors that they usually use.

1641
02:35:47,110 --> 02:35:55,637
[SPEAKER_06]: an increasing number of ways that districts can up their reimbursement rate if they do certain things, if they, in this case, commit to maintaining buildings, et cetera.

1642
02:35:56,197 --> 02:36:02,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some other places where that becomes important along the way in terms of decisions that the building committee will make.

1643
02:36:02,643 --> 02:36:12,951
[SPEAKER_06]: But the building committee is going to need a lot of advanced work from the administrative team in order to be able to start and get off to the races as quickly as possible.

1644
02:36:14,985 --> 02:36:33,991
[SPEAKER_06]: My goal for this, and as I talked to the mayor and to member Rousseau was just to say, we all agree that we want you all to start doing this work to collect this data so that when we form the committee, there's actually just a pile of data waiting for them to start to work through.

1645
02:36:34,591 --> 02:36:42,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I did put a resolution on for our next meeting to talk about the creation of the building committee.

1646
02:36:42,173 --> 02:36:43,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can have that conversation next week.

1647
02:36:44,649 --> 02:36:49,890
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of as a preview, but hoping that we can pass this tonight so the superintendent's team can get to work.

1648
02:36:50,390 --> 02:36:51,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Graham.

1649
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:52,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau.

1650
02:36:53,271 --> 02:36:53,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

1651
02:36:54,451 --> 02:36:55,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is helpful.

1652
02:36:56,011 --> 02:37:00,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be really good to have a committee of the whole to talk about the process.

1653
02:37:01,053 --> 02:37:12,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this motion makes sense, but I'm not sure that everybody on the committee is as well versed on MSBA and what their requirements are and what the eligibility phase is versus which

1654
02:37:13,476 --> 02:37:16,717
[SPEAKER_09]: the acceptance phases versus what the questions are that we need to have answers.

1655
02:37:16,777 --> 02:37:32,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I think we need to have a committee of the whole or some other explanation of exactly what the process is and what is going to be asked through the phases so that as we're considering a building committee, we have some knowledge of what is actually gonna be asked and so that the public does as well.

1656
02:37:33,262 --> 02:37:36,923
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that there's another phase after and whether we get accepted, but yeah.

1657
02:37:38,163 --> 02:37:41,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Just on that before I turn the mic to Member Ruseau, I know that we,

1658
02:37:42,697 --> 02:37:48,142
[SPEAKER_13]: we were offered the ability to meet with the MSBA while they were given these updates.

1659
02:37:48,202 --> 02:37:55,388
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are great documents that maybe the superintendent could provide us, send to this entire committee so that everybody can take a look first.

1660
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:59,512
[SPEAKER_13]: And if, in my opinion, if a meeting is needed after that, then so be it.

1661
02:37:59,632 --> 02:38:06,939
[SPEAKER_13]: But if it suffices my colleagues, then maybe just the two or three pages, two or three page document that kind of outlines

1662
02:38:07,806 --> 02:38:18,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, all the, all the phases that we'll have to go through and details the first phase, which is what member Graham kind of gave a brief description on, but it's very, the documentation is very helpful.

1663
02:38:18,913 --> 02:38:19,673
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good read.

1664
02:38:20,253 --> 02:38:20,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1665
02:38:20,613 --> 02:38:21,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

1666
02:38:21,274 --> 02:38:23,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the public might also want to know and be involved.

1667
02:38:23,835 --> 02:38:26,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd love to take a look at the document and just make sure.

1668
02:38:27,117 --> 02:38:34,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, give that some thought about whether I want to bring that back up again, because I want to see, you know, but I do think that the public would like to know as well.

1669
02:38:34,261 --> 02:38:37,343
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially around like, what are some of the questions that they're going to be asking and

1670
02:38:37,725 --> 02:38:40,447
[SPEAKER_09]: what have you, because there's a lot to be done.

1671
02:38:41,047 --> 02:38:41,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1672
02:38:41,447 --> 02:38:41,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1673
02:38:42,108 --> 02:38:43,649
[SPEAKER_13]: We can make sure that's on our website too.

1674
02:38:43,789 --> 02:38:44,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1675
02:38:44,349 --> 02:38:44,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

1676
02:38:45,370 --> 02:38:45,750
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1677
02:38:46,470 --> 02:38:57,397
[SPEAKER_22]: And in that vein, the questions they're going to be asking are probably multiple thousands of questions.

1678
02:38:57,717 --> 02:38:59,138
[SPEAKER_22]: We will have to dig through

1679
02:38:59,756 --> 02:39:08,780
[SPEAKER_22]: many years of literal paper risk of payments for how much we paid electricity and each building and it will have to be per building.

1680
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:17,184
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, the amount of work that the administration is going to have to do, maybe an issue that will have to actually address separately like I mean, to

1681
02:39:18,291 --> 02:39:23,260
[SPEAKER_22]: dig through file cabinets and figure out where they are in City Hall now because we send them over to City Hall.

1682
02:39:24,722 --> 02:39:29,651
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's going to be a Herculean effort to answer some pretty

1683
02:39:30,694 --> 02:39:43,123
[SPEAKER_22]: basic questions that, through nobody's fault, are not, you know, we didn't process the paperwork in the many, many years with an intent to ever be asked about it.

1684
02:39:44,464 --> 02:39:51,489
[SPEAKER_22]: And so, and since we don't have computerized systems for all this stuff, it's going to be a major undertaking.

1685
02:39:52,390 --> 02:39:56,813
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's just the simple, because we have to answer like, what are our utility costs in each building?

1686
02:39:57,620 --> 02:39:58,882
[SPEAKER_22]: the different kinds of utilities.

1687
02:39:59,262 --> 02:40:11,900
[SPEAKER_22]: And I signed the warrants and, you know, I just see, you know, National Grid, five different pages and somebody's gonna have to look through each one to find out what's the address oh that's the McGlynn school and

1688
02:40:12,332 --> 02:40:13,753
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that's actually the high school.

1689
02:40:15,114 --> 02:40:23,201
[SPEAKER_22]: It's, I don't envy the people that have to start doing this work, but it definitely, we have a deadline and it has to start because it can't finish until it does.

1690
02:40:23,281 --> 02:40:31,567
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for putting this on and thank you to the administration for a big chunk of work ahead.

1691
02:40:32,448 --> 02:40:32,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1692
02:40:33,269 --> 02:40:33,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve.

1693
02:40:33,969 --> 02:40:37,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve by member McLaughlin, member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1694
02:40:38,333 --> 02:40:39,154
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

1695
02:40:39,434 --> 02:40:39,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1696
02:40:39,794 --> 02:40:39,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1697
02:40:40,054 --> 02:40:40,835
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed.

1698
02:40:41,468 --> 02:40:42,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1699
02:40:42,909 --> 02:40:45,970
[SPEAKER_13]: We have 2024-3 offered by Member McLaughlin.

1700
02:40:48,192 --> 02:40:49,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Just looking at the air conditioning.

1701
02:40:50,833 --> 02:40:51,894
[SPEAKER_13]: The temperature keeps going down.

1702
02:40:52,934 --> 02:41:07,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for annual school committee agenda, whereas the Mass Association for School Committees recommends best practice for scheduling and agenda setting for school committee efficiency, whereas communication, planning, and transparency is in the best interest of the community

1703
02:41:07,756 --> 02:41:18,782
[SPEAKER_13]: whereas Medford Public Schools has an identified strategic plan and clear goals, whereas there has historically been an identified pre-schedule to the meetings primarily only known to the chair and superintendent.

1704
02:41:18,802 --> 02:41:33,410
[SPEAKER_13]: The result of the Medford School Committee working together through the chair and superintendent create an annual school committee agenda annually in August with agenda items identified and correlated to relevant goals to be published by September 5th of the same school year.

1705
02:41:34,170 --> 02:41:35,531
[SPEAKER_13]: We further resolved an ad hoc

1706
02:41:37,313 --> 02:41:45,176
[SPEAKER_13]: ad hoc items to the school committee agenda be added the Wednesday prior to the upcoming school committee meeting as required by public notice and email to school committee members.

1707
02:41:45,256 --> 02:41:47,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Submitted by Member McLaughlin, January 24th, 2024.

1708
02:41:47,877 --> 02:41:49,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

1709
02:41:50,278 --> 02:41:50,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1710
02:41:51,078 --> 02:41:55,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what happened with the formatting, but I sent this in a Word doc and it's all over the place.

1711
02:41:55,780 --> 02:41:57,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry about that for the reading.

1712
02:41:57,821 --> 02:41:59,481
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't like that in the Word doc.

1713
02:42:00,282 --> 02:42:06,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially, this is from the MASC conference that I went to earlier in the year in November.

1714
02:42:08,025 --> 02:42:20,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the presentations that our representative and another representative from the MSC was doing was around having these annual agendas prepared in advance, knowing that most school districts have a schedule of agenda.

1715
02:42:21,118 --> 02:42:24,542
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know that other things will be added to the agenda, but there's a cycle.

1716
02:42:25,022 --> 02:42:30,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And having now been on my third term, you know, started, you know, I can see the pattern and I can see the cycle but

1717
02:42:31,118 --> 02:42:47,888
[SPEAKER_09]: For community members that don't know what the cycle is, for school committee members who are newer that don't understand what the cycle is, I think it's advantageous to have that sort of planned out in advance and attached to our goals, specifically as we're talking about the superintendent goals, and so folks can see what we're actually doing in moving those items forward.

1718
02:42:49,929 --> 02:42:50,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor?

1719
02:42:50,169 --> 02:42:51,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1720
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:52,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham, then Member Ruseau.

1721
02:42:54,465 --> 02:42:58,710
[SPEAKER_06]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): Um, we do have a committee of the whole on Wednesday from five to six.

1722
02:42:58,910 --> 02:43:02,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And the goal of that meeting is exactly that.

1723
02:43:02,595 --> 02:43:10,525
[SPEAKER_06]: For now, through the end of June, so that we can sit down as a group and say, okay, here are all the planned reports.

1724
02:43:11,158 --> 02:43:13,600
[SPEAKER_06]: and agree that, yes, we want to receive those reports.

1725
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:17,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we have questions that we want to be answered in those reports, what are they?

1726
02:43:17,823 --> 02:43:20,785
[SPEAKER_06]: So that the superintendent can better anticipate what we're asking for.

1727
02:43:21,826 --> 02:43:23,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe we will see something and say, you know what?

1728
02:43:23,987 --> 02:43:25,168
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need that report.

1729
02:43:25,208 --> 02:43:26,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just put it in our packet?

1730
02:43:27,389 --> 02:43:34,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So the goal of Wednesday night's meeting is to do exactly that, but just for the time between now and June.

1731
02:43:34,494 --> 02:43:37,336
[SPEAKER_06]: And my suggestion is we try that out before we

1732
02:43:38,377 --> 02:44:06,850
[SPEAKER_06]: decide what we like or what we don't like about that planning process so that it's not just like it's not just a sort of a one-way flow of communication but maybe at the beginning of next year we do the same thing for like a for a different like period of time maybe we do for the whole year but I think it's important for us to weigh in not just not just have the superintendent tell us what she plans to do because if she plans to present a presentation

1733
02:44:07,512 --> 02:44:11,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all sit here and say, we actually don't feel like we need that presentation.

1734
02:44:12,914 --> 02:44:15,255
[SPEAKER_06]: The time of the team could be better spent doing something else.

1735
02:44:15,315 --> 02:44:23,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want us to really think about, what do we need to hear about at the podium versus, is there something that just needs to go in our packet?

1736
02:44:24,099 --> 02:44:30,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do we create space so that we have a reasonable number of things on the agenda at any given time?

1737
02:44:30,922 --> 02:44:34,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's space for the unexpected and all those other things.

1738
02:44:34,980 --> 02:44:46,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I think my suggestion would be that we table this until after Wednesday's meeting, and to give that some time to work and see how we like it before we decide what we're going to do going forward.

1739
02:44:46,969 --> 02:44:47,689
[SPEAKER_13]: May I?

1740
02:44:47,729 --> 02:44:50,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a motion?

1741
02:44:50,872 --> 02:44:51,872
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a suggestion.

1742
02:44:53,053 --> 02:44:55,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau and then Member McLaughlin.

1743
02:44:55,195 --> 02:44:56,476
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to thank you.

1744
02:44:56,936 --> 02:44:59,338
[SPEAKER_22]: The second part of the motion is that the

1745
02:45:00,425 --> 02:45:02,967
[SPEAKER_22]: The Wednesday thing, I like that, but that's actually our policy.

1746
02:45:03,008 --> 02:45:09,493
[SPEAKER_22]: We already passed that, that Wednesday is the members are supposed to submit things by Wednesday.

1747
02:45:10,915 --> 02:45:22,365
[SPEAKER_22]: The part about it I like that we don't have now, though, is that when we submit it by Wednesday before a meeting, that it then just goes out to all the members right away.

1748
02:45:22,385 --> 02:45:27,189
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't have any problem with that except for the fact that the

1749
02:45:27,691 --> 02:45:30,354
[SPEAKER_22]: the chair can decide that it's not going on the agenda.

1750
02:45:30,454 --> 02:45:33,438
[SPEAKER_22]: That's obviously part of the policy as well.

1751
02:45:33,859 --> 02:45:43,771
[SPEAKER_22]: Either it's not going on the agenda this coming Monday, or it's not going on, you know, because it's too much already on the agenda, or maybe they're

1752
02:45:44,369 --> 02:45:47,390
[SPEAKER_22]: an interest in a conversation about whether it should be on the agenda.

1753
02:45:47,850 --> 02:46:10,915
[SPEAKER_22]: So I definitely like this idea that we know sooner because sometimes I think that like something will happen and like I'll submit something and then you submit something and you submit something we're all submitting something and like if the first person that submitted it if it went to everybody then the rest of us would be like yeah that's probably what I was going to write anyways and be done with it.

1754
02:46:11,375 --> 02:46:19,359
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think the city council does this themselves, like when something gets added to the agenda, I believe it's sent out to the rest of the council.

1755
02:46:19,419 --> 02:46:22,861
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor, do you remember back in the day if that's the case?

1756
02:46:24,942 --> 02:46:25,542
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the question?

1757
02:46:25,802 --> 02:46:26,863
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

1758
02:46:27,043 --> 02:46:36,728
[SPEAKER_22]: When a councillor, I mean, I realize the rules have probably changed, but when a councillor submits something to the clerk to be put on the agenda, does it immediately just go to all the councillors so they know?

1759
02:46:37,801 --> 02:46:43,086
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we would we would find find out the same way you'd find out for the school committee agenda when you get it in your packet.

1760
02:46:43,226 --> 02:46:43,486
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1761
02:46:44,487 --> 02:46:53,034
[SPEAKER_22]: So it certainly seems like something to talk about because like they think there's pros and cons like the scenario I just described where we all are going to end up submitting the same thing.

1762
02:46:53,434 --> 02:46:59,939
[SPEAKER_22]: And actually when you look at city council agendas, they will frequently be three or four people who have submitted the same thing.

1763
02:47:02,641 --> 02:47:08,004
[SPEAKER_13]: just open meeting log violations if you're talking about agenda items amongst the group.

1764
02:47:09,264 --> 02:47:24,131
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah I mean I was thinking like blind CC or something but um so anyways that that's the part of that I kind of like think would be interesting but the other part the other stuff about like the planning on a calendar I do I do agree with member Graham that um

1765
02:47:26,414 --> 02:47:44,319
[SPEAKER_22]: we can play an account of right now, I think we would have a need for like a seven year long year, because there's just the list of things in our presentations that we have on our policy that we're supposed to get, which is far greater than the number of meetings we will ever have in a year, is sort of part of the problem.

1766
02:47:44,359 --> 02:47:54,201
[SPEAKER_22]: So we gotta go through that list, which I think we're doing on Wednesday and say, all right, we've got these things, we said we wanted to hear about them, but which ones do we mean we wanna have

1767
02:47:54,872 --> 02:47:59,995
[SPEAKER_22]: PowerPoint for and which ones that we just want to have like a report in our packet that we can read.

1768
02:48:00,096 --> 02:48:04,158
[SPEAKER_22]: And if any of us has interest, can we can write our own agenda items for another meeting?

1769
02:48:04,859 --> 02:48:07,400
[SPEAKER_22]: And we didn't do that when we created that list.

1770
02:48:09,582 --> 02:48:13,024
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was, I think, no, I mean, it was just, it was a first step.

1771
02:48:13,064 --> 02:48:15,386
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think we thought about it necessarily.

1772
02:48:15,486 --> 02:48:16,667
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's just my thought.

1773
02:48:17,527 --> 02:48:21,470
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may from the chair, I can definitely support something like we're doing Wednesday

1774
02:48:22,468 --> 02:48:34,252
[SPEAKER_13]: be created in August so that we can discuss it in September for the entire year as far as presentations and reports that we feel might be something we're interested in in the year.

1775
02:48:34,552 --> 02:48:47,736
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think getting every all seven of us getting different resolutions may create a huge headache not necessarily for me but for our superintendent because if

1776
02:48:48,115 --> 02:48:51,138
[SPEAKER_13]: One person doesn't like a resolution and they're going to try to get it removed.

1777
02:48:51,478 --> 02:48:58,485
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't imagine what the superintendent would have to go through from Wednesday to Thursday deciding on what will go on the agenda.

1778
02:48:58,625 --> 02:49:04,410
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's just I just want to throw my two cents in on those two as I try to comprehend them.

1779
02:49:04,590 --> 02:49:05,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

1780
02:49:05,771 --> 02:49:06,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1781
02:49:06,452 --> 02:49:08,934
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank my colleagues for their thoughtfulness.

1782
02:49:09,355 --> 02:49:10,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I just to be really clear.

1783
02:49:11,271 --> 02:49:13,253
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a couple of things that I wanted out of this.

1784
02:49:13,473 --> 02:49:17,356
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think some of what's happening on Wednesday is some of that.

1785
02:49:17,436 --> 02:49:18,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's good.

1786
02:49:19,678 --> 02:49:30,968
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I just wanted to say that the August meeting was intended to be for the committee, not for the superintendent, to create an agenda for the year.

1787
02:49:30,988 --> 02:49:38,554
[SPEAKER_09]: It was to be a collective practice, as the MASC recommended, where we're collaborating together on what the year's

1788
02:49:39,850 --> 02:49:40,670
[SPEAKER_09]: schedule would be like.

1789
02:49:40,810 --> 02:49:53,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And really it's, you know, part of the reason of wanting to do this is both in getting organized and being transparent to the community about, you know, what will happen over the course of the year in terms of the regular meetings, and also obviously the ad hoc add-ons and the process.

1790
02:49:53,954 --> 02:50:03,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And to Member Ruseau's point about, you know, the items being emailed to the rest of the committee, that's really just when they go out to be posted.

1791
02:50:04,037 --> 02:50:06,418
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not when, you know, not before,

1792
02:50:07,203 --> 02:50:08,724
[SPEAKER_09]: it's finalized.

1793
02:50:08,804 --> 02:50:29,179
[SPEAKER_09]: When it's going to be posted and you're sending it to City Hall, send it to the committee members as well, in my opinion, because then it's helpful for us to sort of just know in advance and prepare even sooner than just our Friday packet or if we're away or we don't have a hard copy of the packet or whatever, we're getting an email of it being sent out to each other as well.

1794
02:50:29,259 --> 02:50:35,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I appreciate and I am willing to withdraw the motion for

1795
02:50:37,489 --> 02:50:41,453
[SPEAKER_09]: to see how things go on the Committee of the Whole on Wednesday.

1796
02:50:42,313 --> 02:51:01,330
[SPEAKER_09]: But with the clarity for my colleagues around what the purpose of this is, is to work collaboratively on this, not just for reports, but for other cycles of the agenda, because we also have various presentations,

1797
02:51:03,188 --> 02:51:14,055
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, group and organizations that come forward so that, and then also more specifically that they're tied to our goals, to the superintendent's goals specifically.

1798
02:51:14,175 --> 02:51:29,805
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we're talking about an item, you know, if we're talking about equity being our goal, then I would like to see on our agenda, you know, in a, in a, you know, in a table next to the, to whatever the agenda item is, how does that relate to our goals that we're talking about so that we're actually addressing?

1799
02:51:29,845 --> 02:51:30,985
[SPEAKER_09]: So it may be more than one goal.

1800
02:51:31,045 --> 02:51:31,486
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's safe.

1801
02:51:32,199 --> 02:51:57,396
[SPEAKER_09]: and equity goal, and it's, you know, a family and community engagement goal or whatever, that we're just putting sort of, even if it's acronyms with a code next to it or whatever, it's our E goal, it's our FCE goal or whatever, and we're really sort of tracking for the superintendent when she's getting ready to do her presentation at the end of the year on the work that's been done, but also to the community so that they can see what goals we're actually working on and to ourselves so we can be tracking, you know, what our actions really are.

1802
02:51:59,097 --> 02:51:59,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

1803
02:51:59,738 --> 02:52:00,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1804
02:52:00,118 --> 02:52:01,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld.

1805
02:52:01,923 --> 02:52:03,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is a point of information.

1806
02:52:03,804 --> 02:52:08,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our policy is that we don't meet in August unless there's an emergency.

1807
02:52:08,688 --> 02:52:13,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if there are implications there in terms of a policy.

1808
02:52:14,032 --> 02:52:19,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think my question is, I would really like to know the schedule.

1809
02:52:19,796 --> 02:52:22,318
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like there are school updates in September.

1810
02:52:22,398 --> 02:52:24,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I know budget season is June.

1811
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:27,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see budget conversations happen earlier.

1812
02:52:28,182 --> 02:52:30,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And so are we looking at mapping out

1813
02:52:31,346 --> 02:52:35,888
[SPEAKER_05]: what a typical year looks like or what a specific year looks like here.

1814
02:52:37,068 --> 02:52:38,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

1815
02:53:01,297 --> 02:53:01,417
Okay.

1816
02:53:24,267 --> 02:53:28,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my other question was just how does this intersect with the meeting we're having in two days?

1817
02:53:28,729 --> 02:53:30,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would certainly favor it.

1818
02:53:31,784 --> 02:53:37,187
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at this after I've kind of seen what a report cycle, what that looks like.

1819
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:54,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, because the reports and the presentations.

1820
02:53:55,176 --> 02:53:56,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so

1821
02:53:59,775 --> 02:54:07,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, and I think it has to do, too, with the fact that the administration is going to have a whole lot on their plate, especially with this first phase.

1822
02:54:07,722 --> 02:54:11,205
[SPEAKER_13]: So what can we put on our website and just read on our own?

1823
02:54:11,265 --> 02:54:13,807
[SPEAKER_13]: What do we want to see on a Monday night?

1824
02:54:13,987 --> 02:54:17,030
[SPEAKER_13]: What isn't on there that we want to see, and what do we want to take off?

1825
02:54:18,971 --> 02:54:21,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham.

1826
02:54:40,608 --> 02:54:45,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just a clarification on what we will do on Wednesday night.

1827
02:54:45,449 --> 02:54:54,071
[SPEAKER_06]: It will certainly be about our list of reports, but it's also about what the superintendent plans her reports to look like between now and June.

1828
02:54:54,351 --> 02:55:05,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So that if she says, I'm going to come before you and talk about MCAS, and we're like, we don't want another presentation about MCAS, we can agree on that up front instead of,

1829
02:55:06,035 --> 02:55:10,476
[SPEAKER_06]: having somebody spend lots and lots of time preparing a report and then going from there.

1830
02:55:10,516 --> 02:55:23,060
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, to me, what I'm trying to do and why I requested this committee of the whole is to map it all out so that we can see, like, what does the superintendent plan to bring to us and do we agree with it?

1831
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:28,942
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we make sure we're getting the reports that we always said we wanted and maybe sometimes get it and sometimes don't?

1832
02:55:29,697 --> 02:55:31,959
[SPEAKER_06]: and what does getting that report look like?

1833
02:55:32,319 --> 02:55:55,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll also talk about the budget cycle so that it starts much, much sooner than June and some plan dates from the CFO about how we might progress through that so that we can all plan accordingly and we're making sure that we're not sort of pushing lots and lots of stuff at the administration when we're asking them to do all of this other work for MSBA.

1834
02:55:56,781 --> 02:56:06,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Wednesday as an opportunity to look at what will these meetings look like from the top to the bottom for the rest of the year until June.

1835
02:56:06,707 --> 02:56:08,688
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think there's a motion to table, withdraw.

1836
02:56:08,708 --> 02:56:10,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to withdraw.

1837
02:56:33,700 --> 02:56:33,920
[SPEAKER_12]: question.

1838
02:56:33,940 --> 02:56:35,061
[SPEAKER_12]: A while back, the committee chose the dates.

1839
02:56:35,081 --> 02:56:35,862
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a week that I was in it.

1840
02:56:35,882 --> 02:56:36,602
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1841
02:56:36,623 --> 02:56:37,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1842
02:56:37,303 --> 02:56:38,084
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1843
02:56:38,104 --> 02:56:38,784
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1844
02:56:38,804 --> 02:56:40,146
It was a week that I was in it.

1845
02:56:40,166 --> 02:56:40,826
It was a week that I was in it.

1846
02:56:40,846 --> 02:56:43,668
It was a week that I was in it.

1847
02:56:43,689 --> 02:56:44,369
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1848
02:56:44,389 --> 02:56:45,010
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1849
02:56:45,030 --> 02:56:45,650
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1850
02:56:45,670 --> 02:56:46,331
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1851
02:56:46,371 --> 02:56:47,111
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1852
02:56:47,131 --> 02:56:47,732
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1853
02:56:47,752 --> 02:56:48,453
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1854
02:56:48,473 --> 02:56:49,353
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1855
02:56:49,373 --> 02:56:50,034
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1856
02:56:50,054 --> 02:56:50,895
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1857
02:56:50,915 --> 02:56:52,116
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1858
02:56:52,136 --> 02:56:52,876
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1859
02:56:52,896 --> 02:56:53,617
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a week that I was in it.

1860
02:56:53,637 --> 02:56:53,677
It

1861
02:56:54,810 --> 02:56:56,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I'm out of the loop on this.

1862
02:56:56,190 --> 02:56:57,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anything about this.

1863
02:56:57,231 --> 02:56:57,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recall.

1864
02:56:58,011 --> 02:57:08,274
[SPEAKER_05]: The email was sent on January 19th from Lisa requesting, I got an email on January 19th requesting the Committee of the Whole for January 31st at 5 p.m.

1865
02:57:08,294 --> 02:57:09,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Specific to this?

1866
02:57:09,794 --> 02:57:17,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got the calendar specific to this to discuss requested reports for the remainder of the year to be held on January 31st.

1867
02:57:18,137 --> 02:57:22,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got the calendar invitation on January 22nd.

1868
02:57:22,558 --> 02:57:22,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1869
02:57:23,314 --> 02:57:25,976
[SPEAKER_09]: So reports for the remainder of the year was the school committee?

1870
02:57:26,016 --> 02:57:26,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1871
02:57:26,156 --> 02:57:26,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1872
02:57:26,817 --> 02:57:30,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So that I, it was a little bit different to me than schedule for the remainder of the year.

1873
02:57:30,760 --> 02:57:32,661
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1874
02:57:32,961 --> 02:57:34,042
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion to adjourn.

1875
02:57:34,062 --> 02:57:34,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to withdraw.

1876
02:57:34,783 --> 02:57:36,144
[SPEAKER_13]: By member Laughlin, seconded by?

1877
02:57:37,705 --> 02:57:37,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1878
02:57:38,245 --> 02:57:39,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham, all those in favor?

1879
02:57:39,426 --> 02:57:40,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1880
02:57:40,307 --> 02:57:44,450
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1881
02:57:44,470 --> 02:57:45,271
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-3 has been withdrawn.

1882
02:57:45,291 --> 02:57:48,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I think I get one more comment.

1883
02:57:50,598 --> 02:57:50,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Reports.

1884
02:57:50,938 --> 02:57:52,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to waive the reading.

1885
02:57:52,880 --> 02:57:55,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to waive the reading by Member Graham.

1886
02:57:55,722 --> 02:58:02,327
[SPEAKER_13]: This is offered by Member Graham and Russo on substitute K. Motion to waive the report by Member Graham.

1887
02:58:02,347 --> 02:58:03,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded.

1888
02:58:03,788 --> 02:58:05,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Reinfeld, all those in favor?

1889
02:58:05,809 --> 02:58:06,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1890
02:58:06,450 --> 02:58:07,310
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1891
02:58:07,471 --> 02:58:12,674
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll, does anybody want to give a brief synopsis of the two present that are proposing?

1892
02:58:13,995 --> 02:58:14,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

1893
02:58:14,976 --> 02:58:18,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I think what I'm trying to

1894
02:58:19,597 --> 02:58:29,480
[SPEAKER_06]: What the question I'm trying to answer when I requested this report is sort of to be able to size and understand our substitute shortage issue.

1895
02:58:29,580 --> 02:58:33,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's been the subject of a lot of discussion across the community.

1896
02:58:33,701 --> 02:58:34,301
[SPEAKER_06]: It always is.

1897
02:58:34,861 --> 02:58:43,103
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of reasons why we might have substitute shortage, not the least of which is everyone has a substitute shortage.

1898
02:58:44,243 --> 02:58:46,284
[SPEAKER_06]: It also is probably because of our pay.

1899
02:58:46,804 --> 02:58:47,905
[SPEAKER_06]: and a whole host of other things.

1900
02:58:47,965 --> 02:59:02,353
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think in order to really think about what do we do about it, instead of just say, yes, we have this problem and we're going to talk about it every year as a problem, is really to understand what really is the problem?

1901
02:59:02,593 --> 02:59:03,774
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the need?

1902
02:59:04,034 --> 02:59:09,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we establish what does our district need from a substitute coverage perspective?

1903
02:59:09,577 --> 02:59:10,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do we have?

1904
02:59:11,665 --> 02:59:14,066
[SPEAKER_06]: so that we can compare what do we need versus what do we have.

1905
02:59:15,487 --> 02:59:29,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And then start to look at how are other districts around us compensating substitutes, et cetera, so that we can start to chart a better course forward when it comes to substitute coverage.

1906
02:59:30,435 --> 02:59:38,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So I tried to be really specific in terms of the questions I wanted to answer through this report and the kind of data that I think we need really to

1907
02:59:39,696 --> 02:59:45,699
[SPEAKER_06]: have a full picture of the the actual problem or the issue as it were.

1908
02:59:45,719 --> 02:59:48,620
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what that's why it is so long.

1909
02:59:48,741 --> 02:59:59,746
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just was my attempt to say if we're going to do a report let's be comprehensive and let's have all the let's get bring all of the factors into one place so that we can have a cohesive discussion.

1910
03:00:00,166 --> 03:00:00,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Member Graham.

1911
03:00:00,887 --> 03:00:02,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion for approval?

1912
03:00:02,767 --> 03:00:07,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we can I I'm not sure if this is an amendment to it but I have some things that I think

1913
03:00:08,359 --> 03:00:09,640
[SPEAKER_05]: would also like to see in this?

1914
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:10,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld, yes.

1915
03:00:11,001 --> 03:00:23,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I would like to see an assessment of how many or how much time full-time and part-time staff are spending covering when we don't have subs.

1916
03:00:23,911 --> 03:00:27,253
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we just heard about an assistant principal who's coming in to do things.

1917
03:00:27,513 --> 03:00:30,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of co-teachers being pulled into another classroom.

1918
03:00:31,596 --> 03:00:37,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would really like to understand what services are not being provided or what work isn't getting done when we are

1919
03:00:38,297 --> 03:00:40,879
[SPEAKER_05]: cobbling together a substitute situation.

1920
03:00:40,899 --> 03:00:53,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And the goal of, and I don't know if that's one of the key questions in the beginning, but the goal on that is to, I really appreciate the specificity of what is the need, what is the cost, what's it going to cost us?

1921
03:00:54,711 --> 03:00:58,454
[SPEAKER_05]: This to me is, what's it going to cost us if we don't fix the problem?

1922
03:00:58,715 --> 03:00:59,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to see that.

1923
03:01:00,536 --> 03:01:04,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I don't have a great sense of what our history as a district is

1924
03:01:05,529 --> 03:01:08,750
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms of long-term subs and building subs.

1925
03:01:09,610 --> 03:01:18,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that has fallen in and out of existence as people have and have not become available over the years.

1926
03:01:18,732 --> 03:01:26,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I had a student whose teacher, we had two maternity leaves in the same year and one of them had a long-term sub and the other had a cobbled together situation.

1927
03:01:27,694 --> 03:01:33,876
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our building, an elementary school had a building sub and then they didn't and so understanding

1928
03:01:34,195 --> 03:01:39,739
[SPEAKER_05]: what that looked like when those things were in place and when they haven't been, or even just what dates.

1929
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:42,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Those amendments are fine.

1930
03:01:42,261 --> 03:01:43,722
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanna add those two things.

1931
03:01:44,242 --> 03:01:47,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So coverages and long-term subs.

1932
03:01:48,625 --> 03:01:49,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

1933
03:01:49,786 --> 03:01:52,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe we could get a little more precise on the language.

1934
03:01:52,387 --> 03:01:52,888
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to write it down.

1935
03:01:52,908 --> 03:01:54,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Say, do you need me to write that up or do you?

1936
03:01:55,189 --> 03:01:57,571
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to write it since it has to be read so we can vote it.

1937
03:01:57,591 --> 03:01:58,892
[SPEAKER_13]: One at a time.

1938
03:01:59,612 --> 03:02:00,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau has the floor.

1939
03:02:02,985 --> 03:02:12,312
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just need to, I followed everything that was said, but there was a lot of... I don't have exact phrasing and I knew you were going to pin me on this, but I don't have it.

1940
03:02:12,372 --> 03:02:13,393
[SPEAKER_22]: I just need the data elements.

1941
03:02:15,194 --> 03:02:16,935
[SPEAKER_22]: And anybody can throw them out there.

1942
03:02:18,416 --> 03:02:19,297
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm too tired to make it up.

1943
03:02:19,417 --> 03:02:28,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so motion on the floor by Member Graham as amended by Member Reinfeld and seconded by... Second.

1944
03:02:28,523 --> 03:02:30,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin, roll call vote please.
