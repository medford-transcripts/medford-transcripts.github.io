    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=299.112s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=301.698s">After</a>  a rainy weekend, we're back for another week of school, the storm that wasn't last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=308.82s">Thank</a>  you to our building and ground staff for diligently monitoring the forecast for snow this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=315.683s">I'm</a>  sure that some of us are grateful that this weekend did not bring a major snowstorm in the end, and others truly are disappointed that today was not a snow day. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=326.907s">I</a>  can reassure all of you that there are many weeks of winter remaining, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=331.61s">and</a>  that I'm sure there will still be more opportunities for a possible snow day in the coming months. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=339.735s">This</a>  evening, I'd like to extend a special congratulations to Dr. Vilma Bobo. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=346.599s">Congratulations</a>  to Dr. Bobo. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=348.621s">She</a>  is Medford's Coordinator of World Language. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=354.504s">She</a>  was elected as the 50th President of the Massachusetts Foreign Language Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=362.116s">Dr.</a>  Bobo began her term this month as the 2024 President of MAFLA, M-A-F-L-A, a statewide professional association of world language teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=379.661s">MAFLA</a>  was founded in 1967 with a mission to empower language educators through advocacy, learning, and support of world-class language instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=392.113s">The</a>  organization's work is focused on professional development for world language educators and advocacy for language education opportunities for Massachusetts students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=405.677s">The</a>  entire Medford School community should be very proud that world language educators throughout our state trust Dr. Brabeau to lead their collective efforts to prepare students for global citizenship. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=422.206s">Once</a>  again, congratulations, Dr. Brabeau. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=426.818s">Also</a>  another important highlight that I'd like to share this evening, which is a free opportunity for all of our students, is the crash prevention training for student drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=440.222s">Hands-on</a>  crash prevention training is available for free to all Medford High School students with a learner's permit or driver's license. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=451.306s">In</a>  Control Crash Prevention has partnered for years with Medford High School and the Medford Police to offer driver safety and crash prevention training to novice drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=464.635s">Graduates</a>  have a much lower chance of crashing and qualify for auto insurance discounts, up to 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=474.522s">More</a>  information is available on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=478.624s">I</a>  also wanna highlight kindergarten registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=482.605s">So</a>  if you know a caregiver of a child who will be starting kindergarten next year, please let them know they are invited to attend one of our two remaining informational sessions to learn about our kindergarten program here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=500.171s">They</a>  have the opportunity to ask questions directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=504.742s">On</a>  Tuesday, February 27th, that will be a Zoom session. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=509.163s">And</a>  our next in-person session will be on March, Thursday, March 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=514.765s">Both</a>  sessions will take place at 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=518.946s">I</a>  also want to thank the 60 plus families who attended our first informational session at Medford High School about a week, last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=530.106s">Childcare</a>  and interpretation services are available at these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=536.612s">I</a>  also want to highlight this week, today was day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=540.755s">DESE,</a>  our Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is in Medford, and they are conducting their triennial special education and civil rights tiered focus monitoring review. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=556.314s">It</a>  started today, and this special review that DESE is conducting is reviewing all of Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=564.976s">DESE</a>  visits each public school in Massachusetts every three years to monitor compliance with federal and state special education and civil rights regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=578.579s">So</a>  all districts are visited, and this is our turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=582.82s">They're</a>  here today, tomorrow, and Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=586.201s">I</a>  want to thank all of our special educators, our special education faculty and staff for their important work in supporting this review. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=597.682s">Lastly,</a>  I want to bring two key dates for you to keep in mind this year, February 6 will be day 100 of school or 100 day of school barring that there are no snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=610.886s">So</a>  as of right now February 6 will be a very enjoyable day for many of our youngest learners celebrating day 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=619.569s">And</a>  also mark your calendars February 19 through the 23rd is our February break vacation week so there's no school during that entire week. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=630.902s">So,</a>  at this evening school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=634.386s">We're</a>  going to cover a variety of topics, including a presentation from the Curtis Tufts High School, presented by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=643.072s">Laurie</a>  Hodgdon, the principal, and also a presentation about the Brooks Elementary School, presented by the principal, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=651.559s">Shannon</a>  Demos, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=653.26s">There</a>  will be an update from our math director, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=656.503s">Faiza</a>  Khan, and a discussion on the district's proposed excessive heat protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=665.269s">Dr.</a>  Cushing will be providing that presentation this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=669.673s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=675.077s">Thank</a>  you, Superintendent Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=678.379s">We</a>  have recommendation to approve travel to Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, with model United Nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=686.082s">Matthew</a>  Brophy, MHS history teacher, and Dr. Nicole Chiesa, director of humanities. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=691.764s">Come</a>  on down. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=694.865s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=792.819s">So</a>  we have about 20 or 30 students in the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=796.181s">These</a>  are the ones who've gone to this year's conference, Ari Atwell, Emma Bennu, Cheyenne Chowdhury, Mandy Chow, Ann Dupes, Jack Dodd, Brian Deplassio, Sierra Goodley. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=815.816s">Bridget</a>  Inman, Sarah Isbell, Sean Johnson, Mohammad Jamaluddin, Evan Russell, Daviana Vega, Sienna Tran, Kira Tramble, Jaden Ville, Maria Zasra, Darren Truong, and Noah Urasco.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=897.445s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=898.165s">We</a>  were advised that first that we need approval of school committee, then we know who's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=902.928s">And</a>  then of course, we've already been in contact numerous times with the nurse regarding that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=906.651s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=907.171s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=907.711s">And</a>  this is all very exciting and motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=919.219s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=920.54s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=921.661s">Thank</a>  you so much for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=922.962s">Have</a>  fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=923.422s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=930.913s">We</a>  have a number three math placement presentation presented by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=934.54s">Faiza</a>  Khan, Director of Mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=937.126s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=937.807s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=940.509s">Thank</a>  you for having me here. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=943.23s">And</a>  yes, today I'm here to give an update on the continued implementation of the integrated math pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=952.815s">We</a>  will be piloting the integrated mathematics three program at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=958.878s">And</a>  I'm also here to talk about pushing the acceleration that happens at the end of the sixth grade to now be happening <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=969.523s">at</a>  the end of the seventh grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=971.524s">So</a>  that's slide one and two that I just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=978.406s">Once</a>  again, there are two purposes to this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=982.108s">First</a>  is that the placement exam that usually takes place at the end of sixth grade will now be taking place at the end of the seventh grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=990.591s">And</a>  I'll be going in much details as to why that seems to be a better route for <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=997.533s">the</a>  math department and for the students in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1000.656s">And</a>  the second objective is that I'll give you an update on how integration is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1005.921s">We</a>  used to have the traditional pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1008.243s">Now</a>  we have started going down the path of integrated math instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1015.189s">And</a>  so that leads us to slide three. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1019.173s">So</a>  the current landscape at the secondary level, which starts at sixth grade, we know that both our schools have two math teachers at each grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1030.52s">So</a>  that makes a total of 12 mathematics teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1035.263s">At</a>  the sixth grade level, students learn only six <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1041.627s">grade</a>  math standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1044.809s">But</a>  when we do the acceleration decisions at the end of sixth grade, many factors, we look at many of them, and then one of them is the end of the year placement exam that's conducted right about end of May, beginning of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1064.002s">Once</a>  that exam is done and the teachers have looked at the overall pictures, students are placed in accelerated or the standard sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1077.612s">Parent</a>  wishes are always honored and we recommend as to where the student shall be, but at the end, we always honor the parent wishes and the students are placed in the desired section. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1091.221s">Most</a>  of the requests come for the student to be in the accelerated or advanced course. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1098.905s">There</a>  are three sections of grade level math and one section of accelerated advanced math in grades seven and eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1106.93s">And</a>  again, there is no acceleration at the sixth grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1110.112s">So</a>  all teachers teach the same and students get the same illustrative mathematics curriculum as per DESE standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1120.118s">The</a>  last bullet says that the 7th and 8th grade accelerated slash advanced math sections each cover a year and a half worth of math content. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1130.045s">Now</a>  that's the content that's given to us by DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1134.748s">We</a>  follow their math standards being a public school and when we <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1140.172s">teach</a>  students in the two accelerated sections of seventh grade and subsequently in eighth grade, the students can take geometry in their freshman year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1152.662s">We</a>  move on to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1155.584s">And</a>  that is slide number five. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1158.867s">We</a>  discussed the impact of the current math acceleration on student learning at MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1166.109s">So</a>  Desi calls it the race to calculus. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1169.454s">So</a>  that's what I will call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1171.698s">The</a>  race to calculus mindset prioritizes quantity. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1177.506s">over</a>  quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1179.167s">So</a>  what we mean by that is that we have to teach students a year and a half of math standards in seventh grade, which is seventh grade standards plus half of eighth grade standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1191.891s">And</a>  then when students go to eighth grade, they have to learn the rest of the half of eighth grade standards plus all of algebra one. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1201.363s">When</a>  that happens, performance on the procedural 6th grade math standards has continued to become an integral determining factor for students' ability to learn conceptual math in a fast-paced and rigorous 7th and 8th grade <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1218.786s">environment.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1219.607s">So</a>  what happens is that the sixth grade standards are very procedural in mathematics, there's no denying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1226.458s">So</a>  when students are learning a year and a half of seventh slash eighth grade, and then eighth grade slash algebra one, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1235.72s">Many</a>  times students are not ready for the reasons we have mentioned before and for the main reason that we are testing them on procedural concepts and placing them in the accelerated section. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1249.497s">So</a>  due to this structure, and then the structure at the high school, several AP calculus and calculus honors students exhibit widening gaps in their mathematical foundations, and it impacts their class assessments and college board exam results. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1267.345s">We</a>  see on our next slide that the demographic enrollment data at the high school also provides an opportunity to have, you know, for us to be able to provide them equitable access to accelerated courses if we push seventh grade, if we push the acceleration to the end of seventh grade, and if we follow the integrated pathway rather than the traditional pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1295.433s">So</a>  the next slide is when you look at the demographics from the school year 2022-2023 and school year 2023-2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1308.678s">We</a>  see that we have seen a small shift, but we would like to open it up to more of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1318.945s">And</a>  how do we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1321.927s">And</a>  even before how we get to it, we look at how advanced placement calculus AB plays out in colleges for the acceptance. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1334.276s">That</a>  slide says it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1336.557s">When</a>  a student gets a score of five on the college board exam, number of colleges accepting the five AP scores only <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1345.208s">are</a>  22, those are the Ivy Leagues, those are the colleges that some students strive to go to, and they get a five and they make it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1357.436s">And</a>  their scores are accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1360.358s">And</a>  then we see how many colleges accept four or more AP scores, and we go down that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1367.663s">And</a>  then we see that only one college, or rather three colleges accept a score of one only on the college board exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1377.952s">Next</a>  slide takes us into what is the impact of the middle school placement exam on our students' learning, actual learning, not just rushing through and covering the standards so that teaching is not just, its concepts are not just being taught, they're also being learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1403.331s">So</a>  what we are proposing is that the acceleration be pushed by one more year and the placement exam takes place at the end of seventh grade and the students can go into eighth grade math and eighth grade math accelerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1420.817s">And</a>  what that'll do is that that'll give the teachers an opportunity to challenge the students without having to cover all of algebra one. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1430.521s">in</a>  eighth grade and they will get a solid pre algebra foundation in seventh grade because that's where conceptual understanding and teaching of concepts actually starts is the <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1442.395s">is</a>  in seventh grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1445.038s">Moving</a>  on, here is some input from the middle school teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1449.022s">These</a>  are our own teachers that they are saying that the best way to go is that students get a solid seventh grade foundation before they go the accelerated path. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1466.57s">Moving</a>  on to the integrated pathways, because one thing impacts the other, it's like a chain reaction kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1476.958s">So</a>  we have on our slide 12, you see the way DESE, Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and the Department of Higher Education, how they have proposed the courses, the sequence to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1495.271s">So</a>  they say pre-K through eight, there should be not any acceleration. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1501.135s">Acceleration</a>  should happen at the high school, either through the traditional pathway or through the integrated path that students can take. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1511.383s">That</a>  will open up their fourth year <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1515.206s">to</a>  be able to take calculus AP or calculus honors, pre-calculus, quantitative reasoning, and statistics, either standard or AP. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1526.355s">And</a>  then students, when they go to the post-secondary courses, they have a much more solid foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1535.663s">On</a>  the next slide, number 13, we see the difference between the traditional pathway, which we used to have and now we are slowly weaning away from, and the integrated pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1548.07s">Basically,</a>  the end result is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1550.991s">It's</a>  just that the integrated pathway <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1554.733s">covers</a>  the concepts in an integral way, as in students will learn geometry and algebra in integrated math one and in integrated math two, and to a degree also in integrated math three. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1570.522s">Next</a>  slide is directly, again, from the pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1577.546s">curriculum</a>  that Desi has given us, and this is how they have envisioned mathematical rigor to happen, is that it's basically a byproduct of the three pieces that you see around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1595.171s">So</a>  many times we are asked why we have been shifting away from the traditional pathways of teaching algebra, geometry and algebra two as standalone courses and why are we shifting towards integrated one, two and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1611.224s">The</a>  biggest advantage that the teachers are seeing is that they constantly <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1616.228s">do</a>  not have to review right before they teach a concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1620.689s">It's</a>  being interwoven, it's spiraling, and that review kind of happens as part of teaching the previous concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1631.252s">Another</a>  thing that we have noticed is that it's very task-oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1635.854s">It</a>  has become task-oriented versus just procedural. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1639.255s">You</a>  master the algorithm and you'll go and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1644.471s">Another</a>  thing is that students have been developing strong problem solving skills and reasoning skills because they have to make a decision as to if they will use one kind of form to solve the problem or another kind of form. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1665.392s">So</a>  far, it seems that NCTM has been backing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1670.897s">NCTM</a>  is the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and they are claiming that they have seen better results in the classroom and district and state when it comes to the assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1686.485s">Why</a>  do we adjust? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1688.506s">Why</a>  are we adjusting Medford High School math pathways? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1692.368s">It's</a>  because we wanna open it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1694.729s">We</a>  wanna open up our highest level courses to a lot more students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1700.091s">And</a>  we don't wanna, you know, box students in that if you did not take, if you did not get on the accelerated pathway at the end of sixth grade, which is too early for many students to make a decision that now you are <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1716.358s">going</a>  to be in the standard pathway for the rest of the high school math career. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1723.447s">And</a>  this is a high school teacher's input on slide 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1732.998s">And</a>  moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1735.601s">This</a>  is the flowchart that we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1739.704s">When</a>  you look at it, you see that there is geometry being honored, being offered at the ninth grade level, and we have algebra two. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1754.133s">There</a>  was no algebra one that was being offered this year because we are, as I said, we are on our trajectory of adopting integrated math <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1766.301s">to</a>  the fullest. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1768.902s">When</a>  we go to slide 18, the difference between slide 17, which is what we are currently offering, to slide 18, which we will be offering in this coming year, is that there will be no geometry at the ninth grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1785.585s">All</a>  students, whether they are coming from the accelerated pathway, accelerated eighth grade, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1793.767s">or</a>  standard eighth grade will be taking integrated math one honors or CP. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1799.79s">And</a>  we'll go down that path and the teachers of the honors path will be infusing the standards that are necessary for students to be able to take calculus. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1817.518s">AP</a>  and calculus honors in their fourth year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1821.742s">What</a>  that will also help with is that students will be able to take more computer programming courses eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1828.648s">And</a>  that is also shown on the next slide, which will be the subsequent year, 25-26 on slide 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1841.235s">It</a>  will give them a selected list of courses to choose from. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1846.222s">All</a>  of them will be computer science courses and possibly statistics course. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1851.31s">We</a>  are still in the exploration phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1853.593s">But</a>  again, the mathematics department's goal has always been <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1857.879s">and</a>  we'll stay as to making more courses accessible to most of our students, if not all of our students, to ensure that we keep rigor, that we prepare our students for the rigorous courses, and to ensure that students continue to get courses like personal finance, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1880.485s">and</a>  consumer math to be able to, you know, be equipped with real life skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1890.752s">And</a>  after slide 19 is 20, which is basically <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1896.275s">a</a>  table form of the flowchart that you saw earlier for the school year 24-25. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1903.798s">And</a>  then with that, I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1906.639s">And</a>  there is an appendix of many slides that I have presented in the past year, years, last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1915.223s">I</a>  have been coming here in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1917.223s">So</a>  you can take a look at them and I'm happy to answer any questions at this time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1927.216s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1930.118s">Member</a>  Rheinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1931.959s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1932.88s">So</a>  I'm new to school committee, so I haven't seen the presentations other than in passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1937.963s">So</a>  I have a couple of questions and I'll start with the accelerated math. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1944.027s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1944.467s">So</a>  my big question here is what is differentiation gonna look like in the seventh grade now that there's going to be a broader range of skills and abilities and comfort with math? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1956.141s">And</a>  how are teachers going to be supported in meeting those wider needs without the trust?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1961.34s">Wonderful,</a>  that's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1963.141s">So</a>  at least two of our veterans, seventh grade teachers, have been piloting this differentiation already. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1971.245s">I</a>  have been giving them strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1974.587s">We</a>  do a lot of observations in the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1977.509s">So</a>  through that, we are able to give good suggestions and ideas of what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1986.213s">We</a>  also have a few PD courses that we, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1991.056s">you</a>  know, refer them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1993.999s">And</a>  one of the ways that teachers have been differentiating is, and that I had suggested, and I'm happy to see that it's that they have used it, they've been using it, is having a problem of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2009.488s">for</a>  the students who can handle a challenge and have it at different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2013.831s">So</a>  that when students are done, they're not just doing rote worksheet work, and I'll give you another worksheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2020.477s">Or</a>  if that has to happen, then there needs to be level of problems as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2025.3s">And</a>  students use choice work. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2027.462s">If</a>  you can handle a higher level problem, then there should be that accessible in the classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2036.429s">You</a>  know, I know that our teachers are working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2040.995s">It's</a>  always going to be a work in progress, but at least that's where we have started. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2045.82s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2046.021s">And</a>  they have the opportunity to do some of the vertical integration talking to the grade below and the grade ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2052.609s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2053.357s">Most</a>  of our department meetings, we get some time to do that, but definitely our June meeting and our beginning of the year meeting is all about it, to realign and to look at the pacing guides and to look at what one teacher is doing that's working in one classroom and to bring it to all the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2070.852s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2071.252s">So</a>  I have questions about the integrated math, but if any of my colleagues have things on the middle school, I want to make sure we can keep that together.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2081.837s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2082.137s">I</a>  think member. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2083.158s">So</a>  I saw you late next and then member Graham.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2086.4s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2087.021s">Um</a>  I love all of this as I have since you started down this path three years ago at this point, four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2096.848s">Um</a>  and when I'm looking at the proposed 2526, one thing that's a little confusing to me is that pre calculus does not appear to be a prerequisite to calculus. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2108.857s">Um</a>  and um <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2110.956s">I</a>  will admit it's been so long since I took pre-calculus or calculus that I, like, is the title pre-calculus actually just a poorly named course?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2121.445s">Yes,</a>  there are actually many views about it, but what we do notice, and in many conversations, not just with the in-district teachers, but in the other, what's happening around the district, when we talk to them and when we get together at the DESE meetings, what we hear a lot and what we know, I taught pre-calculus here, is that many of it can be infused in <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2148.806s">all</a>  levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2149.366s">So</a>  what we have done on the honors path is that we have taken that pre-calculus and a lot of it is actually a repetition of algebra 2 honors. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2160.651s">So</a>  we are going to be teaching it as integrated math 3 honors <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2168.835s">You</a>  know, some mixed in and then some of those standards of integrated met three honors can be brought down pushed down to algebra to honors are not as a bridge to I'm sorry integrated met two honors and then subsequently some of those standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2185.083s">can</a>  be pushed down to integrated math one honors. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2188.547s">So</a>  we have charted this path also, although we will continue to tweak it and look at it every May and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2197.176s">But</a>  that was the that was the idea is that to take out pre calculus and see how our students do with <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2207.526s">just</a>  having those standards, a lot of those standards being part of integrated MAT 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2214.348s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2214.828s">I</a>  figured you had figured this out, but I just was curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2218.749s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2219.069s">We're</a>  trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2219.749s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2220.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2222.29s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2224.711s">Can</a>  you provide us some comparable districts that have fully implemented this? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2230.732s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2232.173s">Waltham</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2233.232s">is</a>  one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2235.613s">Cambridge</a>  has been working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2238.774s">I</a>  know Natick was also looking into this pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2243.915s">And</a>  last year when I attended Desi's big thing on math, there were so many districts who were very interested in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2255.138s">And</a>  I think they are now <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2257.159s">getting</a>  on this, so I'll be happy to get more names, but I do know that we talked to the Waltham department head and she came and did a presentation for our committee and was able to give the way in the pros and the cons both. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2275.469s">So</a>  that one I know is one who I followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2278.431s">Arlington</a>  was also working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2280.972s">Let</a>  me see where they are now, but they all kind of started <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2284.858s">probably</a>  a year later, but there was a lot of interest in this pathway just because algebra geometry and algebra standalone was not working out for so many districts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2294.622s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2294.902s">And</a>  I think, um, I think my middle school question is really about the kids that are like more than ready for the acceleration. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2304.665s">Um,</a>  I understand that the delay helps lots of kids, but there are kids who are more than ready for the acceleration and <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2315.433s">It</a>  looks like, like my seventh grader right now, if I like did the jump the math around this, these charts, he's, he's an accelerated math this year, which is like a one and a half, one and a half, which he'll do next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2329.686s">And</a>  then in school year 25, 26, he'll take integrated math, which sounds like it will basically be repetition of what he learned in eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2338.974s">Is</a>  that true?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2341.179s">Some</a>  concepts will be, but a year and a half worth of standards whenever they are taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2348.317s">Sometimes</a>  even to the kids who can really take the challenge, the teacher never gets a chance to go in as much depth as they possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2361.568s">So</a>  the integrated math one honors is being taught by a veteran teacher who also teaches AP calculus. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2369.054s">So</a>  I have been in talks with her and seems like <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2376.071s">Some</a>  students are basically yes, they are there and she is trying her level best to do the differentiation, but this is the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2385.078s">Also,</a>  I think as it evolves. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2387.981s">We</a>  will know more ways to differentiate, not just at the seventh grade level, but also at the integrated math one honors level and just this that integrated math one honors has <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2401.616s">the</a>  standards that were infused, that were brought down from integrated math too. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2406.978s">And</a>  that shall be able to be the new piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2411.621s">Because,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2413.501s">And</a>  I think the other thing that I've noticed in my house in terms of like the value of now, both my kids having gone through this, and they're totally different, they're very different students in lots of ways, is it was the first time they had to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2429.248s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2430.885s">What</a>  that taught them was that they can't just mail it in all the time, which they frankly had been able to do for lots and lots of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2440.293s">And</a>  so it was conditioning for them to make a pretty seamless transition to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2445.858s">Like</a>  my ninth grader sort of learned about rigor in a way largely because of this accelerated class. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2454.881s">It</a>  wasn't as easy for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2456.921s">She</a>  had to figure out how to like work through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2458.722s">She</a>  had to figure out how to advocate for herself and ask for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2461.903s">And</a>  the coursework was more intensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2463.723s">And</a>  I think it is in part why she's made a pretty seamless transition to the high school where the work is more intense. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2471.825s">And</a>  I just, I love the idea of differentiation and I just also know how very hard it is to execute that in a classroom with <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2482.908s">20</a>  different kids who are doing lots of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2485.269s">So</a>  I love this concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2488.23s">I</a>  just don't want people to hear about it and think their kid is no longer going to be challenged because we're slowing this down. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2498.595s">And</a>  I think there's lots of parents who went through algebra one and then geometry and then calculus, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2504.317s">Like</a>  they went through that path that hear this and think that's not how I did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2509.438s">I</a>  am supportive of all of this, but I think the district needs to do a really crisp job of communicating to parents like why this is better for their students wherever their student might be in their like learning progression in math. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2524.993s">Because</a>  I could I could see and I have heard from lots of parents who say like I'm not interested in that I want my kid to be able to like be challenged in math and. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2534.823s">sort</a>  of the flip side of that is they're not going to be in this model. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2538.064s">And</a>  I don't think that's necessarily true, but I think the district really has to be clear about how that happens so that parents can rethink about math in a way that they've not had to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2552.268s">And</a>  because this is completely different <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2554.778s">math</a>  sequence than we all grew up with.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2559.122s">So,</a>  yes, you are 100% right. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2562.265s">Communication</a>  plays a major role, and that definitely needs to be out. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2567.21s">And</a>  we are working on it, on parent letter, doing another presentation in April for the parents, or even sooner, but that the goal is to do it at our <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2580.463s">beginning</a>  of April timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2583.424s">One</a>  thing that I will say is that there are many concepts out there for acceleration. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2590.869s">One</a>  is to teach more content. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2593.931s">And</a>  then the other concept of acceleration is really go in depth about the problem and really understand why and be able to apply it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2604.297s">And</a>  I feel that <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2606.418s">we</a>  tend to take, most of us tend to take this approach that if we, if my child is learning a lot, then, you know, they are being accelerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2616.463s">And</a>  as a parent also, I can speak to it that, you know, I have four kids, one of them was that way, and the other one needed more depth. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2623.867s">So</a>  I feel that hopefully our students and our teachers will, you know, be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2634.195s">get</a>  to that level, that's our hope and dream, but we will continue to work towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2639.878s">That's</a>  the best that we can do is that provide guidance, provide, you know, have high expectations from both parties and provide, you know, clear communication to the parents.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2652.544s">And</a>  I think if Waltham has completed their implementation and could share with you how it has impacted their students, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2662.52s">like</a>  across the spectrum in terms of access to calculus and AP class success and all of those things, I think that kind of comparable information would be really helpful because you really are having to retrain a bunch of adults who have only known math one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2685.865s">And</a>  I think being able to show them like, see, here's how it's working and here's why it's better, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2692.182s">that</a>  kind of exemplar would be really important and powerful for families to hear.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2697.964s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2698.724s">I'll</a>  be in touch to get more ideas on how to, you know, do it so that it's more obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2707.447s">I</a>  mean, clearly we are doing it, but it's not out there, but happy to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2712.069s">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2712.769s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2713.169s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2714.11s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2716.03s">And</a>  thank you so much for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2716.971s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2718.231s">I</a>  had a quick question on slide 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2721.727s">with</a>  the proposed course flow chart for 25-26 school year, it's the errors are pointing to integrated math three or going up towards computer programming and those types of maths and computer science principles and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2734.955s">My</a>  question, I guess, is that if a student decides to go that way instead of integrated math three and then decides to continue on in grade 12, are they going to be missing some of the more foundational principles that we may be more used to? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2747.162s">And</a>  I think that that's, it sounds exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2749.644s">I</a>  just, I'm a little concerned about, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2751.795s">on</a>  misunderstanding about how a student will be able to still learn the principles that they would need, I think, to get you on into any other secondary school or any other type of thing post high school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2762.063s">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2763.624s">And</a>  I didn't realize that maybe the flowchart may be giving that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2769.168s">Basically,</a>  what I wanted to indicate through is that students should be taking integrated math three and taking a computer programming course with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2778.876s">So</a>  it's not an or, it's an and.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2785.998s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2787.039s">Thank</a>  you, Member Redfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2788.739s">So,</a>  Member Graham touched on my questions about education for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2793.662s">And</a>  so a small question is, what kind of support is going to be available for students coming in from other districts who have had <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2800.575s">who</a>  were coming from the traditional path into the integrated?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2804.497s">That's</a>  again, a wonderful question. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2806.599s">And</a>  we have to think about that population because it happens every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2810.941s">So</a>  what we do do is that we have a placement exam for students who are coming in from private school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2819.566s">That's</a>  one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2820.747s">So</a>  we'll adjust our placement exam <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2823.93s">to</a>  test them now on both concepts in one test like algebra and geometry so there will be a placement exam for each <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2832.941s">level,</a>  the students who are coming in from other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2837.563s">We</a>  have had this discussion as a committee and I believe the teachers are ready for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2844.045s">We</a>  will meet them where they're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2846.046s">They</a>  will not be placed any lower just because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2849.207s">Of</a>  course, when we look at the student's transcript and we see <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2854.349s">algebra</a>  one on it only and now the student is going to go to integrate it to it is what it is, and so that piece will be covered if the student comes to us in June some assignment of some sort or the teachers will be providing some. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2873.199s">support</a>  of that kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2874.8s">But</a>  then again, this is to, we are working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2878.421s">We</a>  are working on all of those pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2880.602s">It's</a>  going to take us time to iron those out, but they are on our mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2884.964s">We</a>  have been thinking about what's the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2888.065s">But</a>  for now, teachers have given their commitment to ensuring that students will get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2893.507s">I'm</a>  really happy to hear it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2894.287s">And</a>  I will say, I love the spiral model of education. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2896.928s">I</a>  think it's much more effective than the latter. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2900.225s">So</a>  my next question is around that kind of interdisciplinary perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2903.666s">So</a>  I know you've had a lot of conversation within the math department and digital learning, and how does this intersect with, say, the science courses, you know, chemistry, physics, where a lot of these concepts are coming into play, and at the vocational school, things like metalwork and carpentry, where that geometry foundation, and as much as I hate to reference standardized tests, academic milestones like the SATs, which lean really hard into the geometry. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2931.089s">So</a>  how is that being integrated kind of beyond the math department and making sure that those intersections, those alignments are matching up?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2939.451s">Right,</a>  so right now what we, so currently teachers are, so just a couple of years ago, we ensured that we go back to our older model of having a project every quarter in each <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2959.178s">course,</a>  so the teachers through these projects, they have the, you know, they <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2969.153s">are</a>  into that kind of thing that they have already started taking initiative on making it interdisciplinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2976.837s">For</a>  others that are not, because we are on our way, again, it's a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2983.941s">Some</a>  of us need a little bit more of, okay, they did it and I can do it too kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2989.685s">Others</a>  are like, I'm a daredevil, I'm gonna give it a try anyhow. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2994.307s">So</a>  we are at different places in the department, and I'm hoping that our daredevils will be able to say, you know, this is working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3004.609s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3005.589s">So</a>  that's where we're at.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3006.929s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3007.149s">And</a>  will they have the opportunity to do that peer-to-peer professional development in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3011.93s">This</a>  is what worked for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3012.83s">This</a>  was my challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3013.751s">How</a>  can we help each other?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3015.191s">Yes,</a>  they already are. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3016.411s">So</a>  in the mathematics department, we have this peer observation and strategy implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3022.529s">that</a>  you go observe a peer, and then you take down notes, and then you adopt one of their strategies, and you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3029.154s">So</a>  that can be easily geared toward the projects as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3033.157s">And</a>  I must admit our newer crew, we have three new math teachers this year, and all of them work very nicely in this way that they always collaborate together, even at their own time to come up with such projects to keep student engagement <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3052.569s">up</a>  and that's the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3054.611s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3055.412s">Well,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3056.172s">Thanks</a>  to your work and thank the committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3058.414s">I</a>  know it's a lot on top of teaching to be thinking about that at this level.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3062.998s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3063.819s">I'm</a>  also very grateful to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3065.4s">This</a>  work wouldn't have happened without them. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3068.322s">So</a>  I'll be in touch with some of you and thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3073.367s">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3074.227s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3076.189s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3078.342s">We</a>  have number four school update, the Curtis-Tufts High School, presented by Laurie Hodgdon, principal, and Brooks Elementary School, presented by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3087.145s">Shannon</a>  Demos, also principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3089.706s">So</a>  we'll start with the Curtis-Tufts, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3093.127s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3093.307s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3093.927s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3094.647s">How</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3095.228s">I</a>  think it's been a year since I've seen some of you, and some of you are new. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3099.709s">I</a>  first want to acknowledge <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3102.429s">My</a>  student, teacher, and a parent who's here supporting Curtis-Tufts tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3107.292s">Dad's</a>  supporting because Anthony Seekman, who's a junior, wanted to be here to support his school and to support me. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3115.817s">And</a>  Kate Wellard, who teaches math at Curtis-Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3119.839s">This</a>  is her first year, but she's been in the district for 10th year, 10th year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3126.583s">So</a>  first I wanna say, all of the things that you're talking about, we do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3132.259s">So</a>  when you apply rigor and you apply relevance and you build good relationships with kids, you're able to differentiate in a way and meet kids where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3145.622s">Because</a>  rigor is about how you ask the question, how you ask yourself the question as a learner and how the teacher does. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3153.644s">And</a>  you have to have good relationships and know what students are interested in so you can apply that to their learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3160.866s">So</a>  it just resonated with me when Faisal was talking about math and all the work that they've done as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3167.814s">It's</a>  the work that our teachers do every day because the kids they see in front of them are at varying abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3177.305s">and</a>  need more support than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3179.346s">And</a>  some are like going gangbusters and know exactly what they want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3184.387s">They're</a>  just traveling at different rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3186.527s">So</a>  I just, I had to just kind of point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3189.528s">So</a>  since you don't have the slide, if you look at slide two, this is celebrating our students of the month based on attendance and academic achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3198.81s">And</a>  I want to give props to Anthony. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3200.691s">He</a>  has the best attendance at Curtis Tufts this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3209.133s">And</a>  as we know, when you go to school, it's about attending and learning and being in every class. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3216.939s">And</a>  for the most part, that's what he's doing and we can see progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3221.382s">So</a>  as you all know, and I'm on slide three, Curtis Tufts is a therapeutic day school that supports diverse learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3229.568s">We</a>  currently serve 12 students on IEPs with varying disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3235.532s">We</a>  have three academic teachers, two counselors, one paraprofessional, one nurse, and one expressive arts intern that I'll talk more about later in the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3247.611s">We</a>  work as a team and we work around our students, the students at the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3253.656s">I</a>  feel very fortunate that I have a team that we work with at the high school in Joan Bowen, Kim Clinton, all of my colleagues there who support and at the high school who support learning at Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3268.568s">We</a>  couldn't do it without them. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3270.83s">Obviously,</a>  I'm the school director and principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3273.672s">I</a>  also chair all of the IEP meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3276.716s">and</a>  help to write the IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3280.058s">I</a>  also want to give a shout out to my colleagues at the Missittuck, the Andrews, and the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3286.501s">Suzanne</a>  Galussi set it up so that we could have our electives in music, art, PE, and digital literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3295.525s">So</a>  they come in their busy days and they support our students with enriching their learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3303.834s">So</a>  you can see slide four, you see Anthony and Nikki, students working collaboratively in Kate's class in order to meet learning targets and to achieve success. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3313.378s">Maybe</a>  they're at different places in terms of math, but she's planning and thinking about how each of the students learn best and where she can target their learning to support them so they move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3326.905s">Sometimes</a>  I like to say to everyone, you have to move back to move forward and vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3336.303s">On</a>  the demographics of Curtis tough high school currently we currently serve 12 students to African American students one multi race to Hispanic and seven white students in varying disability areas of health autism and emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3356.482s">There</a>  are currently eight referrals from the high school that will be placed either in the spring or next fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3362.824s">What</a>  we like to do is we like to see students who transition from eighth to ninth grade try the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3368.605s">Sometimes</a>  it doesn't work for them because the learning environment is too large. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3373.027s">They</a>  travel through each of the different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3377.808s">To</a>  see if they need to go to Curtis Tufts, they have to work to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3382.835s">And</a>  I can I can talk a little bit more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3386.561s">We</a>  just had a student join us today at the end of quarter two. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3390.667s">We're</a>  very excited to have her to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3394.592s">And</a>  we're very careful in the middle of the year of making sure that students feel comfortable transitioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3401.334s">It's</a>  really hard in a high school situation to think about leaving all of your friends and what you've known and go to a different learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3410.577s">So</a>  we've worked really hard with our students and the faculty to ensure that that kind of transition is seamless. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3417.598s">And</a>  the other thing is, is when a student is making progress, thinking about a student moving back to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3424.013s">So</a>  with that comes success plans, behavior plans, support, sitting down and ensuring that kids have a personalized learning plan in front of them about how they can meet those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3439.859s">Important</a>  to note that we had two graduates in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3442.481s">I've</a>  been in touch with both. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3445.464s">One</a>  is applying to be unionized or go through the union of pipe fitters, which is very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3452.829s">And</a>  another one is looking at community college and thinking about nursing. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3458.514s">So</a>  in their transition plans, they worked on all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3462.497s">Some</a>  go at a slower rate, some at a quicker rate, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3467.683s">And</a>  we are always open to work with them and support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3471.247s">They</a>  never are not our students, as I speak in a double negative, they're always our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3477.793s">We</a>  have two potential graduates in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3482.517s">So</a>  I'd like to just celebrate. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3487.489s">You</a>  can't do it without the people around you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3490.431s">And</a>  this is slide six. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3493.072s">This</a>  year, in collaboration with the arts department, we have an expressive arts rotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3501.356s">A</a>  Lesley intern is at Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3505.418s">She's</a>  there for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3506.699s">She's</a>  there three days a week, working with our students, and I explain it even more so in the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3514.423s">We</a>  have many students who are interested in dance, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3517.628s">And</a>  so what we'd like to get is a dance therapy intern for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3522.352s">It's</a>  been very additive for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3527.217s">And</a>  I would say that she has been able to work with our students individually and she sees them and their expression in very different ways than we do academically or just sitting down with them in a counseling session. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3545.317s">Curtis</a>  Tufts, with the help of Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3552.887s">received</a>  a grant from the Federation of Special Needs under the statewide mass family and community engagement program, an award of $5,000 last October. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3563.29s">And</a>  we're working on service learning opportunities in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3569.632s">And</a>  I had asked our superintendent if I could come back and have our students present. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3575.314s">We're</a>  looking at STEM learning, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3577.214s">We're</a>  looking at volunteering at the Miss Attack reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3580.96s">Anthony</a>  wants to do a basketball program with some of our grades three through fifth graders and really giving back in a way that's very enriching. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3593.961s">One</a>  of the things that we did after my first year was we moved all academic classes to the beginning of the day, which has helped us to support a stronger culture of achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3603.889s">Students</a>  need to get to school, need to be there, need to be on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3607.331s">And</a>  this allows for many of our juniors and seniors who may have exhausted their credits and want work-study to leave and go get work or do an internship or <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3622.063s">create</a>  a work study program that is in their area of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3629.089s">So,</a>  working as a team around our students, you know, it really is cooperation, collaboration, and commitment to our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3638.417s">I</a>  see that across the district, but I have to say that I work with a team of individuals from our custodian, Bobby Hawkins, to our paraprofessional, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3650.1s">to</a>  all of our teachers to our kids and our parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3653.042s">No</a>  one works harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3655.403s">And</a>  we have a professional learning community that puts students at the forefront of our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3661.447s">We</a>  meet every day, we meet every day after school four times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3666.737s">Monday,</a>  Wednesdays and Thursdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3668.578s">It's</a>  for 10 to 15 and oftentimes our teachers are left and we're talking and we're saying what should we be doing differently? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3677.181s">What</a>  are the opportunities for success to support students? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3681.542s">Tuesdays</a>  are hour long day. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3683.623s">We</a>  usually have conversations about students, but also planning and what are we doing next? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3691.526s">Teachers</a>  and learning is at the heart of our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3695.148s">The</a>  creation of plans that support school avoidance and therapeutic needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3700.07s">We've</a>  seen attendance go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3701.971s">We've</a>  seen attendance wane. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3704.372s">It</a>  depends on the time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3706.333s">It</a>  depends on where a student is. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3708.574s">What</a>  we do is we sit down, we come up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3711.476s">How</a>  do we get that student into school and we support them? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3715.558s">Personalized</a>  learning plans that support student success. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3718.359s">What</a>  do you want to be when you grow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3720.34s">What</a>  does that look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3721.4s">What</a>  kind of internship do you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3722.981s">What</a>  work experience do you need? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3725.23s">But</a>  we're also into communication that meets them where they're at in terms of their reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3732.14s">If</a>  they're not coming to school, how are they going to hold down a job? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3736.787s">The</a>  team approach to all thoughtful and purposeful work begins <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3741.778s">as</a>  a team, and we model that for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3745.122s">This</a>  afternoon, we talked about electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3747.424s">We</a>  met as a team with students there. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3749.967s">It</a>  was a purposeful and thoughtful conversation where kids knew exactly what they need to do tomorrow, and they were part of the decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3762.102s">And</a>  I think it's really important that we do our best to work in partnership with our caregivers, that we know that our caregivers are very busy, they have challenges themselves, and the more that we can communicate with them, cooperate with them, and collaborate with them, even when we have conflict, is really, really important, that what we do is what we say we're gonna do, and we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3791.02s">The</a>  next slide is about the Expressive Arts Room. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3793.821s">I</a>  don't need to necessarily read it to you, but really, we took one of the classrooms and we've made it a place where kids can go create music. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3803.785s">We</a>  have an old piano. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3805.506s">We</a>  have two keyboards, where one of our music teachers wrote a grant and got us keyboards. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3812.81s">They</a>  can express themselves visually. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3814.832s">One</a>  of their lasting impacts is a mural that's going to go in the classroom around the border. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3821.539s">But</a>  I also think it's looking and expressing oneself in a different way that isn't necessarily sitting down and having that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3832.045s">I</a>  think the other thing is too is having Anthony here as being part of, as an authentic audience member is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3843.15s">Maybe</a>  one day he'll become a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3846.272s">Maybe</a>  one day he'll be advocating for his children. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3850.054s">And</a>  so I think the more that we can serve our community, and that is why we wrote the grant, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3857.584s">But</a>  we also know that we have to do skill building and this is something that we need to continue working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3864.228s">That's</a>  what we want for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3867.13s">For</a>  those of you who are at the graduation, and I appreciate those who are there, I think you saw at its best when our two graduates stood on their chairs and they couldn't stop smiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3877.836s">They</a>  had done something and it was, they had tackled something knowing that maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3884.713s">It</a>  was something that they never thought they could actually do, and their parents were so proud too. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3890.455s">So</a>  opportunities for improvement, because that's the kind of leader I am, and that's the kind of team I've created, is we need to move daily attendance from 70% to 85% total student attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3903.52s">And</a>  then we need to drill down, and we need to create those plans, and we gotta figure out how to get them to school and get them to school on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3911.727s">It's</a>  working, it's a lot of conversation, and what they're seeing is they're achieving when they're getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3918.258s">You</a>  know, the one plus one equals, I'll get good grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3922.903s">We</a>  want to move to project-based units two times a year, you were talking about that, where you intersect content areas, social studies, English, science, and math, so the kids have a question, students have a question, we're answering the question, and we're able to integrate all of their areas of learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3947.316s">so</a>  that they see it differently, and they don't see it as rote work, but they think about how they ask the question, and it also personalizes their learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3957.124s">It</a>  supports the teacher in differentiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3960.186s">So</a>  that is our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3961.968s">We</a>  also believe in incentive-based learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3965.571s">What</a>  does it mean when this happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3968.813s">What</a>  does it mean when I have straight A's? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3971.035s">I</a>  feel good about myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3972.596s">It's</a>  a growth mindset. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3974.215s">It's</a>  not a fixed mindset. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3976.416s">We</a>  wanna continue to partner with area colleges and universities to provide opportunities for pre-service teachers like our expressive arts intern to be trained at Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3990.302s">It</a>  is a great little laboratory. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3993.664s">You</a>  can learn so much about yourself as a teacher, a clinician, a principal, when you're working with our students who learn differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4004.618s">I</a>  also want to create, we want to create more work study opportunities and internships for our older students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4011.102s">So</a>  on the last page, I just want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4014.504s">Our</a>  goal obviously is to ensure that all students have a safe learning environment that supports them in achieving their academic potential and therapeutic needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4024.11s">And</a>  it really is balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4026.712s">Sometimes</a>  it's more therapeutic than academic and vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4031.257s">But</a>  if you look at our two graduates who graduated last year, it all became equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4037.882s">And</a>  that's when you know you've been successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4040.824s">We</a>  wanna just say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4043.165s">We</a>  hope to get more students. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4047.088s">I</a>  hope to go out with Joan's support to find students in other districts to come into Curtis Tufts and support with revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4060.543s">so</a>  that we continue this program and that we actually are a place that everyone wants to be outside of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4071.046s">So</a>  I wanna thank you and I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4076.828s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4078.529s">Thank</a>  you, thank you Dr. Hutchins for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4081.73s">I</a>  know your commitment to the work and I know the students' commitment to the work as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4087.732s">I</a>  just wanna clarify, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4088.973s">just</a>  in terms of the grant, this was the community funds grant through the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4094.575s">And</a>  really it was an introduction to a 501c3 as a fiscal sponsor that we were able to connect you with so that that money could go to the Curtis Tufts directly based on some of the work that you wanted to do in the community, which I think is so important as we think about this particular student population. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4112.82s">And</a>  one of the questions I have is how are we helping our students and our families <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4118.712s">at</a>  the Carter's Tufts feel part of our community, part of the bigger community, because I think that certainly last year we heard a lot around, you know, othering, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4130.734s">And</a>  I think that as we're thinking about equity and inclusivity, I really want us to be thinking about how are we being inclusive of all of our students and helping them to feel like they're part of our community because they very much are a part of our community while respecting, obviously, their individualized needs.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4149.497s">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4150.578s">That's</a>  a dissertation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4153.5s">But</a>  in terms of other, I would say our students this year, and I'm speaking for them, and maybe I shouldn't be, feel more recognized than they ever have. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4170.491s">And</a>  I would say that it's because of they've bought in <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4175.583s">to</a>  what we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4176.984s">Now</a>  there are some students who haven't and we're still working with them and we're not gonna give up on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4182.606s">But</a>  the more we work with the high school and the more we work with the community, the Kiwanis wants to work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4194.411s">They've</a>  been very supportive of us in terms of their leadership program. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4199.093s">The</a>  more that I can build bridges for our students with our students, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4204.622s">the</a>  more they're gonna be recognized in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4208.164s">I</a>  do think there's an opportunity to ensure that our students who attend Curtis Tufts feel seen by all of you and continue to feel seen by the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4222.25s">I</a>  think it's hard because we're so far away. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4226.559s">In</a>  some ways, that's a really good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4228.76s">And</a>  in some ways, that's really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4231.0s">How</a>  do we get them more involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4233.121s">So</a>  it's something we constantly are talking about and improving upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4237.282s">And</a>  I would say that our relationship in terms of how we receive students and how we think about students from high school has changed in really positive ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4248.625s">So</a>  I would say it's a work in progress and we will continue with that mindset.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4256.785s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4257.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4257.986s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4258.766s">And</a>  I would love to see more. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4260.327s">And</a>  I guess just more specifically, how are families being engaged as well in the community, in the Curtis Tufts community? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4270.052s">One,</a>  I guess, just for specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4272.153s">And</a>  then two, is there transportation available for students to go between the Curtis Tufts and the high school, for example, for science labs or that sort of thing with their teachers?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4284.102s">not</a>  currently, but if you want to invest in a cheap van, we'd take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4288.723s">So</a>  it's budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4293.804s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4295.045s">So</a>  I, you know, I mean, I think there are opportunities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4298.125s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4299.026s">Yes,</a>  they get specialized transportation to get to and from school, but not necessarily between the yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4308.128s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4309.068s">So</a>  if they were in the life of the so yes, thank you, Miss Bowen. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4312.349s">I'm</a>  sorry, we're talking across the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4314.045s">So</a>  every student, as I'm sure you know, is entitled to the life of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4318.106s">And</a>  so what I understand Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4319.367s">Bowen</a>  is saying, for others who may not have heard, was she was saying that students are entitled to extracurricular activities, what have you, and so the transportation would be provided for students that needed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4331.131s">And</a>  during the day, if students, you know, using science labs and things like that, because our students at the Curtis Test are entitled to all of the services, including our swimming pools, our science labs, all of those things, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4343.474s">I'm</a>  going to ask my colleagues to be thinking about how we're making that happen for all of our students, because I think that's really important that they're accessing everything that they can access. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4352.561s">So</a>  I just want to sort of elaborate on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4355.383s">I'm</a>  going to let another colleague go, and then I have a couple more questions if you don't mind there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4360.187s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4360.668s">Member</a>  Rousseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4362.449s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4365.503s">You</a>  know, I know that there's a shortage of space for students in and out of district placements. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4373.133s">It's</a>  a serious shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4376.717s">And</a>  so I'm excited that you're thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4380.444s">becoming</a>  a place where we could accept students from other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4384.406s">If</a>  we have the capacity, it seems morally appropriate, not to mention fiscally a good idea, to use the capacity we have, because there are wait lists everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4395.092s">And</a>  all those kids on wait lists are not being served. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4398.214s">So</a>  thank you for thinking about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4408.439s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4410.137s">A</a>  quick question about the service learning, and I think the partnership programs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4415.68s">As</a>  someone who really benefited from service learning when I was in college, and as someone who really appreciates what it's intended for, what is the process, if there is an immediate formal process on how you develop those programming with community groups, or is there a way for community groups to, I think, reach out to the Curtiseps and offer their partnership capabilities?</p>
