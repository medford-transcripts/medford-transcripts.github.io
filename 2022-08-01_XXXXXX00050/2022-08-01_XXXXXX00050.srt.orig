00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:37,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's episode includes an interview with Alicia Lagambina about the work she does as the community social worker for Medford.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I've included additional information in the show notes.

11
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:41,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you enjoy.

12
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:48,871
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you so much for joining me today.

13
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:53,076
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

14
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Alicia Lagambina.

15
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,162
[SPEAKER_01]: She, her, and hers.

16
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:03,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am the community social worker for the City of Medford's Health Department in the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

17
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:06,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also a lifelong Medford resident.

18
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:07,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

19
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Alicia.

20
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:15,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first question that I ask everybody on the podcast is just to share your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

21
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:27,474
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite place to eat in Medford has to be Bob's, and I get a chicken parm sub every time I get takeout from there.

22
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:28,936
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds really good.

23
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:35,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if you could just tell us a little bit about your role at the city, what your job entails, kind of what you do here.

24
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so my position is new.

25
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:43,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I went from being the community recovery coach out of the health department.

26
00:01:44,121 --> 00:02:01,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I transitioned during COVID to the at-risk coordinator and kind of helping those services be connected to those with limited access to the great federal funding coming and being solidified as the community social worker.

27
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,327
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a variety of things.

28
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:04,508
[SPEAKER_01]: The most

29
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:13,956
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing that we have done is our substance use recovery and harm reduction initiatives.

30
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:19,762
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with the Medford Police Department and we do

31
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:24,126
[SPEAKER_01]: door knocks after an individual in the community has overdosed.

32
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:33,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide overdose prevention training, naloxone to that person or their family in the event that another overdose would occur.

33
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:39,117
[SPEAKER_01]: We do one-on-one individual recovery coaching here at City Hall.

34
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:45,082
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a peer recovery group that meets every Wednesday from 4.30 to 5.30 here at City Hall.

35
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:47,924
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have dinner.

36
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:57,331
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very informal, family dinner style check-in with residents who are seeking their place in recovery.

37
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:11,525
[SPEAKER_01]: We support families who call us and have a loved one who is living with a substance use disorder or have some concerning behaviors that they're worried about.

38
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:23,773
[SPEAKER_01]: So substance use, in terms of my role, is huge and definitely something that we consistently want to broaden our services surrounding.

39
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:25,915
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some

40
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:41,776
[SPEAKER_01]: programming where somebody who is interested in recovery, we help them with job placements, recovery home scholarships so that they could pay their first or a couple months rent and remain in recovery.

41
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:47,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, you know, help them with basic needs and gift cards and bus passes.

42
00:03:47,949 --> 00:04:00,581
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting a job readiness program, as well as hoping to, in the works is coordinating with the mayor, such as the housing meeting that they had, we would like to have an employment one.

43
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:05,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So those who are unemployed or underemployed in the resources available.

44
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to

45
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:18,650
[SPEAKER_01]: dip into the career opportunity realm as it's directly connected to the people that we work with who are living with substance use.

46
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:36,474
[SPEAKER_01]: The social work aspect kind of came out of the fact that I'm a social worker and I work for the health department and so a lot of the needs of the communities are directly related to social determinants of health and we

47
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:40,410
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of concerning

48
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:55,876
[SPEAKER_01]: issues in the community and usually what happens is that the health department, the building department, office of community development or veterans office are wondering like what can we do to help connect this person to resources.

49
00:04:56,356 --> 00:05:03,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of the substance use initiative, we don't provide any actual assistance here.

50
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,422
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to make that clear.

51
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:08,944
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no emergency housing fund that I know of.

52
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:17,733
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we do is we connect those two resources in the community as well as case manage them.

53
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:23,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not enough to just connect somebody with resource and make a resource list.

54
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:30,088
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly wasn't during the pandemic where offices were closing and there were different routes to get services.

55
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:32,749
[SPEAKER_01]: and receive services or connect with services.

56
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,610
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do a lot of advocacy for those who are looking for services.

57
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So we follow up with the community providers and we say, hey, what's going on?

58
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:47,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And we follow that with the person.

59
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:52,433
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what we do is just support people while they're going through this

60
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:55,095
[SPEAKER_01]: time that's difficult for them.

61
00:05:56,076 --> 00:06:03,344
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of brief supportive counseling just for those who are really experiencing some anxiety, really experiencing a stressful time.

62
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:09,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get a lot of calls surrounding that without even the resource management.

63
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:19,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like there is a comprehensive idea around supporting folks that are seeking recovery in various stages of substance use and recovery.

64
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:30,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is one of those things that people know is a problem, but they don't know what it means in terms of impact to their community unless it's affecting them.

65
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:36,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I didn't know about your position before I came across it with something with work.

66
00:06:37,195 --> 00:07:00,529
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of knowing that this problem, which I think can be really personal, these things that can be sort of like hidden within families or like different groups, like it's, I think it's really important to know that something like this exists at the city level and that you're, you're not just sort of like hearing what people are going through and like sending them off to a program, but you're like sitting with them, you're having meetings where you provide dinner, and I think it's, it's helpful to know.

67
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:06,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if you could say, like, if you had any estimate of like how many folks you serve with this program.

68
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:09,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have my stats up.

69
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me start by saying there's a couple ways to...

70
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:18,815
[SPEAKER_01]: for someone to come in contact with the community social worker.

71
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So through the co-response, we had the at-risk referral form.

72
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:33,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was interdepartmental through the city, as well as anybody from the community could do that.

73
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:39,272
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have like these patches of data of how many initial contacts, and we also have the

74
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,274
[SPEAKER_01]: multilingual resource line.

75
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:57,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So the community liaison speaking a variety of languages, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, they will respond in the person's language and be able to connect that way.

76
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:06,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the social service calls that go to that come to me and all the health-related COVID vaccinations will go to the public health nurse.

77
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:08,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of

78
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:22,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So through these various avenues of kind of getting connected to me, we've served, I actually had my numbers up for housing.

79
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:28,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also, we run stats based on their needs.

80
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:32,661
[SPEAKER_01]: So housing, food insecurity,

81
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:40,241
[SPEAKER_01]: substance use, mental health, children, elder.

82
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:47,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of have this really messy database of data, which we are working on.

83
00:08:48,027 --> 00:09:00,616
[SPEAKER_01]: We're collaborating with Tufts for our practice evaluation of what we're doing here and also like better ways for us to get this good data that I think the city needs.

84
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the city would

85
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:08,199
[SPEAKER_01]: should hear about the stories that we are hearing about.

86
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:20,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another aspect of my job is to just bring the social work perspective, bring what I'm hearing to those who make the decisions, the stakeholders, the grant funding.

87
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:29,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's funny because I'm one of the only people that have direct contact with populations who need assistance.

88
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a social worker at the

89
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:36,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Council on Aging, we have some family workers in the city.

90
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:44,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So when there is a discussion surrounding social service needs, they kind of call me in as the expert, but I'm not.

91
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:48,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just the only person who is working with these populations.

92
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,775
[SPEAKER_01]: So those who are homeless in Medford, those with housing instability, those with food insecurity.

93
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:15,452
[SPEAKER_01]: so a variety of issues so they'll call on me and it's good because I get to tell them in real time what I'm seeing and what so right now we're kind of working on this a population of those who are unhoused and the community we're finding spots where they are where there's evidence clothes

94
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:22,155
[SPEAKER_01]: shopping carts, and we've been doing some direct outreach this week.

95
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:33,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've made backpacks of Cheez-Its and Gatorade, and more so to just engage with these individuals, tell them about the cooling centers that are going on right now, which are highly underutilized.

96
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:44,189
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's hard to make contact with a population that needs something when we're, you know, the way that we communicate with the public is highly, you know, technical.

97
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a big job.

98
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:45,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

99
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you mentioned social determinants of health.

100
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I'm glad that you brought that up.

101
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:54,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you're speaking to is like, I think this perception sometimes of folks who

102
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:01,721
[SPEAKER_03]: who use drugs, who use substances, this being a moral failing and we just need to get them to stop using and then all their problems will be solved.

103
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,282
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like how you're speaking to all these other issues.

104
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:22,366
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't just use drugs and alcohol because it's fun or whatever, but there can be lots of underlying reasons and then lots of underlying challenges that would help someone achieve recovery, like having a home being one of them, for sure.

105
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:26,167
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an open path to recovery program.

106
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:33,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a program for those who want to achieve sobriety and need certain resources to get there.

107
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:37,949
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a population who don't necessarily want to stop drinking.

108
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,889
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to work on employment or housing.

109
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And we support that.

110
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And we support them in other ways.

111
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can help them make a doctor's appointment, if we can help those

112
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:56,734
[SPEAKER_01]: with giving them access to naloxone, telling them when their needle exchange is.

113
00:11:57,334 --> 00:12:02,897
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're navigating this harm reduction world right now, which seems really scary to people.

114
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:06,779
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is just limiting the health effects.

115
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,021
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a public health initiative.

116
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:15,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're limiting negative health consequences for the people that we're working with.

117
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:22,482
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they want to be abstinent from substances or not.

118
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:32,188
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a population that we've been working with in terms of mitigating the harmfulness of the alcohol use.

119
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:37,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely something that I'd like to see bigger in Medford.

120
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:39,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Harm reduction is huge.

121
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:40,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it can be applied to anything.

122
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,856
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be applied to teens.

123
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:45,397
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good principle.

124
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:54,164
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, to a population where they, you know, worthlessness could be there.

125
00:12:54,204 --> 00:13:04,652
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of really emotional things to just be open to where they are and, you know, what they want, because we are our best, you know, advice givers.

126
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:05,953
[SPEAKER_01]: We know ourselves the best.

127
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:13,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and just, you know, reinstating some self-determination that people know what's best for them with what they have.

128
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:18,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And you all do, do you do Naloxone trainings?

129
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:24,927
[SPEAKER_01]: We do, so we do group ones, we do one-on-ones, we give away free Naloxone and we

130
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:33,449
[SPEAKER_01]: have done a couple of community-wide ones, but anyone can come by or make an appointment to get one.

131
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:43,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this substance use program, and we're working on this social services program, and I always kind of like to plug what I am seeing.

132
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:51,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am seeing a lot of homelessness, and we are seeing a lot of hoarding disorders and cluttering affecting those of age.

133
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:54,258
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really concerning.

134
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:59,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work with the health department and the building department and we

135
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:09,348
[SPEAKER_01]: We rally around these situations and try to find the best course of action because we want people to live independently and healthy in their own homes.

136
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that the city, we all share that ideal.

137
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:17,893
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a hub table that meets every Tuesday.

138
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:27,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any agency that provides social services to the city, including our community mental health providers,

139
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:47,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Children and Families, the public schools have come, DMH, so we have all these providers come and if there is a high-risk case usually brought forth by the police, so the police that fire the EMTs are also there and we all kind of rally around

140
00:14:48,661 --> 00:15:09,554
[SPEAKER_01]: this individual family or dwelling, and we make a team to outreach that person in this crisis moment, elevated risk moment really, and just offer services, you know, and just provide the information, offer it at no, you know, you have to do it kind of message.

141
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:22,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And you bring up a good point, and I'm wondering if it's okay to ask about, I think something that is on a lot of people's minds is this idea of intersection of social work, mental health, and the police.

142
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:27,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like the hub that you're describing involves all of those people.

143
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:31,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And so could you describe kind of what Medford's doing to sort of combine those services?

144
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

145
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:35,126
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, I had the,

146
00:15:37,618 --> 00:16:04,357
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great to be here through two different administrations at the police station and I will say that our police station now is very welcoming to the idea that social workers and clinicians should be interfacing with those with mental health and substance use and being offered services and de-escalation and the whole thing.

147
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:31,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we have the recovery coach who goes for overdose door knocks and offers resources and naloxone and as well as myself to provide anybody the police or any department with connections to social services and we also now officially as of yesterday have our three jail diversion clinicians and they're

148
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:38,923
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be, if not already, corresponding with the police for mental health interactions.

149
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:41,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I work closely with them.

150
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:45,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm located at the police station on Thursdays.

151
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:46,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I work closely with them.

152
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:49,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been

153
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,767
[SPEAKER_01]: really great to see it unfold.

154
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:57,109
[SPEAKER_01]: First, there's a huge capacity for this work.

155
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:10,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Mental health is its own job, and over here with the substance use and the other social determinants of health, there's a huge capacity of work to have this many people and more.

156
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:15,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the police are now having this unit,

157
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:23,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And these mental health clinicians with experience are going out and interfacing with families.

158
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:33,176
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a day clinician, an evening clinician, as well as a youth and families clinician.

159
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:37,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is fairly new within the last year.

160
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Total godsend.

161
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:43,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a grant through DMH.

162
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:53,322
[SPEAKER_01]: They're contracted through Elliott, so they have that connection to the resources of our community health agency that serves Medford.

163
00:17:54,082 --> 00:18:09,028
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the sort of primary reason for someone getting attention from the police is like a mental health, substance use, some sort of related cause that these clinicians can sort of try to intervene and get the support that this person needs rather than sending them to jail.

164
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:12,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, so the whole aim is to avoid...

165
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:25,198
[SPEAKER_01]: jail time and possibly avoid involuntary commitment on the substance use and mental health side by having that person, because it can be traumatic.

166
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:27,880
[SPEAKER_01]: It is traumatic.

167
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:41,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And having those individuals speak to someone and get services in that time and not cause the community more trauma, who's already facing a lot of mental health issues.

168
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:49,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've been here for a long time in this, as like a social work sort of position with the city.

169
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:55,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you can talk about like a piece of it or like a time or project that you're kind of most proud of.

170
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:01,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Substance Use is definitely our baby here.

171
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:18,562
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we move forward, I think just solidifying this position so that we can work on programming for the city that has a connection to the population that they serve.

172
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:33,149
[SPEAKER_01]: A huge part of this is just being a part of the team who is seeing what's going on and advising the top that this is what we're seeing and this is what we need help with.

173
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:35,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having those connections.

174
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:40,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the other thing is this weekly group.

175
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:46,435
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a solid group of people in Medford who come to the group and

176
00:19:48,663 --> 00:20:09,540
[SPEAKER_01]: for any other reason this is the group that they attend and not much else and they feel there's trust there and you know and I think that's something that I'm super proud of and you know my supervisor the office of prevention

177
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:17,618
[SPEAKER_01]: and Outreach Manager Penny, funnily, she is everything to this city.

178
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:29,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So she is responsible for this office, for our positions, for advocating for services, for taking our word for it and advocating to the administration.

179
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:47,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And she also has several grants, which I would be really hard to describe, but just about emergency preparedness and climate resiliency and social determinants of health and equity and all these things.

180
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:51,391
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's responsible for the community liaisons.

181
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,893
[SPEAKER_01]: She's responsible for most of our prevention.

182
00:20:56,283 --> 00:21:01,347
[SPEAKER_01]: grants that are servicing like regionally substance use prevention.

183
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:04,709
[SPEAKER_01]: She's responsible for writing for the jail diversion clinicians.

184
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:07,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean and so on and so on.

185
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:17,699
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a grant through RISE that helps fund our work here with substance use to be able to provide those scholarships and so she's really the brains and the behind

186
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:47,887
[SPEAKER_01]: this operation and she also really believes in like serving the community you know and it can get political when we work for the city but her main her main goal is always to this is about serving the city and i really like that about political players who have that ideology like it can be messy we can yeah but this you know this is what's best for the community so i'm going to fight for this that sounds great and it sounds like there's some like

187
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,108
[SPEAKER_03]: ideas in the works for the future.

188
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:57,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there was something that you thought like here's something that we could improve upon or like a step that would like help us move towards that equity space.

189
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:01,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there anything that you're noticing or anything you would name?

190
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:14,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've come a long way in terms of English literacy and English as a second language and really reaching out to those populations.

191
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel strongly that it's not a population's job to

192
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:22,944
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to us.

193
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:45,576
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our job to reach out to certain populations and we have some really deep-rooted cultural and linguistic groups in Medford and you know it it's not okay for them to not know about services available or be unable to access them due to you know a language barrier and I think that was a huge goal of ours that everything be translated and

194
00:22:46,236 --> 00:23:01,670
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there are communities with more languages and more people who speak other languages and you go into their city hall and they've got like every language and you know, I hate to think that someone would come into this space even to pay a parking ticket and just be unable to.

195
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:09,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've worked really strongly on everything, especially resources be translated.

196
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:10,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a project

197
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:25,954
[SPEAKER_01]: in the spring where we took some of the groups, the community organizations in Medford, and we translated some really important things about them and what they provide the community, so, in a flyer.

198
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:32,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So Anna is the MVP coordinator, and so we have, you know, what happens at the library.

199
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,940
[SPEAKER_01]: The library, you can rent a laptop.

200
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really important for people to know.

201
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:49,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Medford Rec Center, Medford Family Network, us here, you know, so the tricky thing that I learned through it is that

202
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:57,925
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the languages or definitions that we say aren't really translatable.

203
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:02,687
[SPEAKER_01]: So wellness isn't an easy translatable term.

204
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:11,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in one culture, a sort of equivalent was like unburdening oneself.

205
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting to think about, we think of like your mental health wellness.

206
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:19,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not, you know, sometimes a term that's

207
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,487
[SPEAKER_01]: easily translatable.

208
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:30,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cultures, they have mental illness and then they have a work ethic.

209
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:46,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to speak to any other culture or be an expert in it, but just the translation of trying to figure out how to put this out there where this culture would understand what we would like to say was really eye-opening.

210
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:50,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even think, even when I was writing the substance use

211
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:56,276
[SPEAKER_01]: like short description, they were like, this is not translatable.

212
00:24:57,317 --> 00:25:01,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, like a lot of the jargon that we use totally in like some of these terms.

213
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I think also like the value system that, you know, in different communities.

214
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you want me to talk about how I feel?

215
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:08,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't do that.

216
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:15,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the connotation of some of the things that we're providing resources and they just, you know, there was a better way.

217
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

218
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,052
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get people.

219
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,051
[SPEAKER_01]: hooked up with resources.

220
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:25,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean it sounds like you're being really creative and it's a cool program.

221
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:35,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering too if there's any like the best way to get in touch with you or City Hall if somebody has a need or concern that relates to substance use, mental health, any of these resources?

222
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:43,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we have the multilingual resource line, and you can call that and leave a message in any language, really.

223
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:45,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's 781-475-5644.

224
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:56,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can put a request for services on medfordma.org, and that will also come to me.

225
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:04,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we have a outreach cell phone, but it's office hours.

226
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:12,272
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you would like to get in touch with myself or the community recovery coach, 71-654-5635.

227
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:22,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I hadn't mentioned, his name's Jeff Gibson, and he's a complete asset of caring and compassionate

228
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:25,340
[SPEAKER_01]: outreach work in Medford.

229
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:32,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do see him with a couple of bags passing them out in Medford Square, make sure you, you know, say hi.

230
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:37,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we love this community, so.

231
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:39,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Alicia, thank you so much.
