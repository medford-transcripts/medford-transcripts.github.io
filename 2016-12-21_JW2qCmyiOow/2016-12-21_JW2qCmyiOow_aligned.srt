1
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:44,678
Yeah.

2
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:35,534
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

3
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:45,375
At this time, we'd like to introduce the Metropolitan City Fine Arts Department holiday music presentation under Mr. Signey.

4
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:45,975
Thank you.

5
00:03:47,775 --> 00:04:05,160
I'd like to do a piece from the concert I just finished a couple of weeks ago, a winter concert, a piece by George Richard Handel, which is appropriate for the season.

6
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,780
Okay.

7
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:23,424
Yeah.

8
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:33,795
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

9
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,431
Thank you very much, Mr. Cigney.

10
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:31,734
As usual, we are always pleased this time of year to have our orchestra come play for us.

11
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:34,235
It's an honor for us to be here to listen to you tonight.

12
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:35,316
It's an honor, Professor.

13
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:43,000
We enjoy this and we're pleased to be here both for you.

14
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,001
So thank you very much.

15
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:45,762
Thank you very much.

16
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:46,842
Thank you.

17
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:47,083
Ms.

18
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:47,643
Vandekloot.

19
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:56,404
Mr. Zigney, I waited all day today knowing that the students were gonna be here, anticipating, knowing what joy you would bring us.

20
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:58,606
And it was joy over the last two weeks.

21
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:11,373
I managed to attend every concert this winter season, and it was just thrilling, whether it's a group of 12, or I don't know, 14 students you have tonight, or 125 or 30, I don't know, there's so many on the stage.

22
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:13,634
It's amazing that you managed to do it.

23
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:17,737
And Miss Chang as well, wonderful concert, the choir concert was great.

24
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:24,481
They were absolutely fabulous and we're really proud of our students and thank you very much Mr. Zigny for bringing them to us tonight and always.

25
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:32,025
Mr. Benedetto.

26
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:32,505
Thank you.

27
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:44,491
I also want to thank the parents for coming out to so many events throughout the community because I've seen them playing up at the high school for open house nights and a lot of different functions and every time I walk in it makes my night.

28
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,893
It just starts it with such joy and

29
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:51,814
These children have great talent, and I appreciate your dedication as well.

30
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,195
Merry Christmas.

31
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:59,497
Happy holidays to all of you.

32
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:07,179
Approval of the minutes of the December 5th.

33
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,119
Motion for approval by Mr. Scarry.

34
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,900
Madam Mayor.

35
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,480
There's a question by Mr. Benedetto.

36
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,781
Thank you so much.

37
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,262
So in the minutes, there was a motion made.

38
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:21,839
To add, have a note, sorry.

39
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:36,007
So we made a request to add a protocol that Mr. Belson was gonna check into and get back to us on Ms.

40
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:41,630
Stone's concern about things that happen outside of school time and teachers hear about it.

41
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,132
So could we just add that to the agenda list of things to be done?

42
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:47,133
That's all.

43
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,241
So it's like a policy.

44
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,801
It was a policy.

45
00:09:52,921 --> 00:10:03,225
The superintendent was to draft a policy about outside of school issues and a protocol so that way everybody at every school follows the same protocol.

46
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:06,986
So if we could add that to the drop-down list so that way we keep track of that.

47
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,867
On the motion to add that to our report list, do.

48
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:10,927
All those in favor?

49
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:11,007
Aye.

50
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,368
All those opposed?

51
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:13,168
Motion carries.

52
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:13,728
Thank you.

53
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:15,389
And is there a second on the minutes?

54
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:16,209
Seconded by Ms.

55
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:16,789
Van de Kloot.

56
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,690
Roll call, Mr. Secretary.

57
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:35,828
Yes Yes, I'm in the affirmative zero on the negative motion passes approval of bills transfer of funds Madam Mayor Mr. Benedetto, I had a question when reviewing the bills.

58
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:41,713
I don't know if Chris Kristen had a moment there was just a

59
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:46,983
On page three of nine, there was an individual that received two checks.

60
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:49,824
One was for $1,000 and one for $800.

61
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:53,905
And I was just wondering what that service was for.

62
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:56,225
It just seemed like a lot that we don't usually see.

63
00:10:57,706 --> 00:11:00,887
So the name of the person is Valerie DeGeorge.

64
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:06,468
One check on page three, probably the sixth one up from the bottom.

65
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:08,889
And then on

66
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:18,288
Page six of nine, probably 10 up from the bottom.

67
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,991
Two, four, six, eight, oh, 11.

68
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,732
Yeah, pretty close.

69
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:22,732
$800.

70
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:26,875
So I just didn't know what those services were and if they were ongoing.

71
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,859
Sometimes I just like to ask questions so I know what's going on.

72
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:34,562
I don't know, the superintendent might recall as well.

73
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:39,265
Would you like to review them, or do you have an answer for tonight?

74
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:40,005
I would like to review them.

75
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:46,006
I don't know the extent of the specific service, so I would need to look at each specific invoice.

76
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,127
That's OK.

77
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,347
I'm putting you on the spot.

78
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:48,667
I know that.

79
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:52,508
I did have one other question on page three, halfway up the sheet.

80
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:57,468
It was other supplies for $250 for Richard Chaney.

81
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:04,790
I'm sure it was just supplies that he was getting reimbursed for, but when I see that, it's just not a lot of explanation.

82
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,850
So I'd like to know what we're writing our bills for.

83
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:09,498
and there's no rush getting back to me.

84
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:12,621
On the motion that those three items be investigated by Christine.

85
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:13,822
All those in favor?

86
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:14,162
Aye.

87
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:15,083
All those opposed?

88
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:15,883
Motion passes.

89
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:16,624
Thank you.

90
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:19,506
And is there a second on approval of bills transfer funds?

91
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:20,527
Seconded by Ms.

92
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:21,147
DiBenedetto.

93
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:22,649
All those in favor?

94
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:23,089
Aye.

95
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:23,950
All those opposed?

96
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,391
Motion carries.

97
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,972
Approval of payrolls.

98
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:30,995
Motion for approval.

99
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:31,796
Seconded by Ms.

100
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:32,396
Van de Kloot.

101
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:33,177
All those in favor?

102
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:33,557
Aye.

103
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:34,518
All those opposed?

104
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:35,318
Motion carries.

105
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,160
Report of secretary.

106
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:45,848
Ms.

107
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:46,169
Kretz.

108
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:46,489
Yes.

109
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:47,909
Okay.

110
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:48,589
Um, yep.

111
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:58,891
So I got another update this, this actually this morning, late this morning, um, regarding the crossing light at Fulton street and the Felsway.

112
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,051
And, um, I have the update.

113
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,311
I'm going to read it to you right now.

114
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,172
So the Fulton street crossing time has been changed.

115
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:07,929
It's been changed for about two weeks now.

116
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,512
So the walk sign will go for up to 24 seconds.

117
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:22,158
Then it will flash walk for 13 seconds, and it will count down, and you have exactly 13 seconds to finish walking across.

118
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:30,582
With the three second do not walk, so that the lights will then signal to change, and then the cars will begin going.

119
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:35,145
The traffic engineer department is also looking into adding a second crossing

120
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:48,790
in the intersection on the other side would likely make the intersection safer and work more smoothly as it would require less pushing of the pedestrian walk buttons to get from one side of the Fulton to the diagonal side across.

121
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:56,617
However, it's likely that this will need to be reexamined in the spring due to the weather conditions that are coming with the winter coming.

122
00:13:57,077 --> 00:14:01,080
And it's difficult to paint lines and do any repaving in the winter.

123
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:04,283
So it's something that they're going to revisit again in the February.

124
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:15,516
I did test out the crossing light today with Noah three times, and you have 36 seconds, and you can get across all lanes, and you don't have to run.

125
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:18,258
You can simply walk across all lanes.

126
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:20,059
The traffic is stopped everywhere.

127
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:20,679
It's great.

128
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:21,220
It's amazing.

129
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,082
It was really impressive, so I wanted to share that update with everybody.

130
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:26,643
Very good, Ms.

131
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:26,903
Kratz.

132
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:27,443
Thank you.

133
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:27,844
Thank you.

134
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:28,924
Mr. Skerry?

135
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:40,413
Mr. Johnson, no.

136
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:40,893
Yep.

137
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,935
That's I can, I can forward you the email.

138
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:43,235
Okay.

139
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:43,456
Yeah.

140
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:43,756
No problem.

141
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:44,276
Okay.

142
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:44,817
Very good.

143
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:46,458
On the motion that report be accepted.

144
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:47,259
All those in favor.

145
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:48,760
All those opposed.

146
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,241
What is accepted?

147
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:54,805
Report of committees, community participation.

148
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:56,427
None.

149
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,045
Report of Superintendent.

150
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:05,448
A recommendation to accept gift from Edward Clark to honor the memory of former Director of English, Leah R. Kaleri-Clark.

151
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:06,629
Mr. Superintendent.

152
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:22,275
Madam Mayor and members of the committee, it's our distinct privilege and honor this evening to have with us Medford resident Professor Emeritus at Suffolk University, Edward Clark, who is the husband of the late Director of our English Department, Leah R. Kaleri-Clark.

153
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:32,958
did an outstanding job during her time as the leader of that department and as an inspiration to our faculty and to our teachers and to our students.

154
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,702
Professor Clark is here this evening with his attorney, Paul Kelly.

155
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:52,524
And they are going to make a presentation and ask the committee to accept a gift in honor and memory of Leah in the amount of $25,000 to serve as a scholarship.

156
00:15:53,024 --> 00:16:01,506
So I'd like at this time to call upon Attorney Kelly and Professor Clark to join us at the rostrum here to make any statements they would like to make.

157
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:13,209
While they're coming up, I'd indicate that under the direction of our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, we have set up some criteria.

158
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,230
You have it in front of you.

159
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,411
I won't read it at this time.

160
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:17,412
But she is also here.

161
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:20,574
And we welcome any questions that you may have.

162
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:23,796
We welcome you, Mr. Clark and Mr. Kelly.

163
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:26,218
Thank you both very much.

164
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:27,459
I'm Paul Kelly.

165
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,561
I'm a friend of Professor Clark.

166
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:33,343
And I think he'd like to say a few words about his

167
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:39,433
His wife, Leah R. Cleary Clark.

168
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:50,776
Leah was born and raised in Jamaica Point, the oldest of nine children.

169
00:16:53,296 --> 00:17:01,558
After high school, she joined the Order of the Sisters of Notre Dame.

170
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,702
a teaching order.

171
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:17,569
And over the years, she taught every grade from first grade through high school, specializing in English.

172
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:31,575
In the course of those years, she took a bachelor's degree from a manual college and a master's in English from

173
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:36,259
the School of English at Middlebury College.

174
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,741
In 1975, she left the Order and

175
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:03,031
became head of the English department in the Medford schools.

176
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,874
She retired after 11 years and died of cancer at age 56.

177
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:42,421
One of her favorite enterprises in the Medford schools was what she called Awards Night.

178
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:57,971
It was a sort of gala occasion in its way in the auditorium at Medford High School in which she

179
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:14,466
gave an award for excellence in English to a considerable number of students at Medford High School.

180
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:21,690
It was held in the auditorium at the high school.

181
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,893
She would be very happy to know that

182
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:57,836
in a way that tradition is due to be carried on with this award in English studies that Mr. Belson and Nicole have so graciously agreed to support as it comes forward to the school committee.

183
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:12,398
Thank you for your attention, and I thank you for your interest.

184
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:17,702
Thank you very much, Mr. Clark.

185
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:27,149
Mr. Skerry.

186
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,150
Thank you, Mayor.

187
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:37,087
Professor Clark, I would like to thank you on behalf of the citizens and the students of Medford for this great gift, and I would move that we accept it wholeheartedly.

188
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:41,776
And on a personal note, I had the privilege and honor of working with

189
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:45,528
later in my earlier teaching days at Medford High School.

190
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:53,512
And she taught me a lot that I carried through life and carried on to my second livelihood as a investigator for the Commonwealth.

191
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:59,514
And I'm very glad for the lessons that she taught me and I could pass those on to my students.

192
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,115
And again, thank you very much for your generosity.

193
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:03,276
Merry Christmas.

194
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:11,914
Ms.

195
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:12,414
Vander Kloot.

196
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:27,904
I too would like to just extend the thanks of this of myself and the school committee and also for all of those students in the future who are going to receive the generous scholarship because of your generosity tonight.

197
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:28,924
So thank you very much.

198
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:40,292
We really appreciate that you've come down and this was just before my time on the school committee but I know that Leia's reputation was someone I heard of and was

199
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:51,202
very very well known and very well respected so thank you so much and thank you for reminding us tonight during this holiday season of the tremendous people we've had in our past.

200
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:51,903
Thank you.

201
00:21:51,923 --> 00:21:57,350
Thank you.

202
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:05,958
Of course, I want to say thank you for your generosity to Professor Clark, for hers.

203
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:14,780
But more so is the passion that you and she had brought to our district, a passion that I know still exists.

204
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,381
And I know that passion will be definitely at our award ceremony.

205
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:25,403
And so I hope she will be looking down and her spirit will rekindle the generosity that you have brought tonight.

206
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:26,363
So thank you very much.

207
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:31,601
Ms.

208
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:31,961
Kretz.

209
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:33,323
Hi.

210
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:36,545
I just want to thank you very much for this very generous donation.

211
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:37,546
Thank you so much.

212
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:39,768
The students will really appreciate it.

213
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:40,629
Thank you very much.

214
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:49,256
There is a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

215
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:50,337
Roll call vote, please.

216
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:51,318
Ms.

217
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:51,618
Guino.

218
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:53,580
Absolutely.

219
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:53,860
Mr. Benedetto.

220
00:23:00,002 --> 00:23:02,523
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

221
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:03,944
We proudly accept this gift.

222
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:07,426
And awards night is a night that we all look forward to attending as well.

223
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,148
It's a joyous night in our city and for our school department and school children.

224
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:13,650
So we're very proud to be able to add this on.

225
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,990
So thank you, Professor Clark.

226
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:27,938
I just want to also comment that I had the pleasure of working with Leah for many years and, um,

227
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:33,701
He was a very, very outstanding educator and a good kind person who really cared about our young people.

228
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:38,023
But I also want to make note that attorney Kelly this evening is with us.

229
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:44,548
He is the husband of the superintendent of the Arlington public schools and the former chairperson of the Winchester public schools.

230
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:49,531
So it's a pleasure to have you here and give our best to Kathy because she's a terrific educator too.

231
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:50,352
Thank you very much.

232
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:01,830
Thank you.

233
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:08,039
A recommendation to accept donation to Columbus Elementary School to honor the memory of Margaret Weigel.

234
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,501
Mr. Superintendent.

235
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:14,328
Madam Mayor, I call upon our assistant superintendent to join us and explain this gift.

236
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:17,922
Good evening.

237
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:31,727
So on behalf of Kathy Kay and the Columbus Elementary School, I would like to inform you that the co-workers of Margaret Weigel, who worked at Six Red Marbles, wanted to make a donation to the Columbus Elementary School in her memory.

238
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:34,448
She recently lost her battle to cancer.

239
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:46,092
She was very interested in the education of children, and together with her co-workers, decided to use the $2,000 memorial towards a donation to the Columbus School Library.

240
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:53,337
The money will be given to the PTO who will work with Amanda Fowler, the Columbus School paraprofessional, to purchase new books.

241
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:58,681
They will choose books which will further enrich the collection that they are currently growing.

242
00:24:59,261 --> 00:25:07,547
Each will be marked with a label to read in loving memory of Margaret Weigel, whose passion for learning knowledge and understanding live on.

243
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:14,132
So I'd like for you to accept this donation to the Columbus Elementary School for $2,000 in Margaret Weigel's name.

244
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:16,654
Thank you very much.

245
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:17,335
Thank you.

246
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:19,156
I had the privilege of knowing Margaret.

247
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:23,858
I'd call her my friend, as I'm sure several of you as well would call her a friend.

248
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:24,939
She was a friend to many.

249
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:29,021
She took good care of the people in the city, and we miss her dearly.

250
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:32,102
So on behalf, I know there's a motion for approval by Ms.

251
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:32,583
Cuno.

252
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,764
Is there a second on the floor by Ms.

253
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:35,364
Van de Kloot?

254
00:25:36,004 --> 00:25:36,765
Roll call vote, Ms.

255
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,245
Disceri.

256
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:37,325
Ms.

257
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:38,225
Cuno.

258
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:39,346
Yes, sir.

259
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:39,566
Ms.

260
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:39,726
Beto.

261
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:40,727
Yes, and thank you.

262
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:41,227
Ms.

263
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:41,587
Stretz.

264
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:41,927
Yes.

265
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:41,987
Ms.

266
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:42,948
Westone.

267
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:43,228
Yes.

268
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:49,405
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

269
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:52,207
Thank you very, very much to the family of the Wiggles.

270
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:06,137
Report on Columbus School Celebration of Cultures Night.

271
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:07,238
Mr. Superintendent.

272
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:14,243
Madam Mayor, a return performance by our assistant superintendent, because it's Columbus School Night and we're going to discover a lot of things.

273
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:16,905
And so she'll present this report.

274
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:18,606
So thank you very much.

275
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:21,928
I'm very proud tonight to have our Columbus School family with us.

276
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:28,632
At this time, I'd like Kathy Kay, the principal of the Columbus School, to come up with Kara.

277
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:31,073
Kara, I'm trying to remember your last name, Rossi.

278
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:36,417
And I want to thank the Columbus School family who are here tonight to celebrate as well.

279
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:40,010
There are two reports that I'd like to tell you about tonight.

280
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:44,472
The first one is that the Columbus Celebration of Cultures Night.

281
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:49,674
As you know, if you go to the Columbus School, there are so many different cultures to celebrate.

282
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:57,597
So on Thursday, November 17, they hosted their second annual Giving Thanks, a celebration of cultures night.

283
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:05,820
All the Columbus School families were invited to share and celebrate the diverse backgrounds that make the Columbus School such a special place.

284
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:27,566
Dinner was provided by local restaurants, and I was there, so I think I sampled every bit from the edible arrangements, Harrow's Chicken Pie, Razzo's Flatbread Company, Istanbulu, Oasis, May's Cafe, Bocelli's, LaCasha's, Salvatore's, Boston Chi, Party, and Kelly's Roast Beef.

285
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:41,711
There were cultural performances by the children and families, including piano and gymnastics, martial arts, bilingual storytelling, and a rousing performance of the music of Mali by Balka.

286
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:44,231
You're going to have to help me with this, Kathy.

287
00:27:46,405 --> 00:27:47,705
and her family.

288
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:57,328
Raffle prizes included an eight-week course from Dance Caliente, puzzles, books, and candy samples from all around the world.

289
00:27:57,828 --> 00:27:59,608
It was really an extraordinary night.

290
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:08,550
The kids were all working at separate tables, doing arts and crafts, making flags, playing games with the teachers that were there.

291
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,010
Would you like?

292
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,311
Learning new languages.

293
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:10,771
Please come up.

294
00:28:11,351 --> 00:28:16,272
And it wouldn't have happened without the wonderful PTO at the Columbus Elementary School, many of whom are here tonight.

295
00:28:21,194 --> 00:28:34,279
They worked tirelessly, you know, up until the time getting the vendors to support their goods for the evening and getting parents to be involved, canvassing the kids to do their events.

296
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,500
One of our students played the piano.

297
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:41,697
And some of the kids got up and did their martial arts, and they read bilingual books, like Mrs. Caldwell said.

298
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:44,118
And it was just a fantastic night, and everyone really had a good time.

299
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:46,660
So we're looking forward to number three, and please join us next year.

300
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:48,201
Excellent.

301
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:55,946
Is there a motion to accept the report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

302
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:56,467
Van de Kloet.

303
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:57,227
All those in favor?

304
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:57,307
Aye.

305
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:58,708
All those opposed?

306
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:00,049
Motion passes.

307
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:02,831
Report on Columbus School Little Free Library.

308
00:29:04,747 --> 00:29:08,049
So this was really a very fun experience as well.

309
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:14,393
And I have to say that Kara Rossi was behind us two years ago.

310
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:21,918
She came to me and she wanted to have this little free library, and we were working on a solution to try to figure out how to do it.

311
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:28,783
So then along came Eric Handler, who is the husband of Shannon Handler, who is a special education teacher.

312
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:40,248
at the Columbus Elementary School, and of course Mrs. Rossi with her fifth grade students as they work together on a project that will actually air on PBS in the near future.

313
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:43,429
The project is called Little Free Library.

314
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:48,011
Mr. Handler and his design squad kids, are they here tonight?

315
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:49,572
Okay.

316
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:52,193
Just your kids.

317
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:58,235
I worked with the Columbus School to install their handiwork.

318
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:01,977
The full video production will be completed in about two months.

319
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:05,338
The students had a great time and worked really well together.

320
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:09,400
Mr. Hanlon was very impressed by the hard work of the children.

321
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,742
So if anybody wants to know what is this little school library,

322
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:21,766
You can go to the website or I can tell you that it is take a book, return a book, free book exchange.

323
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:27,869
So they come in many shapes and sizes, but the most common version is a small wooden box of books.

324
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:29,690
Anyone can take a book.

325
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,691
So in the community, people can stop by and look.

326
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,072
And if you turn to the page right,

327
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:40,860
gave you a picture of Miss Rossi and her group of children, you can see there is a picture of the little school library.

328
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,886
So at this time I'd like to call upon Miss Carol Rossi to tell you a little bit about it as well.

329
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:48,369
Miss Rossi.

330
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,011
And the children.

331
00:30:58,943 --> 00:31:01,827
school committee, thank you so much for putting us on the agenda tonight.

332
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:03,049
We really appreciate it.

333
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,112
Mayor and Mr. Bellson as well.

334
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,875
So as Ms.

335
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:14,344
Caldwell said, this has been kind of a two year project for me and Eric Handler kind of came along and

336
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:16,648
Basically read my mind.

337
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:22,010
Um, he provided the little free library.

338
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,850
Um, it's, it looks like a large birdhouse, right?

339
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,331
A freestanding birdhouse.

340
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,511
Um, he supplied it with books to start.

341
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,792
I am the library steward for that.

342
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:33,512
So it is registered nationally.

343
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:37,453
So I will be in charge of maintaining it and I'm kind of checking on it.

344
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:41,194
Um, it will have both children's books as well as adult books.

345
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:45,987
Um, there are two levels in the, um, the actual, uh, structure.

346
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:54,372
Um, but I do have a student here who was there the day and he was in the filming of it, uh, two actually.

347
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:55,793
Yeah, I have two of them.

348
00:31:56,493 --> 00:31:58,815
Um, it was a great experience for them.

349
00:31:59,155 --> 00:32:04,538
We have not seen the final production of it, and I believe it's going to be about seven minutes long.

350
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:11,145
And I can't wait, because it was kind of filmed backwards, as editors and producers do.

351
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:14,507
So it will be nice when we see it all put together.

352
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:22,153
But I'd like them to come to the microphone and maybe give their experience on the day, which was about four hours long.

353
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:24,855
It was windy and cold, yes.

354
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,498
So Lindsay and Rafael, please come on up.

355
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:45,501
So I think the best part about that day was probably spending it with everybody and filming it.

356
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:57,071
I just loved hanging out with everybody and yeah.

357
00:32:57,672 --> 00:33:01,755
Maybe the best part of it was I never was in a

358
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:12,381
I never got film before, so it was kind of new to me, but like fun new, not like scary.

359
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:21,092
So it was kind of interesting to be in a film.

360
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:36,419
One of the funniest things about the end of that day was we picked four fifth grade students and they said, okay, is this going to be done tomorrow?

361
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,840
We can watch it tomorrow.

362
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,241
And Mr. Handler laughed.

363
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:41,383
He's like, how about two months from now?

364
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:43,184
So it wasn't instant.

365
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:45,465
So thank you.

366
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:50,107
It's a great option for the community to have right out in front of the Columbus.

367
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:51,707
So I hope it gets great use.

368
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:57,209
And in the springtime, I think it will be a very busy spot.

369
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,189
If not, it already is.

370
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,049
So thank you.

371
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,030
Well, thank you, Ms.

372
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:00,170
Rossi.

373
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:00,630
You're welcome.

374
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,817
Lindsey and Raphael, great job, by the way.

375
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:08,357
Great job tonight.

376
00:34:08,377 --> 00:34:09,078
Yeah, they were terrific.

377
00:34:09,618 --> 00:34:17,342
So in this season of giving, this started the whole giving back process, which is something that we love to do in our buildings.

378
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:19,543
And it's not just at the Columbus Schools.

379
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:20,703
All of them are doing this.

380
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:23,204
But this held a special place for me.

381
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:25,085
So thank you so much, Columbus School.

382
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:26,426
Great job.

383
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:39,433
We're just going to talk about another donation for the Home for Little Wanderers.

384
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:46,336
So earlier this year, I've been with Medford teaching for the past four years.

385
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,537
We've always done some sort of community service.

386
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:50,858
We've done treats for troops the past four years.

387
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:58,902
This year we took on a new project and donated no-sew blankets, no-sew fleece blankets to the Home for Little Wanderers.

388
00:35:00,282 --> 00:35:05,743
My 5th grade students got together 6 mornings from 8 to 8.30 and they were like busy bees.

389
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:10,965
They made over, they made 25 blankets that we donated to the children there.

390
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:19,887
The home was so impressed that one of the gentlemen came in to thank them personally and played a

391
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,839
extra recess kickball game with them as well.

392
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:33,002
So, but of the 70 fifth graders at the Columbus, about half of them showed up in the morning to help make these blankets.

393
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:37,524
So they're, you know, children just want to give and they were very much involved.

394
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:41,365
Very quickly, I'm just going to have each one of them say what they liked best about it.

395
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:44,546
It's beautiful.

396
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:45,607
That's just an example.

397
00:35:52,922 --> 00:36:00,026
What I like best about doing the project was actually making the breakers because it was really fun.

398
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:05,549
Me and my friends got to do it together and I really enjoyed it a lot.

399
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:18,820
So as Fedora said, actually my favorite part of the no soap blankets was actually making them too.

400
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:28,105
And I also liked knowing that they were going to a community that helps children like us.

401
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,988
That one's short.

402
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:40,052
I liked the part where you could like, I liked making the blankets, but I liked that I could be with my friends and everything like that.

403
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:41,333
Just, it was fun.

404
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:59,527
I liked making the blankets and donating them to the kids and I was with my friends so I wasn't as nervous and I also liked that we were with our friends doing it.

405
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:09,390
My favorite part was being with my friends in the morning and being

406
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:14,668
and making the blankets because they were soft and fluffy.

407
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:28,613
Probably making the best part probably the best part of making the blankets is that it helps others that need it.

408
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:33,395
So it's basically helping others.

409
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:34,715
That's what it's all about.

410
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:40,612
Thank you so much.

411
00:37:40,652 --> 00:37:41,372
Thank you very much, Ms.

412
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:41,853
Rossi.

413
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:42,413
Thank you.

414
00:37:43,273 --> 00:37:52,796
Is there a motion to receive and place Columbus School Little Free Library report on file, please?

415
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:56,097
On the motion, Mr. Scarry, seconded by Ms.

416
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:56,577
Vandeclute.

417
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:57,277
All those in favor?

418
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:57,357
Aye.

419
00:37:57,877 --> 00:37:58,518
All those opposed?

420
00:37:58,598 --> 00:37:59,278
Motion passes.

421
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:00,392
Ms.

422
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,733
Vandekloot, did you wish to speak on that?

423
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:05,615
No, I just wanted to thank the parents for coming down and bringing the kids tonight.

424
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:08,936
My favorite part was hearing the kids tell us about their projects.

425
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:13,878
Obviously, there's a whole lot going on at the Columbus School, and it's really great.

426
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:16,280
I'm very familiar with the Little Free Libraries.

427
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:24,363
I first ran across them in a Chicago neighborhood when I was visiting, and so I'm so proud that we have one now right outside the Columbus School.

428
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:25,224
Thank you very much.

429
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:30,378
Ms.

430
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:30,878
Cuno.

431
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,359
I just want to say thank you.

432
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:35,461
Thank you to the teachers involved, the parents, the students.

433
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:41,523
I know we sit here throughout the year and we're talking about budgets and how to get more money.

434
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:52,309
But tonight really does prove, not that we're not trying to get any more money, but it does prove the fact that we can be so successful in really thinking outside of the box.

435
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:58,815
and making something passionate, making it your own, and being extremely successful at it.

436
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:09,927
And what the children have done and the reputation that they've already built for themselves is just, there's not enough money to thank you for that.

437
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:11,149
So I just want to say thank you.

438
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:21,294
Report on Global Scholars Program at Museum of Science.

439
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:22,155
Mr. Superintendent.

440
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:37,927
Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this was an outstanding activity, and I'm going to call upon our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, to brief you on the exciting day that our young people had at the Science Museum, along with Dr. Piazza.

441
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:45,971
Good evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent Belson, and members of the Medford School Committee.

442
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:48,537
So Dr. Nicole Chiesa is here with me tonight.

443
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,800
I wrote the report, but

444
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:58,459
Dr. Chiesa works, as I do, with the teachers on bringing this wonderful program to Medford.

445
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,941
So this is a great night.

446
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:09,112
We've talked a lot about the community partnerships, the local partnerships, past relationships we're building on with Ms.

447
00:40:09,132 --> 00:40:09,772
Galeri Clark.

448
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:24,085
And tonight we're here to talk about a partnership that we have with a national, actually international organization, Global Scholars, which many of you are familiar with because we've presented about this on this program, uh, in the past.

449
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:34,654
So specifically, I'm here to talk about a field trip that Global Scholars provided to all of our grade seven students last Wednesday to the Museum of Science.

450
00:40:34,714 --> 00:40:35,395
It was a wonderful.

451
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:46,097
experience for our students, and you can see in the report that it was directly tied to the curriculum that the students are studying in the program.

452
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:59,018
So the visit focused on preparing students for unit three of that Digital City's Connect curriculum, entitled How We Make Things.

453
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:01,539
So the theme was innovation.

454
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,743
Students viewed exhibits, Da Vinci the Genius, to learn about historic inventions.

455
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:16,748
Innovated engineers and design challenges to discover the engineering design process and how it is used to create innovative products.

456
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:25,696
and the Charles River exhibit in the Yawkey Gallery to see how engineering solutions are being used locally to manage and protect the river.

457
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:31,522
The guiding theme of this visit was on how products are created to solve real world problems.

458
00:41:31,883 --> 00:41:35,847
So there's the connection to that grade seven program.

459
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,581
Um, when we first started this program three, actually two years ago, we're in our third year of the program.

460
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:48,362
We were the only school in Massachusetts to be participating in it.

461
00:41:49,142 --> 00:42:01,564
Um, we helped global scholars reach out, reach out, and they are now involved with some schools in Boston, the Everett public schools, and I believe it's one school in Chelsea.

462
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,845
So on this field trip, there were a thousand students.

463
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:09,087
It was an immense undertaking by the organizers of this program.

464
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:14,129
Uh, and I thought it was well organized attached to the report.

465
00:42:14,149 --> 00:42:15,210
You can see the schedule.

466
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,991
So they saw four different exhibits.

467
00:42:18,992 --> 00:42:24,795
Uh, the global scholars provided lunch and then the day ended with a, with a picture.

468
00:42:25,315 --> 00:42:27,116
Uh, they actually split the group into two.

469
00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:29,677
So there were 501 picture and 500 in another and organizing a photograph of 500 students.

470
00:42:34,362 --> 00:42:37,985
is not an easy task, but they made it look relatively simple.

471
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:42,088
Prior to this field trip, the teachers did a lot of preparation.

472
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:56,278
They were provided guidance on what to prepare the students to see, and then there also was a follow-up sheet, a study guide that the teachers have been working with the students on.

473
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:01,068
We did extend an invitation out to various members of the community.

474
00:43:01,088 --> 00:43:04,493
Of course, being in the middle of the week, it's not easy to get away from work.

475
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:08,719
We do appreciate those people that were able to spend time with us.

476
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:13,045
A special thank you to school committee woman Kathy Kretz.

477
00:43:14,987 --> 00:43:23,574
And in particular, our grade seven, four of our grade seven teachers really have taken a lead role in bringing this to our students.

478
00:43:23,954 --> 00:43:30,960
So those students are Ryan McCarthy, Kathleen O'Donohue, Brian Villard, and Frank Zizzo.

479
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,781
So they've done a wonderful job.

480
00:43:33,162 --> 00:43:38,025
They've worked more closely with Dr. Chiesa than myself.

481
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:40,848
I've had more of a connection with Global Scholars in New York City.

482
00:43:41,348 --> 00:43:42,769
So between Nicole and myself,

483
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:45,747
You know, we think the program's going great.

484
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:58,812
We're very happy to be able to offer it to Medford students, and we're thankful of the generosity of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tiven and her wonderful, incredibly wonderful staff.

485
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,193
I don't know if you wanted to offer anything else.

486
00:44:03,094 --> 00:44:04,314
Thank you very much.

487
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:06,015
Ms.

488
00:44:06,035 --> 00:44:06,435
Kratz.

489
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:07,055
Thank you.

490
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:11,857
I want to say, you know, thank you very much to the Bloomberg Philanthropies, and I might be saying that wrong.

491
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:18,097
But it was a great day, and it was so enjoyable for the students, the administrators, the teachers, everybody there.

492
00:44:18,137 --> 00:44:22,839
We were all involved in the exhibits, having fun, and it was so organized.

493
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:25,699
It was hard to believe there was over 1,000 students there.

494
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,180
It was so organized.

495
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,120
It was a great day.

496
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:28,620
Thank you.

497
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,501
It was a pleasure going.

498
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:30,021
Great.

499
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:30,361
Thank you.

500
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:31,681
Thank you very much.

501
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:34,662
Is there a motion on the floor for acceptance of the report by Ms.

502
00:44:34,682 --> 00:44:35,063

503
00:44:35,463 --> 00:44:35,683

Aye.

507
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:39,924
All those opposed?

508

The report is accepted.

509
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,065
Thank you very much.

510
00:44:43,462 --> 00:44:44,823
Negotiations in legal matters?

511
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:45,123
None?

512
00:44:46,044 --> 00:44:46,204
None.

513
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:46,264
OK.

514
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:47,966
New business.

515
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:48,646
We have a few.

516
00:44:49,267 --> 00:44:49,787
New business.

517
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:50,928
School committee resolution.

518
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:55,832
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Marvin Brown.

519
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:59,414
Mr. Brown was the husband of former science teacher Althea Brown.

520
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:08,341
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Cleveland Red Honeycutt.

521
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:12,485
Mr. Honeycutt was the father of Bill Honeycutt, a generous supporter of the Medford Public Schools.

522
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:19,518
And further, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Mary Alice Leach.

523
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:20,098
Ms.

524
00:45:20,138 --> 00:45:23,240
Leach was the sister of retired Medford police officer William Fargo.

525
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:29,804
Also, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Jean Barry Sutherland.

526
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:31,825
Jean was a longtime Medford resident.

527
00:45:31,885 --> 00:45:35,507
She was a teacher and administrator for the Medford Public Schools for over 40 years.

528
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:38,168
And lastly,

529
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:45,837
That the Medford School Committee has expressed its sincere condolences to the family of Joseph C. Bettinelli.

530
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:48,982
He was a Lincoln School of Science teacher who passed away last week.

531
00:45:49,162 --> 00:45:52,829
Could we all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these fine Medford individuals?

532
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:07,835
Ms.

533
00:46:07,855 --> 00:46:08,336
Van de Kloot.

534
00:46:08,656 --> 00:46:12,760
I would just like to take a moment to comment on remembering Jean Barry.

535
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:24,593
Jean was such an exceptional individual, a teacher who just loved what she did, a administrator and a community member, and lastly, a fighter who waged such an incredible

536
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:32,612
fight and with such a wonderful, always upbeat, always lovely personality.

537
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:46,859
So I just take a minute to remember Jean Barry because over the years in the school committee, she was certainly one of the first teachers that I got to know well and one who I certainly felt had a very large impact on our students.

538
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,401
And I remember her both professionally and personally.

539
00:46:51,282 --> 00:46:51,962
She's a great lady.

540
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:56,222
Through all of her struggles, she's always had a smile on her face every time I saw her.

541
00:46:56,262 --> 00:46:57,263
What a wonderful woman.

542
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:01,687
She will be missed by Medford and beyond, and we were blessed to know her.

543
00:47:02,628 --> 00:47:03,229
Mr. Skerry.

544
00:47:03,249 --> 00:47:07,913
Yes, I'd also like to express my condolences to the Barry family.

545
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:12,498
I grew up in the neighborhood that Gene grew up in, and we both attended Boston State.

546
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:25,258
And she was a teacher that always gave 100% and she was a principal that was loved by all her students all the time and would go out of her way to make sure that whatever the students needed, they always had.

547
00:47:25,938 --> 00:47:27,079
And she'll be sorely missed.

548
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,620
Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

549
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,761
Mr. Superintendent.

550
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:36,427
Madam Mayor, it's interesting and perhaps ironic that tonight Jean became the first principal of the New Columbus School.

551
00:47:37,047 --> 00:47:38,168
And tonight we celebrated

552
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:40,148
achievements of the Columbus School.

553
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:44,489
So I think that something comes together mystically in our world.

554
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:52,993
As Jean opened that school and she was the queen of her castle as she would announce in the morning, every morning over the loudspeaker.

555
00:47:53,673 --> 00:47:55,634
It was exciting.

556
00:47:55,694 --> 00:47:56,875
Go ahead.

557
00:47:56,895 --> 00:48:01,997
I ask my colleagues if we could dedicate this meeting in the memory of Jean Barry Sutherland.

558
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:06,349
On the motion to dedicate this meeting, in her memory, all those in favor?

559
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:06,870
Aye.

560
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:07,890
All those opposed?

561
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:08,951
Motion passes.

562
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:11,773
And finally, we have one last item on the agenda.

563
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:16,836
A recommendation to accept CASET grant of $50,000 for Italian language program.

564
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:18,217
Mr. Superintendent.

565
00:48:18,837 --> 00:48:27,903
Madam Mayor, members of the committee, the CASET program, the Centro Attivo Scholastico program, which presents- Italian.

566
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:29,283
Italian, which presents

567
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:45,421
funds for us to keep our elementary language program going and to also support the development of the Italian culture within our schools, so central to the fact that there's such a strong Italian heritage in our community as well.

568
00:48:48,169 --> 00:48:55,972
I had the opportunity to attend a meeting yesterday, and several of our elementary teachers were recognized, and Anne Marie was there.

569
00:48:57,092 --> 00:49:07,756
And the ever energetic Jaconda Mata, who heads the organization, presented us with a check for $50,000 to help support that program.

570
00:49:07,776 --> 00:49:12,778
So I recommend that we accept it and make it work for us as we go forward.

571
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:34,007
very good miss clinton you know i'd just like to say that height i do have the pleasure of going to the board meeting once a year and i am thrilled that every time i come back uh... we have been given a generous donation for us so and and what's really nice this year is also the relationship that we have formed with the general counsel

572
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:51,130
the Italian General Counsel who is very much into education and very much into looking into the future of hopefully, we've already partnered with him in different ways, but the goal is really to express and exchange the culture of the students that we have here.

573
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:55,815
to hopefully have like exchange programs going on with the students in Italy.

574
00:49:56,216 --> 00:50:05,924
So it's really nice when you're working with other partnerships that are really pushing the envelope and really working with the educational part.

575
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:13,850
So I just want to say thank you to the council general and of course CASET run by Giovanda Malta.

576
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:14,371
Thank you.

577
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:14,831
Very good.

578
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:16,232
On the motion for approval by Ms.

579
00:50:16,252 --> 00:50:17,573
Cuneo, seconded by Ms.

580
00:50:17,593 --> 00:50:18,754
Kretz, roll call vote, Ms.

581
00:50:18,794 --> 00:50:19,255
Disceri.

582
00:50:27,018 --> 00:50:30,200
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

583
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:33,141
And is there a motion to adjourn?

584
00:50:33,802 --> 00:50:34,882
Motion to adjourn.

585
00:50:35,162 --> 00:50:37,604
We wish everyone a wonderful holiday season.

586
00:50:37,624 --> 00:50:40,665
Stay safe out there.

587
00:50:41,646 --> 00:50:46,648
We have some bad weather coming, some ice cold weather coming, so stay warm, stay bundled.

588
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:48,489
Hopefully it'll be during vacation.

589
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:49,270
Motion to adjourn.
