00:00:00,592 --> 00:00:06,697
Welcome to tonight's meeting of the community effort Community Development Board, February 1 of 2022.

2
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:09,280
No, it's 2023.

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:16,086
I'll get that's only February, want to call the meeting to order and welcome everyone to the meeting.

4
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:21,211
And I'm going to read some fun obligatory messages before we get started.

5
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:29,063
First, regarding the nature of the meeting, this hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

6
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:41,051
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 107 of the Acts of 2022.

7
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:53,680
A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included in the meeting agenda posted in the City of Medford website.

8
00:00:54,761 --> 00:01:02,466
If, despite our best efforts, we're unable to provide real-time access, we'll post a recording of this meeting on the City's website as soon as possible.

9
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:09,031
A reminder that given the nature of tonight's meeting, tonight all votes from the Board will be made by roll call.

10
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:25,782
Another reminder for everyone that if you're interested in materials that are before the board, best way to find those is to go to the city's website, now new and improved website, clicking on boards and commissions.

11
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:29,583
In fact, the link is even more prominent for Community Development Board.

12
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:35,426
You can click through and see current filings there on our page.

13
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:44,465
So we'll begin with a roll call and a shorter bench for the team tonight, but we'll start with our Vice Chair, Jackie Furtado.

14
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:45,485
Here.

15
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,586
Klyce Andreasen.

16
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:48,646
Here.

17
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,027
Emily Hedeman.

18
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:51,167
Here.

19
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:52,687
George Fisher.

20
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,390
Okay, I see George waving his hand.

21
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,351
He is here, and I'm Dave Bloomberg, and I'm here as well.

22
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,154
First, oh, before we go any further, we do have some city staff in attendance tonight.

23
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:14,536
Amanda, could you introduce for the public our friends from the city?

24
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:15,797
Sure.

25
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:26,826
So myself, Amanda Cinchella, planner out of the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, director of our office, Alicia Hunt, and our senior planner, Danielle Evans are in attendance.

26
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:29,064
Excellent, thank you.

27
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:38,870
We can go to our first item on the agenda for tonight, which is an A&R plan approval not required plan at 15 Hadley Place in Medford.

28
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,973
So Attorney Desmond, I presume, will be presenting for.

29
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:45,714
Yes, yes.

30
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:46,815
Welcome, how are you?

31
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:48,016
Good, how are you?

32
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:52,459
Amanda, do you want me to put the plan up on my screen?

33
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,481
Sure, let me know if you have any trouble.

34
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:57,262
I just gave you co-host permissions.

35
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:09,733
Can everybody see that?

36
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:14,777
Yes.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,384
So, and I'm here on the owner's behalf, Frank Capone, he's the applicant.

38
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:26,907
He owns both parcels, both of the existing parcels.

39
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:30,590
So before you this evening is a plan that essentially

40
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:35,729
seeks to reconfigure the lot lines of two parcels both owned by Mr. Capone.

41
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:43,715
Parcels are situated at the corner of Hadley Place and Franklin Street, and they're both located in the apartment one district.

42
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:51,401
Presently, the property known as 6 Franklin Street which is this parcel here and the old lot lines travel down

43
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:54,495
here.

44
00:03:56,238 --> 00:04:03,527
It contains approximately 10,152 square feet of land and a two family home is situated on that parcel.

45
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:08,194
The parcel is identified as lot 28 on the assessor's map, map 10, M10.

46
00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:21,287
The second property known as 15 Hadley Place contains approximately 9,371 square feet of land on which a single family home sits on the northernmost corner.

47
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:32,157
And that parcel if you look at it under the old lot lines travels here and then this kind of long elongated portion comes out and comes back up to what

48
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:35,080
the lot where the house sits.

49
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,683
There's two parcels on that.

50
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:42,688
They're both identified as lot 27 and lot 39 on the assessor's map.

51
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:50,035
27 is this long parcel and 39 is this parcel up here where the existing dwelling is situated.

52
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:52,077
That contains 9,371 square feet.

53
00:04:54,995 --> 00:05:06,682
What Mr. Capone proposes to do is reduce the area of the Franklin Street parcel to 6,003 square feet, and this would be the contours of the outline of the parcel.

54
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:17,148
That holds to the zoning requirements for two-family dwelling, increases the lot area for Hadley Place to approximately 13,520 square feet for purposes of development.

55
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:28,220
Both properties have sufficient lot area, 6,003 for the single family.

56
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,422
The requirement of frontage is 35 on the Franklin Street parcel.

57
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:37,963
The actual frontage is 75.62 feet.

58
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:45,826
The frontage on lot one, because of the elongated nature of the parcel is 197.59 square feet and the parcel is 13,820.

59
00:05:52,435 --> 00:06:00,638
The proposal is to use the existing dwelling and put an addition on and make it a multifamily unit on that lot one.

60
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,921
So that's essentially what the proposal is.

61
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,762
It meets the frontage and the area requirements.

62
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:14,383
I don't know if the board has any questions.

63
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:24,294
the questions from the board at this point.

64
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:31,558
I guess I'm just wondering why you're using that little sliver that goes all the way down to the corner.

65
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:44,425
Well, it's part of the existing parcel to lot one and it provides some

66
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:58,019
portion of frontage for a multi, um, over what's existing now and the frontage, it wouldn't add anything necessarily to the frontage on, um, on the six Hadley parcel.

67
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:01,982
And it also gives us the square footage.

68
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:04,343
Um, it increases the lot size.

69
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:12,709
So in terms of the multi, um, in, in lot coverage, it gives us some, some additional flexibility.

70
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,450
Is there.

71
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:18,699
Is there anything planned for that?

72
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:37,533
Right now, the design is still in process, but the thought at this point would be to make this existing, put two units and then add three units to what's existing for a five unit building with garages under.

73
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,634
Where would the two units go?

74
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:44,873
The two units would go in what's existing.

75
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:52,157
So this would be two and then there'd be an attachment in addition to this with three additional new construction units.

76
00:07:52,697 --> 00:08:05,864
So they divide the existing dwelling into two units as it exists, not creating a separate building, but creating an addition and then adding three additional units to this existing building.

77
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,805
So five on that top lot.

78
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:09,806
Right.

79
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:14,526
And then another, however many in the lot below?

80
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,289
Well, that's already an existing two family.

81
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,892
So nothing's changing in that.

82
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:22,575
The center lot.

83
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:26,118
This is the old lot line.

84
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,645
So this is one, when combined it will be one lot.

85
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:50,343
So there's only two lots, it's just changing the lot lines from what exists presently, which this building comes down and this is a piece of that lot with the existing single family.

86
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:57,765
Okay, so there won't be anything else built, there'll just be the addition of the three units to the top building.

87
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:01,106
Correct, to make a five unit building.

88
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,733
Seems like there's going to be a lot of land left over then.

89
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:12,454
Not really.

90
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:17,319
And we've kind of been working with that in terms of the design.

91
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:19,461
When you look at what lot coverage is.

92
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:27,949
Also, you know, this is a little tricky in the way the lot is situated to begin with.

93
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,052
There'll certainly be more than there is.

94
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:41,306
you know, for a multi, you may actually have usable open space, which is, you know, something that is always difficult to find.

95
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:45,909
But there should be more green space, definitely.

96
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:56,397
So there's no plan in the future to subdivide it again and then add another building?

97
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:57,378
No.

98
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:09,416
No, it would be the addition, it would be five units on that parcel, keeping this as a two, which is already in existence and occupied.

99
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,308
Clyce, I don't wanna cut you off, but I see Emily's hand is raised.

100
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:28,589
I'm done.

101
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:30,384
Okay.

102
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:37,849
So what I'm hearing is that we originally had two parcels, three parcels?

103
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:42,012
This is a combined parcel by deed.

104
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:46,896
So this is one parcel for purposes of deed on your assessor's map, it's three parcels.

105
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:47,456
Okay.

106
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:52,220
So three parcels, two of which were effectively

107
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:21,876
one because they were combined by deed and we are redoing the lines so that the existing dwelling to the north will have the adequate lot area as well as frontage to accommodate for the for the total of five units right okay so if we were not adding additional units we would not have to

108
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:26,149
I guess we would have to make some change.

109
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,933
I'm kind of in the same area of thought with you.

110
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:48,844
If just roughly, if this was to read as like three, I feel like there could be another dwelling put in kind of right smack where lot one is.

111
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:54,048
But that's not, I think, within our power

112
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:55,094
to do.

113
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:07,745
Well, and this building extends, actually, the building as proposed, which is still in draft stages, which is why, I mean, we're left with 15 feet on this side, roughly.

114
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:09,666
Oh, okay, interesting.

115
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:11,247
15 to 20 feet on the setback.

116
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:19,351
So it's not a situation, it's gonna be a long structure with garages under so that the entrance is at the front onto Hadley.

117
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:23,433
So it's not as if there's gonna be another structure here.

118
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:26,175
The plan is to include three,

119
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:30,028
three townhouse units, style townhouse units.

120
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,009
Okay.

121
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,430
That's helpful to know.

122
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,230
Thank you, Kathleen.

123
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,672
Any other comments from the board?

124
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:45,616
If not, Amanda's city staff or anyone else in attendance tonight?

125
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:49,638
Not that they have to.

126
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:52,320
Just trying to be polite and offer the invite.

127
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,282
Yeah, Alicia, Danielle, do you guys have any comments you want to share?

128
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:10,164
I just feel like we should remind the board that the way A&R law is written, that if they're proposing a legal shifting of the lot lines, we don't actually have any authority to tell them no.

129
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:11,585
It's very weird.

130
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:18,711
And in some cities, the staff approve them administratively because, like,

131
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:21,353
we can't not say yes to this.

132
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:31,217
I know that the one thing that you could look at, the board has once said no to an A&R, but it was around not having access, right?

133
00:13:31,397 --> 00:13:35,939
There was no real frontage access on that one.

134
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:39,481
This one, I know we didn't look at street view, but this is flat.

135
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:44,543
And in fact, that entire frontage right now is paved parking.

136
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:54,272
So there is no real ability to do anything here from the board's position.

137
00:13:55,293 --> 00:14:03,058
I'm curious, Attorney Desmond, is the applicant planning looking to do something as of right?

138
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,820
Or do you think that we would be seeing a future?

139
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,363
I guess actually this board wouldn't, if you're saying five units, it wouldn't even come to CD board.

140
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:15,045
It would only, if it needed relief, go to the CBA.

141
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:26,737
We're probably going to need relief as to depth based on that strange corner in the back that kind of dictates a variance requirement.

142
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:29,538
Mostly I was just curious.

143
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:36,581
I really thought that I had seen a proposal on this property before.

144
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,283
I'm familiar with this property.

145
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:53,973
I think we had a draft before the historical commission laid in the process as to a conceptual, but that's somewhat changed since it was before them.

146
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:58,296
So it's not even been finalized.

147
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:04,041
When it was actually put on the CAD file, it didn't fit within the confines of the parcel.

148
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:06,022
So it kind of had to be pulled back.

149
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,284
So we're still kind of working on the zoning piece of that.

150
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,273
I'm remembering something from a couple of years ago.

151
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,754
I don't know if maybe you weren't involved.

152
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:15,175
No, I wasn't involved.

153
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:15,536
No.

154
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:16,697
Yeah.

155
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:18,438
OK.

156
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:19,399
Thank you.

157
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:32,190
On the call, I don't know if he I was just curious because I definitely remember discussing this property and parking and units and young adults living there.

158
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,891
So, yeah.

159
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,113
Can you hear me?

160
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:38,255
Yes, we can.

161
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,032
Yeah, I sat down with you, Alicia, a couple of years ago, I remember.

162
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:47,053
But the architect, I don't think he did his homework correctly.

163
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:54,096
It was a large structure, but it's totally different now that we redesigned it.

164
00:15:54,216 --> 00:16:03,280
And after speaking to the historical, we changed the whole design to fit the neighborhood and to fit the setbacks, except for that corner.

165
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:05,517
Thank you.

166
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:13,343
I just, I knew I'd seen it and I just don't remember why I was the only one that explains why I'm the only one who remembers seeing it.

167
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:13,863
Thank you.

168
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:17,245
Okay.

169
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:24,771
Any other board comments or if not, we could entertain a motion to endorse this plan as approval not required.

170
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,614
I'll make a motion to endorse.

171
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:31,595
Thank you, Emily.

172
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:32,256
Is there a second?

173
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:35,798
I'll second.

174
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:37,259
Thanks.

175
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:38,840
Okay.

176
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,420
Roll call vote.

177
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,961
Vice chair, Jackie Furtado.

178
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:42,202
Hi.

179
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:45,584
Hi.

180
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,085
Emily.

181
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:48,246
Hi.

182
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:50,007
And George Fisher.

183
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:58,672
I see George's posted a message that he is an eye and I am an eye as well.

184
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,034
Thank you.

185
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:06,987
Before we, sorry David.

186
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:13,533
I was just going to say we usually have minutes on our agenda but we don't have minutes to review tonight which is fine, not a problem.

187
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,877
You want to go to some miscellaneous items Amanda?

188
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:18,642
Yeah.

189
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:26,908
And one quick thing about the A&R is that I have a Mylar sheet that actually does need signatures from you all.

190
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:31,270
So maybe I can coordinate over email and help us to do that.

191
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:37,314
Whether it be, maybe I do like a run around one day or if folks want to stop into the office.

192
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:40,716
Thank you.

193
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:41,257
Cool.

194
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,650
Okay, yeah, so just a couple quick updates.

195
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:53,895
We will have a meeting on the 15th so two weeks from now, and on there, we will cover their BS site plan review for a Dover use.

196
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:58,658
So, tennis courts being proposed by Tufts at one of their fields.

197
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:12,569
Something that I should want to put on everyone's radar so I know I think last meeting we had heard a petition for an accessory dwelling unit for 11 Paul Road.

198
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:22,417
Danielle and I were reviewing the ordinance and realized actually that in terms of procedures that that needed to have been a public hearing.

199
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:22,477
So.

200
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:28,502
We've contacted the applicant and figured out the path forward.

201
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:33,966
We'll be re-advertising, and that'll be on the next meeting.

202
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:39,410
So, you know, re-hearing that item and opening it to the public for comment.

203
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:42,493
And just want to apologize for that mix-up.

204
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:49,018
It wasn't immediately clear in the ordinance, but after some digging, it became so.

205
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:50,819
Okay.

206
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,360
Thank you.

207
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,780
And any other items from the office for us while we're all here?

208
00:18:57,676 --> 00:19:05,039
Yep, so we just received today a planned development district application for 100 Winchester.

209
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:13,061
It's around a proposed project that would be for a multi-unit residential site with some commercial.

210
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:20,204
So we'll communicate with you guys over email in terms of materials and process for that.

211
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:26,906
So just expect to see some information coming from our office on what that'll look like.

212
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:28,583
Okay, great.

213
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:42,889
Yeah, and then last quick thing is just that we did get confirmation today from the mayor on some candidates that we had to put forward for her for one full member position and one associate member position.

214
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:47,591
I haven't actually, it just came in and I haven't actually notified those folks yet.

215
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:51,052
So just wanted to say, you may see some new faces at the next meeting.

216
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:57,886
And Amanda, the full-time is going to be Andrea's successor, is that?

217
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:00,842
Deanna's successor.

218
00:20:00,902 --> 00:20:01,762
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

219
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:02,043
Yes.

220
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:03,503
My apologies.

221
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:04,903
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:09,704
So yeah, I've been in touch with Deanna a bit about that.

223
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:22,207
And so, you know, she will probably be saying her goodbyes, not for any bad reason, just because she's been in holdover status, and has graciously lent us her time.

224
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,908
And then the associate member is a brand new thing into the audience.

225
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:28,608
Yes.

226
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:31,616
All right, very good.

227
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,042
I think that's all we have to do.

228
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:39,679
If you don't mind, I just wanted to just give you guys a heads up too.

229
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,380
This was something that was coming up in the office today.

230
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,041
We were reviewing the requirements for special permits.

231
00:20:47,641 --> 00:21:00,825
And I just thought I'd give you all a heads up that it's always been in the ordinance that if the city council is issuing a special permit, then they need to refer it to the CD board for comment and opinion.

232
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:14,890
And it got written into the new zoning that if a special permit is from the zoning board or the city council, then it needs to come to this board for for review and comment.

233
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,271
So we've just been sort of working through what that would look like.

234
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,172
And we think that it makes sense that it might.

235
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,753
be sent administratively to you.

236
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:33,655
So the filing would be sent as if you guys were a department head to review it as opposed to the applicant to come for another meeting.

237
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:36,736
And it's not a site plan review.

238
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:43,918
It's just like a letter of comment like the board did for the 40B.

239
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:49,420
And the reason I mention it is because we have been operating for the last several months

240
00:21:50,220 --> 00:22:02,445
on the assumption that the marijuana licenses that have to go back to the ZBA for special permit wouldn't would not come to this board unless they were actually triggering site plan review.

241
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:07,808
Because we have a small one going into an existing building there's no external

242
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,569
changes occurring.

243
00:22:10,591 --> 00:22:13,974
It doesn't trigger any of it's under 10,000 square feet.

244
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:17,979
The whole existing building is doesn't trigger site plan review at all.

245
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:21,763
But it looks like it's going to need to come to this board for comments.

246
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:27,349
And I just wanted to give you guys a heads up since in person since so to speak.

247
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,552
since we were on here, since that was not something we've been anticipating.

248
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:42,637
And we're not clear that it makes sense to have that everything that needs a special permit from zoning board should come to this board for comment.

249
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:44,458
And we can take a look at that.

250
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:47,500
I don't know if anybody else remembers that from the zoning.

251
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,902
We didn't, like it didn't jump out at us.

252
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:54,183
We're like, that's a lot of extra review for this board.

253
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:56,925
And we weren't clear that it made sense.

254
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:04,812
So we'll start to notice those, but in the short run, it's in the zoning and it's the law.

255
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,074
So we'll be sending that along.

256
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:11,975
There's a chance that this one might get sent to you in the next three weeks.

257
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:14,096
We're not sure, or next two weeks.

258
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,458
We're not sure we can get, the applicant's gonna get everything in that quickly, but they might.

259
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:25,640
So that's why I'm bringing it up tonight, just because it might happen in the next week.

260
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:31,100
The applicant had their way they would have applied today, but they didn't have all, everything they needed to apply.

261
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,742
Okay, well, thanks for the heads up.

262
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:35,383
Interesting twist there.

263
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:36,384
Yeah.

264
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:38,686
All right.

265
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:42,209
Hearing no other items.

266
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,890
Oh, wait a minute.

267
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,652
Amanda, do we have a hand up?

268
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:46,372
Oh, nope.

269
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:47,613
I was just giving you a thumbs up.

270
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:48,534
Thumbs up.

271
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:49,215
Okay.

272
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:50,796
We appreciate thumbs up.

273
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:54,479
Motion to adjourn could be entertained at this time.

274
00:23:59,005 --> 00:23:59,906
I will make that much.

275
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,227
Oh, guys, thank you.

276
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:02,267
In a second, please.

277
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:03,288
I'll second.

278
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,829
Thank you, Jackie.

279
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,792
Roll call on our motion to adjourn tonight's meeting.

280
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,255
We'll start, as always, with Vice Chair Jackie Furtado.

281
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:13,396
Yes.

282
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:15,938
Clyson Jason.

283
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:18,099
Hi, Emily headman.

284
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,321
Hi, George Fisher.

285
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,662
Oh, there he is.

286
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,805
Thumbs up this time.

287
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:26,307
That's fine.

288
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:28,392
We recognize that as well.

289
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:33,226
And I'm an I. So thank you, everyone.

290
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:34,750
Thank you, staff.

291
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:38,621
And we'll see you on the 15th of February, 2023.
