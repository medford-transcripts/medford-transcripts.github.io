[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

24
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:20,544
[SPEAKER_21]: A few weeks ago, I caught wind by a number of people, Medford residents, talking about a young lady, Elizabeth Lazaro, who has been very successful in her hockey career, academically as well, from what I understand.

25
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:25,707
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I put this on the agenda to give Elizabeth a citation.

26
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:27,809
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to tell you a little bit about Elizabeth,

27
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:33,752
[SPEAKER_21]: She started the Learn to Skate program when she was four through Medford Rec Learn to Skate.

00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:39,057

[SPEAKER_21]: In 2000, it was April, 2018 USA Hockey National Championship weekend, that tournament was in Marlboro, Mass.

33
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:17,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Her team won the division, sorry, her teammates in her place, second in the country.

34
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:25,642
[SPEAKER_21]: And on March 11th, to get to that April tournament, they won the Mass State Hockey Tier Two Championship at the New England Sports Center in Marlboro.

35
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:31,229

39
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:44,795
[SPEAKER_21]: She has two proud parents here in the audience.

40
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:54,960
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just someone who is extremely accomplished in the academics and very close to my heart, girls hockey, which is something that I've

41
00:06:55,935 --> 00:07:00,542
[SPEAKER_21]: definitely worked hard for and this council has worked hard for throughout the years.

42
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:07,311
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to bring her up and read a citation and let the city of Medford give her a round of applause.

43
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,980
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to read the citation.

44
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,142

51
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:00,481

52
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:16,773
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess I just want to thank my parents for always supporting me and my coaches that I've had throughout the years and teachers for making it possible for me to be

[SPEAKER_22]: That's good.

56
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,479
[SPEAKER_21]: She realizes what parents put into it.

57
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:30,200
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm learning that.

58
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,001
[SPEAKER_21]: Spring sports, this, and I'm sure my colleagues, too.

59
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:36,422
[SPEAKER_21]: It takes a lot, and I'm sure they're extremely proud of you.

60
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:13,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's an old man.

61
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,541
Right there, a little closer.

67
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:36,448

68
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:40,229

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:17,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reviewing everything.

76
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:21,436
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like everything's in order, but do you know the hours of operations yet?

77
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:23,438
[SPEAKER_26]: We do, yes.

78
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:24,899
[SPEAKER_26]: Starbucks or for the store in general?

79
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,420
[SPEAKER_08]: The store in general.

80
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,941

[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and I know the

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,351
[SPEAKER_08]: The Starbucks is coming in?

86
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:38,852
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

87
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,734
[SPEAKER_08]: And those hours, will they run concurrent?

88
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:45,698
[SPEAKER_26]: They will close an hour before the store does, but they will open at the same time.

89
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:48,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Mr. President, I find everything in order.

90
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I move forward in favor of this paper.

91
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,264

[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, through the chair.

94
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you explain a little bit, when's the grand opening?

95
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:02,320
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, we open August 14th.

96
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,101
[SPEAKER_26]: We're in the middle of hiring our team members right now.

97
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:14,447
[SPEAKER_26]: We're looking to hire about 91 team members in the area, 80 Target Express team members, eight Starbucks team members, and three Target protection specialists.

98
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:16,128
[SPEAKER_26]: We're well on our way.

00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:18,890

100
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:23,893

00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:31,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

105
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes, congratulations.

106
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:36,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

107
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:42,807
[SPEAKER_13]: 18444 petition to reverse the sign denial by Steve Stabile for Blink Fitness, 465 Salinger Street, Memphis, Mass.

108
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:48,891
[SPEAKER_13]: OCD application 2018 slash 11 exceeds allowable size.

109
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Signed Chairman, Counselor Mox.

110
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:53,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

111
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:57,715
[SPEAKER_17]: I was wondering if we could hear from the petitioner where he's present tonight.

112
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:58,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

113
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:05,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Stephen Stabile, 465 Salem Street, Bedford.

114
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:06,528
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

115
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:09,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, absolutely.

116
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:19,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you looked at the paperwork that I submitted to all council members, you'll see that the facade that we have, it kind of starts as like a bottle and opens up in the back.

117
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:25,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're one of the largest tenants in that strip mall, but unfortunately the smallest facade.

118
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the current bylaws just don't,

119
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:33,004
[SPEAKER_06]: to be successful.

120
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:41,967
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually did receive from the building department to build a parapet, kind of like a mini version of the Target one, like the red box that they have.

121
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:46,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll be building something like that, and I feel like what we submitted

122
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:51,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think if it was any smaller, it might look a little odd.

123
00:13:51,693 --> 00:14:03,443
[SPEAKER_06]: So, because we will be raised above, you know, Rite Aid and here Terrace and the liquor store a little bit, but, you know, we're putting a lot into this plaza.

124
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:07,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to try to draw as much attention as possible to the consumers.

125
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:19,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just like regular channel lettering with LED internally, not offensive, not neon, things like that.

126
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of exactly the way the target sign will be.

127
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:29,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you read the current sign ordinance regarding how long the sign can be left on and so forth?

128
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not read that in detail, no.

129
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:37,137
[SPEAKER_17]: So would you be willing to, now you're going to have a secondary freestanding sign?

130
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: The only secondary sign we have is the pylon sign that's currently there.

131
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:44,359
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be taking the MG Fitness space across the bottom.

132
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:48,003
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, there'll be no other signage.

133
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:50,846
[SPEAKER_17]: So is that going to be the same size as it currently exists?

134
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:51,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

135
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:52,908
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not going to be any larger?

136
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,509
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

137
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

138
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:59,364
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Mr. President, I find no problem with this particular paper.

139
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:07,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish the gentleman that's been a long-standing site for physical fitness in the community, I wish him well, Mr. President.

140
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:20,531
[SPEAKER_17]: I would just ask that he read the entire piece of the ordinance that was created some years ago regarding signage and what the rules and regulations are regarding signage.

141
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:25,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I don't want to belabor the point, but I don't think the sign

142
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:32,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anything extraordinary in that plaza?

143
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:42,321
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems to be fitting for its location and doesn't create any problems for about a second approval.

144
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:43,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor McLachlan.

145
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:50,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Carviello.

146
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:54,266
[SPEAKER_21]: I, too, I agree when you go into the old, it used to be Mike's gym.

147
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:56,958
[SPEAKER_21]: attend that gym.

148
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,139
[SPEAKER_21]: When you go in, it's just very straight and narrow, and then it's like wings out.

149
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Will it be two floors?

150
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,740
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're actually doing a complete renovation.

151
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:11,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're demoing the mezzanine that's currently in there, and we're closing up the basement and using that just for storage.

152
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:17,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be now one level, but instead of having very low ceilings, it'll have like 19 foot ceilings.

153
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:19,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll give it that open look.

154
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:20,223
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, great.

155
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:21,823
[SPEAKER_21]: And all new equipment and everything?

156
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:22,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Everything's brand new.

157
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:22,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, great.

158
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:25,504
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the same question, when will we be opening?

159
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:31,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Grossman, the landlord, is doing a lot of the work, you know, the demo work itself.

160
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:36,848
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're trying to start by, I would think, somewhere in the next couple of weeks to start their demo.

161
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:38,629
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going in and doing some abatement.

162
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,611
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from there, they'll start the demo.

163
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:44,234
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're hoping that they'll finish up around end of July.

164
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:50,178
[SPEAKER_06]: And then our process takes currently from like start to grand opening about 14 weeks.

165
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking somewhere in late October.

166
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:54,301
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

167
00:16:55,982 --> 00:17:01,083
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

168
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:01,783
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

169
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:02,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

170
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:03,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

171
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:04,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

172
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:04,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

173
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:05,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

174
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:09,224
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're talking about signs, I, um, I have something on the agenda this week.

175
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:20,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, 18.452 offered by President Carabello, be it resolved that Memphis City Council address the sign reading Hustle Killer on Main Street, South Medved on as being appropriate for the community.

176
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:25,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the weekend, I, I, I sent out a picture to, uh, all the councilors showing, um,

177
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:32,764
[SPEAKER_13]: a picture right in Tufts Square across from the fire station and the school with the sign calling, it's called Hustle Killer.

178
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:38,907
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, just the word killer on any sign in the city, I think just sends the wrong message.

179
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:48,511
[SPEAKER_13]: I was informed by John Bavuso that the gentleman came in for a sign permit on Monday after he put the sign up already.

180
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:54,413
[SPEAKER_13]: So the sign will be coming down, but going forward with the sign going back up,

181
00:17:56,355 --> 00:18:02,617
[SPEAKER_13]: with that language of hustle killer on it, and say across the street from the park and across the street from the school.

182
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:14,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't think it sends the right message to anybody in the community or this whole country with all the senseless violence that's going on.

183
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:17,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

184
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:22,502
[SPEAKER_13]: From what I understand, they sell urban apparel.

185
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,903
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what they sell in there, but again,

186
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:35,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Having that name out across the street from a school in the park, I just don't think sends the right message to our community.

187
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:42,100
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would hope that when he comes back up for a signed ordinance, that it gets denied.

188
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:47,902
[SPEAKER_13]: And if he wants to put it up, I would hope that they would change the name of the business.

189
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:51,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would hope that everybody would support me on that.

190
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:51,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

191
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:51,744
18, 447.

192
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:16,214

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

199
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:36,038
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

200
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:46,587
[SPEAKER_17]: We typically request that any new appointments come before the council to stand here and let us know the position they've been appointed to.

201
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:47,588
[SPEAKER_17]: These are reappointments.

202
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:48,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, right.

203
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,310
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've done that in the past for reappointments also.

204
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,072
[SPEAKER_17]: It's up to the druthers of this council.

205
00:19:53,407 --> 00:20:02,709
[SPEAKER_17]: I would prefer, Mr. President, because some of them are three, four-year appointments, I would ask that the reappointments also appear before us, Mr. President.

206
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:04,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor DelaRusso.

207
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:07,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I withdraw my motion.

208
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:08,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

209
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:19,111
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Marks that we table this until the two candidates come up here before the council, before they get reappointed.

210
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:21,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

211
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:21,972
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

212
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:22,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

213
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:24,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

214
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:25,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

215
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:29,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you believe we have a meeting on the Community Preservation Act, which would be tomorrow evening?

216
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:30,535
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

217
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:31,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

218
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:38,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we can get the applicants to come, the reappointment candidates to come to that meeting as they're probably going to be there to present anyway.

219
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:43,819
[SPEAKER_17]: If they come tomorrow night, we'll talk to them.

220
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:44,940
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

221
00:20:53,821 --> 00:21:05,146
[SPEAKER_13]: 18448, dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Barney approve the following, the appointment of Alex Gostanian of 20 Bower Street Method as a Commissioner of Trust Funds.

222

00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,229

224
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,410

225
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:18,572
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Alex Gostanian and I live at 20 Bower Street, Council Members.

226
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:20,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

227
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Would anybody have any questions for Alex?

228
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:25,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President?

229
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President?

230
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Carvalho.

231
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for submitting your resume to us.

232
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:37,188
[SPEAKER_21]: And maybe just give us a little background about yourself so the people at home can hear.

233
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:38,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

234
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:43,973
[SPEAKER_04]: For the last 11 years, I've worked in financial services between banking and business valuation.

235
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:49,037
[SPEAKER_04]: During that time, I earned a master's at Suffolk University in finance.

236
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:53,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I worked in business valuation, I specifically focused on that.

237
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:59,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm focused on valuing investment management companies, so I'm well aware of the products that they offer.

238
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:01,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

239
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:02,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Russo.

240
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:13,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if I could, through the chair to Mr. Gustanian, could you tell me the college in New England which has as its motto, Initium Sapientiae Timor Domini?

241
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:14,691
[SPEAKER_04]: St.

242
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:15,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Anselm College.

243
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:15,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

244
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:17,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval, Mr. President.

245
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:23,035
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, a motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Naito.

246
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:23,755
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

247
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:24,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

248
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:25,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations, Alex.

249
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:26,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

250
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:26,156
18, 445.

251
00:22:45,656 --> 00:23:01,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Two, Council President and members of the City Council, from Stephanie and Burt Mayer, acceptance of a grant from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the National Park Service Land and Water Conservation Fund, phase one improvements to Harris Park, and to appropriate the funds necessary for the implementation of the project.

252
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:13,611
[SPEAKER_13]: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the National Park Service have awarded a reimbursement grant of $300,000 in federal land and water conservation funds to the city for improvements to Harris Park to service residents.

253
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:26,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Implementation of the project will cost an estimated $817,000, and this sum must be appropriately allocated to the project prior to the execution of the grant agreements.

254
00:23:27,422 --> 00:23:35,666
[SPEAKER_13]: The council has appropriated $300,000 in CPA funds to the project, leaving a balance of $517,050 to be appropriated prior to the execution of the grant agreement.

255
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:56,630
[SPEAKER_13]: I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body adopt the attempt resolution letter, resolution to finally accept the grant and to appropriate the sum of $570,000 for the implementation of the project.

256
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:06,335
[SPEAKER_13]: The Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund grant will reimburse $300,000 on completion of the project.

257
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:10,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Sincerely, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

258
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:13,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Clara, did you want to speak on this?

259
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

260
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:19,606
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Clara Stoker-Long.

261
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:23,787
[SPEAKER_23]: I am a planner in the Office of Community Development.

262
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:30,908
[SPEAKER_23]: We've been working for some time on a concept plan for Harris Park.

263
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:37,969
[SPEAKER_23]: And last February, February before last, in fact, we submitted a grant to the Land and Water Conservation Fund for $300,000 for that project.

264
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:38,590
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the maximum amount.

265
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,941
[SPEAKER_23]: that you can get from that particular grant round.

266
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:49,024
[SPEAKER_23]: In the meantime, we had anticipated that we would get the grant, but we did not know.

267
00:24:49,044 --> 00:25:06,674
[SPEAKER_23]: We also went to, I applied to the CPA, an early application last, in the winter last year, the CPA recommended allocating $300,000 towards the project, and the council approved that last December.

268
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:08,114
[SPEAKER_23]: Just recently,

269
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:17,071
[SPEAKER_23]: The state has finalized and gotten the authorization to actually offer the Council the grant.

270
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:25,353
[SPEAKER_23]: So now we come before you to ask you to authorize applying for and accepting the grant.

271
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:34,854
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's necessary to have all the funding up front before the grant agreement will be signed by the Commonwealth.

272
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:38,715
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're asking you to also appropriate

273
00:25:39,742 --> 00:25:45,347
[SPEAKER_23]: The balance of funds was just $517,000 up front.

274
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:48,950
[SPEAKER_23]: $300,000 of that amount will be reimbursed on completion of the project.

275
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:53,394
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm available for any questions.

276
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:58,358
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, we did discuss it last week at the Committee of the Whole, but any additional questions, I will do my best to answer.

277
00:25:58,978 --> 00:25:59,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Del Rosso.

278
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:04,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, we had a wonderful presentation.

279
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:25,495
[SPEAKER_14]: from Florida and the representative of the design firm which presented to us a preliminary schema which was required for the application of this grant on making improvements to a park that's part of a vital neighborhood within our community.

280
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:31,921
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an innovative design that follows upon and incorporates many

281
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:40,636
[SPEAKER_14]: new features that one finds in parks in the United States today, which also benefit from federal funding.

282
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:48,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, the features were enumerated for us at the meeting the other night to the council.

283
00:26:48,822 --> 00:27:00,151
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to belabor them, but this is a phase one, if I understood correctly, of the implementation plan that will not take into account any significant

284
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:06,284
[SPEAKER_14]: embellishments to the basketball and tennis courts, nor to the baseball field.

285
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:12,406
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll take into account other areas of the park and also add special features.

286
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,586
[SPEAKER_14]: I approve of this, Mr. President.

287
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:20,708
[SPEAKER_14]: If there is a neighborhood in Medford, and I'm sure my colleague to the right will attest,

288
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:29,871
[SPEAKER_14]: where there's vitality, families who are staying in this community, living in this community, and multi-generational families there.

289
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:33,191
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the neighborhood around Harris Park.

290
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:40,213
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this would be a wonderful addition and improvement to our community, and I move approval.

291
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Neistat.

292
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:43,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

293
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:50,815
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an environmental justice area, so upgrades to our public park in this area I think is going to be valuable to the community.

294
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:52,629
[SPEAKER_18]: I do have a question though.

295
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:59,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Would the acceptance of the grant preclude us from expanding our community guidance program at this public park?

296
00:27:59,774 --> 00:28:00,455
[SPEAKER_23]: No, indeed.

297
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,897
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a community garden as an element of phase one.

298
00:28:03,297 --> 00:28:03,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

299
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:04,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

300
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:09,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Member Kern.

301
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:11,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Carviello.

302
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:17,948
[SPEAKER_21]: I was present last week when we got the presentation, which was very detailed and we got a breakdown

303
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:21,425
[SPEAKER_21]: per our request of the money that will be expended.

304
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:26,366
[SPEAKER_21]: I think this too is a park that needs to be rehabbed.

305
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:35,489
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe that doing the tennis courts and the basketball courts, the tennis and basketball courts have already been done.

306
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:43,871
[SPEAKER_21]: My questions last week were kind of with regards to the financials of this project, the 817,000.

307
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:54,230
[SPEAKER_21]: That coupled with the phase two, just personally, I feel like 1.6 million is a bit excessive.

308
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:56,871
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely we need this.

309
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:58,292
[SPEAKER_21]: It's great that we have grant money.

310
00:28:58,412 --> 00:29:01,313
[SPEAKER_21]: It's great that we were able to use some CPA funds for this.

311
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:14,337
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think looking ahead, we need to be a little bit more conservative considering the maintenance we need at our other parks, the issues we have with our buildings in the city of Medford.

312
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:16,098
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanna make that point because

313
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:20,557
[SPEAKER_21]: My question last week had to do with the design is great.

314
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:22,858
[SPEAKER_21]: They're going to add a couple of handicapped spots.

315
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:24,898
[SPEAKER_21]: There's going to be community gardens.

316
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:29,059
[SPEAKER_21]: There's going to be a very big play structure.

317
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:32,800
[SPEAKER_21]: There's also going to be a water element, which I think people are asking for.

318
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,361
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think this will be very well utilized.

319
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,702
[SPEAKER_21]: Funding for the water and stuff were questions of mine last week.

320
00:29:40,122 --> 00:29:43,303
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there's a whole nother strip of more

321
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:56,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Claudia can explain a little bit more in detail, but another whole strip leading to the parking that has to do with almost like another play structure and a little different feel to it, but another play structure.

322
00:29:56,214 --> 00:30:11,983
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think my question had to do with, is there any way we can reduce it so then if we do go to phase two and redo the ball fields, whether we put soccer fields or another baseball diamond or softball field, whatever the case may be for phase two,

323
00:30:12,715 --> 00:30:20,740
[SPEAKER_21]: that it wouldn't be such a hefty price tag, because you're talking 1.6 million where you've already spent some money on the basketball and the tennis court.

324
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,302
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just had to make that point.

325
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:32,248
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like going forward, definitely to look at the price and being able to maintain all of our ball fields, all of our playgrounds.

326
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:37,852
[SPEAKER_21]: I have this moving forward while I'm getting complaints about other parks having graffiti and

327
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:43,083
[SPEAKER_21]: wood chips never being replaced, different things that come before us all the time.

328
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:49,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Just wanna be able to rehab our parks in an efficient manner while we still have the ability to maintain them all.

329
00:30:49,964 --> 00:30:54,505
[SPEAKER_21]: And this grant was submitted, so my question, can we scale back a little bit?

330
00:30:55,466 --> 00:31:02,507
[SPEAKER_21]: The answer is no, because this plan was submitted and is based on the grant, the $300,000 grant.

331
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,668
[SPEAKER_21]: So I am in support of this tonight.

332
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:06,168
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think moving forward,

333
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:14,568
[SPEAKER_21]: With phase two, another 800 plus thousand dollars, I think we just need to, we'll personally just scale it back a bit.

334
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:19,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Do it right, be able to maintain it, but just scale it back somewhat.

335
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:21,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

336
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:21,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor Marks.

337
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:24,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

338
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:30,923
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I want to speak from a firsthand knowledge that, uh, this happens to be a local park near my home.

339
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:37,270
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've spent countless hours in the play structure and the basketball court and you name it.

340
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:44,492
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can tell you, I can't think of one other park in the community that's utilized to the fashion that this particular park is.

341
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:49,594
[SPEAKER_17]: It's such a fashion that the neighbors take care of the park.

342
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:53,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a little dome there where you can sit down.

343
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:58,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Neighbors actually bring their supper out there and will eat within the park with their families.

344
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,797
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a real unique setting.

345
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:03,993
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe this particular work is long overdue.

346
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:12,328
[SPEAKER_17]: And the question I do have, Mr. President, is recently we created the Crystal Campbell Memorial Garden, which is a park area.

347
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:26,103
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in the process right now of turning the Riverside Ave, which used to be a bus shelter, into park land and a new addition to the parks department.

348
00:32:26,763 --> 00:32:35,388
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to be spending multi-millions of dollars refurbishing our parks, but yet our park department hasn't grown at all, the staffing.

349
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:41,332
[SPEAKER_17]: And in my opinion, you can't expand and create, especially parks that are going

350
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:52,941
[SPEAKER_17]: a water addition, and similar to the Crystal Campbell PAC, that are going to require significant upkeep and not expand the staffing and the maintenance on these PACs.

351
00:32:53,441 --> 00:33:09,927
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would ask that during budget deliberation that the administration include ample amount of money to sufficiently increase the DPW staff, in particular, I know we need it in the highway, we need it in forestry, but in particular in the PACs.

352
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:23,841
[SPEAKER_17]: As we all hear, we get the complaints when the baseball fields aren't lined properly in time, the grass is not cut, and it's not because they're not doing the job, it's because they're at bare bones capacity, which many of our departments are in the city.

353
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:39,430
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would just ask that with the addition of these parks, we want to make sure in five years from now that the water facility at Harris Park, which is going to be a great addition, and I'd like to see more throughout the community, is still working after five years and properly maintained.

354
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:45,320
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Councilor Longo-Curran mentioned, that when needs come up, that they're addressed immediately.

355
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,402
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can't do that with a skeleton crew.

356
00:33:47,822 --> 00:34:05,533
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be my one recommendation I make on this, Mr. President, that the city administration come back to this council during the budget with an appropriation to increase the staffing at DPW, in particular, in the parks department.

357
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:06,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Nice.

358
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:09,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I support the paper wholeheartedly as amended and move approval.

359
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:13,779
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by?

360
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:14,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

361
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Mox.

362
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:19,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

363
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:22,826
[SPEAKER_13]: For the paper to take the first read.

364

365
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:28,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

366
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco?

367
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:29,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

368
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:30,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Layton?

369
00:34:31,132 --> 00:34:31,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

370
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:32,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor McKernan?

371
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:32,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

372
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:33,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Mox?

373
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:34,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

374
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:35,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scott Pelli?

375
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:36,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

376
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Caprio?

377
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:37,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

378
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:38,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative.

379
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,399
[SPEAKER_13]: None of the negative paper takes its first reading.

380
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

381
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,302
[SPEAKER_13]: 18449, from Mayor Stephanie Burke.

382
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:52,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I read amendment to the revised ordinance of the city of Medford establishing a revolving fund account in the city of Medford.

383
00:34:53,346 --> 00:35:06,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Mr. President and members of the city council, I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body approve an amendment to the revised ordinances of the city of Medford establishing a new ordinance pertaining to revolving funds.

384
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:16,412
[SPEAKER_13]: General law chapter 44, section 53E and a half permits the city to establish a revolving fund ordinance.

385
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:25,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Any such ordinance must specify for each fund, one, the programs or activities for which the revolving fund may be expended.

386
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:33,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Two, the departmental receipts in connection with those programs or activities that shall be credited to the revolving fund.

387
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:37,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Three, the board, department, or officer authorized to expend

388
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:44,517
[SPEAKER_13]: from such fund ends for any reporting or other requirements the city or town may impose.

389
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:54,363
[SPEAKER_13]: The attached is the full text of the proposed amendment creating a revolving fund ordinance in the text of the provisions of the statute.

390
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:58,485
[SPEAKER_13]: The Director of Finance and Auditing will be at attendance to answer any questions.

391
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:01,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

392
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:02,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

393
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:05,489
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening, Honorable Counselors Leish and Unley Benjamin, Finance Director.

394
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:15,962
[SPEAKER_25]: Through the Governor's Municipal Minority Organization Act, the departmental revolving funds now have to be in an ordinance or by-law.

395
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:23,984
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Bailão.

396
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:24,765
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

397
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:27,126
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

398
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:29,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

399
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:30,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

400
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:30,607
[SPEAKER_13]: 18-450.

401
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:52,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear President Caravaglia and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following home rule petition to be sent to the general court regarding the use of specific language on its municipal property tax bills or on inserts that will accompany municipal property tax bills in the city of Medford.

402
00:36:54,176 --> 00:36:56,818
[SPEAKER_13]: A draft format is attached to this paper.

403
00:36:57,138 --> 00:37:00,000
[SPEAKER_13]: The purpose of this effort is to provide taxpayers

404
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:11,052
[SPEAKER_13]: with a method to make voluntary contributions to assist in the construction or renovation of the buildings that serve our police, fire, and library departments.

405
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:17,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

406
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:21,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, in our packet this evening, we do have some papers from the mayor.

407
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:28,258
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we look at these papers from the mayor, we'll see that the council had voted to create a fire station donation account.

408
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:32,194
[SPEAKER_18]: The council had voted to create a police and fire donation account.

409
00:37:32,254 --> 00:37:37,638
[SPEAKER_18]: The council had voted to complete a police, fire, and library donation account, Mr. President.

410
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:44,383
[SPEAKER_18]: The administration has supported this measure that the council has brought forward, and this is what it takes to execute such.

411
00:37:44,623 --> 00:37:47,426
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would move for approval of the paper, Mr. President.

412
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:53,650
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

413
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:54,931
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

414
00:37:55,511 --> 00:37:56,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lococo.

415
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:57,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

416
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,052
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess a question for the administration.

417
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:13,556
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we voted to create an account for the fire department rebuild and the library rebuild, but we didn't create an account for the police station rebuild.

418
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:22,219
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know in this homeroom petition, we're asking that on the tax bills or on inserts that will accompany the tax bills.

419
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:33,482
[SPEAKER_21]: It will provide taxpayers with a method to make voluntary contributions or donations to assist in the construction or renovation of the buildings that serve the Medford Police, Fire, or Library.

420
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,864
[SPEAKER_21]: So will we be setting up a third account for the police station?

421
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:41,907
[SPEAKER_11]: The police station is one of the three boxes that would be on the insert.

422
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:49,112
[SPEAKER_11]: What you have before you is the home of Mark Rumley, City Solicitor, 50 Woodrow Avenue, Medford.

423
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:51,337
[SPEAKER_11]: What you have before you is the home rule petition.

424
00:38:51,357 --> 00:39:06,527
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an attachment with that also, which showed what would be an insert, which had three boxes on it, which are the three boxes that came up during the three subjects that came up during the committee meetings, police, fire, library, for people that might want to make a voluntary contribution.

425
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:14,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And the law is you can't include some data with the tax bill unless you have specific authority.

426
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:16,994
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the necessity of the home rule petition.

427
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:28,844
[SPEAKER_11]: If this goes forward concurrently, that form that you got in the packet would have to go to the Department of Revenue for their approval, because nothing can go in the tax bill without it.

428
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:29,905
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

429
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:31,166
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I understand that.

430
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:39,313
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm talking about if this gets approved by the State House, where would we put the collections for the police station?

431
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:40,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Which account would we put it in?

432
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:41,736
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have a separate account yet.

433
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,338
[SPEAKER_21]: We voted to... Sure.

434
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:51,340
[SPEAKER_21]: approve an account for the fire station and the library, but we haven't voted to approve a separate account for the police station.

435
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,480
[SPEAKER_19]: That's correct, counselor.

436
00:39:52,540 --> 00:40:06,104
[SPEAKER_19]: And the last time I was here, we did, you did approve donations for fire and library and requested that we look into doing the police as well, which we should have a paper coming before you shortly to allow for that.

437
00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:07,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

438
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Vote timeframe for this to potentially, if it does get passed, do we have?

439
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:14,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Passed at the state house?

440
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:14,647
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

441
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:16,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have like a timeline?

442
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

443
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:27,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the chair, I think the councilor knows through experience that it's always a matter of speculation on when things come back from the state house.

444
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,480
[SPEAKER_11]: They're in the, I'm sure the stages of going through their budget.

445
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:36,164
[SPEAKER_11]: So no one can really predict when it would be approved.

446
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:41,188
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been through home rule petitions of all sorts, as you have too, comes back at various times.

447
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:46,303
[SPEAKER_11]: If I was a gambling man, I don't think I'd want to bet on anything earlier than the fall.

448
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:48,243
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

449
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:48,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

450
00:40:52,804 --> 00:40:58,546
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

451
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:03,787

[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

453
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:05,621

00:41:08,323 --> 00:41:09,203

00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:09,463

[SPEAKER_13]: President Camillo.

464
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:14,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

465
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:18,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

466
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

467
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:22,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

468
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:24,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion.

469
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:31,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Dela Ruzzo, seconded by Councilor Night.

470
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:33,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Routine.

471
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:37,481
[SPEAKER_13]: 4-5-1 offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

472
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:49,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be provided with any and all information in regards to the rental of Duggar Park in Tufts Park to Lesley University.

473
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:50,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

474
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:52,536
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Carviello.

475
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:57,241
[SPEAKER_21]: I put this on after I heard recently within the last week or two that

476
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:00,767
[SPEAKER_21]: There are some talks with Lesley University.

477
00:42:00,787 --> 00:42:14,496
[SPEAKER_21]: I first learned of this with regards to the Medford Public Schools working out agreements with Lesley University to use the basketball, potentially to use the basketball courts up at the high school.

478
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:27,885
[SPEAKER_21]: I did catch wind that there's also potential for an agreement between the city and Duggar Park, as well as the city and Tufts Park, and really it's just been

479
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:33,668
[SPEAKER_21]: a few people that have come and asked me questions and I don't know anything about it.

480
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:36,590
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know the school issue has moved forward.

481
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:44,374
[SPEAKER_21]: If you watched Monday night's meeting, they're moving forward on, you know, going out for a request for a proposal, I believe on the high school portion.

482
00:42:44,955 --> 00:42:58,263
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just feel like as the city council who answers to the residents, maybe we should get some sort of update from the administration on what is going on, who is, what type of term, what are the terms to these potential agreements?

483
00:42:58,737 --> 00:42:59,798
[SPEAKER_21]: How are we going to handle it?

484
00:42:59,858 --> 00:43:01,059
[SPEAKER_21]: What's the timeframe?

485
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:07,083
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe Leslie's doing a lot of work, wants to do some work at each particular area.

486
00:43:07,203 --> 00:43:08,844
[SPEAKER_21]: What does that entail?

487
00:43:09,184 --> 00:43:10,645
[SPEAKER_21]: How will the council be involved?

488
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:15,689
[SPEAKER_21]: These are just all questions that have run through my head over the last couple of weeks, and I think it's extremely important.

489
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:23,855
[SPEAKER_21]: We've learned that we're not always included in informative discussions, but I think this is something that potentially

490
00:43:24,383 --> 00:43:31,927
[SPEAKER_21]: depending on the terms, I definitely want to be able to review and look over and give my opinions, my concerns, ask questions.

491
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:39,170
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's very important that the city of Medford, our residents are informed on this.

492
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:53,117
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that parents are asking questions about what's going on with the high school and I just want to make sure the areas around Duggar Park and Tufts Park and the city as a whole has the time to digest this and ask questions and that we're transparent all around.

493
00:43:53,691 --> 00:44:10,245
[SPEAKER_21]: So I ask that we get a written summary of just any type of update with regards to these two locations and anything that is being talked about so that we can have an idea of what's going on, timeframe, so that we can do our job.

494
00:44:11,046 --> 00:44:11,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

495
00:44:12,207 --> 00:44:22,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request also that a copy of the RFP that was approved by the school committee, once it is issued, be forwarded forthwith to the council for review as well.

496
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:31,599
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Council Member Kern as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

497
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,319
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

498
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:32,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

499
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

500
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:43,545
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Marks to take suspension to take paper 18-296 and report that out.

501
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:44,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

502
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:54,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

503
00:44:54,729 --> 00:45:07,120
[SPEAKER_17]: We met tonight as a council, Committee of the Whole meeting for an issue that was tabled or referred to the Committee of the Whole on March 20th, 2018.

504
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:14,966
[SPEAKER_17]: This paper was an appropriation of $1 million to fund a demolition and other costs for construction of the police station.

505
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:19,490
[SPEAKER_17]: We had several discussions regarding

506
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:32,025
[SPEAKER_17]: some issues with tearing down the current training tower and police facility in order to make way for new headquarters.

507
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:39,369
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would ask that that committee recommendation be brought forward this evening, Mr. President.

508
00:45:43,693 --> 00:46:06,062
[SPEAKER_13]: the motion by Councilor Marks to adopt the committee report of this evening, which was 5-2 in favor of appropriating the money for the demolition of the police station.

509
00:46:08,663 --> 00:46:09,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

510
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:16,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Eddie Buckley, President of Local 1032-340 Salem Street Method.

511
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:18,650
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I want to apologize for my appearance.

512
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually working today, and I came from work, and I'm going back to work after this.

513
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:28,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, I want to apologize because I might sound a little frustrated, but it's for good cause.

514
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:34,355
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people are telling me not to take this personal, but it really doesn't get any more personal for me.

515
00:46:36,863 --> 00:46:44,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I was elected to lead my brothers and sisters, and I feel like I'm not doing my job now.

516
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:50,912
[SPEAKER_09]: By the vote that I saw tonight that took place in the Committee of the Whole meeting, it really shocked me.

517
00:46:52,794 --> 00:47:01,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that the councilors, Councilor Scott Pelley, Councilor Knight, and Councilor Falco, who made the resolution to withhold the million dollars until they had answers,

518
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:13,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was a great idea and good movement for us, and we can pitch our case on why we need a combined station, or why we need at least a plan for a tower and a headquarters.

519
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:22,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys tell me, any of those councils, can you tell me what answers you have so far that made you change your vote to release that money, please?

520
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:25,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

521
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, the trade that the council passed was to

522
00:47:29,617 --> 00:47:37,182
[SPEAKER_18]: put a hold on the appropriation of the funds for 45 days so that the council could further investigate financial opportunities to keep this proposal on track.

523
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:41,985
[SPEAKER_18]: What we've been able to find out is that it's really a $1.1 million problem for EM, Mr. President.

524
00:47:42,345 --> 00:47:48,629
[SPEAKER_18]: We have three years of debt exclusion, I mean, three years of debt and debt service that needs to be paid.

525
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:53,431
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we can find $1.1 million annually, we can keep this project on track.

526
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:57,594
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been a lot of discussion about other outside-of-the-box ideas that we can pursue.

527
00:47:58,015 --> 00:47:59,556
[SPEAKER_18]: in order to keep this project on track.

528
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:03,319
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the goal of this council, that's the goal of this councilor anyway, I wanna speak for myself.

529
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:10,384
[SPEAKER_18]: But my goal and my commitment is to keep this on track and to be sure that we have a new police and a new fire station.

530
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:17,049
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we're not moving forward on anything, then we're never gonna get either one of those things, Mr. President.

531
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:26,496
[SPEAKER_18]: So what made me move forward on this paper was the stark reality that a financial situation in the community right now doesn't allow for us to maintain

532
00:48:27,495 --> 00:48:33,880
[SPEAKER_18]: based on the use of tax dollars through taxation in our operating budget to keep this project on track.

533
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,063
[SPEAKER_18]: So now we need to come up with some outside-of-the-box ideas to do that.

534
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:40,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Counselor Scott Pelley's come forward with a great idea concerning debt exclusion.

535
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:50,193
[SPEAKER_18]: I've requested a report from the administration for the disposal of surplus properties to other individuals in the community to put them back on the tax rolls.

536
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:55,598
[SPEAKER_18]: And I am committed to continue to meet until we can come up with a way to

537
00:48:56,071 --> 00:48:58,713
[SPEAKER_18]: properly fund this project so that it stays on track, Mr. President.

538
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:05,359
[SPEAKER_18]: So the reason that I have moved forward and said that it's appropriate for us to go forward with the police station is because the 45-day review was concluded.

539
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,221
[SPEAKER_18]: We've examined options.

540
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:07,941
[SPEAKER_18]: We have options.

541
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:10,503
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm looking forward to pursuing those.

542
00:49:11,484 --> 00:49:18,090
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we have the training tower that we need to focus on, but we also have the big three buildings that we want to get built, the library, the police station, and the fire station.

543
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Keeping those on track is my priority, Mr. President.

544
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:23,975
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we don't move forward and we remain stagnant in one area, then we're never going to move forward

545
00:49:25,177 --> 00:49:26,818
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can certainly understand the frustration.

546
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,479
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I consider Mr. Buckley a friend.

547
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:41,944
[SPEAKER_18]: And although, you know, maybe this issue right here is taking a personal turn, you know, I can certainly say that at the end of the day, I will be committed to continuing to work towards the ultimate goal of keeping this project on track.

548
00:49:42,644 --> 00:49:44,005
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have to be happy with my vote.

549
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:44,745
[SPEAKER_18]: I already know you're not.

550
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:47,086
[SPEAKER_18]: But with that being said, that's where I'm coming from.

551
00:49:47,106 --> 00:49:51,628
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why I'm casting a vote this evening in favor of demolition of the training tower in the police academy building.

552
00:49:52,465 --> 00:50:00,009
[SPEAKER_18]: so that we can move forward and allow the police station to be built based upon the plans that have been put forth and the $2 million that this council's already appropriated.

553
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:04,752
[SPEAKER_18]: When we look at the plans and the design of the police station, we've seen that the police have made concessions.

554
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:14,517
[SPEAKER_18]: They've eliminated their gun range as part of the plan so that they can move forward on this project, and I think right now we're at a point in time where we've remained very stagnant with some of our buildings in the community.

555
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:19,620
[SPEAKER_18]: We've ignored these buildings in our community, and we are not gonna be able to get out of this issue and out of this problem

556
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:25,881
[SPEAKER_18]: by using our operating funds from our day-to-day operational budget to continue to fix these buildings.

557
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:33,524
[SPEAKER_18]: We're putting good money after bad money when it comes down to it, so we need to take a long, hard look at what we can do to reconstruct both of these facilities for our public safety personnel.

558
00:50:33,884 --> 00:50:36,505
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm committed to doing that, and I'm committed to keeping this on track, Mr. President.

559
00:50:38,386 --> 00:50:42,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, Counselor, we've learned in the last few months or the last year

560
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,211
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't mean anything to this union.

561
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:49,872
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a commitment last year that's gone.

562
00:50:51,772 --> 00:50:54,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand how you guys can't look and see the high school coming.

563
00:50:55,373 --> 00:50:56,114
[SPEAKER_09]: The high school's coming.

564
00:50:56,814 --> 00:50:59,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And the same thing's going to happen that's happening with the library.

565
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,675
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be pushed aside again.

566
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:06,417
[SPEAKER_09]: And even though it looks like I'm turning purple right now, I'm going to go home tomorrow when I get out of work.

567
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,577
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to be able to go to bed at night.

568
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:16,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I'm fighting my hardest and putting all my energy into my fighting for my brothers and sisters.

569
00:51:17,399 --> 00:51:19,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how some of you councils are going to be able to sleep.

570
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:23,983
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not getting a fire headquarters.

571
00:51:24,183 --> 00:51:25,744
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not getting a training tower.

572
00:51:26,405 --> 00:51:30,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I read in the paper that I've had discussions with the mayor about a regional training tower.

573
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a five minute phone call conversation with the mayor.

574
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:35,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Next thing I know it's in the papers.

575
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:43,542
[SPEAKER_09]: If the paper called me, I would have said, I had one conversation with the mayor and said, Hey, I talked to a guy from Somerville and he think this is a good idea.

576
00:51:44,523 --> 00:51:48,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think 24% raise is a good idea for the fire department.

577
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:50,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you put that in the paper tomorrow?

578
00:51:50,948 --> 00:51:53,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone can know that we're getting a 24% raise next year.

579
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:56,132
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not how things work.

580
00:51:56,152 --> 00:51:59,094
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a one conversation that we had and all of a sudden we're getting a training towel.

581
00:51:59,354 --> 00:52:00,455
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not getting a training towel.

582
00:52:01,616 --> 00:52:02,737
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have landed method.

583
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,442
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't get land from the city.

584
00:52:04,662 --> 00:52:05,823
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't get land from the state.

585
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:09,085
[SPEAKER_09]: The state's already tried to give us the land, and that hasn't happened.

586
00:52:12,787 --> 00:52:24,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to tell you how disappointed I am in the councils that voted to go forward without answers to our future, I should say, and to lack the foresight to see the high school coming.

587
00:52:24,335 --> 00:52:27,497
[SPEAKER_09]: The high school's coming, and we're going to get pushed aside again.

588
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:33,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

589
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:37,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Michael Larkovich, 7 Laguna, vice president of local 1032, my firefighters union.

590
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,043
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, I don't see what came of this resolution to hold them at 45 days.

591
00:52:43,103 --> 00:52:45,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing was figured out in that time frame.

592
00:52:45,925 --> 00:52:49,168
[SPEAKER_20]: None of those answers, no answers were given.

593
00:52:49,448 --> 00:53:01,377
[SPEAKER_20]: And as President Buckley said, that there's been no movement going forward in terms of coming up with a resolution to addressing this issue, moving forward with a joint station,

594
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:08,935
[SPEAKER_20]: all these councilors spoke highly of when we initially spoke about this 45-day halt to the training tower.

595
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:11,036
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's frustrating.

596
00:53:11,136 --> 00:53:20,500
[SPEAKER_20]: It's extremely frustrating, because we watched you guys make a mistake last year, made a huge mistake by voting to not go ahead with a combined station.

597
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:27,944
[SPEAKER_20]: And the opportunity to rectify that mistake arose, and then now it's passing.

598
00:53:28,564 --> 00:53:30,285
[SPEAKER_20]: And you're going to continue to make that mistake.

599
00:53:31,322 --> 00:53:33,404
[SPEAKER_20]: It's our tax dollars, those of us that live in the city.

600
00:53:33,804 --> 00:53:43,672
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's also, as President Buckley said, it's our lives and our futures because we're living in a substandard building that is a health hazard to all of us.

601
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:49,817
[SPEAKER_20]: So to go forward with this and to vote to tear down the train tower is going to create three things.

602
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:55,722
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to be building a substandard police station that's going to be obsolete before the police even move in.

603
00:53:56,383 --> 00:53:59,225
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not going to see a fire station because, again, as President Buckley said,

604
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,903
[SPEAKER_20]: The high school is going to come online, and we're going to get pushed down the road further.

605
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:25,690
[SPEAKER_20]: And third of all, the taxpayers of this city, the homeowners of this city, the property owners of this city are all going to see an increase on their insurance rates, because our ISO rating will most probably increase, meaning that regardless of your age, your financial standings, how well your business is doing, how poor your business is doing, you're going to see an increase on your

606
00:54:27,378 --> 00:54:30,740
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, increase on your charge rates.

607
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,380
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

608
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:36,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

609
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:37,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

610
00:54:37,183 --> 00:54:38,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, councils.

611
00:54:38,343 --> 00:54:39,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert M. Jones, 5 St.

612
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:40,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary Street.

613
00:54:42,205 --> 00:54:45,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I share the feelings of my brothers and sisters on the fire department.

614
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:47,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd just like to give you a little history lesson.

615
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:52,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Back when this discussion first started, a combined station was recommended.

616
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:55,532
[SPEAKER_07]: All of a sudden, that plan was scrapped.

617
00:54:56,923 --> 00:55:09,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Fast forward a little bit, we have a plan for a police station, no fire station, zero input from the fire department, zero input from this legislative body.

618
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:15,233
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't want to hold up the police station one year ago, which apparently is a mistake on our part.

619
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,295
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't want to stand in the way.

620
00:55:17,435 --> 00:55:19,736
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanted the police to get the building that they deserve.

621
00:55:20,436 --> 00:55:21,397
[SPEAKER_07]: They need a new building.

622
00:55:21,957 --> 00:55:26,918
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I hope everybody understands that the police station and the fire station are the same exact building.

623
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:35,401
[SPEAKER_07]: All the problems that are in the police station, which are valid concerns, valid problems, are also in the fire station.

624
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:38,222
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a shared utility, shared everything.

625
00:55:41,903 --> 00:55:42,543
[SPEAKER_07]: At that point,

626
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:49,703
[SPEAKER_07]: We went with the commitment from the mayor, and again, our mistake.

627
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:56,586
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, we have zero commitment from the mayor for a fire station, for a training tower.

628
00:55:58,446 --> 00:56:05,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Make no mistake, once that training tower comes down, so comes down for a fire station.

629
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,230
[SPEAKER_07]: If we do not get a combined station, we will get nothing.

630
00:56:11,211 --> 00:56:14,492
[SPEAKER_07]: As previously stated, if the high school is gonna come online,

631
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:18,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will take up the lion's share of all the funding that's required.

632
00:56:20,759 --> 00:56:28,064
[SPEAKER_07]: What you're doing, I'm sorry, what you're not doing, what the mayor is doing is taking away our ability to train.

633
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:30,085
[SPEAKER_07]: The police station is scaled down.

634
00:56:30,105 --> 00:56:32,426
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard the police chief at the past meeting.

635
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:35,308
[SPEAKER_07]: He wanted a range, he wanted some other things.

636
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Those requests were denied.

637
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:41,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, the police will not have their training ability.

638
00:56:43,228 --> 00:56:46,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Once our training tower comes down, we won't have ability to train either.

639
00:56:46,929 --> 00:56:51,571
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of new buildings going on being constructed in the city of Medford.

640
00:56:52,231 --> 00:56:52,991
[SPEAKER_07]: They're new buildings.

641
00:56:53,031 --> 00:56:53,991
[SPEAKER_07]: They're newer type buildings.

642
00:56:54,031 --> 00:56:57,672
[SPEAKER_07]: They utilize a standpipe for fire suppression.

643
00:56:58,393 --> 00:57:00,153
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a standpipe system in the tower.

644
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:01,634
[SPEAKER_07]: We can train on that.

645
00:57:01,774 --> 00:57:02,694
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to train on that.

646
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:06,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Building construction and fire service needs to advance together.

647
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,756
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to adapt to what buildings are out there.

648
00:57:09,316 --> 00:57:10,396
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to be able to do that.

649
00:57:11,116 --> 00:57:12,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't go into a station landing

650
00:57:13,526 --> 00:57:15,306
[SPEAKER_07]: and doing evolution on standpipes.

651
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:18,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Training tower comes down, we lose that ability.

652
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:23,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess good luck to us because we're going to have to go there cold.

653
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:26,109
[SPEAKER_07]: No practice.

654
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,250
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about the radio system.

655
00:57:32,691 --> 00:57:34,171
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a radio system that has

656
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:37,233
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of shortcomings.

657
00:57:37,633 --> 00:57:40,334
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a combined radio system with the police and the fire.

658
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:46,256
[SPEAKER_07]: When we have two new stations, we're gonna have two radio systems, which are gonna have to be brand new.

659
00:57:46,356 --> 00:57:51,058
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all kinds of rewiring, other infrastructure that has to go forward.

660
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:56,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So my hopes for that are very dire.

661
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:04,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So in closing, the more things change, the more they stay the same in the city of Medford.

662
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

663
00:58:07,948 --> 00:58:09,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

664
00:58:09,328 --> 00:58:11,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Jimmy Flynn, 17, Doan Road.

665
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:16,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Counsel, I'm just at a loss of words here.

666
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that we were gonna make an educated decision here.

667
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:23,792
[SPEAKER_03]: We're no more educated this evening than we were 45 days ago.

668
00:58:24,372 --> 00:58:33,655
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got no more information, maybe some lies, maybe a couple of one-minute phone conversations were translated into hopes and dreams.

669
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:37,192
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the council, you know, their commitment?

670
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:41,634
[SPEAKER_03]: What about when you guys were going to host this committee, the whole, and it was going to base out of here and you guys are going to come toward the stations?

671
00:58:42,575 --> 00:58:43,135
[SPEAKER_03]: What about that?

672
00:58:44,436 --> 00:58:45,636
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with the training tower?

673
00:58:46,377 --> 00:58:46,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything?

674
00:58:47,978 --> 00:58:48,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

675
00:58:48,498 --> 00:58:50,299
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to tear down a perfectly good building.

676
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

677
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the mayor said so?

678
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:57,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the mayor's worried about displacing the police department during the time of construction?

679
00:58:58,103 --> 00:58:59,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what it boils down to here.

680
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,325
[SPEAKER_03]: This council is sitting behind this rail.

681
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:11,088
[SPEAKER_03]: that voted not so long ago to fund brand new HVAC system for that building, yet this evening they sit here and they ask for that building to be torn down.

682
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:13,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Very ironic.

683
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,932
[SPEAKER_03]: We spend frivolously behind this rail, it seems, at times.

684
00:59:17,993 --> 00:59:29,521
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to tear down a building we just put new HVAC in, a building there's nothing wrong with, a building that we've gathered costs of, what, $3.5 million in replacement, and we don't even have the land to build it on now.

685
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,532
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that we're thinking about moving forward on this tonight is embarrassing.

686
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:42,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost as embarrassing as the fact that the other day the doorbell rang at the fire station and woman handed me a $25 check for a donation.

687
00:59:45,357 --> 00:59:47,538
[SPEAKER_03]: When that bell hits, we go out and we serve the community.

688
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,099
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't look for donations.

689
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:56,783
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in a really tough time in this community and tough times call for tough decisions to be made.

690
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:05,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't always mean you side with the popular decision because, hey, you know, we've got to rub a stamp through the 45 days.

691
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,806
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you're sitting here and on behalf of my brothers and blue, my brothers and sisters in blue, you're siding with the fellow.

692
01:00:12,826 --> 01:00:14,147
[SPEAKER_03]: They made some concessions, you know.

693
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:16,909
[SPEAKER_03]: They're conceding on a gun range.

694
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Open your eyes, folks.

695
01:00:20,212 --> 01:00:20,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch the news.

696
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:24,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Yarmouth police officer killed a couple weeks ago.

697
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:27,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to take away an element of training

698
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad enough you're doing it to us, but you want to do it to the boys in blue?

699
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:33,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

700
01:00:34,395 --> 01:00:37,017
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very, very rash decision.

701
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,079
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing wrong with that building.

702
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Towns and cities from all over come to train at that building.

703
01:00:45,563 --> 01:00:48,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the only cistern where you can test the pump at draft.

704
01:00:49,506 --> 01:00:51,968
[SPEAKER_03]: As my colleague said, it has a standpipe system.

705
01:00:52,008 --> 01:00:52,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a roof scuttle.

706
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It has almost every obstacle that we need to be thrown at.

707
01:00:58,399 --> 01:01:00,640
[SPEAKER_03]: The council, you heard it recently.

708
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're going to get some more money because there's more development coming up on Middlesex Ave.

709
01:01:05,222 --> 01:01:08,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about Brainerd Ave or the stuff coming up on Cabot Road.

710
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:11,645
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that stuff is high-rise technology.

711
01:01:12,206 --> 01:01:14,487
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't just drag hoses through brand new high-rises.

712
01:01:14,947 --> 01:01:16,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Developers don't go for that.

713
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:19,249
[SPEAKER_03]: We need this building to stay.

714
01:01:19,749 --> 01:01:21,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm asking you this evening to do the right thing.

715
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:23,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

716
01:01:26,332 --> 01:01:26,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

717
01:01:26,692 --> 01:01:27,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

718
01:01:28,547 --> 01:01:29,488
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

719
01:01:29,528 --> 01:01:30,749
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at 281 Park Street.

720
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:38,896
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a school-age daughter who has a lot of friends, and I see all the ZBA meetings and a lot of new projects coming through.

721
01:01:38,976 --> 01:01:49,905
[SPEAKER_24]: The Locust Street is going to have a school bus stop on it with 350 units, so we're going to have families and children living in these buildings, and we're going to have families living in the buildings on Middle 6 Ave.

722
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,507
[SPEAKER_24]: These are all buildings that

723
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:58,491
[SPEAKER_24]: My daughter could potentially go play in and I want the fire department to be prepared to fight a fire if one breaks out this building.

724
01:01:59,352 --> 01:02:03,613
[SPEAKER_24]: It seems irresponsible to tear down a fire tower without the new tower in place.

725
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:17,616
[SPEAKER_24]: It seems even more irresponsible when we're talking about creative solutions to say, this building is fine and we're gonna tear it down to put a different building in its place and leave a hole in our infrastructure where we need a training tower.

726
01:02:18,656 --> 01:02:19,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Whose bright idea was that?

727
01:02:19,876 --> 01:02:22,037
[SPEAKER_24]: To tear down a tower that's perfectly good

728
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:30,456
[SPEAKER_24]: And that right there would have saved us a million dollars that could have gone directly towards building our new fire station, but we threw that away because we apparently don't need it.

729
01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:33,057
[SPEAKER_24]: To go forward with that is ridiculous.

730
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:35,458
[SPEAKER_24]: And we see all these projects coming through.

731
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:41,941
[SPEAKER_24]: Every time I'm at a meeting, we see $500,000 going on Riverside Plaza to expedite it so that it could be open in the fall of 2017.

732
01:02:42,101 --> 01:02:50,785
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you go by, it's May of 2018, and I see mismatched furniture that looks like it came from other projects.

733
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:52,863
[SPEAKER_24]: set up there and it's still not open.

734
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:57,906
[SPEAKER_24]: That's $500,000 that maybe we could have cut that down and put that towards a new tower.

735
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:02,348
[SPEAKER_24]: If we're thinking creatively, debt exclusion is not the most creative.

736
01:03:02,388 --> 01:03:05,450
[SPEAKER_24]: That's probably, you know, that just says, let's just take more money.

737
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,671
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to look at the difference going on.

738
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:19,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we need $1.6 million in one park when we have at least a dozen parks in 2011 that were identified in poor condition and those children will continue to play in those poor parks?

739
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:23,991
[SPEAKER_24]: and look over at that park that you can't park near to go and play in.

740
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:32,097
[SPEAKER_24]: When I visit people in that neighborhood, I often park in Tiki Island, sorry, Tiki Island, to visit friends because there's no parking on the street.

741
01:03:32,157 --> 01:03:38,521
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're spending money in places that we maybe need to start thinking more creatively of budgets.

742
01:03:39,022 --> 01:03:47,368
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't build the Taj Mahal everywhere and to tell the fire department that they can't have a station and they can't have a training tower while we're building projects at levels

743
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:52,949
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't afford to maintain, we can't sustain, and we just can't afford is irresponsible.

744
01:03:53,429 --> 01:04:01,795
[SPEAKER_24]: You should move to, maybe you need to spend more money on an architect and tell him he needs to build around that tower because it's irresponsible to tear down that tower.

745
01:04:02,195 --> 01:04:12,542
[SPEAKER_24]: The million dollars that it's gonna cost to put up a new tower versus a million dollars in new architecture fees, maybe that should be the situation, and then our fire department doesn't have interrupted training schedule.

746
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,624
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe that's a creative solution.

747
01:04:15,104 --> 01:04:16,385
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's more creative than,

748
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:26,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, we don't want to hold things up, so let's just knock it down and maybe we'll figure it out because the DPW, the sand and salt is coming to Mystic Ave.

749
01:04:26,388 --> 01:04:29,329
[SPEAKER_24]: They've already decided that that's where they want the sand and salt.

750
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:40,395
[SPEAKER_24]: They said that they negotiated and they sold the sign shops so that they could build a high rise of 500 units, which the firefighters will have to go into if it goes on fire, but they won't be able to train to prepare for.

751
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:45,038
[SPEAKER_24]: So now they want another piece of Medford land to put sand and salt on.

752
01:04:45,418 --> 01:04:46,538
[SPEAKER_24]: So we need to think about it.

753
01:04:46,558 --> 01:04:50,979
[SPEAKER_24]: If we're not going to get that land, we're going to lose that tower, and we're going to potentially lose lives.

754
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

755
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:01,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Method Mass.

756
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:06,322
[SPEAKER_01]: We would even be having this conversation about

757
01:05:07,373 --> 01:05:13,855
[SPEAKER_01]: knocking down three buildings, police, fire, library, about 55 years old, made of brick.

758
01:05:14,936 --> 01:05:17,737
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me we have a problem with maintenance in the city.

759
01:05:18,017 --> 01:05:22,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Hate to sound like a broken record, but when will the city ever learn?

760
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you keep putting this on our kids' dime on their charge card.

761
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

762
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:34,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks.

763
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:37,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

764
01:05:38,054 --> 01:05:42,996
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's important that we remember how this all originated.

765
01:05:44,097 --> 01:05:50,200
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was a year ago when this chamber was filled with police and fire and a number of residents.

766
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:59,985
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the time, we were told that we couldn't build a combined center because it would require a proposition two and a half.

767
01:06:00,846 --> 01:06:03,527
[SPEAKER_17]: And I remember the discussion and debate quite vividly.

768
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:05,108
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the time,

769
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,469
[SPEAKER_17]: the firefighters took a step back.

770
01:06:08,449 --> 01:06:18,033
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were the ones to say, you know what, if we can get a commitment, we're willing to postpone our fire station for several years out.

771
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:22,094
[SPEAKER_17]: We're willing to go without a tower until a new one's built.

772
01:06:23,214 --> 01:06:27,676
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were the ones that stuck their neck out in the line more than anyone else, to be quite frank.

773
01:06:28,116 --> 01:06:32,898
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's ironic we're back here a year later with the firefighters in the same predicament.

774
01:06:34,049 --> 01:06:38,690
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't blame, and that's why I stand alongside them, Mr. President, I don't blame a single one of them.

775
01:06:39,190 --> 01:07:01,857
[SPEAKER_17]: After one year of hearing discussion and debate, after receiving a pledge or a commitment, whatever you want to call it, from the administration, that they would receive a new fire headquarters in 2021 or 2022, and to have the rug pulled out from underneath them and pushed down to 2026, which is another four or five years,

776
01:07:03,142 --> 01:07:13,129
[SPEAKER_17]: And then to say, you'll get a training tower when that one comes down, this was a year ago, when the training tower comes down to make way for new police headquarters, a new one will go up.

777
01:07:14,189 --> 01:07:19,893
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're a year out and none of those commitments are on track.

778
01:07:21,214 --> 01:07:27,558
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know what track some of these counselors are on, but it's clearly not a track that makes sense.

779
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:30,340
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a one sided track.

780
01:07:32,794 --> 01:07:37,435
[SPEAKER_17]: And the firefighters are absolutely correct when they talk about training.

781
01:07:38,716 --> 01:07:46,057
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't work in that sector or that field, but I can imagine the intense training that's required by both police and fire.

782
01:07:46,698 --> 01:07:48,938
[SPEAKER_17]: In the private sector, sitting at a desk.

783
01:07:50,259 --> 01:07:55,620
[SPEAKER_17]: We're scrutinized every year and go through intensive training, working with numbers and paper.

784
01:07:57,048 --> 01:08:01,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine doing fire rescue, the intense training that's required.

785
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:12,325
[SPEAKER_17]: And to take that away not only puts their lives at risk, but every man, woman, and child and pet in this community, Mr. President.

786
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:16,189
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think we could just brush over it.

787
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,692
[SPEAKER_17]: I really don't think so, Mr. President.

788
01:08:19,484 --> 01:08:25,768
[SPEAKER_17]: And the conversations we had regarding state land, and I said this weeks ago, are going nowhere.

789
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:26,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Did they try?

790
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:28,190
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll give them an A for effort.

791
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:29,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Did they try?

792
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:29,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, they tried.

793
01:08:30,131 --> 01:08:32,153
[SPEAKER_17]: But they're going nowhere fast.

794
01:08:33,354 --> 01:08:39,037
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we have to depend on getting state land, we're going to just keep depending on getting state land.

795
01:08:39,918 --> 01:08:41,499
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're going to be in the same situation.

796
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:48,404
[SPEAKER_17]: So the commitments that were given a year ago have not fallen through.

797
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:50,411
[SPEAKER_17]: or they have fallen through.

798
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:53,913
[SPEAKER_17]: So where do we stand right now?

799
01:08:54,653 --> 01:08:55,673
[SPEAKER_17]: They're exactly correct.

800
01:08:55,953 --> 01:08:59,014
[SPEAKER_17]: The minute that tower comes down, it's going to be put on the back burner.

801
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,736
[SPEAKER_17]: And nothing's going to happen, Mr. President.

802
01:09:03,036 --> 01:09:04,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Then there's going to be another need that comes forward.

803
01:09:05,257 --> 01:09:07,778
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, a community, I think you could tell a lot about a community.

804
01:09:08,058 --> 01:09:15,040
[SPEAKER_17]: When a community doesn't put its time and effort and money into public safety, it says a lot about a community.

805
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:16,921
[SPEAKER_17]: It really does.

806
01:09:18,324 --> 01:09:20,005
[SPEAKER_17]: and I think we're seeing that in this community.

807
01:09:21,146 --> 01:09:23,568
[SPEAKER_17]: The headquarters is one of six buildings.

808
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:29,873
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll take anyone, if the reporter wants to go through, anyone that wants to go look at these other buildings.

809
01:09:31,555 --> 01:09:35,078
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to take them all down in one fell swoop, the condition of these buildings.

810
01:09:35,758 --> 01:09:36,939
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're starting somewhere.

811
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:42,183
[SPEAKER_17]: We're starting with the headquarters because it was attached to the police station, which we all know needed to be done.

812
01:09:43,565 --> 01:09:47,608
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree also, and the police aren't here tonight, but how do you take a firing range

813
01:09:48,365 --> 01:09:49,686
[SPEAKER_17]: away from police officers.

814
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:52,947
[SPEAKER_17]: It's unheard of, Mr. President.

815
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:55,369
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't make any sense.

816
01:09:55,789 --> 01:10:00,771
[SPEAKER_17]: We're building a building undersized already because of monetary constraints.

817
01:10:01,992 --> 01:10:14,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Everywhere I look, we're building in this community, receiving millions of dollars in new building fees, linkage money, millions of dollars in linkage money, new revenue coming in, thousands of new residents pouring into this community.

818
01:10:14,799 --> 01:10:17,240
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a hot commodity, but we can't afford

819
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:22,216
[SPEAKER_17]: to rehab and build a station that's long overdue.

820
01:10:23,156 --> 01:10:24,296
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a matter of priorities.

821
01:10:24,316 --> 01:10:25,177
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I tell everyone.

822
01:10:25,377 --> 01:10:26,537
[SPEAKER_17]: They say, how come we can't do it?

823
01:10:26,897 --> 01:10:27,617
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what I say?

824
01:10:28,517 --> 01:10:32,478
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't do it because this is not the mayor's priority.

825
01:10:32,798 --> 01:10:33,999
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what it boils down to.

826
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:38,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Building a park out here in Riverside Ave, that's the mayor's priority.

827
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Building giant big box residential buildings on Locust Street, that's the mayor's priority.

828
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:47,902
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's clearly not public safety.

829
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:53,552
[SPEAKER_17]: And I didn't support tearing this down in the committee hall, Mr. President.

830
01:10:54,012 --> 01:11:00,433
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope, after hearing some of the pleas from the fire department, that some of my colleagues have a change of mind.

831
01:11:00,973 --> 01:11:02,793
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, a 45-day is just what it is.

832
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,134
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 45 days.

833
01:11:05,414 --> 01:11:13,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Did we put a time limit on the revitalization of Meffitt Square, which has been going on, from what I can remember, from 2005?

834
01:11:15,176 --> 01:11:17,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a time limit on that, where it just ends?

835
01:11:18,437 --> 01:11:20,217
[SPEAKER_17]: But, no, there's a time limit on the fire department.

836
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:22,174
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get to a certain point.

837
01:11:22,714 --> 01:11:23,755
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll put some time limits.

838
01:11:24,455 --> 01:11:26,837
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we can't meet our goal, we move on to something else.

839
01:11:27,697 --> 01:11:29,058
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not fair, Mr. President.

840
01:11:29,758 --> 01:11:31,840
[SPEAKER_17]: And commitments have to count for something.

841
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,322
[SPEAKER_17]: A politician is only as good as their word.

842
01:11:37,423 --> 01:11:40,305
[SPEAKER_17]: And if people can't trust your word, then you're no good.

843
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:42,326
[SPEAKER_17]: You're no good, Mr. President.

844
01:11:42,646 --> 01:11:43,967
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't want to fall in that realm.

845
01:11:45,188 --> 01:11:48,670
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we should extend the 45 days, Mr. President.

846
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's give it several more months to try to work out.

847
01:11:53,663 --> 01:12:03,770
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor's own committee that she put together when she became mayor looked at the revitalization of the square, looked at business and economic development, looked at a number of things.

848
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,512
[SPEAKER_17]: And guess what one of their major recommendations were?

849
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,795
[SPEAKER_17]: To build a new combined center on that exact location.

850
01:12:11,275 --> 01:12:12,036
[SPEAKER_17]: It's in the report.

851
01:12:13,097 --> 01:12:14,678
[SPEAKER_17]: That was one of their recommendations.

852
01:12:16,923 --> 01:12:22,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, that committee did yeoman's work, spent many, many months putting together all sorts of data.

853
01:12:25,289 --> 01:12:29,393
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I plead with my colleagues, Mr. President, take a step back.

854
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:35,718
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to lose out on anything right now, taking a step back and taking a look at this picture.

855
01:12:35,978 --> 01:12:37,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, there was a lot of things brought up.

856
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:40,461
[SPEAKER_17]: I brought up about wind casinos, Mr. President.

857
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:46,566
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to receive a million dollars a year as soon as the casino opens for infrastructure in this community.

858
01:12:47,182 --> 01:12:48,543
[SPEAKER_17]: i.e., public safety.

859
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:50,904
[SPEAKER_17]: What better of a project?

860
01:12:51,165 --> 01:12:56,048
[SPEAKER_17]: To earmark, as Councilor Knight mentioned, all we need is roughly a million dollars a year to take us over the hump.

861
01:12:56,808 --> 01:12:57,989
[SPEAKER_17]: That's only one aspect.

862
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,430
[SPEAKER_17]: That's only one aspect.

863
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:05,013
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not talking about new growth, to be earmarked, linkage.

864
01:13:07,495 --> 01:13:12,938
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Mr. President, you know, a reason why we're in this situation is the fact that

865
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:16,012
[SPEAKER_17]: This council has talked, I've been on the council a number of years.

866
01:13:16,552 --> 01:13:19,833
[SPEAKER_17]: We wrote together a wish list of capital improvements.

867
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:21,454
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been around, Mr. President.

868
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:23,374
[SPEAKER_17]: And what were the top one and two?

869
01:13:23,915 --> 01:13:24,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anyone recall?

870
01:13:25,335 --> 01:13:31,357
[SPEAKER_17]: For years, consistent, police and fire, one and two, police and fire, one and two.

871
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:39,900
[SPEAKER_17]: So now we're at a predicament where we're doing number one without number two.

872
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,061
[SPEAKER_17]: And that could get painful.

873
01:13:43,191 --> 01:13:44,412
[SPEAKER_17]: You ever do number one without number two?

874
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:46,434
[SPEAKER_17]: It's painful.

875
01:13:48,376 --> 01:13:50,778
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the situation we're in now, Mr. President.

876
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:55,603
[SPEAKER_17]: This is becoming awfully painful, and it doesn't need to be.

877
01:13:56,544 --> 01:13:59,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Who in this community doesn't think we need a new fire station?

878
01:13:59,767 --> 01:14:00,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Stand up.

879
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Who doesn't think we need a fire station?

880
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:06,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Even when the library people were here, Mr. President.

881
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:18,363
[SPEAKER_17]: When the library people, I got more emails from library people after the fact saying, thank you, we knew that was a tough vote, but we want to be part of the fight to create a new fire station.

882
01:14:18,763 --> 01:14:20,084
[SPEAKER_17]: Our eyes were open that night.

883
01:14:21,004 --> 01:14:23,445
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't know what was going on in our public safety buildings.

884
01:14:24,065 --> 01:14:25,465
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to be part of that fight.

885
01:14:26,746 --> 01:14:29,866
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an entire city fight, not just with the fire department.

886
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:32,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Think about it.

887
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:35,008
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to get up and fight on behalf of the entire city.

888
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:37,811
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not fighting for themselves.

889
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:41,112
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't want a new kitchen or a new bath.

890
01:14:41,532 --> 01:14:44,094
[SPEAKER_17]: They're fighting for the entire city, Mr. President.

891
01:14:45,074 --> 01:14:46,115
[SPEAKER_17]: That's who they're fighting for.

892
01:14:47,736 --> 01:14:53,819
[SPEAKER_17]: And they don't have all these different interest groups and friends of the fire department and so forth, and maybe they should.

893
01:14:55,159 --> 01:15:02,743
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is a crucial, crucial item that we as a member of the council, us as councilors, have to stand up sometime and say, you know what?

894
01:15:03,523 --> 01:15:04,704
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to do the right thing here.

895
01:15:05,527 --> 01:15:18,477
[SPEAKER_17]: And if the right thing is flexing our muscle, asking the mayor to come back to the table, which we were never at the table with her, by the way, but asking her to come back to the table and say, we are not going to move forward until we take another look at this.

896
01:15:19,858 --> 01:15:21,780
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to move forward until we take another look.

897
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,881
[SPEAKER_17]: It's too important of an issue.

898
01:15:25,723 --> 01:15:27,704
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's the right way to do it, Mr. President.

899
01:15:28,645 --> 01:15:32,568
[SPEAKER_17]: I respectfully ask my colleagues, I realize we took a vote and committed a whole.

900
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,270
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing that precludes anyone from

901
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:43,242
[SPEAKER_17]: re-looking after listening to new debate and dialogue to say, you know what, I'm at the point where I think we need to take another look at this.

902
01:15:44,562 --> 01:15:47,262
[SPEAKER_17]: We asked that we meet with the mayor every two weeks.

903
01:15:48,403 --> 01:15:52,424
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had two meetings, and they've been somewhat productive, but we've had two meetings.

904
01:15:54,404 --> 01:15:55,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's continue the discussion.

905
01:15:57,385 --> 01:16:03,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's put out plan A, B, and C. We only saw plan A. We never saw a B and C, ever.

906
01:16:04,955 --> 01:16:09,357
[SPEAKER_17]: We got the email the night before the mayor was announcing where the new police station was going to go.

907
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:13,819
[SPEAKER_17]: The night before we got the email inviting us to a press conference.

908
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:15,700
[SPEAKER_17]: That's when we got it.

909
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,221
[SPEAKER_17]: So we had no idea what was taking place.

910
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,162
[SPEAKER_17]: The decisions were made in a vacuum.

911
01:16:22,323 --> 01:16:23,703
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're just saying, let's revisit it.

912
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,526
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not that far down the road that we can't stop the process now.

913
01:16:29,566 --> 01:16:30,306
[SPEAKER_17]: We're really not.

914
01:16:31,547 --> 01:16:34,648
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're right in the thick of things where we can't put a halt in this.

915
01:16:35,629 --> 01:16:42,412
[SPEAKER_17]: and press the administration to sit down with this council and come to a resolve once and for all, Mr. President.

916
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:43,872
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be my suggestion.

917
01:16:44,152 --> 01:17:02,460
[SPEAKER_17]: I would ask any member of the council, respectfully, because I know this is not an easy decision, respectfully take a look at their vote, Mr. President, and revisit this for at least another 90-day period so we can continue our two-week meetings and discussions about a combined center and where we're going with the tower.

918
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:03,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

919
01:17:06,363 --> 01:17:07,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Carviello.

920
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:12,785
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to second what my council colleague, Councilor Marks, just said.

921
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:19,887
[SPEAKER_21]: It took a few things of what I was going to say, but I just have to go on record that I feel the exact same way.

922
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:34,211
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like there were two promises that were made, at least one I know specifically was in writing and one, the training time, I'm not sure, but two specific promises that were made and promises that

923
01:17:35,086 --> 01:17:42,428
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe were made in the interest of public safety that I feel are important, even though it wasn't me making the promises.

924
01:17:42,648 --> 01:17:54,632
[SPEAKER_21]: It's our administration making promises to the fire department with regards to the training tower, that it would not be torn down until a new training tower is put up.

925
01:17:55,392 --> 01:17:58,433
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought, and I still think that is extremely important.

926
01:17:59,093 --> 01:18:04,675
[SPEAKER_21]: It's where our firefighters train to protect the lives of our children,

927
01:18:05,232 --> 01:18:08,434
[SPEAKER_21]: of our parents, of ourselves, and I think it's so important.

928
01:18:08,715 --> 01:18:19,803
[SPEAKER_21]: Having a house fire myself, just a small electrical fire, I saw firsthand what the fire department does five years ago when there was an electrical fire right in my daughter's pillow.

929
01:18:20,983 --> 01:18:23,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Scary, and not everybody experiences that.

930
01:18:24,406 --> 01:18:33,232
[SPEAKER_21]: But to see the professionalism come into your home to protect your family and to know they've been trained, that is something they need to keep doing.

931
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:38,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Two, I'm big on the development issues, and we have a lot of high-rises coming up.

932
01:18:38,571 --> 01:18:39,311
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to repeat it.

933
01:18:40,311 --> 01:18:42,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Training is number one.

934
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:47,092
[SPEAKER_21]: And if we don't allow our firefighters to do that, shame on us.

935
01:18:49,773 --> 01:18:59,634
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the promise that it would be up and the fact that we're being asked to totally disregard that promise is not fair to the seven of us.

936
01:18:59,814 --> 01:19:00,495
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not fair.

937
01:19:01,015 --> 01:19:03,055
[SPEAKER_21]: The position that we are in is not fair.

938
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,342
[SPEAKER_21]: The position we are in is due to lack of communication.

939
01:19:07,562 --> 01:19:14,045
[SPEAKER_21]: Like Councilman Mark says, I got a text message 9.30 p.m., come to a press conference at the police academy building.

940
01:19:15,745 --> 01:19:19,307
[SPEAKER_21]: Come to find out after that press conference, a new police station is going to be built.

941
01:19:19,627 --> 01:19:20,888
[SPEAKER_21]: We had no idea.

942
01:19:20,908 --> 01:19:23,789
[SPEAKER_21]: The fire department had no idea.

943
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:27,771
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even think most of the police department had any idea.

944
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:31,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Lack of communication and lack of transparency.

945
01:19:32,253 --> 01:19:33,193
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why we're here.

946
01:19:33,938 --> 01:19:35,118
[SPEAKER_21]: We're doing the best we can.

947
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:42,562
[SPEAKER_21]: We were misled, I believe is the word that was used at the Committee of the Whole meeting, February 2017, we were misled.

948
01:19:43,342 --> 01:19:47,484
[SPEAKER_21]: I, as one councilor, pushed and pushed and pushed for a combined center.

949
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:51,805
[SPEAKER_21]: That is the number one thing we need in this city, a combined center.

950
01:19:52,806 --> 01:19:53,946
[SPEAKER_21]: We were told we couldn't do it.

951
01:19:55,687 --> 01:19:59,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Come now, we're doing police station and a library.

952
01:20:01,449 --> 01:20:02,970
[SPEAKER_21]: We were told that the fire department

953
01:20:03,385 --> 01:20:05,906
[SPEAKER_21]: would get a new fire headquarters by 2021.

954
01:20:06,026 --> 01:20:09,327
[SPEAKER_21]: It would be built by 2021, 2022.

955
01:20:09,947 --> 01:20:11,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it's being pushed to 2026, 2027.

956
01:20:11,808 --> 01:20:15,329
[SPEAKER_21]: It was brought up in the Committee of the Whole.

957
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:20,611
[SPEAKER_21]: Work at the high school could even bring that down to 2030 and beyond.

958
01:20:20,631 --> 01:20:24,332
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we won't be here when it possibly could happen.

959
01:20:27,053 --> 01:20:28,094
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't move forward.

960
01:20:28,174 --> 01:20:31,195
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've been on the council for too long, I think.

961
01:20:32,855 --> 01:20:35,796
[SPEAKER_21]: That police station, we need a new police station.

962
01:20:36,756 --> 01:20:40,496
[SPEAKER_21]: That's where we were brought, that's where we toured for years and years ago.

963
01:20:41,897 --> 01:20:45,577
[SPEAKER_21]: It hurts to not move forward, but I can't.

964
01:20:45,797 --> 01:21:00,740
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't move forward knowing that promises have been broken, knowing that the only way we get our questions answered, knowing the only way we even got the union president to sit down with the mayor, knowing we can't

965
01:21:01,283 --> 01:21:11,088
[SPEAKER_21]: We can help move this forward in a way that's going to benefit our city, our fire department, our police department, and our library if we stick together and if we continue to meet.

966
01:21:11,228 --> 01:21:12,869
[SPEAKER_21]: I think they were pretty productive.

967
01:21:13,029 --> 01:21:14,990
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like we're starting to get some answers.

968
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:19,031
[SPEAKER_21]: We're starting to work together, but we are just skimming the top.

969
01:21:20,172 --> 01:21:21,453
[SPEAKER_21]: We can make progress.

970
01:21:21,733 --> 01:21:22,953
[SPEAKER_21]: The mayor came to our meetings.

971
01:21:23,494 --> 01:21:25,735
[SPEAKER_21]: The administration came to our meetings.

972
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:30,657
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to push to get this land, whether it's a combined center,

973
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:34,651
[SPEAKER_21]: or new land for a new training tower, we need to push for it.

974
01:21:34,731 --> 01:21:37,872
[SPEAKER_21]: If we don't continue to push for it, it's not going to happen.

975
01:21:38,472 --> 01:21:39,553
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't believe it will happen.

976
01:21:39,593 --> 01:21:40,913
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just my personal opinion.

977
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:53,837
[SPEAKER_21]: This vote is, I mean, this once in a while you get pretty sentimental in a vote or, you know, you really take it to heart.

978
01:21:53,857 --> 01:21:55,197
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is one for me.

979
01:21:55,698 --> 01:21:58,418
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we definitely need to keep this.

980
01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:00,159
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought the resolution,

981
01:22:00,905 --> 01:22:04,006
[SPEAKER_21]: put forth by the three counselors was a good idea.

982
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:05,566
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we want to move forward on the police station?

983
01:22:05,626 --> 01:22:07,027
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, they need a new police station.

984
01:22:07,307 --> 01:22:11,988
[SPEAKER_21]: They need an up-to-date, full-furbished, full building with a gun range.

985
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:13,049
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with that too.

986
01:22:14,069 --> 01:22:16,230
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's just this way or the highway.

987
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:23,192
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're left as a counselor saying, do I go back on promises, or do I move forward with what I believe is right?

988
01:22:23,332 --> 01:22:30,694
[SPEAKER_21]: And what I believe is right is that we continue to have meetings, and we continue to work together, and we continue to keep the fire department, the police department,

989
01:22:31,088 --> 01:22:35,153
[SPEAKER_21]: the city council, the administration at the table and work this out.

990
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:38,236
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a number of questions.

991
01:22:38,276 --> 01:22:42,681
[SPEAKER_21]: We were going to have a meeting with regards to the debt service.

992
01:22:42,701 --> 01:22:47,046
[SPEAKER_21]: We were going to have a meeting with regards to different parcels of land that we may be able to put a tower.

993
01:22:47,827 --> 01:22:50,550
[SPEAKER_21]: It's always been a no with the compensation, but if we stick together,

994
01:22:51,061 --> 01:22:51,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we can do it.

995
01:22:52,021 --> 01:22:53,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Start fundraising for that library.

996
01:22:53,582 --> 01:23:02,905
[SPEAKER_21]: We may have the money to be able to do a combined station, which everybody in this community wants, and which I believe is the right way to go.

997
01:23:02,925 --> 01:23:04,066
[SPEAKER_21]: I always have said that.

998
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:06,687
[SPEAKER_21]: And I wish we did it a year ago if we were not misled.

999
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:09,508
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know really what else to say.

1000
01:23:11,469 --> 01:23:19,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the whole situation we've been put in is unfair with the fire department, the situation in the fire department, and even last year when the police versus fire.

1001
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:25,622
[SPEAKER_21]: It's terrible the way this administration has pinned people against each other.

1002
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:27,963
[SPEAKER_21]: It's terrible.

1003
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:35,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1004
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:40,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've heard a lot of things tonight.

1005
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard a lot of things the last few months.

1006
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:46,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And one thing we realized

1007
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:48,977
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a problem for 30 years.

1008
01:23:49,097 --> 01:23:50,917
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happening 30 years all over the city.

1009
01:23:51,478 --> 01:23:54,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a problem with our facilities.

1010
01:23:54,839 --> 01:24:01,602
[SPEAKER_08]: The dual station was prior to my tour here on the city council.

1011
01:24:02,963 --> 01:24:10,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And one thing that forced me to run for city council is to make a difference.

1012
01:24:11,887 --> 01:24:16,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the words mediocre Medford was banging off my head over and over again.

1013
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:18,149
[SPEAKER_08]: and making a change.

1014
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:20,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hear it from everybody.

1015
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:22,231
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a new library.

1016
01:24:22,631 --> 01:24:23,691
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a new police station.

1017
01:24:24,252 --> 01:24:25,412
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a new fire station.

1018
01:24:26,773 --> 01:24:28,114
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to refurbish the schools.

1019
01:24:28,154 --> 01:24:29,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to refurbish the high school.

1020
01:24:31,556 --> 01:24:34,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We're pushing things forward and trying to get things done the right way.

1021
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:43,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, a few weeks ago, the word misled, I might have used that word, that statement when we talked about

1022
01:24:44,202 --> 01:24:47,724
[SPEAKER_08]: the funding of all three projects and keeping things on the timeline.

1023
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:55,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And the vote at the time to freeze everything is to make sure we got all the answers that we needed to move forward.

1024
01:24:59,269 --> 01:25:00,929
[SPEAKER_08]: The answers I got were pretty loud and clear.

1025
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:02,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I know where the mayor stands on this.

1026
01:25:03,611 --> 01:25:06,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand where we're trying to go and what we need to do to move forward.

1027
01:25:07,877 --> 01:25:16,342
[SPEAKER_08]: People have come up to the podium, said we need to be bold, we need to make strong choices, we need to do things that you're gonna feel uncomfortable about.

1028
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:20,884
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that I don't believe everything what everybody said.

1029
01:25:22,806 --> 01:25:25,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I call most firemen my friends.

1030
01:25:27,408 --> 01:25:28,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I think the firemen are important?

1031
01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:31,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Every day they came through the door to help my dad.

1032
01:25:33,787 --> 01:25:37,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I know their worth, and I appreciate them more than anybody can understand.

1033
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,354
[SPEAKER_08]: So to throw those things around is a little distorted.

1034
01:25:44,756 --> 01:25:46,397
[SPEAKER_08]: The gun range, we understand that.

1035
01:25:46,697 --> 01:25:49,800
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't had the gun range since they blew the boiler apart years ago.

1036
01:25:51,441 --> 01:25:52,362
[SPEAKER_08]: That was 30 years ago.

1037
01:25:53,703 --> 01:25:54,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing's been done.

1038
01:25:56,105 --> 01:25:56,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing has been done.

1039
01:25:57,972 --> 01:26:00,634
[SPEAKER_08]: So we sit and we meet and we talk about, let's have a meeting.

1040
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:01,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's have another meeting.

1041
01:26:02,094 --> 01:26:03,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's have another meeting.

1042
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:04,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put this in place.

1043
01:26:04,976 --> 01:26:05,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put this in place.

1044
01:26:08,118 --> 01:26:13,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we sat with the administration, we talked about the different avenues we can go to achieve what we want.

1045
01:26:14,522 --> 01:26:19,665
[SPEAKER_08]: A library, a police station, a new fire station, the refurbishing of the schools.

1046
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:27,232
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to talk about bold, and I keep saying this, I'm bold.

1047
01:26:27,352 --> 01:26:32,355
[SPEAKER_08]: People want to threaten people, you want to threaten the council, get on the councilist to want to vote for debt exclusion.

1048
01:26:33,776 --> 01:26:36,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is like a dog chasing its tail right now.

1049
01:26:36,378 --> 01:26:43,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Until we make bold decisions on what we have to do to make our city straight, it's not going to be done the way we're doing it right now.

1050
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:47,661
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've already heard it.

1051
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:52,064
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called the George Scott Pelley Resolution, the debt exclusion resolution.

1052
01:26:53,145 --> 01:26:53,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll own it.

1053
01:26:55,567 --> 01:26:56,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And what does that mean?

1054
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:01,132
[SPEAKER_08]: As we move forward with this process, it'll be explained to everybody in the community.

1055
01:27:02,653 --> 01:27:09,459
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't make a motion 45 days ago and sit there and say, let the time go by, then I'm going to vote for a police station to be built again.

1056
01:27:09,939 --> 01:27:12,602
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I visited North Reading.

1057
01:27:12,942 --> 01:27:13,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I visited Wilmington.

1058
01:27:15,509 --> 01:27:17,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I've visited communities that have done a debt exclusion.

1059
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:20,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I've sat with groups of people.

1060
01:27:20,593 --> 01:27:21,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone to Little League fields.

1061
01:27:22,795 --> 01:27:28,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I've sat with people that are the strongest, most conservative people in the world, and I explained what a debt exclusion is.

1062
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:40,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I feel that's the only way that we can do what we promised, something I'm not hiding from, was one counts I promised to stand beside the firemen and women.

1063
01:27:43,478 --> 01:27:46,500
[SPEAKER_08]: So you want to talk about making a tough choice in Medford?

1064
01:27:47,561 --> 01:27:53,205
[SPEAKER_08]: How about being the council that's sitting there telling you, I'm ready to roll on a debt exclusion to get this project done.

1065
01:27:55,266 --> 01:28:04,813
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the councils that were questioned in that room, in the other room about, we need five votes, five votes to make it something we could put on the ballot.

1066
01:28:05,473 --> 01:28:07,575
[SPEAKER_08]: But we only have four, so it's not going to happen.

1067
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:19,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I challenge the community, I challenge the firemen and women to look at the council that don't want to vote for it and realize we can have meeting after meeting after meeting and get nothing done.

1068
01:28:20,659 --> 01:28:23,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we can take bold decisions and stand up

1069
01:28:24,511 --> 01:28:25,552
[SPEAKER_08]: And say, yeah, I'll take it.

1070
01:28:26,172 --> 01:28:29,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's fear of losing an election, I'll lose the election.

1071
01:28:30,155 --> 01:28:35,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when it's all said and done, I want a library, I want a police station, and I want a fire station like we promised.

1072
01:28:36,259 --> 01:28:39,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my children to go to Medford High School that's refurbished that everybody's going to be proud of.

1073
01:28:40,877 --> 01:28:46,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And doing it with what we have right now on a tax roll, it's not going to happen.

1074
01:28:46,483 --> 01:28:53,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing it on our ordinary operating budget, it's not going to work.

1075
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:54,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I've talked to thousands of people.

1076
01:28:56,092 --> 01:28:57,874
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a fire station, Councilor Scott Pelley.

1077
01:28:57,894 --> 01:28:58,835
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a fire station.

1078
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:00,557
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your plans?

1079
01:29:00,597 --> 01:29:01,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tell them my plans.

1080
01:29:02,099 --> 01:29:03,160
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I think we need.

1081
01:29:05,143 --> 01:29:06,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you want a fire station?

1082
01:29:06,364 --> 01:29:11,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the men and women are living in sub conditions.

1083
01:29:11,886 --> 01:29:13,027
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to get that built.

1084
01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:14,627
[SPEAKER_08]: We need them in that situation.

1085
01:29:15,328 --> 01:29:16,108
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do that.

1086
01:29:17,589 --> 01:29:21,370
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want you to see common sense, because common sense says, how do you want to do it?

1087
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:22,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's bond it.

1088
01:29:22,511 --> 01:29:23,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, let's bond it.

1089
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:30,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Times are good right now, but in two years, when times are tough, guess what, everyone?

1090
01:29:30,554 --> 01:29:31,755
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have to pay a bond.

1091
01:29:32,936 --> 01:29:42,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So the people you're protecting, the people that you want to help with this, with building a fire station, making sure our firemen and women have everything they need, guess how we have to pay that bond back?

1092
01:29:44,202 --> 01:29:50,065
[SPEAKER_08]: By laying off the men and women you want to protect, in our schools, in the police department, and in the fire stations.

1093
01:29:50,705 --> 01:29:52,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So you want to talk about bold and making a decision?

1094
01:29:53,646 --> 01:29:55,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Here I am, I'm publicly doing it.

1095
01:29:56,908 --> 01:29:57,568
[SPEAKER_08]: You want a challenge?

1096
01:29:57,608 --> 01:29:58,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll challenge everyone in the community.

1097
01:30:00,287 --> 01:30:02,069
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not, we keep doing this 30 years.

1098
01:30:02,089 --> 01:30:03,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been seeing this for 30 years.

1099
01:30:06,453 --> 01:30:10,537
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our facilities are substandard and we need to find a way to get ahead of it.

1100
01:30:12,138 --> 01:30:18,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And from what I heard, what I've met with the administration, it's not going to happen traditionally.

1101
01:30:18,524 --> 01:30:19,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to think outside the box.

1102
01:30:21,246 --> 01:30:23,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, do I love the firemen and women?

1103
01:30:24,029 --> 01:30:24,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1104
01:30:25,569 --> 01:30:33,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know someday, hopefully not soon, they're going to be coming to my door and I want them trained because my children depend on you.

1105
01:30:35,795 --> 01:30:41,679
[SPEAKER_08]: And the policemen and women that protect us every day, of course, I think they need a gun range.

1106
01:30:41,799 --> 01:30:47,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And when my son and daughter need to do a project, they need to use the library.

1107
01:30:50,224 --> 01:30:50,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard it all.

1108
01:30:52,259 --> 01:30:57,226
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm telling you, people have come up to that podium and said, you people are going to have to make a tough decision.

1109
01:30:57,246 --> 01:31:04,956
[SPEAKER_08]: 45 days ago, we made a resolution to halt the police demolition, the building, so we can talk about this.

1110
01:31:05,316 --> 01:31:05,757
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did.

1111
01:31:06,898 --> 01:31:08,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm secure enough that I know

1112
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:25,545
[SPEAKER_08]: that the process we have, the process of sitting here behind this reel when you get this job and having meeting after meeting and after meeting and just hope things get done, if that's what you wanna do, go ahead, but I'm not voting for it.

1113
01:31:25,825 --> 01:31:26,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna make a bold decision.

1114
01:31:27,506 --> 01:31:30,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna step up to make sure the fire station's built.

1115
01:31:30,786 --> 01:31:32,627
[SPEAKER_08]: At least I'll try everything I can.

1116
01:31:33,567 --> 01:31:37,688
[SPEAKER_08]: If I have counselors that don't wanna support that venue or that option,

1117
01:31:39,188 --> 01:31:45,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I also heard, we don't want to do it because of a debt exclusion, but it's a proposition to an afternoon override.

1118
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:46,210
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more tax.

1119
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:47,830
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it isn't.

1120
01:31:49,090 --> 01:31:51,571
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a tax that's focused on one job.

1121
01:31:51,871 --> 01:32:05,335
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I talked to the people in the community and we looked at what that job is and building a fire station, every person I talked to said, if you're telling me the way that it's broken down at a $600,000 home,

1122
01:32:07,514 --> 01:32:15,238
[SPEAKER_08]: appraisal, that $54 a year will go directly to a fire station, I'm going to support it because I know where my money's going.

1123
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:25,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And knowing that as the money comes in with the philanthropist, hopefully, that the money that comes in goes back into that fire station and brings down that debt.

1124
01:32:26,864 --> 01:32:34,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as soon as that debt is paid off, that that tax is gone, but we have that station, I'm willing to take that chance.

1125
01:32:36,067 --> 01:32:47,192
[SPEAKER_08]: especially when we talk about the way it looks by excluding our seniors, our handicapped, our blind, our veterans, because that's what we got, that's what we asked for.

1126
01:32:47,952 --> 01:32:50,994
[SPEAKER_08]: We asked the administration to give us numbers so we can be creative in our decisions.

1127
01:32:52,414 --> 01:33:00,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, making a decision behind this reel, at nights that, no, I don't sleep, because you have to make these decisions.

1128
01:33:00,938 --> 01:33:01,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not easy.

1129
01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:04,460
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not easy, just like it's not easy for you guys.

1130
01:33:06,047 --> 01:33:12,691
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know when I put my head down that we've already put out $2 million for a police station that's needed.

1131
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:15,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know we can move forward with that project.

1132
01:33:17,293 --> 01:33:19,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can make bold statements by moving forward.

1133
01:33:20,055 --> 01:33:20,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm willing to do that.

1134
01:33:22,116 --> 01:33:24,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I offended anybody, I apologize.

1135
01:33:25,518 --> 01:33:26,738
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's George Scott Pelley.

1136
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:28,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how I'm going to work.

1137
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how I'm going to push forward.

1138
01:33:31,161 --> 01:33:32,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1139
01:33:32,542 --> 01:33:33,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

1140
01:33:33,836 --> 01:33:35,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll yield to Mr. Buck.

1141
01:33:35,257 --> 01:33:35,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.

1142
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:43,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't disagree with you that debt exclusion might be the only way to get a combined station done.

1143
01:33:45,084 --> 01:33:54,370
[SPEAKER_09]: But as I said last week, allocate money, hire an architect for the training tower right now, next week.

1144
01:33:56,211 --> 01:34:02,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a vote between the council to even go forward with debt exclusion, which is what you need to even leave this city.

1145
01:34:03,206 --> 01:34:05,328
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can say all you want about debt exclusion.

1146
01:34:05,728 --> 01:34:08,230
[SPEAKER_09]: If it doesn't leave this room, we're screwed.

1147
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:09,952
[SPEAKER_09]: We get nothing.

1148
01:34:10,772 --> 01:34:15,076
[SPEAKER_09]: So as passionate as you are, which is great, if we don't get that, we get nothing.

1149
01:34:15,896 --> 01:34:17,658
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not worth talking about unless it's a vote.

1150
01:34:18,038 --> 01:34:19,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So you want to make a bold statement?

1151
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't vote this week on that $1 million.

1152
01:34:25,424 --> 01:34:31,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait till the money's allocated for the tower and the architect is hired and the vote for a debt exclusion between the council is taken.

1153
01:34:32,838 --> 01:34:33,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a bold statement.

1154
01:34:34,539 --> 01:34:37,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I want exactly what the mayor wants, what she wrote last year.

1155
01:34:37,981 --> 01:34:39,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I want more than words.

1156
01:34:39,562 --> 01:34:40,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I want action.

1157
01:34:40,622 --> 01:34:41,303
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want.

1158
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:42,704
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where we agree.

1159
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:50,748
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing we agree on.

1160
01:34:50,868 --> 01:34:52,369
[SPEAKER_08]: We agree, Mr. Buckley, because you know what?

1161
01:34:52,749 --> 01:34:53,690
[SPEAKER_08]: We both want action.

1162
01:34:54,469 --> 01:35:01,524
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you see over and over again, for 30 years being on the other side of that rail and now being behind this rail, you have to make decisions.

1163
01:35:01,544 --> 01:35:04,630
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to try to be bold about what you're going to do to make these things happen.

1164
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:18,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and I agree, we need these, we need, our councils stand together with this, but I'm telling you, from what I've seen and what I've heard and what we've done, because this isn't, like I said, we didn't bring it up and go to sleep in 45 days.

1165
01:35:18,816 --> 01:35:19,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done my homework.

1166
01:35:19,617 --> 01:35:20,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone out and knocked on doors.

1167
01:35:20,997 --> 01:35:33,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen other facilities and other organizations, and I'm telling you, the way I feel my decision that I have to be, that I have to be secure in is that, that I've done my homework and understand to move things forward, this is what we need to do.

1168
01:35:34,264 --> 01:35:35,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's not popular,

1169
01:35:35,603 --> 01:35:39,066
[SPEAKER_08]: tonight, but I think this is the way I feel secure and going.

1170
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:44,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert Jones, 5 St.

1171
01:35:44,932 --> 01:35:45,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary Street.

1172
01:35:45,472 --> 01:35:49,596
[SPEAKER_07]: George, Councilor Scott Pelley, again, I thank you for your leadership.

1173
01:35:50,777 --> 01:35:54,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It was what you did to ask for these debt exclusion numbers.

1174
01:35:55,822 --> 01:36:00,767
[SPEAKER_07]: A dual facility would cost 32 cents a day, the average taxpayer in the city of Medford.

1175
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a roadmap, there is still a roadmap to get this done, to get all the projects done, as you spoke about.

1176
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:13,642
[SPEAKER_07]: However, in the room tonight, you didn't have the support of the fellow councilors to do that.

1177
01:36:14,203 --> 01:36:19,146
[SPEAKER_07]: In the room last week, you didn't have the mayor's support to do that, okay?

1178
01:36:20,106 --> 01:36:22,828
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a roadmap, there is a path to success.

1179
01:36:23,668 --> 01:36:27,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether or not you wanna take it is up to your votes, okay?

1180
01:36:28,451 --> 01:36:29,152
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be done.

1181
01:36:30,434 --> 01:36:31,714
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit more on the debt exclusion.

1182
01:36:33,095 --> 01:36:39,796
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to go up to the full levy of 102.5 on the prior year's budget before you can get a debt exclusion in there.

1183
01:36:41,776 --> 01:36:43,797
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't go up there, we go close to that.

1184
01:36:44,237 --> 01:36:53,779
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we do go for that, the debt exclusion, we will have to go to the full 2.5% levy and then add back the debt exclusion.

1185
01:36:56,099 --> 01:36:56,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your leadership.

1186
01:36:59,769 --> 01:37:01,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1187
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:05,693
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very frustrating issue, without a doubt.

1188
01:37:08,254 --> 01:37:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: When we offered this resolution back a couple of months ago, I think it was a smart thing to do.

1189
01:37:13,938 --> 01:37:24,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Tap the brakes, hit pause, let's take a look at all of our spending with regard to the library, the police station, the fire station, the potential build-outs of the high school.

1190
01:37:25,746 --> 01:37:29,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And during that time or since then, we met numerous times.

1191
01:37:30,614 --> 01:37:38,478
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I look at this, I think we're at a point where we do have to make bold decisions.

1192
01:37:39,478 --> 01:37:40,759
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not easy decisions to make.

1193
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:44,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know I want a fire station just as much as anyone.

1194
01:37:45,201 --> 01:37:45,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all do.

1195
01:37:46,602 --> 01:37:47,843
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want a police station.

1196
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:48,763
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want a fire station.

1197
01:37:48,803 --> 01:37:50,004
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want new facilities.

1198
01:37:51,925 --> 01:37:52,925
[SPEAKER_05]: These issues aren't new.

1199
01:37:54,366 --> 01:37:58,728
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think many times, bold decisions need to be taken, and they need to be made.

1200
01:37:59,602 --> 01:38:07,704
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you take a look at a debt exclusion, you know, that might not be a popular idea, but when you look at it, it's something that's available in the toolkit, you know?

1201
01:38:08,004 --> 01:38:09,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that, you know, we need to look at.

1202
01:38:12,686 --> 01:38:16,346
[SPEAKER_05]: We need new state-of-the-art facilities, without a doubt.

1203
01:38:17,567 --> 01:38:19,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do we need a new police station?

1204
01:38:19,587 --> 01:38:20,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1205
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:21,208
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a fire station as well.

1206
01:38:21,248 --> 01:38:25,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We need all new fire stations, to tell you the truth, because they're all in really bad condition.

1207
01:38:26,689 --> 01:38:28,210
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need to start at some point.

1208
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,330
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to move forward.

1209
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:35,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, in my heart, I mean, I believe that, you know, that's something that we need to look at.

1210
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:37,091
[SPEAKER_05]: We do need to look at that exclusion.

1211
01:38:37,251 --> 01:38:40,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a popular answer, I'm sure, but it's something that we need to look at.

1212
01:38:41,732 --> 01:38:46,733
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and if it comes up to a vote, when it comes up to a vote and it fails, then we need to find another direction.

1213
01:38:48,093 --> 01:38:55,394
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what we need to continuously do, and I know what I will continuously do, I will continuously advocate for a training tower.

1214
01:38:55,674 --> 01:38:58,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I will continuously advocate for a new fire station

1215
01:39:00,347 --> 01:39:07,051
[SPEAKER_05]: improvements or additional, if we can build, we should really have a long-term plan to replace all of our freight stations.

1216
01:39:07,071 --> 01:39:09,553
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's really needed at the end of the day.

1217
01:39:09,573 --> 01:39:14,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have some very old buildings that have some very serious issues.

1218
01:39:15,637 --> 01:39:20,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, long-term planning, long-term capital planning needs to be done.

1219
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:24,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to, you know, just

1220
01:39:24,998 --> 01:39:26,199
[SPEAKER_05]: offer my opinion on this issue.

1221
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not an easy one.

1222
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand your frustration, Mr. Buckley.

1223
01:39:31,664 --> 01:39:33,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not in an easy position either.

1224
01:39:33,645 --> 01:39:37,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely understand that.

1225
01:39:37,108 --> 01:39:47,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate your words, Counselor, but if we're gonna make a long-term plan for fixing all our stations, we need to start with fixing at least one.

1226
01:39:47,965 --> 01:39:56,120
[SPEAKER_09]: And the one that we need to fix right now is headquarters, because it's attached to the police station, which seemed to be ruled inhabitable by the city.

1227
01:39:57,179 --> 01:40:02,622
[SPEAKER_09]: All we do is ask for equality and respect, equality to our peers and the police.

1228
01:40:03,302 --> 01:40:08,165
[SPEAKER_09]: If the police need a new building, the fire needs a new building, and the combined building is the way to go.

1229
01:40:08,565 --> 01:40:13,227
[SPEAKER_09]: We got talked out of it last year, and I was one of the guys that agreed on it, and the members didn't like it.

1230
01:40:13,247 --> 01:40:15,608
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew this day was coming.

1231
01:40:15,628 --> 01:40:16,109
[SPEAKER_09]: They were right.

1232
01:40:16,229 --> 01:40:18,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Every day they look at me and say, told you, told you.

1233
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:24,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm going to look at all you and say in two years when the high school comes and we get kicked down to 2032, told you, told you,

1234
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:33,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, name and address on the record, please.

1235
01:40:34,341 --> 01:40:35,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Cronin, 11 Winter Street.

1236
01:40:37,383 --> 01:40:38,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Counsel, you talked about mediocrity.

1237
01:40:40,185 --> 01:40:46,848
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get on the path with the police station that doesn't suit their needs, we're continuing down the path of mediocrity.

1238
01:40:47,469 --> 01:40:54,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're continuing with mediocrity for mediocrity training, or mediocre training for the police and fire, because we won't have the facilities that we need.

1239
01:40:55,653 --> 01:40:56,394
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say.

1240
01:41:01,937 --> 01:41:04,158
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Marks.

1241
01:41:04,979 --> 01:41:08,781
[SPEAKER_13]: To report the paper out.

1242
01:41:11,582 --> 01:41:13,223
[SPEAKER_13]: You read the paper.

1243
01:41:13,243 --> 01:41:15,504
[SPEAKER_13]: You took the paper out.

1244
01:41:15,524 --> 01:41:21,107
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a motion on the floor.

1245
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:27,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Dela Russo.

1246
01:41:28,651 --> 01:41:31,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Move that we adopt the committee report

1247
01:41:32,452 --> 01:41:33,933
[SPEAKER_14]: and approve the expenditure of funds.

1248
01:41:34,793 --> 01:41:37,354
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Galarruso, seconded by?

1249
01:41:39,435 --> 01:41:40,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1250
01:41:40,795 --> 01:41:41,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1251
01:41:41,915 --> 01:41:44,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, before you call the roll, Councilor Mox.

1252
01:41:46,697 --> 01:41:47,618
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1253
01:41:48,118 --> 01:41:59,782
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think we're at such a unique opportunity now where we have some leverage and able to negotiate this as a separate body

1254
01:42:01,058 --> 01:42:04,140
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they create separate bodies for a reason, as a check and balance.

1255
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:05,901
[SPEAKER_17]: We're a separate body.

1256
01:42:07,202 --> 01:42:13,186
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't receive marching orders, or at least some of us don't receive marching orders from the administration.

1257
01:42:15,948 --> 01:42:21,612
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we have the perfect opportunity now to sit back and revisit this.

1258
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:26,796
[SPEAKER_17]: We're under no obligation, Mr. President, to move forward.

1259
01:42:28,056 --> 01:42:30,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's been a lot of great ideas bantered around,

1260
01:42:30,972 --> 01:42:35,754
[SPEAKER_17]: But personally, I don't think it's very bold raising everyone's taxes.

1261
01:42:37,395 --> 01:42:40,437
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that's a bold, creative idea, to be honest with you.

1262
01:42:40,737 --> 01:42:41,717
[SPEAKER_17]: My own personal opinion.

1263
01:42:43,638 --> 01:42:45,119
[SPEAKER_17]: It's easy to raise people's taxes.

1264
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:52,423
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think we have to get more creative and hold people accountable to their words.

1265
01:42:53,163 --> 01:42:58,786
[SPEAKER_17]: When the mayor stands up during election time and say, when we build a new library, we're not only going to get 13 or 12.5 million,

1266
01:43:01,163 --> 01:43:05,964
[SPEAKER_17]: in a library fund grant through the state.

1267
01:43:06,424 --> 01:43:10,485
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also going to find 12 to 13 million in private funds.

1268
01:43:11,265 --> 01:43:17,246
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to hold the mayor's feet to the fire and say, Madam Mayor, where are these private funds?

1269
01:43:17,266 --> 01:43:18,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Because guess what?

1270
01:43:18,287 --> 01:43:21,547
[SPEAKER_17]: When they come through, we won't be having these discussions.

1271
01:43:23,128 --> 01:43:24,768
[SPEAKER_17]: We will not be having these discussions.

1272
01:43:25,967 --> 01:43:29,969
[SPEAKER_17]: But now we're hearing, after we approve the library, well, we've got to set up this committee.

1273
01:43:30,069 --> 01:43:30,929
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to take longer.

1274
01:43:31,169 --> 01:43:32,470
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't approach anyone yet.

1275
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:39,093
[SPEAKER_17]: And the mayor, over a year ago, said that she had some donors lined up, Mr. President.

1276
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:42,654
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a tape on it, something about a rich uncle.

1277
01:43:43,474 --> 01:43:44,655
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what she said at the debate.

1278
01:43:46,892 --> 01:43:48,573
[SPEAKER_17]: So there had to be some consideration.

1279
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:52,235
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't just throw out a figure as the chief executive officer.

1280
01:43:52,815 --> 01:43:58,218
[SPEAKER_17]: It'd be irresponsible to say, I believe I can raise 13, 13 million is a ton of money.

1281
01:43:58,558 --> 01:44:01,820
[SPEAKER_17]: And if someone came to me and said, can you raise 13 million through private funding?

1282
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,582
[SPEAKER_17]: I would take a step back before I made a commitment.

1283
01:44:05,162 --> 01:44:09,304
[SPEAKER_17]: So the mayor has to be privy to more than she's letting out there, Mr. President.

1284
01:44:09,745 --> 01:44:15,508
[SPEAKER_17]: And if that's the case, all this discussion is in vain because we can afford to move forward.

1285
01:44:16,832 --> 01:44:20,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why we need to keep these dialogue and discussions going on.

1286
01:44:21,353 --> 01:44:27,975
[SPEAKER_17]: And once we sever this relationship, and that's what's going to happen, once we stop meeting, I disagree with my colleague.

1287
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:35,838
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think meeting after meeting, and I've been doing this a long time, it may not seem productive, but as long as you're together discussing it, it's productive.

1288
01:44:36,518 --> 01:44:39,979
[SPEAKER_17]: And even if we're at the meeting, we feel nothing happened, we're together.

1289
01:44:40,439 --> 01:44:43,640
[SPEAKER_17]: For too many years, Mr. President, we went without meeting.

1290
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,361
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it was the laugh of the city,

1291
01:44:47,191 --> 01:44:53,275
[SPEAKER_17]: for 14, 15 years that the mayor, the former mayor never appeared before the city council ever for one issue.

1292
01:44:55,576 --> 01:44:57,837
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not the way I perceive city government working.

1293
01:44:58,418 --> 01:45:03,100
[SPEAKER_17]: So the fact that we're meeting with the mayor and the mayor agreed to do so, I think is productive.

1294
01:45:05,742 --> 01:45:08,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Does it get contentious because we have different ideas?

1295
01:45:08,143 --> 01:45:09,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, but that's healthy.

1296
01:45:10,024 --> 01:45:11,305
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't all have the same idea.

1297
01:45:12,519 --> 01:45:14,280
[SPEAKER_17]: And we haven't explored that exclusion.

1298
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:19,523
[SPEAKER_17]: We got some feedback, and the feedback we got looked positive, but we haven't explored it.

1299
01:45:20,183 --> 01:45:24,045
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think anyone behind this railing could say we really explored it, Mr. President.

1300
01:45:25,326 --> 01:45:30,188
[SPEAKER_17]: And we talked about polling residents to see if there'd be some support out there.

1301
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:31,889
[SPEAKER_17]: We talked about a number of things.

1302
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:35,971
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with the firefighter that got up, Mr. Flynn.

1303
01:45:36,472 --> 01:45:40,434
[SPEAKER_17]: He mentioned that, you know, we made a commitment to go out and view all the fire stations.

1304
01:45:42,132 --> 01:45:42,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Where is that commitment?

1305
01:45:45,193 --> 01:45:50,834
[SPEAKER_17]: It's more talk, and that's why you can see how people say, you know what, all they're doing is, they're only hot air.

1306
01:45:52,274 --> 01:45:58,475
[SPEAKER_17]: If we were concerned about going to each fire station, we should have made that commitment, Mr. President, and followed through with it.

1307
01:45:59,955 --> 01:46:00,555
[SPEAKER_17]: And we haven't.

1308
01:46:02,436 --> 01:46:07,236
[SPEAKER_17]: We heard Brian Cronin, he's presented information before this council about cancer rates.

1309
01:46:09,077 --> 01:46:10,897
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know we had the Board of Health Director out there,

1310
01:46:11,848 --> 01:46:39,196
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm not that confident that whatever was done by the Board of Health is going to make sure that the brave men and women of the fire department don't have to eat their dinner within five feet of an apparatus that they could be catching cancer off of, or sleeping in a facility that fumes go up to the second floor, or putting their turnout gear or regular gear next to trucks that are pulling in and out of a garage.

1311
01:46:40,843 --> 01:46:42,225
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are the discussions.

1312
01:46:42,465 --> 01:46:45,468
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not merely simply about building a building.

1313
01:46:46,369 --> 01:46:47,511
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about life or death.

1314
01:46:48,492 --> 01:46:49,072
[SPEAKER_17]: It really is.

1315
01:46:50,374 --> 01:46:56,921
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think we can turn a cheek when they present cancer rates and show the cancer rates in this community.

1316
01:46:58,062 --> 01:46:59,164
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not looking at other communities.

1317
01:46:59,184 --> 01:47:00,365
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking at this community.

1318
01:47:01,059 --> 01:47:10,142
[SPEAKER_17]: and draw a direct correlation between our old, outdated stations and how they build new stations and keep the men and women safe in new stations now.

1319
01:47:10,542 --> 01:47:15,003
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why this council fought for dryers to clean the turnout gear.

1320
01:47:15,043 --> 01:47:19,544
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why they fought for a second pair of turnout gear and washers, Mr. President.

1321
01:47:21,065 --> 01:47:22,245
[SPEAKER_17]: All for safety issues.

1322
01:47:23,425 --> 01:47:24,486
[SPEAKER_17]: These aren't aesthetics.

1323
01:47:25,686 --> 01:47:29,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, they're not looking for a new kitchen with marble countertops.

1324
01:47:31,158 --> 01:47:35,400
[SPEAKER_17]: They're looking to be safe in a building that they're in seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

1325
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:37,501
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that's asking a lot.

1326
01:47:37,881 --> 01:47:39,482
[SPEAKER_17]: And now's the time to do it.

1327
01:47:40,462 --> 01:47:44,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, before we take the vote, I ask my colleagues, just take a step back.

1328
01:47:45,865 --> 01:47:48,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's continue our dialogue and discussion.

1329
01:47:48,606 --> 01:47:50,307
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't stop anything.

1330
01:47:51,107 --> 01:47:52,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, will the police station take a little longer?

1331
01:47:53,308 --> 01:47:53,869
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

1332
01:47:54,109 --> 01:47:54,729
[SPEAKER_17]: But guess what?

1333
01:47:55,389 --> 01:47:56,450
[SPEAKER_17]: So's the fire station.

1334
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:01,021
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're not talking a little longer, we're talking years.

1335
01:48:03,562 --> 01:48:06,223
[SPEAKER_17]: So I respectfully ask my colleagues, this is not easy.

1336
01:48:06,483 --> 01:48:08,703
[SPEAKER_17]: No one behind this reel, the firefighters, no.

1337
01:48:08,723 --> 01:48:11,844
[SPEAKER_17]: No one behind this reel is against firefighters.

1338
01:48:11,864 --> 01:48:14,044
[SPEAKER_17]: They know that, the police know that, believe me.

1339
01:48:15,665 --> 01:48:17,005
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a mutual respect here.

1340
01:48:17,645 --> 01:48:18,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's just take another step.

1341
01:48:19,605 --> 01:48:20,846
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's just take one more step.

1342
01:48:21,166 --> 01:48:27,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's look at this and let's continue to be at the table so we can have discussions.

1343
01:48:27,487 --> 01:48:31,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Because once this issue is voted on, the discussions are going to end.

1344
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:32,550
[SPEAKER_17]: That's no secret.

1345
01:48:33,611 --> 01:48:35,953
[SPEAKER_17]: They only started up because we requested.

1346
01:48:36,753 --> 01:48:40,155
[SPEAKER_17]: The Board of Health only went down there and did stuff because the council requested.

1347
01:48:40,796 --> 01:48:45,259
[SPEAKER_17]: There's only a new police station because we went and did the walk of shame, Mr. President.

1348
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:47,160
[SPEAKER_17]: We were on the council at the time.

1349
01:48:48,221 --> 01:48:50,082
[SPEAKER_17]: We did the walk of shame through the police station.

1350
01:48:50,522 --> 01:48:51,963
[SPEAKER_17]: There's only a new DPW yard.

1351
01:48:52,243 --> 01:48:54,525
[SPEAKER_17]: We did the walk of shame through the DPW yard.

1352
01:48:54,805 --> 01:48:56,286
[SPEAKER_17]: It showed the conditions of that building.

1353
01:48:57,817 --> 01:48:59,618
[SPEAKER_17]: and alerted the residents of this community.

1354
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:02,439
[SPEAKER_17]: This building is no different.

1355
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,520
[SPEAKER_17]: It's no different, Mr. President.

1356
01:49:05,941 --> 01:49:09,902
[SPEAKER_17]: I respectfully ask one of my colleagues to reconsider their vote, Mr. President.

1357
01:49:10,643 --> 01:49:11,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1358
01:49:14,044 --> 01:49:15,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President DelaRusso?

1359
01:49:15,365 --> 01:49:15,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1360
01:49:16,185 --> 01:49:16,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falcone?

1361
01:49:16,765 --> 01:49:16,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1362
01:49:17,726 --> 01:49:18,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Night?

1363
01:49:18,406 --> 01:49:18,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1364
01:49:19,166 --> 01:49:19,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Laura Curran?

1365
01:49:19,867 --> 01:49:19,907
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1366
01:49:20,868 --> 01:49:21,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks?

1367
01:49:22,028 --> 01:49:22,168
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1368
01:49:22,769 --> 01:49:23,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1369
01:49:23,689 --> 01:49:23,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1370
01:49:24,409 --> 01:49:25,149
[SPEAKER_15]: President Caviello?

1371
01:49:25,349 --> 01:49:25,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1372
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:28,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1373
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:29,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1374
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:29,771
18.446.

1375
01:49:31,771 --> 01:49:36,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Mr. President, city councilors.

1376
01:49:38,813 --> 01:49:39,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Del Rosso?

1377
01:49:39,633 --> 01:49:48,276
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you want to read this into the record, but I move that this is tabled so we can have a detailed discussion

1378
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:52,376
[SPEAKER_14]: in committee of the whole tomorrow as you have scheduled, Mr. President.

1379
01:49:53,436 --> 01:50:04,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, we do have someone who would like to speak briefly on an issue of timing that you may be serving.

1380
01:50:04,929 --> 01:50:07,310
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1381
01:50:07,731 --> 01:50:12,193
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm here to speak on the resurfacing project for the Roberts Elementary School.

1382
01:50:12,373 --> 01:50:14,154
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the second item down on the list.

1383
01:50:15,295 --> 01:50:17,396
[SPEAKER_24]: We're very concerned about the timing of this project.

1384
01:50:17,896 --> 01:50:21,939
[SPEAKER_24]: School lets out on June 20th and school resumes on the last week of August.

1385
01:50:22,019 --> 01:50:25,200
[SPEAKER_24]: This project needs to be done during the school break.

1386
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:33,165
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to go out for bidding and then schedule the work during probably the busiest time of the year, so it's gonna be very hard for us to schedule one week

1387
01:50:33,738 --> 01:50:41,242
[SPEAKER_24]: could mean that the children have to wait an extra year for this project, so I'm hoping that perhaps an exception can be made and this project can be approved this evening.

1388
01:50:41,262 --> 01:50:46,664
[SPEAKER_24]: I can answer any questions that anyone has.

1389
01:50:48,605 --> 01:50:51,066
[SPEAKER_24]: We have photographs of the project as well.

1390
01:50:53,377 --> 01:50:53,838
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

1391
01:50:54,318 --> 01:50:55,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1392
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,823
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have a committee of the whole scheduled for tomorrow evening.

1393
01:50:57,843 --> 01:51:02,210
[SPEAKER_18]: We can report this paper out tomorrow evening if we feel comfortable with the presentations that are made that evening.

1394
01:51:02,931 --> 01:51:06,496
[SPEAKER_18]: I as one councilor do not support taking just one item out of this.

1395
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:16,743
[SPEAKER_18]: I, as one councilor, would support the measure provided that we have a presentation tomorrow in its entirety over the paper that's before us.

1396
01:51:17,863 --> 01:51:19,184
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see a timing issue in this.

1397
01:51:19,224 --> 01:51:24,405
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there are also concerns and questions about who's going to manage this money, how they're going to be sure these benchmarks are made, so on and so forth.

1398
01:51:24,445 --> 01:51:26,926
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to hear that from the parties that pick one.

1399
01:51:28,366 --> 01:51:29,227
[SPEAKER_24]: I am the-.

1400
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:29,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Del Rosso.

1401
01:51:29,907 --> 01:51:34,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I think we should wait and discuss this in committee of the whole.

1402
01:51:34,828 --> 01:51:36,569
[SPEAKER_14]: We've set principles behind this rail.

1403
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:50,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Even just tonight, an hour and a half ago, we delayed and chose not to vote on two outstanding citizens to be replaced on a board.

1404
01:51:50,706 --> 01:52:02,371
[SPEAKER_14]: They had been thoroughly vetted, not only by the general public, but by their peers and by this body before, yet we're making them wait a week to be approved.

1405
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:19,456
[SPEAKER_14]: The people who work for the city are required, once they've negotiated their salaries through the union process, ordinance change is required to expend on those salary increases.

1406
01:52:20,056 --> 01:52:24,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Year after year, we make them wait nearly two months

1407
01:52:25,225 --> 01:52:30,229
[SPEAKER_14]: to get their raises, thus raising their taxes on their retro pay, Mr. President.

1408
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:41,657
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're going to go through those lengths, with all due respect for this expenditure, I think it should stand the test of process, Mr. President.

1409
01:52:41,697 --> 01:52:43,719
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, Mr. President, if I could.

1410
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Counsel Max.

1411
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:46,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1412
01:52:47,101 --> 01:52:49,303
[SPEAKER_17]: The way the process, as far as I know, is outlined,

1413
01:52:49,824 --> 01:52:56,326
[SPEAKER_17]: is that once the Community Preservation Committee makes recommendations, it appears before the Medford City Council.

1414
01:52:56,886 --> 01:53:00,747
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't want anyone at home to believe that we're circumventing anything.

1415
01:53:01,207 --> 01:53:04,948
[SPEAKER_17]: I do agree with setting up a Committee of the Whole, as you did, Mr. President.

1416
01:53:05,748 --> 01:53:08,209
[SPEAKER_17]: However, there are extenuating circumstances.

1417
01:53:08,809 --> 01:53:18,192
[SPEAKER_17]: And as my colleague, Councilor De La Russa, would know, there's been many times that my colleague has approved, when the administration comes up and say, we were just presented with this,

1418
01:53:18,556 --> 01:53:27,378
[SPEAKER_17]: we need a vote tonight, you know, and not able to move it to a subcommittee or committee of the whole, that that vote is taken because of extenuating circumstances.

1419
01:53:27,878 --> 01:53:29,039
[SPEAKER_17]: And this happens to be one.

1420
01:53:29,419 --> 01:53:45,363
[SPEAKER_17]: This issue, and I won't speak for the two women at the podium, but this issue has been presented not only to this council, but this community for several years now, actually, about refurbishing around the Roberts Elementary School playground.

1421
01:53:45,863 --> 01:53:47,323
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is in vital need.

1422
01:53:47,957 --> 01:53:56,923
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd like to hear, because I'm under the impression that time is of the essence on this, and if it's a week delay, that could alter things, Mr. President.

1423
01:53:57,343 --> 01:54:01,666
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would be willing to support this tonight, Mr. President, as an extenuating circumstance.

1424
01:54:04,508 --> 01:54:08,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn Street, and also a member of the Meffitt School Committee.

1425
01:54:10,152 --> 01:54:14,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here because Cheryl brought this forward through CPA funding.

1426
01:54:14,648 --> 01:54:19,811
[SPEAKER_12]: It is on your agenda, so we're not asking for something, for you to vote on something that's not already on your agenda.

1427
01:54:20,172 --> 01:54:21,152
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on your agenda.

1428
01:54:21,432 --> 01:54:27,336
[SPEAKER_12]: The information, this program was approved by CPA funds and is coming before you tomorrow.

1429
01:54:28,417 --> 01:54:36,102
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're coming to you as a group packet, and we didn't know that this item was going to be tabled until your committee of the whole.

1430
01:54:36,442 --> 01:54:43,787
[SPEAKER_12]: So I respectfully ask you to vote on this one issue while you have the applicant in front of you can answer any questions.

1431
01:54:44,951 --> 01:54:51,356
[SPEAKER_12]: All of this is gonna be managed through the administration at Meffitt High School and the Building and Grounds Department.

1432
01:54:51,756 --> 01:55:01,184
[SPEAKER_12]: If bids need to be made, they need to go out, so the timing for those has to be appropriated as well as, you know, that's gonna slow down our process.

1433
01:55:01,384 --> 01:55:07,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Our goal here is to make sure that it's safe for our children to return to that playground day one in September.

1434
01:55:08,370 --> 01:55:10,392
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's our only goal for asking you

1435
01:55:10,741 --> 01:55:13,682
[SPEAKER_12]: to move forward with your agenda item that you have before you.

1436
01:55:13,963 --> 01:55:21,126
[SPEAKER_12]: And any information I can help with or the applicant can help with, Cheryl Rodriguez, we're here to answer any and all questions.

1437
01:55:21,566 --> 01:55:23,687
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just ask for your consideration for this.

1438
01:55:24,348 --> 01:55:30,831
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want to interject that this board council has already approved an off-cycle application.

1439
01:55:30,871 --> 01:55:32,511
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not an off-cycle application.

1440
01:55:32,692 --> 01:55:36,273
[SPEAKER_24]: I submitted the application on January 5th, the initial application.

1441
01:55:36,313 --> 01:55:39,695
[SPEAKER_24]: Then I submitted the full application the first week of March.

1442
01:55:40,202 --> 01:55:44,263
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been to several meetings for the CPA and presented this project.

1443
01:55:44,303 --> 01:55:47,043
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been to meetings at the school committee to present this project.

1444
01:55:47,463 --> 01:55:51,904
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been to subcommittee meetings of the school committee to submit this project.

1445
01:55:52,404 --> 01:55:58,265
[SPEAKER_24]: I prepared the 65-page application for this project, collected signatures and support for this project.

1446
01:55:58,645 --> 01:56:02,806
[SPEAKER_24]: So I am more than capable of answering any questions that you have on this project.

1447
01:56:03,386 --> 01:56:08,787
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that I'm more than happy to come tomorrow if you have additional questions and answer it again.

1448
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:23,665
[SPEAKER_24]: but this project is very time sensitive, and to tell these children that they could possibly have to wait an additional year for the largest elementary school in the city with the English language learner program, the autism program, this would break a lot of hearts.

1449
01:56:24,085 --> 01:56:25,626
[SPEAKER_24]: So please, I ask you to consider us.

1450
01:56:25,966 --> 01:56:28,167
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion on the floor by Councilor Knight to table this.

1451
01:56:28,207 --> 01:56:29,867
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

1452
01:56:31,148 --> 01:56:31,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

1453
01:56:33,709 --> 01:56:39,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because you mentioned the timing, and I understand the bid process does

1454
01:56:40,375 --> 01:56:40,795
[SPEAKER_05]: take time.

1455
01:56:43,016 --> 01:56:48,599
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's the, do you know as far as like when they, someone's awarded the bid, someone starts the work.

1456
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:51,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know, have you done any research as to how long this will take?

1457
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:58,023
[SPEAKER_24]: I've gotten conflicting answers on this, but I'm told that until the money is approved by this council, they won't prepare the bid.

1458
01:56:58,483 --> 01:57:00,304
[SPEAKER_24]: I spoke to Cassandra in engineering today.

1459
01:57:00,364 --> 01:57:06,607
[SPEAKER_24]: She said it could take 45 days for the bid and that has to be advertised for two weeks, I was told by the procurement office.

1460
01:57:07,267 --> 01:57:09,088
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're really pushing up against it.

1461
01:57:09,588 --> 01:57:16,452
[SPEAKER_24]: And just getting in the schedules of these people once we do go through that process could really push us up to the end of the summer.

1462
01:57:16,772 --> 01:57:17,833
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean the actual work.

1463
01:57:17,893 --> 01:57:20,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So like when they would actually come in and like, you know.

1464
01:57:20,694 --> 01:57:24,056
[SPEAKER_24]: The actual work is projected to take between five and 10 days.

1465
01:57:24,116 --> 01:57:24,857
[SPEAKER_24]: Five and 10 days, okay.

1466
01:57:25,097 --> 01:57:30,400
[SPEAKER_24]: And we were asked to make our application smaller just because this is only for the surfacing.

1467
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:33,441
[SPEAKER_24]: There's not a bench or a flower in this application.

1468
01:57:33,962 --> 01:57:36,043
[SPEAKER_24]: So we actually need a landscaper to do removal.

1469
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:41,335
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we need a playground specialist to do the installation because we were told there's very limited funds.

1470
01:57:43,377 --> 01:57:44,278
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1471
01:57:45,499 --> 01:57:51,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I request that, um, uh, community preservation commission provide us with copies of the applications as well.

1472
01:57:54,548 --> 01:57:56,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's a motion on the council.

1473
01:57:56,169 --> 01:57:57,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Nate has a motion on the floor, the table.

1474
01:57:57,611 --> 01:58:00,874
[SPEAKER_13]: This been seconded by council Dolo Russo.

1475
01:58:01,835 --> 01:58:10,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Councillor Neill.

1476
01:58:10,279 --> 01:58:23,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Councillor Neill.

1477
01:58:34,652 --> 01:58:41,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight has made a motion to table this and has been seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1478
01:58:44,478 --> 01:58:45,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you withdraw?

1479
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:46,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1480
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm sorry, I apologize.

1481
01:58:50,882 --> 01:58:52,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't hear you say that.

1482
01:58:53,484 --> 01:58:54,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

1483
01:58:54,405 --> 01:58:58,147
[SPEAKER_05]: So if this did come to a vote tonight, and if the vote failed, when does it come up again?

1484
01:58:58,567 --> 01:58:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week.

1485
01:58:59,268 --> 01:58:59,488
[SPEAKER_05]: 90 days.

1486
01:58:59,508 --> 01:58:59,828
[SPEAKER_05]: 90 days?

1487
01:59:02,930 --> 01:59:04,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your clarification.

1488
01:59:05,057 --> 01:59:07,059
[SPEAKER_13]: And if that's all, I'm okay.

1489
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:09,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Carriello.

1490
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:17,506
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not taking part in this discussion because my children go to the Roberts, so even the appearance of a conflict of interest, I'm going to abstain from this.

1491
01:59:18,047 --> 01:59:19,368
[SPEAKER_13]: And my grandchildren go to that school also.

1492
01:59:19,388 --> 01:59:32,017
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Mr. President, would it be okay if we requested to vote on one portion of the paper?

1493
01:59:33,015 --> 01:59:37,681
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like a legal opinion on whether or not the 90-day rule would apply.

1494
01:59:38,341 --> 01:59:41,766
[SPEAKER_17]: We're only voting on one portion of the paper.

1495
01:59:41,786 --> 01:59:46,932
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't believe that would apply, Mr. President, to the five of the proposed items.

1496
01:59:47,693 --> 01:59:49,995
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not quite sure that does apply.

1497
01:59:51,128 --> 01:59:56,211
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk is saying we would have to sever this from the whole thing, from that paper.

1498
01:59:56,231 --> 02:00:01,835
[SPEAKER_17]: It's presented as a whole paper, so this would have to be severed.

1499
02:00:13,173 --> 02:00:20,679
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate what my colleagues say, and I appreciate the fact that we're meeting tomorrow.

1500
02:00:43,779 --> 02:00:47,983
[SPEAKER_17]: If maybe the petitioner could tell us some more around how will this affect your deadline?

1501
02:00:48,023 --> 02:00:49,204
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you mentioned there's a deadline.

1502
02:00:49,584 --> 02:00:51,445
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe if you could just clarify.

1503
02:00:56,069 --> 02:01:00,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we take any other one if we feel impelled, if it's an urgency?

1504
02:01:00,553 --> 02:01:02,454
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no petitioner here for any other project.

1505
02:01:03,775 --> 02:01:04,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure you could.

1506
02:01:04,856 --> 02:01:07,478
[SPEAKER_14]: These aren't subject to petitioners, Mr. President.

1507
02:01:07,538 --> 02:01:08,599
[SPEAKER_14]: It's to the city council.

1508
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:10,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1509
02:01:10,641 --> 02:01:12,222
[SPEAKER_17]: And we listen to residents when they come up.

1510
02:01:12,895 --> 02:01:21,422
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to separate this from the rest of the package so someone can make that motion.

1511
02:01:21,662 --> 02:01:23,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'd like to hear the sense of urgency.

1512
02:01:23,844 --> 02:01:26,146
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Cheryl did describe the sense of urgency.

1513
02:01:28,348 --> 02:01:30,209
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to hear a little more on that, Mr. President.

1514
02:01:34,873 --> 02:01:40,658
[SPEAKER_24]: We're concerned that the city is not going to move forward in preparing the bid until this money is allocated.

1515
02:01:41,425 --> 02:01:43,486
[SPEAKER_24]: We're talking about waiting until after Memorial Day.

1516
02:01:43,506 --> 02:01:45,688
[SPEAKER_24]: It'll be less than a month before school lets out.

1517
02:01:46,488 --> 02:01:52,812
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we do a 45-day bid, we're talking about sometime in July when the bid will end, and then we have to try to get on the schedule.

1518
02:01:52,852 --> 02:01:54,513
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll need to be on the schedule.

1519
02:01:54,793 --> 02:02:00,917
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll probably have about a 35-day window, less than that, actually, because we need to allocate 10 days to do the work.

1520
02:02:01,277 --> 02:02:07,381
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll have 25 days to get on the schedule of the chosen bid to do the project.

1521
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:09,883
[SPEAKER_24]: So seven days could be,

1522
02:02:11,133 --> 02:02:16,595
[SPEAKER_24]: the difference between doing it now and saying, do you have any time in July of 2019?

1523
02:02:19,296 --> 02:02:22,737
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's an entire year.

1524
02:02:23,277 --> 02:02:33,360
[SPEAKER_24]: Or the kids go back to school, and there's caution tape and construction vehicles, which would complement the construction on the corner of Court Street.

1525
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:37,001
[SPEAKER_24]: So we really don't want to disrupt the children's recess time.

1526
02:02:37,541 --> 02:02:39,082
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a very coveted time.

1527
02:02:40,392 --> 02:02:41,973
[SPEAKER_24]: well utilized in the area.

1528
02:02:42,093 --> 02:02:46,095
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the only playground that has, the school playground has lighting at night.

1529
02:02:46,135 --> 02:02:47,436
[SPEAKER_24]: The neighborhood children play there.

1530
02:02:47,456 --> 02:02:50,217
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll often see children there till 8 or 9 p.m.

1531
02:02:50,297 --> 02:02:52,078
[SPEAKER_24]: because it's a lit area.

1532
02:02:52,298 --> 02:02:54,859
[SPEAKER_24]: Hickey Park is down the street, but it's pitch dark.

1533
02:02:54,919 --> 02:02:57,241
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not able to be used by the neighbors at night.

1534
02:02:59,082 --> 02:03:02,483
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a difference between now, it could be a difference between now and a year.

1535
02:03:02,503 --> 02:03:09,527
[SPEAKER_17]: So Mr. President, just so I understand, approving it tonight,

1536
02:03:10,307 --> 02:03:15,570
[SPEAKER_17]: or waiting till tomorrow night, which may or may not be approved, who knows?

1537
02:03:15,610 --> 02:03:18,231
[SPEAKER_17]: We could leave it in Committee of the Whole, right?

1538
02:03:18,751 --> 02:03:19,531
[SPEAKER_17]: We could leave the paper.

1539
02:03:19,592 --> 02:03:23,253
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing that's forcing us to vote tomorrow night.

1540
02:03:24,374 --> 02:03:33,358
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure that if we did report it out tonight, what's the earliest, Mr. Clerk, that this paper could be before the administration?

1541
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:37,960
[SPEAKER_24]: It's already been signed by the mayor.

1542
02:03:38,821 --> 02:03:38,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1543
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:42,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the allocation has to be made.

1544
02:03:42,071 --> 02:03:42,871
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not made by us.

1545
02:03:43,472 --> 02:03:46,813
[SPEAKER_17]: So, someone from the administration does the allocation and so forth.

1546
02:03:47,514 --> 02:03:48,154
[SPEAKER_17]: I would assume, right?

1547
02:03:48,174 --> 02:03:49,295
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not the CPC committee.

1548
02:03:49,795 --> 02:03:51,436
[SPEAKER_17]: So, it's got to be someone from the administration.

1549
02:03:59,480 --> 02:03:59,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1550
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:02,241
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I'm asking how long does that roughly take?

1551
02:04:02,261 --> 02:04:04,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we splitting hairs here?

1552
02:04:06,168 --> 02:04:11,714
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just trying to figure out how long that process takes because that may be seven to ten day process.

1553
02:04:11,774 --> 02:04:15,499
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know because sometimes papers go different ways and so forth.

1554
02:04:30,609 --> 02:04:38,175
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that if there's controversy with papers tomorrow, that perhaps these papers will stay in committee for a week or two longer.

1555
02:04:38,275 --> 02:04:41,457
[SPEAKER_24]: We could be talking about June before this is approved?

1556
02:04:41,577 --> 02:04:42,919
[SPEAKER_17]: It's possible.

1557
02:04:43,799 --> 02:04:54,908
[SPEAKER_13]: When Roberta Cameron called me, I told her that we were meeting, that this was going to be tabled this evening, so we could have a council meeting to discuss everything on here.

1558
02:04:55,429 --> 02:05:00,073
[SPEAKER_24]: And will this be voted on as a whole tomorrow, or will there be possibility of parcelization?

1559
02:05:00,113 --> 02:05:02,615
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just trying to find out what's going to happen.

1560
02:05:02,835 --> 02:05:04,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, counsel.

1561
02:05:04,457 --> 02:05:10,241
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we're having the meeting, to have the presentation, so that we can determine what we want to fund and what we don't.

1562
02:05:10,682 --> 02:05:17,407
[SPEAKER_18]: I personally, as one counsel, wouldn't have any problem making a tentative report of the matters that we reported out favorably and the matters that we keep in committee.

1563
02:05:17,447 --> 02:05:20,470
[SPEAKER_18]: And that tentative report can go out to the powers that be, the purchasing department,

1564
02:05:21,124 --> 02:05:32,531
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, to get the bid ready and get the bid prepared, tomorrow night, as early as tomorrow night, we can make a committee report together and report out portions of this paper favorably and unfavorably with those recommendations to the administration.

1565
02:05:32,731 --> 02:05:35,032
[SPEAKER_18]: They can still move forward and begin to prepare the bids.

1566
02:05:35,412 --> 02:05:39,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Then once the money's released, I mean, all we're doing is releasing the funds.

1567
02:05:39,035 --> 02:05:39,795
[SPEAKER_18]: They have the money already.

1568
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:42,252
[SPEAKER_18]: So when they get their first bill, then they pay the bill.

1569
02:05:43,072 --> 02:05:59,965
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't think that us not appropriating the money, us appropriating the money absent the committee of the whole that's been scheduled for this absolute distinct purpose, especially in the age of transparency and openness that my council colleagues like to talk about so much, is appropriate.

1570
02:06:00,286 --> 02:06:02,427
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that moving forward, we can do this.

1571
02:06:02,467 --> 02:06:04,009
[SPEAKER_18]: We can put out a committee report tomorrow.

1572
02:06:04,029 --> 02:06:05,810
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a tentative committee report that we all support.

1573
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:08,041
[SPEAKER_18]: and get the powers that be to be aware of it.

1574
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:08,461
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?

1575
02:06:08,501 --> 02:06:09,721
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the tentative committee report.

1576
02:06:10,261 --> 02:06:11,001
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to send it out.

1577
02:06:11,061 --> 02:06:15,823
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be engrossed by the, it's going to be adopted by the council at the next council meeting.

1578
02:06:15,863 --> 02:06:18,884
[SPEAKER_18]: These people will know what's going on and they'll know tomorrow night or the day after.

1579
02:06:21,185 --> 02:06:21,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

1580
02:06:22,305 --> 02:06:23,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1581
02:06:23,245 --> 02:06:32,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So you talked about construction and so say if construction was delayed, is it going to be done in September?

1582
02:06:33,108 --> 02:06:35,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, or is it ideally you wouldn't want it done in September?

1583
02:06:36,147 --> 02:06:40,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is the school department saying, no, there's no way this is gonna happen when school starts?

1584
02:06:42,811 --> 02:06:45,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you discussed this during any of your meetings?

1585
02:06:47,133 --> 02:06:55,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Our hope was to have this process already be completed, so we were hoping to be up and running before any child came back onto that school yard.

1586
02:06:55,838 --> 02:07:01,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that we thought this CPA money was going at our last CPA meeting, which was,

1587
02:07:03,615 --> 02:07:14,980
[SPEAKER_12]: We thought it was gonna come before this board much sooner, so we hadn't had those discussions as to whether we would wait a whole year or we would try to do it around the school children.

1588
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:23,943
[SPEAKER_12]: That's gonna be very difficult, especially at that time of the year with outdoor recess and really giving children the opportunity to be outside.

1589
02:07:25,624 --> 02:07:30,626
[SPEAKER_12]: We've all known and we've toured many of the school playgrounds and that

1590
02:07:31,854 --> 02:07:52,686
[SPEAKER_12]: they're in, they've been patched, they've been, their lifetime has, this is a pilot program for all of our schools, and this issue has to be addressed for the safety of the children, and it's a community project as well, because there are so many children in that neighborhood that use it as their parking into the evenings for working parents as well.

1591
02:07:52,706 --> 02:07:55,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1592
02:07:56,408 --> 02:08:00,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Said when school's out and the summer's here, there will be a period of time where that

1593
02:08:02,103 --> 02:08:08,005
[SPEAKER_18]: school yard, which, as you said, has been used as a playground, will be inaccessible to the individuals in the neighborhood.

1594
02:08:08,205 --> 02:08:08,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Ten days.

1595
02:08:09,345 --> 02:08:12,006
[SPEAKER_18]: So there is a period of time that they will not be able to utilize.

1596
02:08:12,066 --> 02:08:19,788
[SPEAKER_24]: And the great thing about doing it in the summer is that it's light out till 8.30 at night, so they'll have a playground a couple of blocks away.

1597
02:08:19,828 --> 02:08:23,890
[SPEAKER_24]: If we wait until the fall, when it starts getting dark at 4.30, 5 o'clock, there'll be nothing.

1598
02:08:26,090 --> 02:08:30,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I definitely, as a former member of the school committee, I know that

1599
02:08:31,977 --> 02:08:33,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Playground is in tough condition.

1600
02:08:33,438 --> 02:08:35,939
[SPEAKER_05]: The flooring there is apparent.

1601
02:08:35,959 --> 02:08:39,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it many times, and I know it desperately needs to be replaced.

1602
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:46,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad that you went through this effort to actually get the funding, to request the funding.

1603
02:08:46,963 --> 02:08:50,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, with three kids that went through that school, I know that playground takes a beating.

1604
02:08:51,464 --> 02:08:57,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ground there is in a tough shape, so this desperately needs to be done.

1605
02:08:59,587 --> 02:09:13,215
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope, if nothing else, that I've expressed the urgency of this project so that if this paper gets bogged down tomorrow, perhaps you would consider not punishing 550 plus school children and letting this project move forward.

1606
02:09:13,235 --> 02:09:16,157
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think the intent was to punish anyone.

1607
02:09:16,177 --> 02:09:17,318
[SPEAKER_18]: This isn't a punishment at all.

1608
02:09:17,498 --> 02:09:26,163
[SPEAKER_18]: This is just a request for transparency and openness, considering that the council president has set an agenda for us, and that agenda includes a committee of the whole, and this appropriation, that's tomorrow.

1609
02:09:27,576 --> 02:09:35,164
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not an attempt to punish anybody, it's an attempt to make sure that we get the sufficient information to move forward.

1610
02:09:35,385 --> 02:09:39,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm offended that someone would suggest that we're punishing anybody.

1611
02:09:40,968 --> 02:09:53,615
[SPEAKER_24]: point of clarification, what I actually said was I hope that if this paper gets bogged down tomorrow with other issues, that it's not delayed and what will happen is the children will be punished.

1612
02:09:53,975 --> 02:10:02,199
[SPEAKER_24]: It's an unintended consequence, so that's just why we're here, to make sure that you're aware that that's a possibility, and we hope that you'll consider and think about that.

1613
02:10:02,875 --> 02:10:04,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I say it is scheduled for me.

1614
02:10:05,037 --> 02:10:06,799
[SPEAKER_13]: It was advertised tomorrow night.

1615
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:10,262
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if anybody from the public that will be there questioning this.

1616
02:10:11,103 --> 02:10:15,007
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's, um, yes, counselor.

1617
02:10:16,048 --> 02:10:16,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1618
02:10:17,229 --> 02:10:21,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I would support what council and I just brought up, uh, tomorrow we're meeting.

1619
02:10:22,194 --> 02:10:24,676
[SPEAKER_17]: I, as one member of the council, we'll be pushing.

1620
02:10:24,696 --> 02:10:26,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, there's a lot of items on here.

1621
02:10:26,679 --> 02:10:42,611
[SPEAKER_17]: But this will be one that I'll be pushing out of Committee of the Whole tomorrow, and I agree with his statement about if we're able to expedite this and let the administration know there's a sense of urgency, and if we can trim off a few days here and there, then we're splitting hairs.

1622
02:10:43,052 --> 02:10:47,935
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we're able to trim off a few days, whether we approve it tonight or tomorrow, I agree with Councilor Knight.

1623
02:10:47,995 --> 02:10:56,542
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would ask that this item go directly to the Committee of the Whole, and we'll relay our sense of urgency, as Councilor Knight mentioned.

1624
02:10:59,815 --> 02:11:06,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1625
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:12,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank you for hearing us this evening and even the consideration.

1626
02:11:13,042 --> 02:11:26,729
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to publicly thank Cheryl Rodriguez for all the time and effort, 65 page application, multiple meetings, at least 10 that I know of, and I've attended as many as I can to help be supportive.

1627
02:11:28,523 --> 02:11:37,029
[SPEAKER_12]: the school community is gonna really benefit because of all the work that she's done, and she should be commended for her work.

1628
02:11:37,549 --> 02:11:37,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1629
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:38,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1630
02:11:39,631 --> 02:11:42,533
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion by Councilor Knight to table the second by Councilor DelaRusso.

1631
02:11:42,573 --> 02:11:43,153
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1632
02:11:43,173 --> 02:11:43,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1633
02:11:45,034 --> 02:11:46,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Six in the affirmative, one abstention.

1634
02:11:48,977 --> 02:11:53,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk, offered by Councilor Knight.

1635
02:11:56,822 --> 02:11:57,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1636
02:12:01,818 --> 02:12:15,084
[SPEAKER_13]: being resolved that the council requests that the mayor and the council president meet to discuss the creation of an ad hoc committee on the implementation of the Method Square master plan.

1637
02:12:15,424 --> 02:12:21,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it further resolved that the ad hoc committee be comprised of members of the council administration in public.

1638
02:12:21,907 --> 02:12:22,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1639
02:12:23,748 --> 02:12:25,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1640
02:12:25,989 --> 02:12:26,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Very recent.

1641
02:12:27,153 --> 02:12:30,954
[SPEAKER_18]: weeks and years this council has taken advantage of the ad hoc committee.

1642
02:12:31,434 --> 02:12:39,076
[SPEAKER_18]: And Councilor Marks earlier this evening ironically had spoken a little bit about the amount of time that it's taken us to implement the master plan in Medford Square.

1643
02:12:40,197 --> 02:12:42,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we are, we have a master plan for Medford Square.

1644
02:12:42,577 --> 02:12:48,299
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had meetings, we have a focus group that's met and it's discussed some of the things that they'd like to see happen in Medford Square.

1645
02:12:49,489 --> 02:12:57,414
[SPEAKER_18]: We get a presentation from the Massachusetts Area Planning Council that discusses Medford Square and what direction this information and data has driven them.

1646
02:12:58,154 --> 02:12:59,875
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it goes quiet.

1647
02:13:00,536 --> 02:13:13,343
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that, Mr. President, one thing that we have all talked about in the past is trying to revitalize our downtown business districts by putting together an ad hoc committee that's made up of representatives of the administration, the council, and the general public.

1648
02:13:14,798 --> 02:13:21,644
[SPEAKER_18]: of getting people together at the table to move forward and try to implement something that we've been looking at for the better part of a decade and a half.

1649
02:13:22,644 --> 02:13:27,548
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, I think it's a rather self-explanatory resolution, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.

1650
02:13:28,329 --> 02:13:30,371
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

1651
02:13:30,391 --> 02:13:31,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1652
02:13:32,052 --> 02:13:33,774
[SPEAKER_13]: By Councilor Felcome and Councilor Scarpetti.

1653
02:13:33,814 --> 02:13:34,534
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1654
02:13:35,035 --> 02:13:35,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1655
02:13:35,555 --> 02:13:36,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1656
02:13:37,637 --> 02:13:40,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Offering by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council

1657
02:13:43,205 --> 02:13:54,393
[SPEAKER_13]: receive an update from the Massport Community Advisory Council on the status of RNAV?

1658
02:13:54,893 --> 02:14:00,917
[SPEAKER_18]: The airport navigation system, Mr. President, has been creating so much controversy in our community.

1659
02:14:01,037 --> 02:14:03,619
[SPEAKER_18]: But apparently, the good weather has finally come.

1660
02:14:04,419 --> 02:14:12,485
[SPEAKER_18]: And as such, many windows in neighborhoods are being opened, and fresh air is being blown in houses, as well as a lot of fresh noise from the airplanes.

1661
02:14:13,299 --> 02:14:21,587
[SPEAKER_18]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I'm requesting that we get a report back from our representatives from Mass Board as to what's going on with the RNAV situation.

1662
02:14:21,787 --> 02:14:31,596
[SPEAKER_18]: I am aware that Congressman Capuano has filed an amendment to the congressional budget that would address some of the RNAV concerns, and I'm hoping that we can be brought up to speed on that as well.

1663
02:14:33,377 --> 02:14:33,758
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1664
02:14:33,878 --> 02:14:35,799
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Night, seconded by

1665
02:14:37,886 --> 02:14:38,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1666
02:14:39,007 --> 02:14:39,747
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1667
02:14:40,287 --> 02:14:40,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1668
02:14:40,627 --> 02:14:41,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1669
02:14:41,887 --> 02:14:48,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Offered by Councilor Knight, Falco, Scarpelli, and Caraviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request— Mr. President, I withdraw my sponsorship.

1670
02:14:48,369 --> 02:14:49,249
[SPEAKER_18]: There's too many people on that.

1671
02:14:49,769 --> 02:14:50,030
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

1672
02:14:50,350 --> 02:14:51,250
[SPEAKER_18]: I withdraw my sponsorship.

1673
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:52,330
[SPEAKER_18]: There's too many people on that resolution.

1674
02:14:52,370 --> 02:14:52,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take my name off.

1675
02:14:55,811 --> 02:15:02,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the city solicitor provide a draft version of the debt exclusion referendum question

1676
02:15:03,457 --> 02:15:06,619
[SPEAKER_13]: for the construction of a new fire headquarters to the council.

1677
02:15:06,659 --> 02:15:07,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1678
02:15:08,181 --> 02:15:09,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1679
02:15:09,181 --> 02:15:17,167
[SPEAKER_18]: What I'm going to do is defer to Councilor Scott Pelli on this because he's taken such ownership of it earlier in his passionate plea to the membership of 1032.

1680
02:15:18,148 --> 02:15:25,894
[SPEAKER_18]: But ultimately this is an effort for us to further examine the debt exclusion option to maintain that our fire department remains on track and that the commitments that were made are kept.

1681
02:15:28,056 --> 02:15:28,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

1682
02:15:29,517 --> 02:15:30,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I want to thank the

1683
02:15:31,505 --> 02:15:37,092
[SPEAKER_08]: for ordaining me as the writer of this resolution.

1684
02:15:37,132 --> 02:15:39,395
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I think that, um...

1685
02:15:40,861 --> 02:15:55,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to think outside the box and being creative and finding different ways to have, we use the word transparency and it's so important that if we can do something to get the word out to our constituents and have their voices heard.

1686
02:15:56,426 --> 02:16:01,408
[SPEAKER_08]: And being the debt exclusion, a valid question.

1687
02:16:03,004 --> 02:16:09,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it's important that we get all the information that we need from our city solicitors so our writings are correct.

1688
02:16:09,928 --> 02:16:19,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I can also amend that, Mr. President, that if we can look at a timeline, if the city clerk can give us a timeline.

1689
02:16:21,394 --> 02:16:26,537
[SPEAKER_08]: If so, be that a valid question, what we need to do.

1690
02:16:28,397 --> 02:16:35,718
[SPEAKER_08]: step-by-step in making sure that if it does come to fruition, that we know when and how we have to do that.

1691
02:16:35,758 --> 02:16:36,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you.

1692
02:16:37,979 --> 02:16:38,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Del Rosso.

1693
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:48,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I know this is a touchy issue, and I am grateful for Councilor Scott Pelli to take, for taking such leadership on this matter.

1694
02:16:49,481 --> 02:16:53,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I have yet to make up my mind how I want to approach this.

1695
02:16:53,241 --> 02:16:56,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm grateful that Councilor Scott Pelli has done such

1696
02:16:56,633 --> 02:17:00,778
[SPEAKER_14]: extensive research on the matter and spoken to so many people in the community.

1697
02:17:01,999 --> 02:17:15,033
[SPEAKER_14]: On face value, it seems almost innocuous, but I think it's going to need further discussion, further conversation, and as one of the

1698
02:17:16,387 --> 02:17:22,849
[SPEAKER_14]: has pointed out that so much gets done when we do sit at the table and have meetings and talk about things.

1699
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:32,693
[SPEAKER_14]: So I look forward to that dialogue as we address this issue and hope I can educate myself and hear from more citizens.

1700
02:17:33,133 --> 02:17:39,996
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard from some, but as we're moving forward on this, that we hear from more citizens and make a wise decision.

1701
02:17:42,216 --> 02:17:43,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1702
02:17:47,638 --> 02:17:48,278
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion.

1703
02:17:53,663 --> 02:17:59,167
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councillor Layton.

1704
02:17:59,227 --> 02:17:59,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Layton.

1705
02:17:59,868 --> 02:18:02,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1706
02:18:02,149 --> 02:18:06,093
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an issue that's going to need a lot of community input and involvement.

1707
02:18:06,973 --> 02:18:16,321
[SPEAKER_18]: I certainly would be happy to commit to putting parameters on this before the matter is addressed to the City Council, before the matter is brought to the City Council floor, whether it's a series of public hearings, public meetings, or so forth.

1708
02:18:17,177 --> 02:18:21,601
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, I guess the request would be to get the solicitor to put this together.

1709
02:18:22,281 --> 02:18:23,743
[SPEAKER_18]: That doesn't mean that it's going to hit the agenda.

1710
02:18:23,763 --> 02:18:28,366
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just going to get a response from the solicitor and we'll have to reintroduce that if we're going to be moving forward.

1711
02:18:28,406 --> 02:18:36,773
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want that to be clear that this isn't an attempt for us to take this and put this on the ballot this evening, but what it is is an attempt for us to get the language that's appropriate from the city solicitor.

1712
02:18:36,813 --> 02:18:38,915
[SPEAKER_18]: So if it's something that we do want to move forward, we have

1713
02:18:39,902 --> 02:18:41,142
[SPEAKER_18]: the matter locked and loaded.

1714
02:18:41,302 --> 02:18:50,644
[SPEAKER_18]: But if it does make my colleagues more comfortable, and even if it doesn't, I think that what we need to do is have an open and transparent process where we go and, what do we like, the travel and road show, as they say.

1715
02:18:50,704 --> 02:18:56,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we have to go out to the community and go to a couple of places and talk about this and have some meetings and public hearings and gather public input.

1716
02:18:57,345 --> 02:19:03,226
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that my colleagues would support any effort to get out in the community and hear what people have to say about this matter.

1717
02:19:03,906 --> 02:19:08,227
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I just want to make that clear that this isn't something that I'm

1718
02:19:09,159 --> 02:19:19,705
[SPEAKER_18]: trying to bring to the floor the next time that the response comes back, but that this is something that we're going to have to use as a tool to go out into the community and to educate people before we bring this to the floor.

1719
02:19:21,366 --> 02:19:22,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

1720
02:19:22,186 --> 02:19:23,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1721
02:19:23,587 --> 02:19:29,930
[SPEAKER_05]: As I stated earlier, this is a bold decision, but it's a tool in the toolkit that we should take a look at.

1722
02:19:29,950 --> 02:19:31,331
[SPEAKER_05]: We should take a look at all of our options.

1723
02:19:31,391 --> 02:19:32,952
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a healthy exercise to go through.

1724
02:19:34,043 --> 02:19:38,546
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be good to actually see the wording from City Solicitor Romley.

1725
02:19:38,886 --> 02:19:44,950
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think one of the most important things is that we do have public meetings and get public input.

1726
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:48,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, educate the public as well.

1727
02:19:49,172 --> 02:19:52,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So the public fully knows what does this mean to them?

1728
02:19:52,594 --> 02:19:54,495
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the impact on them?

1729
02:19:55,296 --> 02:19:57,037
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it gonna mean to their tax bill?

1730
02:19:58,134 --> 02:20:07,882
[SPEAKER_05]: These are things that we need to look at, but I think in the interest of transparency and open government, we should have public meetings with regard to this issue.

1731
02:20:08,482 --> 02:20:14,607
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think education is key in educating the public as to what the impact is going to be on them.

1732
02:20:15,308 --> 02:20:16,008
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

1733
02:20:16,629 --> 02:20:17,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Member Kern.

1734
02:20:18,571 --> 02:20:19,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1735
02:20:20,673 --> 02:20:38,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think maybe the first thing we need to do is have a committee of the whole meeting and discuss everything that has been discussed tonight so that we can decide how, you know, get a game plan and figure out who's in favor, who's not, what questions everybody may have, and then get the language out of that committee.

1736
02:20:39,702 --> 02:20:44,605
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be more comfortable with that because I definitely have a lot more questions before I support it.

1737
02:20:45,125 --> 02:20:45,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks.

1738
02:20:46,866 --> 02:20:47,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1739
02:20:47,886 --> 02:20:48,226
[SPEAKER_17]: You know,

1740
02:20:49,735 --> 02:20:57,099
[SPEAKER_17]: This is such a huge issue in the community and would impact a majority of the taxpayers.

1741
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:15,870
[SPEAKER_17]: And to be quite honest with you, to bring it up under suspension, I don't think it's doing the whole transparency issue we hear about all the time any justice, because no one in the community is aware of us bringing this up now, other than the fact it was brought up under suspension.

1742
02:21:18,251 --> 02:21:23,252
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if... Councilor Scarpelli, point it out to me.

1743
02:21:23,432 --> 02:21:24,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

1744
02:21:24,132 --> 02:21:26,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that now thinking of that, you brought up a good point.

1745
02:21:27,173 --> 02:21:38,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So after, I'd like to just let you know, after you're done, Councilor Mox, I'd like to table it and bring it and put it in as a full resolution next meeting and make sure that people see that.

1746
02:21:38,456 --> 02:21:40,236
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for making that point.

1747
02:21:42,497 --> 02:21:44,117
[SPEAKER_08]: So you withdrawing the motion?

1748
02:21:44,477 --> 02:21:45,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's first.

1749
02:21:46,078 --> 02:21:46,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1750
02:21:46,258 --> 02:21:47,379
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could just finish my comments.

1751
02:21:47,399 --> 02:21:47,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1752
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:48,400
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all right.

1753
02:21:48,420 --> 02:21:48,940
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's all right.

1754
02:21:50,982 --> 02:21:57,527
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate you saying that because I think if we look at debt exclusion, there are a lot of needs in the community.

1755
02:21:58,307 --> 02:22:01,150
[SPEAKER_17]: And why should we limit it to just one issue?

1756
02:22:02,050 --> 02:22:04,792
[SPEAKER_17]: How many times do we hear about the roads in this community?

1757
02:22:05,593 --> 02:22:10,477
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're clearly not going to make any headway with how we do business through the operating budget.

1758
02:22:10,997 --> 02:22:13,379
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to have to get creative and get bold.

1759
02:22:14,113 --> 02:22:17,054
[SPEAKER_17]: and look at debt exclusion to repair our roads.

1760
02:22:17,815 --> 02:22:18,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, that's only one issue.

1761
02:22:19,615 --> 02:22:26,498
[SPEAKER_17]: I can go through a list of issues that probably need to be done and that we're not going to be able to do through the operating budget.

1762
02:22:27,078 --> 02:22:29,779
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a very slippery slope, Mr. President.

1763
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:36,642
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we hear from multimillion-dollar businessmen that don't have a problem raising taxes.

1764
02:22:37,603 --> 02:22:43,585
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have to remember that not everyone is a multimillion-dollar business owner in the community.

1765
02:22:44,419 --> 02:22:53,404
[SPEAKER_17]: And that the slightest increase, not only in taxes, but something outside of taxes, like the — let's take, for instance, Community Preservation Act.

1766
02:22:54,044 --> 02:22:56,205
[SPEAKER_17]: We heard, oh, it's only $45 a year, $50.

1767
02:22:56,365 --> 02:22:59,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Now we're hearing debt exclusion, oh, it might be $65, $70, $80.

1768
02:23:00,127 --> 02:23:01,508
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know, $45.

1769
02:23:02,368 --> 02:23:03,869
[SPEAKER_17]: That all adds up, Mr. President.

1770
02:23:04,529 --> 02:23:08,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And in addition, everything else is going up — your cable bill, your electric bill.

1771
02:23:09,252 --> 02:23:11,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything else is going up, Mr. President, at the same time.

1772
02:23:11,653 --> 02:23:13,434
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we have to be mindful

1773
02:23:13,932 --> 02:23:16,152
[SPEAKER_17]: when we want to get bold with the people's money.

1774
02:23:16,933 --> 02:23:18,893
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's great to get bold with someone else's money.

1775
02:23:19,133 --> 02:23:24,614
[SPEAKER_17]: That's, you know, let's get, let's get, let's think outside the box and charge everyone more taxes.

1776
02:23:25,314 --> 02:23:26,574
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not that creative to me.

1777
02:23:27,034 --> 02:23:29,875
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not, that's, that's not that creative to me, Mr. President.

1778
02:23:31,655 --> 02:23:33,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that too.

1779
02:23:33,195 --> 02:23:42,137
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, the debt exclusion is for this council to get the word out so the people can speak and maybe they can help us with their vision and their word.

1780
02:23:42,197 --> 02:23:42,897
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not,

1781
02:23:43,793 --> 02:23:47,814
[SPEAKER_08]: a bold statement for any council, especially myself to say, let's do debt exclusion.

1782
02:23:48,354 --> 02:23:51,354
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to get the word out to the public to say, hey, maybe this is a way we can do this.

1783
02:23:51,414 --> 02:23:52,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1784
02:23:53,075 --> 02:23:54,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor, are you pointing to me?

1785
02:23:54,675 --> 02:23:55,835
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is a ballot question.

1786
02:23:55,935 --> 02:23:58,556
[SPEAKER_18]: So it goes to the ballot for the voters to decide.

1787
02:24:00,096 --> 02:24:03,056
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not like we're going to pass this and say, what's the question?

1788
02:24:03,096 --> 02:24:06,437
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it's in effect, it has to go to the ballot for the voters to decide.

1789
02:24:07,577 --> 02:24:08,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks.

1790
02:24:08,858 --> 02:24:09,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1791
02:24:09,398 --> 02:24:11,058
[SPEAKER_17]: And it would go to the ballot, Mr. President.

1792
02:24:12,153 --> 02:24:21,878
[SPEAKER_17]: If we're unable to provide the city services, Mr. President, that we should be offering as a community to our regular tax base, then there's a problem.

1793
02:24:21,898 --> 02:24:24,359
[SPEAKER_17]: There's an inherent problem in this community.

1794
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:34,024
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would submit to you, with the building boom that's going on and the increased revenues that are going on in this community, we can't afford the things that we need to do.

1795
02:24:34,544 --> 02:24:36,125
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have to prioritize.

1796
02:24:36,605 --> 02:24:38,346
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not taking place right now.

1797
02:24:39,127 --> 02:24:41,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So, to go outside of the budgetary constraints

1798
02:24:41,924 --> 02:24:55,716
[SPEAKER_17]: and say we can raise money through CPA, we can raise money through, you know, we can raise money through debt exclusion, you know, we'll also privatize our electricity bill and try to save people money that way.

1799
02:24:56,497 --> 02:24:57,998
[SPEAKER_17]: This is all going to come home to roost.

1800
02:24:58,378 --> 02:25:00,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone has to pay for it, Mr. President.

1801
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:02,382
[SPEAKER_17]: This is all going to come home to roost.

1802
02:25:03,101 --> 02:25:16,872
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not at the point right now that I'm going to be operating outside of the city budget, which I believe people are already overtaxed in this community, get limited services, which I see on a daily basis, and then ask for additional.

1803
02:25:17,253 --> 02:25:20,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Now we're going to be asking to send out the tax bill.

1804
02:25:20,916 --> 02:25:29,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, in addition to debt exclusion, in addition to CPA, we also want to know, would you like to donate a little more money to build this, this, and this?

1805
02:25:29,963 --> 02:25:31,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, where are we going, Mr. President?

1806
02:25:32,345 --> 02:25:32,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Where do we go?

1807
02:25:32,985 --> 02:25:36,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't we just put our hand in the pocket of each and every taxpayer?

1808
02:25:36,587 --> 02:25:37,527
[SPEAKER_17]: We won't need to ask them.

1809
02:25:38,088 --> 02:25:39,809
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the slippery slope.

1810
02:25:40,349 --> 02:25:41,589
[SPEAKER_17]: I realize what we're trying to do.

1811
02:25:42,030 --> 02:25:45,651
[SPEAKER_17]: But ultimately, Mr. President, I come from a different train of thought.

1812
02:25:45,951 --> 02:25:47,992
[SPEAKER_17]: That's work within the confines of the budget.

1813
02:25:48,653 --> 02:25:50,614
[SPEAKER_17]: We happen to be in a great economy now.

1814
02:25:50,954 --> 02:25:59,938
[SPEAKER_17]: There should be no reason that we're looking at debt exclusion to do the simple, simple task of maintaining our buildings and our infrastructure.

1815
02:26:00,272 --> 02:26:04,633
[SPEAKER_17]: That goes with a $160 million-odd budget, Mr. President.

1816
02:26:04,873 --> 02:26:18,895
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we can't operate within that budget, we need to take a look at some of the high-paying salaries around here and some of these no-show jobs, Mr. President, that are in the six-figure sums, Mr. President, if we want to get a handle on things.

1817
02:26:19,275 --> 02:26:20,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Not going back to the taxpayers.

1818
02:26:21,436 --> 02:26:22,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1819
02:26:23,036 --> 02:26:23,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Scarpelli.

1820
02:26:25,356 --> 02:26:27,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Council President.

1821
02:26:27,037 --> 02:26:29,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that Councilman Marks brings up a great point,

1822
02:26:31,038 --> 02:26:33,579
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk about leverage, and we talk about our operating budget.

1823
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:58,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the citizenry sees the vote to do something like a debt exclusion, and they see that the money that would be earmarked to a certain job or a certain facility like the fire station, wouldn't it be great to know we can go back with the figure that's already been publicized and say to our administration, hey,

1824
02:26:59,911 --> 02:27:10,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we've come to fruition with this vote, if it does happen, we now have money that we can look at and say, hey, this money was allocated through our operational budget.

1825
02:27:11,197 --> 02:27:17,879
[SPEAKER_08]: and let's focus now on our streets and adding park personnel and adding DPW personnel.

1826
02:27:18,179 --> 02:27:19,180
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's a great idea.

1827
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:21,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, you know, there's so many possibilities.

1828
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:32,384
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why this Committee of the Whole meeting is going to be great just to banter about these wonderful ideas and whether it comes to fruition or not, so be it.

1829
02:27:32,604 --> 02:27:37,686
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a valid question and again, we're going to hear from the people who are going to make that decision.

1830
02:27:37,706 --> 02:27:38,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1831
02:27:41,789 --> 02:27:44,250
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor, did you want to speak?

1832
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:44,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1833
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:46,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

1834
02:27:46,331 --> 02:27:48,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Nathan Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave, Medford, Mass.

1835
02:27:49,652 --> 02:27:55,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 30,000 foot view here that I saw tonight is the city has a spending problem.

1836
02:27:56,534 --> 02:28:02,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The city has a problem making commitments, honoring commitments, then surprises come up.

1837
02:28:03,737 --> 02:28:04,577
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we pay for it?

1838
02:28:06,021 --> 02:28:11,085
[SPEAKER_02]: before you talk about a debt exclusion, which absolutely it's a tool in the toolkit.

1839
02:28:11,686 --> 02:28:12,706
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to have it.

1840
02:28:13,647 --> 02:28:19,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Be prepared in that same discussion to answer what else can you do?

1841
02:28:20,012 --> 02:28:25,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So tonight, right, one of the things that got passed was $500,000 or so on and so forth.

1842
02:28:25,477 --> 02:28:29,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a planned expenditure in the budget for the park?

1843
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:31,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna ask you, Councilor Marks.

1844
02:28:33,523 --> 02:28:34,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't in the budget.

1845
02:28:34,924 --> 02:28:35,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a surprise.

1846
02:28:36,065 --> 02:28:36,905
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not a surprise.

1847
02:28:37,446 --> 02:28:38,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a surprise.

1848
02:28:38,706 --> 02:28:39,226
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something else.

1849
02:28:39,246 --> 02:28:41,147
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of budgetary planning, it was a surprise.

1850
02:28:41,187 --> 02:28:43,048
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't expect to do that last year.

1851
02:28:44,308 --> 02:28:44,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1852
02:28:45,169 --> 02:28:46,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a capital project.

1853
02:28:46,249 --> 02:28:51,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So is maintaining the buildings by the same argument.

1854
02:28:53,232 --> 02:29:00,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can't maintain our buildings, we can't afford to honor the commitments that the mayor made, so we're going to go

1855
02:29:01,732 --> 02:29:04,537
[SPEAKER_02]: As you like to say, reach into the pockets of the taxpayer.

1856
02:29:04,757 --> 02:29:08,023
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, I am not a million dollar business owner.

1857
02:29:10,037 --> 02:29:11,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting the word out.

1858
02:29:11,918 --> 02:29:16,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it could be a ballot question that the people that you can make that vote to say no, that's all.

1859
02:29:17,381 --> 02:29:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1860
02:29:17,801 --> 02:29:18,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1861
02:29:18,562 --> 02:29:19,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1862
02:29:19,182 --> 02:29:21,503
[SPEAKER_02]: But the proposal is to reach for more money.

1863
02:29:21,583 --> 02:29:22,984
[SPEAKER_17]: One information, Councilor Marks.

1864
02:29:23,824 --> 02:29:28,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, and that would allow the people to decide, but what if it's a 60-40 vote?

1865
02:29:28,667 --> 02:29:33,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you tell the 40 percent, sorry, you're going up anyways?

1866
02:29:33,450 --> 02:29:35,551
[SPEAKER_17]: So, it's not a clear cut just because it's

1867
02:29:36,051 --> 02:29:40,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because it passes, just because it passes that everyone's on board, Mr. President.

1868
02:29:40,554 --> 02:29:51,181
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of hardships out there, people struggling day to day that, you know, will have to make decisions whether or not they're going to eat or pay their taxes, Mr. President.

1869
02:29:51,241 --> 02:29:52,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are life decisions that are being made.

1870
02:29:53,603 --> 02:29:55,564
[SPEAKER_17]: We may not experience it, but they're out there, believe me.

1871
02:29:56,452 --> 02:30:05,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that things need to get done, but I haven't ever seen this council say no to a monetary request from the mayor for something that was a surprise.

1872
02:30:06,924 --> 02:30:13,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have that happen in one hand and then, oh, but wait, in order to pay for the things I actually promised, we got to get more money.

1873
02:30:14,453 --> 02:30:18,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go build Locust Street, and there's going to be, what's the term you use?

1874
02:30:19,116 --> 02:30:19,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Linkage.

1875
02:30:19,837 --> 02:30:20,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1876
02:30:20,357 --> 02:30:20,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1877
02:30:20,617 --> 02:30:21,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a lawyer either.

1878
02:30:21,558 --> 02:30:22,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an engineer, right?

1879
02:30:23,599 --> 02:30:25,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually work for the defense.

1880
02:30:26,541 --> 02:30:27,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I get money in a budget.

1881
02:30:28,642 --> 02:30:32,965
[SPEAKER_02]: When we don't have any more money, sorry, better find some other work.

1882
02:30:33,005 --> 02:30:34,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get more raining down from the heavens.

1883
02:30:34,766 --> 02:30:36,567
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't reach back into the pocket.

1884
02:30:38,028 --> 02:30:41,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that might be surprising that the federal government actually can work that way, but it's true.

1885
02:30:44,457 --> 02:30:55,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't ever heard anyone say no, or for the park, hey, we gotta spend 587,000 or whatever, but in order to get that 300,000 more, right, we gotta spend 580.

1886
02:30:55,903 --> 02:30:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't spend four.

1887
02:30:57,704 --> 02:30:58,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't spend 350.

1888
02:30:59,525 --> 02:31:02,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it doesn't have the water part, right?

1889
02:31:03,627 --> 02:31:04,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can we trim?

1890
02:31:04,547 --> 02:31:08,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little here, a little there can actually add up, right?

1891
02:31:09,130 --> 02:31:13,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe there should be some pushback, not just, you know, pencil whipping and rubber stamping,

1892
02:31:14,285 --> 02:31:17,706
[SPEAKER_02]: what the administration wants, which is what happens here, unfortunately.

1893
02:31:19,207 --> 02:31:20,047
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I see.

1894
02:31:20,167 --> 02:31:21,628
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the 30,000 foot view.

1895
02:31:21,888 --> 02:31:23,248
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't afford to pay our bills.

1896
02:31:23,728 --> 02:31:24,349
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more.

1897
02:31:25,349 --> 02:31:31,051
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't afford to honor our promises because we have to pay for the things that we didn't make a commitment on.

1898
02:31:32,751 --> 02:31:33,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to build these new buildings.

1899
02:31:33,972 --> 02:31:34,592
[SPEAKER_02]: You got Wegmans.

1900
02:31:34,792 --> 02:31:35,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Wegmans is awesome.

1901
02:31:35,993 --> 02:31:37,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for bringing Wegmans here.

1902
02:31:37,613 --> 02:31:43,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually bring in money from outside the community, and you're not just reaching into the, you know, the taxpayers to pay for things.

1903
02:31:43,914 --> 02:31:44,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

1904
02:31:45,434 --> 02:31:46,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Locust Street, you're going to get linkage money.

1905
02:31:47,435 --> 02:31:50,555
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than you had in the budget this year, right, when you get that money.

1906
02:31:51,135 --> 02:31:51,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's it going?

1907
02:31:52,876 --> 02:31:56,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fixing a road any more than you would have already.

1908
02:31:57,357 --> 02:31:58,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not paying for the firehouse.

1909
02:31:59,897 --> 02:32:00,737
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're going to get more.

1910
02:32:00,877 --> 02:32:02,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you get more, you spend more.

1911
02:32:03,778 --> 02:32:05,278
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it's a Pandora's box.

1912
02:32:06,485 --> 02:32:09,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to go down that road, you should have the tool.

1913
02:32:09,786 --> 02:32:12,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Be prepared to answer, where is the accountability?

1914
02:32:13,147 --> 02:32:14,468
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you going to say no?

1915
02:32:15,268 --> 02:32:16,609
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you going to trim something?

1916
02:32:17,909 --> 02:32:26,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city needs a, you know, you have a fire tower, you're going to go spend some money to tear down a fire tower, and then maybe build another one in a couple years.

1917
02:32:26,952 --> 02:32:29,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the meantime, are we going to say, oh, the firefighters don't need training?

1918
02:32:30,693 --> 02:32:33,995
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's silly, and that's political suicide, let's be honest.

1919
02:32:34,495 --> 02:32:35,175
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you going to do?

1920
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:46,526
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna pay them money to go train in the neighboring city, because they have fire towers, they're not used 24-7, but in order for them to do their training there, they can't be on duty because they're out of the city.

1921
02:32:47,847 --> 02:32:52,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna pay another crew to come in to backfill them while they go do their training, and they train hard.

1922
02:32:52,589 --> 02:32:53,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a firefighter for 10 years.

1923
02:32:54,810 --> 02:32:56,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard, it wears you out.

1924
02:32:57,032 --> 02:32:58,712
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing it right, it's gonna wear you out.

1925
02:32:59,653 --> 02:33:01,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not going back to work afterwards.

1926
02:33:03,210 --> 02:33:05,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Not if you're going to go out of town anyways to do it.

1927
02:33:05,891 --> 02:33:07,651
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to spend more money than you think.

1928
02:33:10,512 --> 02:33:16,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Start trimming a little bit and have that plan when you come and ask for more money from my pocket.

1929
02:33:18,814 --> 02:33:19,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Show the accountability.

1930
02:33:20,395 --> 02:33:25,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we want more money because we got ourselves in a rut, or mayor so-and-so got us in a rut.

1931
02:33:27,717 --> 02:33:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

1932
02:33:28,077 --> 02:33:28,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

1933
02:33:28,597 --> 02:33:29,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff happens.

1934
02:33:29,377 --> 02:33:30,257
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to work through it.

1935
02:33:30,798 --> 02:33:31,938
[SPEAKER_02]: But show me the plan.

1936
02:33:33,372 --> 02:33:34,593
[SPEAKER_02]: and boil it down in English.

1937
02:33:34,853 --> 02:33:37,135
[SPEAKER_02]: The budget, every year you guys talk about the budget.

1938
02:33:37,235 --> 02:33:38,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't ever see a line on them in the budget.

1939
02:33:38,736 --> 02:33:50,524
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never broken down enough and digestible for John Q. Public like me even to understand or to see it or pull it up, you know, easily and then hold you guys accountable.

1940
02:33:50,804 --> 02:33:52,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you spend the money you said you were going to spend here?

1941
02:33:53,767 --> 02:33:54,787
[SPEAKER_02]: What were the surprises?

1942
02:33:55,988 --> 02:33:58,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we had more money here so we transferred it over here.

1943
02:33:58,510 --> 02:34:02,713
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens every year and it's a lot because we can't plan.

1944
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:04,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Start planning.

1945
02:34:04,311 --> 02:34:05,972
[SPEAKER_02]: You people are the money people, right?

1946
02:34:06,052 --> 02:34:07,292
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the body that does money?

1947
02:34:11,115 --> 02:34:15,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You approve the budget, therefore, the buck stops with you.

1948
02:34:17,058 --> 02:34:18,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to stop with someone.

1949
02:34:18,239 --> 02:34:19,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else do I complain to?

1950
02:34:21,681 --> 02:34:23,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to rubber stamp everything.

1951
02:34:23,282 --> 02:34:24,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe push back.

1952
02:34:25,063 --> 02:34:31,107
[SPEAKER_02]: If I see that, then I'm actually open to you saying to fix the hole that we dug ourselves in,

1953
02:34:32,627 --> 02:34:33,647
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we fix it.

1954
02:34:34,048 --> 02:34:35,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want to see the plan.

1955
02:34:36,328 --> 02:34:37,609
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I'm going to achieve it.

1956
02:34:38,429 --> 02:34:38,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1957
02:34:38,729 --> 02:34:39,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart.

1958
02:34:39,810 --> 02:34:41,831
[SPEAKER_02]: You people in business understand smart, right?

1959
02:34:42,031 --> 02:34:42,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1960
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:44,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Show it to me.

1961
02:34:46,973 --> 02:34:48,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just at some meeting or whatever.

1962
02:34:48,974 --> 02:34:49,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on the website.

1963
02:34:49,934 --> 02:34:50,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it somewhere.

1964
02:34:50,654 --> 02:34:51,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see it.

1965
02:34:53,095 --> 02:35:02,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hold all you accountable so that when things go wrong, I'm going to come back at you and say, well, I gave you more, and you still have the same problem.

1966
02:35:04,187 --> 02:35:04,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the maintenance.

1967
02:35:04,847 --> 02:35:05,908
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to build new buildings.

1968
02:35:06,348 --> 02:35:06,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1969
02:35:06,989 --> 02:35:11,992
[SPEAKER_02]: You still don't have the budget fixed to then once you build that building, maintain it so that we're not doing it again.

1970
02:35:12,932 --> 02:35:14,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, in 20 years, we need a new building.

1971
02:35:14,473 --> 02:35:14,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1972
02:35:14,773 --> 02:35:16,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a new house every 20 years too.

1973
02:35:17,075 --> 02:35:17,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could have a new house.

1974
02:35:17,935 --> 02:35:18,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want a roof.

1975
02:35:20,797 --> 02:35:25,480
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the library, we needed to approve the library because that was, you know, the grant is here.

1976
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:26,120
[SPEAKER_02]: The grant is here.

1977
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:27,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's always that impulse, grant, grant, grant.

1978
02:35:28,101 --> 02:35:28,582
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get it.

1979
02:35:28,602 --> 02:35:29,062
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get it.

1980
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:33,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not the right choice.

1981
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:35,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So just think about that as you do.

1982
02:35:36,061 --> 02:35:42,882
[SPEAKER_02]: You should not have the tool, but be prepared to answer that question when you go down the road, counselor, because I know you're trying to fix the problem.

1983
02:35:43,742 --> 02:35:44,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for that.

1984
02:35:46,263 --> 02:35:47,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But show me something with it.

1985
02:35:49,964 --> 02:35:50,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for your time.

1986
02:35:51,144 --> 02:35:55,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for the, you know, it wasn't quite my, what do you call it?

1987
02:35:57,005 --> 02:35:57,785
[SPEAKER_02]: the donation thing.

1988
02:35:58,065 --> 02:36:01,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not GoFundMe, but you know, at least someone's listening.

1989
02:36:01,466 --> 02:36:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate it.

1990
02:36:02,726 --> 02:36:03,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1991
02:36:03,267 --> 02:36:03,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1992
02:36:04,147 --> 02:36:05,767
[SPEAKER_13]: All in the motion by Councilor Knight.

1993
02:36:07,488 --> 02:36:08,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by.

1994
02:36:10,809 --> 02:36:12,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Table for next week.

1995
02:36:12,169 --> 02:36:15,910
[SPEAKER_13]: So it'll be, it'll be on the agenda.

1996
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:40,211
[SPEAKER_13]: The table records.

1997
02:36:42,633 --> 02:36:43,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfinished business.

1998
02:36:43,433 --> 02:36:44,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Knight.

1999
02:36:48,077 --> 02:36:51,840
[SPEAKER_18]: I move to take paper 18414 off the table, Mr. President.

2000
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,722
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a request for the

2001
02:36:55,950 --> 02:36:59,931
[SPEAKER_18]: House Bill 3610, commonly known as the Red Flag Bill.

2002
02:37:00,331 --> 02:37:05,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Our House Ways and Means Committee is going to be taking this paper up within the week.

2003
02:37:06,612 --> 02:37:15,974
[SPEAKER_18]: The Red Flag Bill is aimed at reducing gun violence by establishing another tool for public safety in a way of closing dangerous loopholes related to gun licensure.

2004
02:37:16,635 --> 02:37:23,316
[SPEAKER_18]: What it does, Mr. President, it allows a family member, a roommate, or a law enforcement official to petition the court to bar someone from owning a firearm.

2005
02:37:24,694 --> 02:37:30,256
[SPEAKER_18]: if their gun ownership presents a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others.

2006
02:37:31,077 --> 02:37:35,478
[SPEAKER_18]: This legislation is supported, Mr. President, by the Massachusetts Police Chiefs Association.

2007
02:37:36,599 --> 02:37:41,321
[SPEAKER_18]: The House Committee on Public Safety has endorsed passage of this bill on April 13, 2018.

2008
02:37:42,161 --> 02:37:44,942
[SPEAKER_18]: The governor is weighed in on the bill.

2009
02:37:44,962 --> 02:37:46,543
[SPEAKER_18]: The Speaker of the House is weighed in on the bill.

2010
02:37:47,003 --> 02:37:51,405
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I think that this is something that we need to do to make sure that our community is a safer place, Mr. President.

2011
02:37:52,064 --> 02:38:04,688
[SPEAKER_18]: I know some of my colleagues do have concerns about the Second Amendment rights of individuals in this community and whether or not this piece of legislation is something that they're willing to support, and I can wholeheartedly understand that and support that.

2012
02:38:05,529 --> 02:38:15,152
[SPEAKER_18]: As an attorney at Law Council, Alongo has taken an oath to uphold the tenets of the federal and state constitutions, and this is something she might not be comfortable supporting, and I understand that, Mr. President.

2013
02:38:15,872 --> 02:38:18,033
[SPEAKER_18]: But with that being said, time is of the essence.

2014
02:38:18,053 --> 02:38:19,453
[SPEAKER_18]: The legislative session is closing.

2015
02:38:19,473 --> 02:38:20,193
[SPEAKER_18]: It is an election year.

2016
02:38:20,233 --> 02:38:21,754
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be closing relatively soon.

2017
02:38:23,025 --> 02:38:27,007
[SPEAKER_18]: The House Ways and Means Committee is set to take this paper up this week, so time is of the essence.

2018
02:38:27,607 --> 02:38:31,009
[SPEAKER_18]: It was put on the agenda for the May 8th meeting.

2019
02:38:31,809 --> 02:38:39,953
[SPEAKER_18]: It was tabled so that a copy of the actual text of the bill could be provided to my colleagues on the council, because I neglected to do that when filing the resolution.

2020
02:38:40,734 --> 02:38:43,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I had forwarded that information to my council colleagues.

2021
02:38:43,395 --> 02:38:50,178
[SPEAKER_18]: They've had it for a number of days now, Mr. President, so I'd ask to move forward on the resolution, and I would request my council colleagues' support.

2022
02:38:50,921 --> 02:38:52,741
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, second and by.

2023
02:38:55,682 --> 02:39:03,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Send a letter of support to a state delegation in the House Ways and Means Committee saying that we support the red flag bill, House Bill 3610.

2024
02:39:03,804 --> 02:39:07,085
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

2025
02:39:07,505 --> 02:39:08,245
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2026
02:39:08,765 --> 02:39:08,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

2027
02:39:09,706 --> 02:39:10,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

2028
02:39:13,306 --> 02:39:14,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

2029
02:39:14,907 --> 02:39:19,928
[SPEAKER_05]: We report out the subcommittee report, I'm sorry, the committee, the whole report tonight.

2030
02:39:20,656 --> 02:39:21,757
[SPEAKER_05]: What report did you want to bring up?

2031
02:39:21,957 --> 02:39:26,841
[SPEAKER_05]: The inclusionary zoning.

2032
02:39:26,861 --> 02:39:28,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Inclusionary zoning.

2033
02:39:28,922 --> 02:39:35,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So during the Committee of the Whole meeting tonight, we met with regard to inclusionary zoning.

2034
02:39:40,971 --> 02:39:42,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to make a recommendation.

2035
02:39:42,232 --> 02:39:42,972
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to make a recommendation.

2036
02:39:42,992 --> 02:39:48,677
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to make a recommendation to the CD board with regard to any new development that

2037
02:39:51,123 --> 02:39:53,285
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk is saying the paper was kept in committee.

2038
02:39:55,247 --> 02:39:58,350
[SPEAKER_13]: What are the clarification counts on that?

2039
02:39:58,610 --> 02:40:00,792
[SPEAKER_18]: The committee report contained three provisions.

2040
02:40:00,832 --> 02:40:05,356
[SPEAKER_18]: The first provision was that we'd send recommendations to the Special Permit Granting Authority.

2041
02:40:06,229 --> 02:40:13,052
[SPEAKER_18]: relative to requests, a requested threshold of inclusionary zoning affordable units and developments.

2042
02:40:13,713 --> 02:40:17,915
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was a recommendation to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

2043
02:40:18,555 --> 02:40:28,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we had a draft inclusionary zoning ordinance that is requiring legislative legal review by a city solicitor.

2044
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:32,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we also had signage notification

2045
02:40:34,126 --> 02:40:35,407
[SPEAKER_18]: that was on the paper that was on there.

2046
02:40:35,668 --> 02:40:37,369
[SPEAKER_18]: I made the motion to report the paper out.

2047
02:40:37,709 --> 02:40:46,617
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion that I made was to keep the inclusionary zoning ordinance in committee and report out the recommendation and report out the signage portion of the committee report.

2048
02:40:46,857 --> 02:40:47,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

2049
02:40:47,998 --> 02:40:48,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2050
02:40:49,159 --> 02:40:49,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2051
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:58,087
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Bailão, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2052
02:40:59,708 --> 02:41:00,389
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2053
02:41:02,288 --> 02:41:09,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clark.

2054

[SPEAKER_05]: To adopt the report.

[SPEAKER_14]: We're having a roll call to adopt the report?

02:41:18,363 --> 02:41:18,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2059
02:41:18,583 --> 02:41:21,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it to adopt the report and send the recommendations to the ZBA?

2060
02:41:21,927 --> 02:41:22,507
[SPEAKER_05]: To the ZBA.

2061
02:41:22,527 --> 02:41:22,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2062

[SPEAKER_05]: And the... And to send the...

2063
02:41:31,181 --> 02:41:37,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, to send the draft signage ordinance public notification panels to the CD board.

2064
02:41:39,043 --> 02:41:40,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, a roll call vote has been requested.

2065
02:41:40,903 --> 02:41:43,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Please call the roll.

2067
02:41:49,925 --> 02:41:50,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2068
02:41:52,145 --> 02:41:52,705

[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Nay?

2071
02:41:55,366 --> 02:41:55,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
