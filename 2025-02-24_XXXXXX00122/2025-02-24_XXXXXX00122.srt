[SPEAKER_05]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:46,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you both for being here with me today.

10
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:52,048
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could just start by introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

11
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:54,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

12
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jenny Graham.

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the vice chair of the school committee, and I'm a Medford mom.

14
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:06,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Patricia Cherry.

15
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:14,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I am an advocate, I'm a mom of a child with a disability and special needs.

16
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,291
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you both.

17
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:22,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So before we get into what we're going to talk about today, I was hoping you could both answer the question that I ask everybody.

18
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:29,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, I know you've answered this before, but if you could just share what your favorite place to eat in Medford is and what you like to eat there.

19
00:01:31,982 --> 00:01:40,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am looking forward to eating at Mrs. Murphy's, which I know will be opening like any day now.

20
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:50,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what my favorite thing to eat will be there just yet, but I'm really excited to have another fabulous restaurant in the square.

21
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:55,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine is Bertucci's and it's the Tuscan chicken wings.

22
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:58,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Bertucci's is my son's favorite place to go out to dinner.

23
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:01,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's awesome.

24
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, and I did hear from Barry that he's hoping to open soon, like before the end of February.

25
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So great.

26
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:23,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the main reason that we came together today was to talk about the override now that it's passed, to hear a little bit about kind of what happens now, like sort of how the money is going to be spent, how that is decided.

27
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:30,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know, Patricia, you have sort of like a personal story about how you've been involved in some of this.

28
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:36,553
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I wonder if maybe Jenny, if you could kind of share like what the next steps are.

29
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:36,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

30
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:57,795
[SPEAKER_02]: On January 13, the school committee heard a proposal from the administration that outlined their proposal for spending the money from question 7 and question 8 in this fiscal year.

31
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:59,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you probably have heard,

32
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,420
[SPEAKER_02]: override was retroactive back to July 1.

33
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:24,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is part of why people felt a bigger impact on their tax bills this quarter, because we were essentially only spreading over two bills what normally would be spread over four.

34
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:28,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a whole bunch of other things that went on with the assessments, which I won't get into.

35
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:28,906
[SPEAKER_02]: But

36
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:37,952
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, the 7M dollars between the 2 questions is available to us this year.

37
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:48,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what we've heard about on January 13th was the proposal for, like, how to do that spending in this fiscal year and because it's the 1st year.

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:58,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So right off the top, we knew and were reminded that the city advanced Medford Public Schools $1.75 million.

39
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:03,254
[SPEAKER_02]: So that $7 million comes down to 5.25.

40
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:07,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the administration came before us, they were really dealing with that $5.25 million pot.

41
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:19,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went through that presentation and I'm happy to talk about the highlights and big elements of what we agreed to.

42
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:23,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Their recommendation was approved unanimously by the school committee.

43
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:30,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So that spending is already being put into action based on what we agreed to on January 13th.

44
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:39,045
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a piece of the $5.25 million that has not yet been allocated from a spending perspective.

45
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:42,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is within Medford Public Schools to spend.

46
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:47,467
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not yet heard a proposal for the whole $5.25 million.

47
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,708
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason being is that some portion of that money

48
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:56,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is allocated under the under the law, right?

49
00:04:56,756 --> 00:05:03,269
[SPEAKER_02]: To be restricted to supporting some of the schedule changes that we outlined as the reason for doing the override.

50
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:11,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are working right now actively with our bargaining partners in the union to talk about what that piece looks like.

51
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:17,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll hear another presentation about what the district is recommending based on those negotiations.

52
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:23,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on that, the school committee will have to approve the spending that gets proposed.

53
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll hear about that maybe, like, in another month or so.

54
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:37,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, right then, then we really quickly are in year 2. so all of this money will be folded in to the budget.

55
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:44,568
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about our operating budget for fiscal 26, which starts on July 1. so this this sort of, like.

56
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:56,557
[SPEAKER_02]: starting point this fiscal year is a little bit unusual because it's a mid-year infusion and an ability to do some things that we didn't know that we were going to be able to do.

57
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:00,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we get into the next budget cycle it will be wrapped in.

58
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:15,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially whatever our budget was comes up by seven million dollars and then we will still expect that the city provide an increase to our budget for next fiscal year as they the city does.

59
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,585
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, nearly every year, I have 2 follow up questions.

60
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:21,569
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say the proposal from the administration, who's who is that?

61
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:27,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So, led by the superintendent and the director of finance, right?

62
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:34,436
[SPEAKER_02]: They sit down really with their, with their leadership team, the assistant superintendents, building principles, et cetera and say.

63
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:40,779
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and this is typical of any budget cycle where they sit down and say, what do we need?

64
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are the proposals?

65
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:42,559
[SPEAKER_02]: What.

66
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Has to happen next year that's not happening this year.

67
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:51,122
[SPEAKER_02]: that is going to cost mon budget for and get approv we need to stop doing?

68
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:51,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Wh anymore?

69
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,025
[SPEAKER_02]: What should we n So every every year, even

70
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:32,099
[SPEAKER_02]: you you should see like savings proposals and spending proposals right and hopefully those things sort of work in concert with each other um so you don't get to crisis which we've been there we've done that hopefully we're charting a better path yeah so my second question was um i think in some of the uh support of the override there was a talk about like if this doesn't pass teachers losing jobs so what are we what's happening there

71
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:40,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so if the override didn't pass, the biggest thing that would have happened is that advance from the city would have.

72
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:42,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Been in question, right?

73
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:43,947
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city advanced 1.75M dollars and.

74
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:44,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That allowed us to save positions.

75
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,553
[SPEAKER_02]: in this fiscal year, that without that advance, we would have had to cut last year.

76
00:07:57,274 --> 00:08:04,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So had the override not passed, those positions would again be on the chopping block to be eliminated.

77
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

78
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that makes sense.

79
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:11,525
[SPEAKER_05]: They knew there was funding coming in, so they could lend it to you in the short term.

80
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:12,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

81
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we were planning for a successful override, right?

82
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:20,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So that money, what that money was used to fund was

83
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:29,797
[SPEAKER_02]: half a million dollars to update our technology portfolio, right?

84
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about Chromebooks, they have a very short shelf life.

85
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,403
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not expensive, but there's a lot of them in the district.

86
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:42,009
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have never in Medford Public Schools had a replacement budget for technology.

87
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:46,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime we needed to replace technology, it was like,

88
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:58,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really hard a really, really hard to do, or we waited for it to be so bad that we would then go and say to the city, like, we need this huge amount of free cash.

89
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: To fix our technology situation, what.

90
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:06,956
[SPEAKER_02]: A district needs to do in this day and age is have a replacement budget.

91
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So we now do so.

92
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,795
[SPEAKER_02]: In FY24, we did not have a replacement budget.

93
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:17,479
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some other sources that we were using to plug that gap.

94
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,822
[SPEAKER_02]: That went away with the pandemic funds expiring.

95
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:26,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, going forward, we have a half million dollar technology replacement budget.

96
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:28,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one big thing that happened.

97
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:38,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the override hadn't passed, we would again be in a situation where we could not replace our technology to the tune of a half a million dollars a year.

98
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:39,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big deal.

99
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:50,675
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that money that advance allowed us to do was keep 14 positions that would otherwise have been cut at the end of last year.

100
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:51,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would have seen.

101
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: two elementary school teachers, two high school teachers, two literacy coaches, one nurse, four curriculum administrators, and three behavior specialists.

102
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:07,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Their positions would have been eliminated on June 30th.

103
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:09,940
[SPEAKER_02]: We saved them with the advance.

104
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:10,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they can

105
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:15,048
[SPEAKER_02]: now we can not worry about having to save them again.

106
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:19,393
[SPEAKER_02]: That becomes permanent and not just in advance anymore.

107
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:21,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

108
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:22,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, yeah.

109
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:26,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds like there's now a little bit more flexibility in what you can plan for the future.

110
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,906
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I'm wondering, maybe Patricia, you can talk about how community input has been taken for some of those things.

111
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:49,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I can add is that when a group of us parents, all who have kids with special needs and disabilities, we heard that they were planning on proposing these overrides.

112
00:10:50,232 --> 00:11:01,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So in that, we reached out and asked to see, you know, some of the, I think Jenny had put something out that was showing what the overrides would cover, like specifically what was under six, specifically what was under seven.

113
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:09,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, no disrespect, but of course, our group was not under any of those questions.

114
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:16,064
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's when the wheel started turning and us as parents were like, well, this is the perfect time that

115
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:25,447
[SPEAKER_06]: if we're going to be voting yes to these overrides and adding more money to the budget, we want some of that money to go specifically to our kids.

116
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:34,729
[SPEAKER_06]: We hear a lot all the time about, you know, teacher aides and raises and, you know, positions to be held.

117
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:41,711
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to see something that actually tangible, something that went to our children.

118
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:44,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So I reached out to Zach and Jenny,

119
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:48,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we had our initial meeting probably about eight months ago.

120
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and from there we broke it off into a couple of different subgroups.

121
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:59,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was meeting with Jenny and was it was Aaron, right?

122
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:00,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

123
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:00,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

124
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:06,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron, um, on the school committee side and on the city council side, we were meeting with Matt and Anna.

125
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:10,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, with Jenny, we had, we had conversations with Jenny.

126
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:12,003
[SPEAKER_06]: We came up with,

127
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,116
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, after I think one or two meetings, we came up with exactly what we wanted to ask for.

128
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:26,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And our asks were to have the Best Buddy program implemented in our public schools, to have an inclusion specialist hired.

129
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,724
[SPEAKER_06]: to one inclusion specialist for all the schools.

130
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,827
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hoping in the future to get one for each school.

131
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we wanted more bus monitors, because buses are a huge issue for our kids.

132
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:43,940
[SPEAKER_06]: We told her our three asks.

133
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we had multiple conversations and

134
00:12:49,712 --> 00:13:02,781
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to the school committee meeting on the 13th and we were, you know, a bunch of us parents showed up to, you know, say why we wanted these things and that it was time that, you know, our kids had a spot, had a seat at the table.

135
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:12,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we hear, like I said, we were always hearing about, oh, the aides and the aides that have to take care of these kids and the specialists that have to take care of these kids.

136
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:15,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was always, it was never the kid about,

137
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,912
[SPEAKER_06]: something that was going to the actual kid.

138
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:19,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we need parents.

139
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we need these teachers, but we also need programming.

140
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:24,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We need social activities for our kids.

141
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:34,581
[SPEAKER_06]: We need places for our kids to go and to, you know, be productive citizens and grow as the humans that they're gonna be, you know?

142
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:42,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went to Jenny, went to the school committee, and we were ready to get up and say everything we needed to say.

143
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:46,368
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't need to because it was already put in the budget and they passed it.

144
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:53,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty much how I came about with the school committee part.

145
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:58,190
[SPEAKER_06]: We also did meet with the city council regarding the overrides on that side of it.

146
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:09,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Their budget doesn't go till May, but we are asking for an inclusion specialist and more programming for kids in the city.

147
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:15,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are very, very happy with the three asks and getting those done right now.

148
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:17,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not stopping there.

149
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,031
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna continue.

150
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:24,432
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the last time you've heard from this group of parents.

151
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:26,352
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I call us?

152
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:27,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Parents in the park.

153
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:36,715
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back to ask for more because I think this is showing good faith to us anyways, as group.

154
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: When you read about the,

155
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:40,799
[SPEAKER_06]: the overrides and what it's going to entail.

156
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,980
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of it is all the behind the scenes stuff.

157
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,562
[SPEAKER_06]: People who are paying for the overrides don't actually see these things come to fruition.

158
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:50,243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all behind the scenes stuff.

159
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:53,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is something that you're actually seeing.

160
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:55,065
[SPEAKER_06]: The Best Buddies program is starting in the high school.

161
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:58,487
[SPEAKER_06]: They just identified both teachers, a subseparate teacher.

162
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:02,030
[SPEAKER_06]: and a gen ed teacher to start running the program.

163
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:05,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It's now going to go to the kids to sign up.

164
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:11,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is going to be something that you're going to now see in our community, finally, you know, something for us.

165
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where we came from.

166
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:18,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what what I have gotten from the override.

167
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:19,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very happy with it.

168
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will tell you, I was a person that was on the fence.

169
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:22,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not

170
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,951
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was very much, I have no more money.

171
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:28,833
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I can't afford this.

172
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,895
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Jenny kept saying it's a cup of coffee.

173
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:35,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, girl, sometimes I can't afford a cup of coffee.

174
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,883
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really, after doing this with her and she, it was so easy.

175
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,784
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not easy, but it was

176
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,166
[SPEAKER_06]: it wasn't confrontational.

177
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It was never a negative vibe.

178
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:54,011
[SPEAKER_06]: They all, she always worked side by side with us, like helping us to get what we wanted.

179
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:57,414
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't an us against me, which is how I've always seen those things.

180
00:15:57,474 --> 00:16:08,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you watch those meetings and it's like, but no, if you, if you, if you talk to somebody and civilly and, and, and ask for, you know, Hey, this is what I'm looking for.

181
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:13,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the time, the people on, on these committees are willing to help out and abide.

182
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:13,905
[SPEAKER_06]: That's,

183
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:16,950
[SPEAKER_06]: what I've received, so.

184
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:32,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think, you know, the interesting thing about sort of what you see on TV or on Zoom versus like how things happen, it's just, there's sort of two worlds that collide, right?

185
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:37,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talk about like how a budget gets prepared,

186
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:43,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really easy to be like, well, the administration does or doesn't like this thing.

187
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:53,220
[SPEAKER_02]: But the truth is, the administration does work really hard to say, what do we need and and they actually know, like, they.

188
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,896
[SPEAKER_02]: They are thoughtful leaders in their own right, and they know what their priorities are.

189
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:02,780
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what they are seeing is needed and not needed and all of those things.

190
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:11,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also spend a lot of time talking to everybody about what other people think that we need.

191
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:15,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, every year that we build a budget, the school committee gets asked, like, what are our priorities?

192
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:17,855
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the things that we're looking for, right?

193
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:33,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, when you are in a universe where you're just cutting the budget one year after the next, people start to feel bad about asking those questions about, what do you think we need?

194
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:37,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're like, I know I'm not going to be able to give you this thing because I know I'm going to have to cut the budget.

195
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:48,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So the administration and the finance people, they definitely have a rough job because it's usually their job to say,

196
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:51,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we want all these things, but we can't have them right now.

197
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:54,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's painful for them.

198
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:57,562
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do take a lot of time and care to say what

199
00:17:58,514 --> 00:17:59,914
[SPEAKER_02]: is the best way to spend this money?

200
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:04,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are the prime needs in the district and how do we do that?

201
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in the background, after talking about these needs, the inclusion specialists in particular, that's a bigger expense, right?

202
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:20,839
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole person versus Best Buddies is a stipended position, so a little bit easier to like get off the ground.

203
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,380
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were talking about these things,

204
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was talking to the administration about these being things that I wanted to see.

205
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,017
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no objection.

206
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:32,417
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no disagreement.

207
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:39,802
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no strong arming that the district would be a better place if we could hire an inclusion specialist.

208
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:46,045
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no disagreement about that at this time, or frankly, probably ever.

209
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:49,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But what was different in the right now is we actually had

210
00:18:50,768 --> 00:19:02,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough money that doing that would not mean not doing something else or saying goodbye to some other professional that we weren't prepared to say goodbye to.

211
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:08,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So this money gives us a unique opportunity to say, how do we sort of.

212
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:12,318
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do this a little bit better and more productively?

213
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And where are those places where we should invest?

214
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:23,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, you know, some of them will look like an inclusion specialist that works with teachers and buildings and with kids, right?

215
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:31,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And others will be sort of invisible to the to the community or to the kids, but really important, like.

216
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:41,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the example I'd like to give people is, um, our payroll office until recently has run with two payroll specialists.

217
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,116
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 800 employees.

218
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:50,583
[SPEAKER_02]: They do like 10 payroll runs and they pay.

219
00:19:52,032 --> 00:20:02,734
[SPEAKER_02]: weekly paychecks, they pay bi-weekly paychecks, they pay teacher schedule paychecks, and then everything under the sun, overtime, all the things.

220
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:14,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So these poor two people have been trying to like hold the district together and the very first thing you do to have happy employees is you paint them on time, right?

221
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:17,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So for these two folks like

222
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:20,144
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it's impossible.

223
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:24,709
[SPEAKER_02]: It was impossible for them to ever not be in crisis mode.

224
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:30,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the changes, one of the investments that we made that we approved was a third position.

225
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:39,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, students aren't going to see that person, but without that person, we're not supporting teachers.

226
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you don't support teachers, you're giving them cause to have to step away from the work that they're there to do to go fight about some question about their paycheck.

227
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:51,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

228
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:51,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And.

229
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:01,173
[SPEAKER_02]: When you pay people accurately and reliably and fairly, things get better, right?

230
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Things improve for everybody.

231
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:07,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a position where it's like, yes, it's an administrative position.

232
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:11,559
[SPEAKER_02]: That person is in our administrative assistance union.

233
00:21:13,894 --> 00:21:20,916
[SPEAKER_02]: But the work they do is so important to enabling everything that we need to happen so that teachers can focus on kids.

234
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some things like that that are being proposed and were approved, like some swing shift custodians to support our programming.

235
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:36,160
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not just happen during the school day.

236
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all kinds of things and reasons why this money is going to be put to good use.

237
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:52,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying hard to make sure that the vast majority of the money is used in a way that as directly as possible benefits kids.

238
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:59,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking to spend this hard won money frivolously.

239
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:06,614
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not cleaning the bathrooms in gold, and we're not laying down cobblestone walks.

240
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:07,955
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing things like,

241
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Fixing the elevator at the high school because it's broken.

242
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:18,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we're, you know, we're do we're going to fix the flashing at the McGlynn elementary school.

243
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally.

244
00:22:20,532 --> 00:22:26,859
[SPEAKER_02]: That causes it to rain inside a 1st floor kindergarten classroom when the rain comes sideways at the building, like.

245
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:29,766
[SPEAKER_02]: These are really important things.

246
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:41,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be amazing for that kindergarten teacher and all her students to be able to go to school after a sideways rainy day and not have a classroom full of buckets and ruined carpets.

247
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:42,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

248
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:45,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, but that fix was that's not a.

249
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:50,874
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a minor fix that's like over a 100,000 dollar fix because we have to.

250
00:22:51,374 --> 00:22:56,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull the roof off and pull bricks away from the, from the side of the building and fix it.

251
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:59,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's, it's not a small change and it.

252
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It will mean so much to 1 kindergarten class.

253
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,382
[SPEAKER_02]: But just 1, so those are the kinds of things that when the whole system is constrained.

254
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:12,344
[SPEAKER_02]: You, they, they get left.

255
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:21,262
[SPEAKER_02]: and people feel neglected and it's not untrue, but it's not for lack of interest in fixing the problems.

256
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:27,709
[SPEAKER_02]: But often what the school committee ends up doing is having to make choices.

257
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:31,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we know what we want, we want all the things, right?

258
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:35,496
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can only have 10 things and we want 15.

259
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:37,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have to then decide

260
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:41,725
[SPEAKER_02]: which are the five we're not going to go forward with.

261
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:58,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, when you hear the community come out in support of the things that they're worried about being cut, rightfully so, what you hear about is why that thing is important, but we sort of are a district where there's no obvious like, well, we don't need to do that thing anymore.

262
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:02,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody comes with like ideas on the thing that we don't need anymore.

263
00:24:02,949 --> 00:24:07,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's partially because we've been a very bare bones district for a really long time.

264
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:07,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

265
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:15,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes, you know, sort of the opportunity to do some of the things, like, take care of our buildings.

266
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:24,574
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to make some mid year hires like, mid year hires are really hard to do in a school, but there are some places where we felt like we could do it.

267
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:26,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the inclusion specialist is 1 of them.

268
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:35,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are others where we will look at whether there's hiring that has to be done starting with the FY26 budget, right?

269
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:50,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's still more to come in terms of the full effect of all of this as we figure out the spending on the remaining bucket of money that has not been earmarked just yet.

270
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:53,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And that amount of money is $3.7 million.

271
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:54,695
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a sizable piece of

272
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:03,494
[SPEAKER_02]: spending on the table for this fiscal year that we are still having to do.

273
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:14,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that is wrapped up in the changes that we're trying to see come next school year with longer days and fixing the high school schedule and all that good stuff.

274
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:32,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think for us, that was probably just what she just spoke of is that that was our biggest kick in our pants is that our particular group of kids were the ones when the cuts needed to be made, were always the ones that were mostly affected.

275
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,820
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was the AIDS being cut.

276
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,500
[SPEAKER_06]: It was everything, you know what I mean?

277
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so we, we were tired of that.

278
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:43,444
[SPEAKER_06]: We were tired of like, okay, we're getting cut AIDS.

279
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:44,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we got,

280
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:52,967
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 kids with all different learning abilities with one teacher and one aide stuck in a classroom because the cuts once again came to our group of kids.

281
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:56,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, yes, I agree 100%.

282
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,251
[SPEAKER_06]: The override is going to take care of that.

283
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:10,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that our kids most vulnerable, as we always talk about how we always wanna help the most vulnerable, that the most vulnerable will no longer be the people that are getting the cuts because we don't have the money.

284
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:18,599
[SPEAKER_06]: know so that that is great and the inclusion specialist I want to add it's it's bigger than just a position.

285
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:30,423
[SPEAKER_06]: An inclusion specialist what we're hoping for this inclusion specialist is to finally build a bridge and a gap that MedFed has always had between kids with disabilities and Gen Ed kids.

286
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:35,565
[SPEAKER_06]: That gap in the city of MedFed and to be honest with you the reason why

287
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed this gap so much is because my daughter isn't in district.

288
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:41,343
[SPEAKER_06]: She's out of district.

289
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:46,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would come, I would take my daughter to school that, you know, seventh grade when she first started out of district.

290
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:50,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would come back and see all my friends who was still in district.

291
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,949
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, Oh my God, my daughter has cooking classes.

292
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:54,170
[SPEAKER_06]: She has the best buddies program.

293
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,251
[SPEAKER_06]: She's, she's getting swim lessons.

294
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,693
[SPEAKER_06]: They go out into the community every Thursday to learn how to use their money.

295
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:05,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I'm talking to somebody who's like, yeah, my son's in a class and

296
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:14,873
[SPEAKER_06]: there's 22 kids and they don't have any aid and there's only one it was it was it was it was it was just so horrible to hear, you know.

297
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:19,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a really, really, really big deal.

298
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:23,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that this is going to affect so many kids and so many parents.

299
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:27,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully what Jenny's describing creates a shift.

300
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:36,735
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like before this, people were fighting over, well, I need the things for my kids, so I can't possibly think about what you... People are pitted against each other, right?

301
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:42,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the different needs are pitted against each other rather than how can we help everybody and how can we be inclusive of everybody?

302
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:43,560
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have the money.

303
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:51,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds like now we're in a different position where we can address these priorities in a better way.

304
00:27:52,063 --> 00:27:53,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.

305
00:27:53,284 --> 00:28:08,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as far as the pitting goes, I don't think that there was too much pitting because that was one of our big talks in front of the school committee is that, you know what, before you give to the programs that already have, we just wanted one program that didn't exist.

306
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:10,818
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just wanted something before everybody else got more.

307
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:14,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where we were at.

308
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:19,905
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I mean, it is a fair point to talk about.

309
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:33,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Because since the beginning of being on the school committee, it's always been very clear to me that the real need of the district was like $10 to $12 million more.

310
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:36,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we just did was do seven more.

311
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:40,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So we made a huge dent in that number.

312
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But there will still be, as we go forward, there will still be change.

313
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,014
[SPEAKER_02]: There will still be hard decisions.

314
00:28:51,203 --> 00:29:04,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I just am really hopeful that we're not at the catastrophic level of hard decisions that I feel like we've been at ever since I took office, really, for any variety of reasons.

315
00:29:04,747 --> 00:29:10,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So we still have to do hard work to say, where could we save money?

316
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:13,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how could we do something better?

317
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,766
[SPEAKER_02]: How could we be more efficient?

318
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:18,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think all of those things are so critically important.

319
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:22,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there is not an endless amount of money, right?

320
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:23,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this the.

321
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:33,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we, we moved the, you know, we expanded the pile of money to, so to speak, but it cannot keep expanding that way.

322
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:40,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Without more overrides, and that's not something anybody's particularly interested in doing.

323
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:51,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we will again go into a cycle of the district needing to figure out how to self fund the new things they want to do because.

324
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:54,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that the city's revenue is capped.

325
00:29:54,918 --> 00:30:05,784
[SPEAKER_02]: At 2 and a half percent a year, plus new growth, so short of, like, explosions and new growth, like, the, the universe of what's possible year to year to year is quite.

326
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:07,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Finite, right?

327
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:08,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

328
00:30:09,046 --> 00:30:14,829
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think about some of the things that are happening in the city when they, when, when we're talking about, like.

329
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:18,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposed zoning, which I know is a very hot topic right now.

330
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:23,133
[SPEAKER_02]: 1 of the things that happens in that discussion is.

331
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:37,838
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're opposing zoning changes, whatever they might be, that again sort of restricts and confines what the city's growth can be or how quickly it can happen.

332
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:42,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not to say it's entirely the reason you should just say, yes, do anything you want.

333
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,940
[SPEAKER_02]: There need to be rules.

334
00:30:44,481 --> 00:30:50,803
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we talk about how communities sort of grapple with Proposition 2.5,

335
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:55,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you have land, you build right?

336
00:30:55,926 --> 00:31:03,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you are in Western mass, like, a developer can go put in a new.

337
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:05,695
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 lot something, right?

338
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:08,738
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not so many spaces around Medford that.

339
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:11,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Where that is possible, so we're talking about.

340
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:16,271
[SPEAKER_02]: redeveloping things that are already developed in some fashion.

341
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:18,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a really different conversation.

342
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:26,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Our toolbox is just more limited than some communities that have many more options at their disposal to grow their tax base.

343
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:29,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing.

344
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:38,402
[SPEAKER_02]: The school committee in Arlington has put forward a request to change the

345
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:57,547
[SPEAKER_02]: the taxation structure that is available to communities so that when the communities required spending on education, it goes up more than 2.5% that the community has some leverage to be able to like move the tax rates accordingly.

346
00:31:58,368 --> 00:31:59,669
[SPEAKER_02]: That will go to the legislature.

347
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:04,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what will happen or whether they will be successful, but at the end of the day,

348
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:09,511
[SPEAKER_02]: If everything is going to cost more money and communities can only.

349
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:12,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Collect 2 and a half percent more than they did last year.

350
00:32:12,652 --> 00:32:16,235
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, this is this sort of a vicious cycle, right?

351
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:19,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you see in many communities is that.

352
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:30,063
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they have an override cycle of, you know, every X years, they, they're doing an override to support what has happened in the community at that time.

353
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:38,691
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never done this before, so I think we're not in a cycle so much because this was the first time.

354
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:43,555
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see communities in a cycle, they tend not to be as big.

355
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,437
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend not to be $7 million big.

356
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:46,818
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to be much smaller.

357
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: But you see a different cadence than what has happened in Medford.

358
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:55,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hopeful that some of the development discussions will be productive.

359
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:59,639
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see some amazing new development, like a Mystic app.

360
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:06,582
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they don't take my yoga studio away.

361
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:14,206
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use all the tools in our toolkit and not just have to be asking for more money to support basic operations.

362
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was a huge step in the right direction.

363
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:18,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

364
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:23,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else that you're excited about that will be changed or added because of the overhead?

365
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:30,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, so if I was to think about some of the things that are, like, the.

366
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:32,648
[SPEAKER_02]: The most, um.

367
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of tangible for folks, um.

368
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:43,214
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of teachers that we were able to fund and pay for where.

369
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:50,649
[SPEAKER_02]: The district had to hire the teachers so that our class sizes did not explode based on last minute enrollment.

370
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:57,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're able to pay for those and not have to cut something else between now and the end of the year to sort of balance the budget.

371
00:33:57,074 --> 00:33:57,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

372
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:01,234
[SPEAKER_02]: and that includes a district wide music teacher.

373
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:09,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we also, um, we'll be adding another administrative assistant, um, to the McGlynn complex.

374
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:10,841
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very visible.

375
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:17,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we'll have a nurse that can sort of float and cover, um, the nurses across the district.

376
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:27,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we will be doing some changes, some changes to security around, um, how staff enter and,

377
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:28,972
[SPEAKER_02]: have access to buildings.

378
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:38,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of having actual keys, we will be moving on into the modern day around, you know, access and security and knowing who's in the building and all that good stuff.

379
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:44,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've got a whole bunch of, um, maintenance things that are on the list.

380
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:50,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we'll be replacing $12,000 worth of instruments, um, across Medford public schools.

381
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,280
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big deal.

382
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we also, um, let's see,

383
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will be like, really preparing for.

384
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:10,007
[SPEAKER_02]: This shift in the schedule that we're working through with our bargaining partners and that that will be a big deal.

385
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,709
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of work to do to make that happen.

386
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:13,029
[SPEAKER_02]: But.

387
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:18,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Increasing the amount of education we're able to provide to students is huge.

388
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:23,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's to be able to create more access for, like, electives for the high school.

389
00:35:23,537 --> 00:35:23,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

390
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1 of the, it will change the schedule substantially at the high school.

391
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So that.

392
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:36,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Our vocational students have more access to things that they just can't access today, like the arts.

393
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:44,226
[SPEAKER_02]: My daughter is at the in the robotics program, and she takes Spanish online, which is like a really terrible way to learn the language.

394
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:50,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's things like that where the schedule and and the other big thing.

395
00:35:51,266 --> 00:36:06,569
[SPEAKER_02]: To Trisha's point is that some of the support that our students need academically is really, really hard to accomplish in the current schedule, particularly if they're at the book.

396
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should be able to open up.

397
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,291
[SPEAKER_02]: More academic support for students who may be struggling.

398
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:14,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that will be a very big deal as well.

399
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:30,057
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's lots to come this, you know, we're, we're hard at work doing what we can to get ready and working with the teachers to negotiate all the changes to the contract that will have to happen in order to enable all of this.

400
00:36:30,177 --> 00:36:30,317
[SPEAKER_02]: But.

401
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:33,003
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's a lot, there's a lot to do.

402
00:36:33,663 --> 00:36:40,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys also took the first step that I have to say that I've seen in a long time of actually trying to be inclusive.

403
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:42,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

404
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:44,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

405
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:55,362
[SPEAKER_06]: There was not inclusion before, and this is the first time a lot of us feel like, okay, they're going in the right direction and they want to see this happen, happen to.

406
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:06,724
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to say, you know, you guys should pat yourself on the back because you took that step and you're actually standing behind the words that you guys always, everybody throws around most vulnerable, inclusive and blah, blah, blah.

407
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:07,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just words.

408
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:11,266
[SPEAKER_06]: You're actually doing action and that's got to be commended.

409
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:12,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

410
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:13,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

411
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:19,630
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, um, you know, this is a really interesting, complicated job.

412
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

413
00:37:21,516 --> 00:37:25,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And often you're just the sort of bad guy that says no.

414
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:32,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to be able to think forward a little bit for change.

415
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:41,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Patricia shared with me before we started recording that she's had, she has a kid, she has kids in like in three different decades, and that she's been doing this sort of advocacy for a long time.

416
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I feel like that's a meaningful statement to say, like, in all that time.

417
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:53,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was saying to her, I said, I've gone through the Medford public school system, my oldest is 33 years old, my second is 24, my third is 14.

418
00:37:54,964 --> 00:38:00,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been down this road, not with, they don't have any disabilities or special needs, but you know, other things.

419
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just been the same old song, the same old dance, you get told the same old things.

420
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:14,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I think you get a lot of the hostility that you get, because nobody actually steps forward and takes actionable steps.

421
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:38,879
[SPEAKER_02]: to things it's always words it's always words you know yeah it means a lot when you start stepping up it does people notice and they're like okay well you know yeah it's it's really interesting i you know my kids are in eighth grade and 10th grade now and the district is it really is a very different place than it was you know when lila was in kindergarten um

422
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:46,127
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reading curriculum in elementary schools.

423
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:48,769
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a science curriculum in the elementary schools.

424
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:51,391
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a math curriculum in the elementary schools.

425
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:53,132
[SPEAKER_02]: There's new textbooks.

426
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:54,493
[SPEAKER_02]: We use computers.

427
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:59,055
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been so much change.

428
00:38:59,776 --> 00:39:07,260
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get to sit back and reflect, we really are a district that is in transition and is moving forward.

429
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,983
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's very easy to

430
00:39:12,044 --> 00:39:17,866
[SPEAKER_02]: get stuck in what we're not doing yet or what we can't do.

431
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:22,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's sort of where we've always been, and we're trying to break out of that.

432
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:28,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a work in progress, but I think we're moving in the right direction at this point.

433
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:32,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So my kids have had a good experience here.

434
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:47,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Lila's in the vocational school, so I look forward to making some changes that make the schedule better for not just her, but for all the half of our students that are involved in vocational education at this point.

435
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:52,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a minority of students.

436
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,784
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what your vocational school used to look like when we went to school.

437
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:02,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really different place, and there's just so much opportunity.

438
00:40:02,827 --> 00:40:04,548
[SPEAKER_02]: for the kids that go through the district.

439
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:20,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So bringing that opportunity to more kids is sort of the name of the game for me and making sure that all kids are feeling like they have that opportunity and that it's not like a one size fits all picture of like what opportunity needs or looks like.

440
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:23,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's definitely something that is my goal.

441
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:31,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see my daughter at some point before she graduates back in a Medford public school within the city that she lives for and lives in

442
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:37,496
[SPEAKER_06]: in the city that you'll actually probably work in, which is another area that I'm working with city council.

443
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:43,840
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no jobs or nothing in the city of Medford right now that would accommodate my daughter.

444
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,423
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any transitioning programs that are linking up.

445
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:53,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why this little bit opens

446
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:54,827
[SPEAKER_06]: to bigger things.

447
00:40:54,887 --> 00:41:00,910
[SPEAKER_06]: When you start seeing these kids walking around together in groups, it means a lot.

448
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:06,233
[SPEAKER_06]: To start really being inclusive means a lot to a lot of people in this community.

449
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:10,616
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be surprised how many people in this community this is going to benefit.

450
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:16,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So one day, hopefully, before she graduates, she'll be back in a Medford public school.

451
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,161
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your next goal, Jenny.

452
00:41:21,307 --> 00:41:22,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you both.

453
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else that you want to add before we wrap up?

454
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:27,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

455
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:32,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to come chat anytime, as you know.

456
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,231
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was nice to have a partner in crime this time.

457
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:39,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks, Tricia, for joining me.

458
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:42,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd love to come back and talk about the city council.

459
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:44,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, excellent.

460
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:46,054
[SPEAKER_05]: An open invitation.

461
00:41:47,474 --> 00:41:49,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Before their budget in May is finalized.

462
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:53,974
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, that sounds like a plan, but thank you both.

463
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,641
