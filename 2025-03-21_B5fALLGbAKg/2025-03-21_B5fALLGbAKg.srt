1

00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:44,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Vice President.

23
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:47,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

24
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:57,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to move suspension of the rules to take paper 15-502 under motions, orders, and resolutions off the table.

25
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,547
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn to take 15.502.

26
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:02,549
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

27
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:03,790
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion carries.

29
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,794
[SPEAKER_13]: 15.502 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

30
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:17,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated by a community group who is working on a proposal for the Malden Hospital redevelopment.

31
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Vice President.

32
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

33
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:27,408
[SPEAKER_07]: There has been obviously a lot of talk and discussion with regards to the

34
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,469
[SPEAKER_07]: site, the Malden Hospital site.

35
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,750
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council in Malden had a meeting probably six months back.

36
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it was during one of the storms.

37
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,611
[SPEAKER_07]: They had that in Malden that I attended.

38
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:46,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And a number of Medford residents obviously have a great concern of the development that's being proposed at that site.

39
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Three acres is on Medford property.

40
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:52,116
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Medford land.

41
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,277
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also, half of the project, if not most of the project,

42
00:01:56,947 --> 00:02:01,910
[SPEAKER_07]: project abuts Medford homes, families, our streets, our roads.

43
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:13,335
[SPEAKER_07]: There's great concern about the traffic, air quality, the gate, obviously, that is located on the property that leads into the Medford streets.

44
00:02:14,696 --> 00:02:26,042
[SPEAKER_07]: From that meeting, you know, probably even before that meeting, a group has organized and has had private meetings, or public meetings, but on Saturdays, and things to come up with a plan

45
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,491
[SPEAKER_07]: on how they see the Malden site being redeveloped.

46
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:38,873
[SPEAKER_07]: With that plan, there's open space, there's less units, less residential than obviously a developer would like.

47
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:54,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more environmentally friendly, it's better for both Malden and Medford, and they would like to come and propose their plan, something that they've met in work groups, they've done a lot of work on the project.

48
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:55,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I was able to attend,

49
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:59,459
[SPEAKER_07]: just a portion of one of the meetings on, I believe, a Saturday morning.

50
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:08,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just put a really lot of work into it, and I think it's for the betterment of Malden, but obviously Medford as well, and something that council should be updated on.

51
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:18,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a community-driven project, and I welcome the discussion, and I welcome hearing more about what has taken place since the last meeting I've attended.

52
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:28,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a packet was given to each councillor on the work they've done, so maybe you could follow along.

53
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone's going to speak on behalf of the group, Madam Vice President?

54
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:42,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

55
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:44,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

56
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:44,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Fitzpatrick.

57
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:46,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

58
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:46,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

59
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Councilor De La Russa, and through you to

60
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:52,388
[SPEAKER_10]: the entire Council.

61
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:53,869
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Bob Fitzpatrick.

62
00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:07,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 20 Oak Road in Medford, which is up in the aforementioned Fulton Heights neighbourhood, where this particular proposal is set to be built.

63
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:12,654
[SPEAKER_10]: So as Councilor

64
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:22,002
[SPEAKER_10]: pointed out, I'm here just to draw your attention to an important issue that my neighbors and I are extremely concerned about, and that is the former Malden Hospital site.

65
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:30,389
[SPEAKER_10]: It is our hope that you, members of the City Council, will support us in our effort to protect our neighborhood from the impacts of ill-considered overdevelopment.

66
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:35,773
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking to the Council for whatever assistance or guidance you can provide to us.

67
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,733
[SPEAKER_10]: As residents of the Heights, we're very concerned about the current proposal to bring dense housing development to the former hospital site.

68
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:49,015
[SPEAKER_10]: We would like to see something done with the site, but it needs to be of a nature and scale that fits with the neighborhood.

69
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,356
[SPEAKER_10]: The current proposal does not.

70
00:04:53,277 --> 00:05:01,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you look at this first board there, that is the current proposal.

71
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,921
[SPEAKER_10]: That is 375 units of housing

72
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,974
[SPEAKER_10]: 500 cars, underground parking.

73
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,616
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an extremely dense development.

74
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:24,262
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you talk about bringing that number of cars into a neighborhood like ours, I'm sure that you're all familiar with the Heights neighborhood.

75
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:28,764
[SPEAKER_10]: A few of you, I'm sure, have gotten lost up there at one time or other.

76
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:38,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a map, and you can just see how dense that neighborhood is.

77
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:49,718
[SPEAKER_10]: And what you'll also know is that we're talking very steep hills, very windy roads, very narrow streets.

78
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,842
[SPEAKER_10]: The winter we just went through, this was all pretty much one-ways.

79
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:59,925
[SPEAKER_10]: If you add 500 cars to the bottom of this neighborhood,

80
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me grab this thing.

81
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:20,587
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to see here, a developer will probably tell you that people who are living here are going to come out and they're going to drive down the Fells Way and they're going to come down, yeah, Fells Way East and turn on 60 and come up Fells Way West.

82
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,528
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to do any of those things.

83
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:29,530
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to come out Murray Hill Road, they're going to come up Fells Ave, just like everybody does currently, they're going to

84
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:40,623
[SPEAKER_10]: take the left on Fulton and the right on Ridgeway, driving through these neighborhoods, it's gonna be, you know, and again, people are already using that as a cutthroat.

85
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:49,948
[SPEAKER_10]: If you had 500 cars, it's just gonna be completely unmanageable.

86
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:56,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that if you talk to the public safety officials here in Medford, they'll tell you the same thing.

87
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,427
[SPEAKER_10]: As Councilor Donohue-Curran pointed out, this development is mostly in Malden.

88
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:11,029
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is an issue for us, right?

89
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:16,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Malden will have sort of the big say in what gets developed there.

90
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:20,616
[SPEAKER_10]: But about 20% or so is in Medford.

91
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:25,599
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of the abutters are in Medford, our neighborhood.

92
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,622
[SPEAKER_10]: On the other side, on the Malden side, you have Felsmere Pond,

93
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:33,856
[SPEAKER_10]: The cemetery, you have Fellsway East.

94
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,318
[SPEAKER_10]: On our side, you have a neighborhood.

95
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of Fellsmere Pond, it's a beautiful little spot.

96
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:52,206
[SPEAKER_10]: If you did this kind of dense development that they're talking about, you're going to add a lot of runoff.

97
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,707
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to really degrade that site quite a bit.

98
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,690
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a proposal that will

99
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:03,715
[SPEAKER_10]: fit in much better with the neighborhood we think.

100
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:15,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to bring to your attention just some of the things that folks that I've been proud to be associated with have been doing sort of on their own.

101
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:22,127
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been hosting neighbor-led discussions to get input and vision, this sort of vision that you see here.

102
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:25,949
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got petition signatures against this development.

103
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:31,878
[SPEAKER_10]: 250 from Medford and 324 signatures from Malden so far.

104
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:45,342
[SPEAKER_10]: We've hosted an information table at Felsmere Pond on Saturdays, gathered volunteers, knocking on doors to alert the community of this pending dense housing development.

105
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:51,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you'll see some folks came out tonight because they got a knock on the door, they got a flyer.

106
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:55,985
[SPEAKER_10]: We published letters to the editors, the Medford transcript, the Malden Observer,

107
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,113
[SPEAKER_10]: and most recently Boston Globe North.

108
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:07,756
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been engaged with Malden City officials to voice our community's concerns as well as theirs and coordinating community meetings.

109
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:11,197
[SPEAKER_10]: The next one is tomorrow at the Beebe School.

110
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:26,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we've done some digging into land donation requirements because there's some question as to whether they should be allowed to do this given that it was a hospital site and that

111
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:31,533
[SPEAKER_10]: the land was donated and there may be some covenants that they could be in violation of.

112
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:36,056
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, finally, we've developed this alternative plan.

113
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, clearly we don't own the site.

114
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:42,679
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't dictate what happens there.

115
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:48,062
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you look at a site and you say, it's one thing to say, that's a terrible idea.

116
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:49,558
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a terrible idea.

117
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:52,199
[SPEAKER_10]: But then, so what else could you do?

118
00:09:52,779 --> 00:10:11,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've come up with an alternate plan, you see it here, small mixed use housing, 70, 80 units, something that's within current zoning, the multi-use lawn, this retention pond, because again, we have all that runoff.

119
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,212
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've ever been in our neighborhood,

120
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,731
[SPEAKER_10]: After rain like we've had recently, it's a torrential river flowing down the hill.

121
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:36,096
[SPEAKER_10]: So this provides water retention, lots of permeable surfaces, places for people to recreate, relax, enjoy some green space, as opposed to just bringing large amounts of traffic into the neighborhood.

122
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:40,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I'm here to bring you guys

123
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,305
[SPEAKER_10]: this information and to say we would really appreciate your help.

124
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:57,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Any advice you can give us, any work you can do with the city of Malden, your counterparts there to say, is there some way that our two cities can work together on this?

125
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:02,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Because again, it is mostly in Malden, but the impacts are mostly to Medford.

126
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:08,658
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, I'll close and happy to answer any questions you might have.

127
00:11:10,832 --> 00:11:12,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

128
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:13,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

129
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:21,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to point out our Office of Community Development Director was at the public meeting in Malden in front of the City Council.

130
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:28,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I, as well, you know, with my help and my colleagues have requested, sent requests to her for updates and to stay involved.

131
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's extremely important.

132
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:36,501
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's extremely important for the City Council to be on top of the administration to make sure they know what's going on.

133
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:37,142
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate it.

134
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:40,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it seems like the City Council is receptive to what

135
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:43,865
[SPEAKER_07]: the public wants, but not necessarily what Medford wants.

136
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:56,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really important, like you said, every abutter, there are, you know, 40 homes that directly abut, plus, you know, obviously, but directly abut that property, and those are Medford homes.

137
00:11:56,493 --> 00:12:05,978
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Medford that's gonna, you know, fall victim to any negative, anything negative that comes from that site, and obviously that is,

138
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:13,362
[SPEAKER_07]: extremely thickly settled, 500 plus cars, however many units they're proposing, it's just too much.

139
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:19,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's been other times this council and the city has had to fight for projects because they're just too large in size.

140
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:23,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one thing that I'm glad you're working on.

141
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I wanted to say, to thank you.

142
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:32,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw you at one of the meetings we had over at the church, I believe in Malden.

143
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:34,322
[SPEAKER_10]: a few weeks back, so.

144
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:47,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was before the city council in Malden and kept having my hand up, but if they knew you were from Medford, they didn't want to hear it to the point where they said, okay, now let's, somebody did get a question in from Medford and it was, okay, now let's hear more from our Malden residents.

145
00:12:47,464 --> 00:12:55,146
[SPEAKER_07]: And we almost felt like, hey, we should have a say too, but our office of community development director was there.

146
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:57,586
[SPEAKER_07]: There may be, there's going to be a new mayor.

147
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:02,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully whoever that is can really take a lead on this and get together with Malden and make sure that our,

148
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,348
[SPEAKER_07]: our neighborhood is protected.

149
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:25,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I know if you want to just maybe explain more of, you know, what you've gathered from the public meetings, whether it's, you know, that plan or something similar to that plan or components of that plan that hopefully Malden and Medford can work into the project, I think anything you take from the community's plan versus the developer's plan is going to be a

150
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:26,616
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, beneficial.

151
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:27,376
[SPEAKER_10]: No, exactly.

152
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:37,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and, and we should stress, I mean, again, this is, this is, this is an idea and it's, it, it shows what you could do, right?

153
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:41,848
[SPEAKER_10]: You could have a, a, an amount of housing that makes sense for the site.

154
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:51,876
[SPEAKER_10]: You could, you could do it in a way where you had a multi-use for, you know, other purposes and event pavilion, what have you.

155
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:52,917
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, another,

156
00:13:53,807 --> 00:14:20,000
[SPEAKER_10]: developer designer could come along and say oh well you know tweak it you know this this way or that but but here you have like concrete example of yeah there is something else that you could do that's something that would fit with the neighborhood that you know the neighbors would be able to access as opposed to just being impacted by yeah and I can just speak as one council that lives in the Heights I mean I know the traffic and you know I know what goes on in the area and I know I drive by

157
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:23,643
[SPEAKER_07]: the pond all the time and it is just backed up traffic.

158
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:34,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So to make that worse is obviously not beneficial for the city of Medford and is just going to clog up our roads and deep within the heights is not going to see a positive impact from this.

159
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank you, Bob.

160
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:41,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, I thank the committee for taking their Saturday mornings, a number of mornings to meet.

161
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:48,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only made one meeting, but to meet and go over this and come up with these plans, it's, you know, something to be proud of.

162
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,898
[SPEAKER_07]: and the city, as a council, thank you.

163
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm glad you came to present.

164
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

165
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:56,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

166
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:58,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor.

167
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you, Madam Vice President.

168
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:06,860
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Penta.

169
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

170
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,581
[SPEAKER_03]: There you are.

171
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I misunderstood it.

172
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:14,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want you to make this perfectly clear before I make my comment.

173
00:15:14,562 --> 00:15:17,222
[SPEAKER_03]: You have what you call a retention

174
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,251
[SPEAKER_03]: in your example.

175
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:22,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you explain that again?

176
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,615
[SPEAKER_03]: The retention pond?

177
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:23,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

178
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:26,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you explain that again and why you're calling it that?

179
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,020
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the purpose of that?

180
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, sure.

181
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:33,806
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose of that is because this is,

182
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:41,720
[SPEAKER_10]: on a hill, and it's directly above Felsmere Pond.

183
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:47,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And the water, we have huge runoff problems already.

184
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:52,292
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is just, the retention pond is a way that

185
00:15:52,772 --> 00:16:01,700
[SPEAKER_10]: You can collect that runoff before it comes pouring down so that the water has some place to go.

186
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:07,165
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll have like, usually do like plants or something like that so it doesn't become stagnant.

187
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:18,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're saying that this retention pond would satisfy the proposal of mixed use and residential home housings that you're proposing?

188
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:25,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the at present proposal by the developer takes place, this retention pond couldn't service it.

189
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:26,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no.

190
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:31,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So if the current proposal takes place, there'd be no place to put it.

191
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:39,470
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not, let me be clear, it's not designed to, it's not like a septic or anything like that.

192
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,711
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a topographical feature, right?

193
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:48,993
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a way to do stormwater

194
00:16:49,894 --> 00:16:50,835
[SPEAKER_10]: runoff management.

195
00:16:51,475 --> 00:17:05,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you go to like the Assembly Square development, you'll see they've done some similar things where, especially like if you're on the train, you can see they have little, but they look almost like little ponds and they have like nice grass and stuff in them.

196
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:11,572
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the rainy season, it gets kind of, it gets good enough water in it for a duck to swim around, but then it can dry out.

197
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,895
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's, it's that kind of an idea.

198
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,978
[SPEAKER_03]: If I understand it, once again, if I'm looking at this and trying to understand it,

199
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:31,223
[SPEAKER_03]: This retention pond with your proposal or whoever put this proposal together seems to be somewhat satisfactory with a lesser density use of housing, correct?

200
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:42,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And by having that lesser density use of housing, the question then becomes of the housing that's being proposed, how many cars, how many vehicles?

201
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:48,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it's going to be according to our present zoning ordinances, I think it's two and a half cars per unit for condos.

202
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:53,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's the case, how many cars would you proposing for how many units?

203
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:54,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

204
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I w I would say a couple of things on that.

205
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:16,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, one of the things that, that, that's been discussed in terms of, of, of the mixed use housing is possibility of, uh, some elder housing being, being included in that, which would, um, which the city needs more of, and that would reduce the amount of cars that would be required.

206
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:17,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

207
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:24,566
[SPEAKER_10]: So we would hope to get the total number of cars down below 100, I would think.

208
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:34,452
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're trying to, again, reduce the impact as much as possible, without saying, well, nothing can go there.

209
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:41,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you're proposing, is the height of the building, are buildings higher or lower than what's presently there?

210
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,920
[SPEAKER_02]: About the same, right?

211
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:47,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

212
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's about the same.

213
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:48,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the same.

214
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:50,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And the proposal is much higher.

215
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,395
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposal actually is, is just denser.

216
00:18:54,435 --> 00:19:09,200
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll see, we actually have on this, on this, uh, here you can see we've marked what the height.

217
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,782
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is like four to five stories, two to three, two to three, four, four, three, three.

218
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:16,142
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so the height,

219
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:24,013
[SPEAKER_10]: of the buildings isn't a particular issue, it's the density that really creates the issue.

220
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:34,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, just superficially, if we're looking at it from a private developer's perspective, he's trying to develop that to make the most amount of money at the highest density.

221
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:46,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're looking at it from the community's perspective, City of Medford, area residents, immediate abutters, if something has to go there, it should be looked at as being the least intrusive, the least obstructive, and at the same time,

222
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,264
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial with a community.

223
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:51,867
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire community not only has a say, but there is some sense of agreement.

224
00:19:52,468 --> 00:20:05,118
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would suggest that before this, your proposal or to get your proposal going, even for the purposes of a discussion that I would think that you might have to bring this back to the developer and let them know that you've already been to the Medford city council.

225
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:08,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, there's no way I could support what they're proposing.

226
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:11,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't make any sense at all, but more concerned.

227
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:13,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more concerned about my community, our city,

228
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:21,289
[SPEAKER_03]: and the immediate impact that the neighbors have, because I think there's some sense of realization that something is going to be developed there, and some shape, mean, and reform.

229
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:30,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So rather than preclude it and nix it and say, no, we don't want anything, let's be realistic, let's use some common sense, and let's just see how far they're willing to compromise.

230
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're not willing to compromise, then neither should you, and neither should the residents.

231
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:42,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Because to me, I mean, you were there first, you pay the taxes first, you've lived through this, and you know what the neighborhood and the area can take.

232
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,230
[SPEAKER_03]: much more than anyone else, not even the developer knows that.

233
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,571
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just going to build it and see you later and goodbye and make his money.

234
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going to leave the problem for the city of Medford.

235
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:52,613
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's, that's exactly right.

236
00:20:52,673 --> 00:21:05,857
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why, you know, um, our first, our first order of business again was to get organized to come up with, um, some kind of alternate plan.

237
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:10,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah, we would, we would love to work with, uh, with the developer, with whoever,

238
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,392
[SPEAKER_10]: and say, you know, here's an idea, what's yours?

239
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,995
[SPEAKER_10]: We want smaller, we want livable.

240
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:20,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, the city of Medford could really use some senior housing.

241
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:21,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be a great use for it.

242
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:38,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's come up with something that will give the developer the return that he needs, even if it's not as much as he would like, that gives the city of Malden the taxes that, you know, some amount of taxes that they are looking for, but doesn't impact.

243
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:40,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also have to look at the cut-through area

244
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,872
[SPEAKER_03]: by that hospital section over there, because the neighborhood is going to take some of that impact.

245
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:45,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

246
00:21:45,112 --> 00:21:56,539
[SPEAKER_10]: They come straight up one road, and they'll go right up Waterville and probably past my house on Oak Road on their way out to Fell's Ave and down.

247
00:21:56,719 --> 00:22:00,322
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a little tiny rotary up there in the heights.

248
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,923
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to blow right through it.

249
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:05,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be out walking my dog, and they'll be just driving right by.

250
00:22:05,985 --> 00:22:06,305
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it.

251
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:07,586
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

252
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:08,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

253
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:08,807
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

254
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Camuso.

255
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:39,946
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the neighbours and especially Mr. Fitzpatrick for coming here this evening.

256
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:57,899
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, this is going to be a major impact on our community, and this City Council, under the resolution of Councilor Marks, actually worked with our Chief of Police to put up some sort of structure on the Medford side so that it's not only somewhat aesthetically pleasing,

257
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,452
[SPEAKER_22]: but also just to cut the flow of traffic as a cut through.

258
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:09,235
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember for many, many years when it was the Malden hospital, it was a cut through and it'd be thousands of cars per day.

259
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:16,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Every change of shift at night, ambulances coming up there and just, it was, uh, it was chaos in the residential neighborhood.

260
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:20,621
[SPEAKER_22]: And it wasn't like our hospital that is abutted by Lawrence road, governor's ave and forest street.

261
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:24,023
[SPEAKER_22]: It was small little, uh, homes on a,

262
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:29,506
[SPEAKER_22]: streets that's traversed by two vehicles, and you can't even fit a car parked on the side when two vehicles are going by.

263
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:37,932
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's a big difference when an ambulance is going through there with the lights on, not necessarily the siren, because when they get to that point, they'd always shut it off, as the neighbors know.

264
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:42,175
[SPEAKER_22]: But the red lights and everything else would light the whole house up.

265
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:48,300
[SPEAKER_22]: With that being said, I think we have to be very cognizant of the fact, Mr. President, that this is a city of Malden project.

266
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:50,281
[SPEAKER_22]: Malden has the

267
00:23:53,805 --> 00:24:04,473
[SPEAKER_22]: We're all and be all as far as getting the vendor slash developer into the table and actually can arrange an agreement with them.

268
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:19,484
[SPEAKER_22]: Where Medford, we're limited because the amount of housing and developing happening on the Medford side, if they do it consistent with the current zoning and they don't have to go to the board of appeals, there's really nothing Medford could do.

269
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:22,607
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's scaled back to the point where it's going to

270
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:27,167
[SPEAKER_22]: where it's going to fit within our zoning ordinances.

271
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:46,017
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think we should send a resolve to the City of Malden, the Mayor Christensen, as well as to their City Council that we do want to work with them, same way Malden and Everett worked with us during station landing in Somerville, and as well as the City of Medford working with the Stoneham development up at the New England Memorial Hospital.

272
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:49,516
[SPEAKER_22]: We're cognizant of the fact that some development is going to take place there.

273
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:53,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Quite honestly, I talked to several of the neighbours and they're just sick and tired of seeing the vacant building.

274
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:55,899
[SPEAKER_22]: They said they have rodents going in there.

275
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:59,721
[SPEAKER_22]: There's people that sneak in and try to take it over living there.

276
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:04,103
[SPEAKER_22]: And unfortunately, it's not conducive to a good quality of life as well.

277
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:08,865
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think we just got to send the message in a nice tone that we want to work with them.

278
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:12,187
[SPEAKER_22]: We're interested in seeing good, prudent development.

279
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,668
[SPEAKER_22]: But at the same token, we have to understand that Malden

280
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:18,026
[SPEAKER_22]: is the driving force behind this, and they're the only people.

281
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:25,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, Malden, we'll have to realize that the city of Medford could take them to court and tie up the job for 10 years if they wanted to.

282
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:30,669
[SPEAKER_22]: But we don't want to spend our taxpayers' money if we don't have to as well.

283
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,609
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think we just have to send a message that we understand it.

284
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:42,471
[SPEAKER_22]: And as I said, you look at some of the developments that we had in our community over the years, and the surrounding communities did not take us to court, worked with us.

285
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,952
[SPEAKER_22]: But we were very amenable sitting down with them, too.

286
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:49,496
[SPEAKER_22]: talking about traffic flow and things that we could do as our community.

287
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:54,258
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think we have to do that with Malden and at least send the message that we're on top of this.

288
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:56,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Our neighbors, our taxpayers are very concerned.

289
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:12,906
[SPEAKER_22]: And as long as we're all on this city council, we're going to continue to monitor the situation, but most importantly, send the strong message that we want something a little bit scaled back, number one, and number two, something that's not going to affect

290
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:23,826
[SPEAKER_22]: the runoff, because I've seen projects like this where people that live in an area don't have groundwater coming through their basements, and then you do a project of this magnitude, next thing you know, the next storm, they have groundwater.

291
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:28,469
[SPEAKER_22]: It just changes the whole flow of things, stormwater, runoff water.

292
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:33,412
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up this evening.

293
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:35,614
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something that we've all been following.

294
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:41,226
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we have to be very cognizant of the fact that it is Malden.

295
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:45,428
[SPEAKER_22]: And I mean, there is small groups in Malden that are saying they don't want a project at all.

296
00:26:46,149 --> 00:27:01,559
[SPEAKER_22]: And quite honestly, I think that's unrealistic, because you're better off having to say something that you get there than someone coming in and saying, hey, we're going to make this whatever, something that conforms to zoning, but not something you want in your neighborhood.

297
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,143
[SPEAKER_22]: Certain types of medical facilities and things like that that people would prefer not in the heart of their neighborhood.

298
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:10,052
[SPEAKER_22]: And right now, and here's the other thing, too.

299
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:13,473
[SPEAKER_22]: You want to have the developer at least come back with a proposal.

300
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:27,616
[SPEAKER_22]: If he's not interested in doing it any way except the way he's doing it, then he should tell them all that, hey, I'm not interested and move on and let the Hallmark Health go out and look at the whole situation again and see if they're interested in other opportunities.

301
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,756
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that's about it.

302
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,936
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just want to thank everyone for coming down tonight.

303
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:33,777
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

304
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:34,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight.

305
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:40,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for the time and effort that he put into his presentation.

306
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:50,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I find it important to point out, like he said, it's very easy to point out a problem or a mistake or an issue, but to provide a solution is really to bring the matter full circle.

307
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,022
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can certainly appreciate the efforts that he's put forth, and I'd like to thank him for his hard work.

308
00:27:57,363 --> 00:28:02,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Under the current circumstances, where the development are not right there, I think that the neighborhood

309
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,152
[SPEAKER_09]: is suffering through a significant amount of cut-through traffic.

310
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:15,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I found myself guilty just the other day cutting down Murray Hill Drive, and when my friend Lou Entopper yelled at me, I pulled over, and he said, I want you to sit here and watch.

311
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you to sit here and watch.

312
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:23,767
[SPEAKER_09]: So I stayed there for about a half an hour with Lou, and we watched, and we counted cars, and we counted 75 cars in a half an hour cut through Murray Hill Road.

313
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:31,473
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think there's a significant problem there right now, absent development, and it's a problem that we can handle here in Medford.

314
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:41,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the Traffic Commission has taken a position that they'd like to see citizen-driven petitions when it comes to closing streets off to resident access, and I think that that might be an important place to start.

315
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:52,861
[SPEAKER_09]: If they close off Murray Hill Road to resident access only between certain hours, I think that'll cut down significantly on the cut-through traffic, similar to what they've done on Rural Ave here in Medford by the Winthrop Street Rotary, Mr. President.

316
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:59,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, one thing that I have learned is that if you drive down one of those streets that says resident access only between the hours of 6 a.m.

317
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:00,143
[SPEAKER_09]: and 9 a.m.,

318
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:02,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And you get caught.

319
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:03,533
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a surchargeable offense.

320
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:05,794
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same thing as driving down a do not enter street.

321
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:08,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a surchargeable offense that goes on your insurance.

322
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:14,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that this is a very effective tool to combat cut through traffic, Mr. President, signage and policing.

323
00:29:15,197 --> 00:29:27,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that that might be something that we here as a city council can support at this level, regardless of what they do in Malden, regardless of the development to address the issues that are in place right now, the cut through traffic problems that they're seeing in that neighborhood, Mr. President.

324
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:34,737
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to request that this committee send a request to the Traffic Commission to examine the possibility of putting in resident access only.

325
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:38,880
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'd like to see that be done through a citizen-driven petition first.

326
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we can have a conversation about that, Mr. President.

327
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:45,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to say turn the street resident access only, and then have all the residents on the street come down here and say, what are you, nuts?

328
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:46,246
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want that.

329
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:50,489
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's a tool that we can use to combat cut-through traffic in that area.

330
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:52,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

331
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Carr of Yellow.

332
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

333
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I see on the sheet here, it says,

334
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:03,657
[SPEAKER_15]: The proposed development adds 375 units, correct?

335
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:07,657
[SPEAKER_15]: On your sheet here, it says that the proposed developer is planning on 375 units.

336
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:08,578
[SPEAKER_15]: That's correct.

337
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,699
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the proposal that your group is, how many units?

338
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:18,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Roughly 70, 60 to 80.

339
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 60 to 80.

340
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,381
[SPEAKER_15]: So 60 to 80, does that make it- So that's smaller.

341
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:28,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that make it financially feasible for the developer?

342
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,379
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what that—I don't know if he's paying for the land, but— I don't know.

343
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:37,882
[SPEAKER_15]: But does that make it financially feasible for him to do that without driving the cost of the housing up?

344
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,803
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest with you, I don't know.

345
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:46,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sure.

346
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:49,907
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

347
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:52,188
[SPEAKER_20]: Could you just present yourself before the microphone?

348
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:53,616
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

349
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:54,596
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Stephen Kelty.

350
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:55,737
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm from Malden.

351
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:59,517
[SPEAKER_20]: I helped form some of the activities that produced this.

352
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:03,278
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, tomorrow at the BB school at seven o'clock, there'll be a six 30.

353
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:06,499
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's six 30 at the BB school to be able to, uh, about an hour presentation.

354
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:07,899
[SPEAKER_20]: And part of that is the financial.

355
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:19,382
[SPEAKER_20]: So in order to achieve this part of the concept of funding, it is through park grants, fundraising and other funding sources from the state because Malden is a gateway community.

356
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:20,962
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's other grants available.

357
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:22,923
[SPEAKER_20]: So some of that will offset some of the costing.

358
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:24,680
[SPEAKER_20]: for doing this plan.

359
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the developer amiable to this plan?

360
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:29,286
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know yet.

361
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,169
[SPEAKER_20]: If we have a developer, that's the point is finding out where the developer would do that.

362
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:43,262
[SPEAKER_20]: The idea is that by having the same number of units on the property in a building versus spread across the entire lot, because by right under residential only, it's between 60 and 80 units.

363
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:50,553
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're putting that all into one structure, conceivably it should be cheaper to build one structure, and the market values are about what they are.

364
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:51,675
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's in the ballpark.

365
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:57,002
[SPEAKER_20]: The question is, do you have to sweeten the pot with a bonus set of units to make it financially feasible?

366
00:31:57,022 --> 00:32:02,509
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's going to be the- Is there state money available to get some of this done?

367
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:16,784
[SPEAKER_20]: For the park stuff, basically, a park grant, say from Medford, if they help purchase the 20% of the property that's in Medford, that park grant would be up to $400,000 match.

368
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:18,764
[SPEAKER_20]: Molden could do the same.

369
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:24,206
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of times when the communities do them together, you get an intramunicipal grant, so you get higher points.

370
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:27,707
[SPEAKER_20]: If the communities have passed the Community Preservation Act,

371
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:34,049
[SPEAKER_20]: We're thinking about maybe even trying to pass the Community Preservation Act in Malden.

372
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,590
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe people are looking at putting a petition around in Bedford for putting the Community Preservation Act on the ballot.

373
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,931
[SPEAKER_20]: These are funding sources for doing that.

374
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:45,672
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there's also, like I said, the gateway funds.

375
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:48,813
[SPEAKER_20]: There's other mediation funds that we could possibly get.

376
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:51,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe we could get some help from the federal or the state government.

377
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:52,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

378
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,015
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Camuso.

379
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:55,735
[SPEAKER_22]: One question.

380
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:56,635
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Kelty, why are you there?

381
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:08,407
[SPEAKER_22]: I see that you cut back significantly, and it's a nice plan you brought forward, but do you have any developers in mind that if it's not necessarily this developer who would actually come forward?

382
00:33:08,948 --> 00:33:10,188
[SPEAKER_22]: That would have to be found, yes.

383
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:12,049
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we haven't shopped that.

384
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:18,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, because I mean, to arbitrarily, and I'm just playing devil's advocate here, because you want this to work for our neighborhood and your neighborhood.

385
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:26,497
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm concerned about the Medford side, to be quite frank with you, but from a standpoint of getting a developer in there,

386
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:28,861
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just being realistic.

387
00:33:29,862 --> 00:33:36,851
[SPEAKER_22]: Developers, you're going to see little interest, probably, with the scope of the work cut back by

388
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:45,269
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of developers, there's a lot of these developers who do these really mega projects, and there are other developers that take on these smaller projects.

389
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:50,311
[SPEAKER_20]: So the question is, will the current developer be willing to build... Precisely.

390
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:55,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Or would there be some other developer who would be willing to take a project of this scope?

391
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:58,153
[SPEAKER_20]: And that would have to be part of the process moving forward.

392
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:03,901
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the main element is that there are similar kinds of buildings like that being built in Everett and other places.

393
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:09,204
[SPEAKER_20]: So it is not beyond reason that we could find somebody that would be doing that and wanting to do that kind of project at that scale.

394
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:12,707
[SPEAKER_22]: And like I said, it sounds great in theory.

395
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:18,431
[SPEAKER_22]: It's certainly better for the neighborhood, but I think at the same time we just have to be realistic.

396
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:20,973
[SPEAKER_22]: We have to sharpen our pencils and see where the money is.

397
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:28,438
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if we're not realistic, it's a waste of everyone's time to sit at the BB school or any school for that matter and come up with a great plan that sounds good, but

398
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:38,141
[SPEAKER_22]: If you don't make it to the point where the developers want to come in, then you're going to be sitting looking at a vacant building with the temporary still fence around it.

399
00:34:38,982 --> 00:34:48,872
[SPEAKER_22]: That's ultimately not the goal, I don't think, for Malden or Medford, because quite honestly, many neighbors up in that area are sick and tired of the transient people trying to break in there.

400
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:50,633
[SPEAKER_22]: The police are there all the time breaking in.

401
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:51,674
[SPEAKER_22]: There's rodent problems.

402
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,667
[SPEAKER_22]: It's coming to the point where it's bad.

403
00:34:55,687 --> 00:35:05,212
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, I think no matter what plan, we need flexibility in saying that if a developer doesn't come forward but we want to do it, then we'd have to decide how to pay for the demolition of the building or have that happen.

404
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:10,876
[SPEAKER_20]: I think already now, the city of Malden is already in court with Hallmark because it's been a derelict building.

405
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:13,057
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a public safety hazard.

406
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:21,603
[SPEAKER_20]: That I believe if this developer doesn't move forward that there may be a judgment against them to take the building down So not the developer.

407
00:35:21,864 --> 00:35:22,644
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm having a hallmark.

408
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:37,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm sorry So the if Hallmark takes it down then we're dealing with a different situation because but now you've got a different animal We will be getting calls if that's a vacant lot now, and I'm just based upon my experience here You'll be getting calls from the neighbors in Medford and Malton if it's a vacant lot

409
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:39,503
[SPEAKER_22]: That there's kids drinking there every weekend.

410
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:46,328
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's, as I stated earlier, the best thing for both communities is to probably come up with a realistic plan.

411
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,811
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I know there are people in Malden that are dead against it.

412
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:52,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Leave it alone, and that's unrealistic.

413
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's why we put the housing.

414
00:35:53,974 --> 00:35:58,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Because by having the mixed-use housing, you have a visible presence at the park, which will help.

415
00:35:58,978 --> 00:36:01,060
[SPEAKER_20]: avoid any attractive nuisance situation.

416
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:12,531
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think whatever help that the council here can provide in terms of finding developers, helping solve the problems and make this a reasonable solution is really, we're grateful to have that help.

417
00:36:12,651 --> 00:36:18,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Because the Medford side, we will, Medford working with the developer, I think significantly the project was already cut back.

418
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:24,425
[SPEAKER_22]: From the original one, as far as the housing and those things going on in the Medford side, it's been scaled back, as you know.

419
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:29,172
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know why it's not happening in Malden, but... For this one or other projects?

420
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:30,253
[SPEAKER_22]: For this particular one.

421
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:32,396
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this one because they don't want to fight two battles, I think.

422
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:36,903
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, and they know the Zoning Board of Appeals probably wouldn't go along with it, but there's...

423
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:44,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so there's other developments that's happened in the area, so maybe the people on council know other developers because there's the things down at the landing, other things.

424
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:54,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe those developers might be interested in this, and some of the architecture of those buildings are really very attractive and would be probably a great asset to have those developers and those architects doing the designs for this project.

425
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:57,778
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just, like I said, I'm open-minded to everything.

426
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:06,763
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just very cognizant of the fact, we've dealt with schools in Medford, believe me, that sat for 30 years, vacant buildings right in the heart of our neighborhoods here.

427
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:11,264
[SPEAKER_22]: There's people in the audience that know the buildings I'm talking about, and it just, it's not a good thing.

428
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:12,544
[SPEAKER_22]: How long has Malden been closed now?

429
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:13,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably since 1999, 2000?

430
00:37:13,504 --> 00:37:16,645
[SPEAKER_22]: 99, so it's been 15 years.

431
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:20,706
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so it's quite a long time, but all right.

432
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:28,007
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know that just to knock that down and get rid of it and get rid of the material and stuff is about three or $4 million.

433
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:36,039
[SPEAKER_22]: just to knock it down, just to get the trucks in here and abate it properly, and you're dealing with asbestos and everything else with it.

434
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:43,986
[SPEAKER_20]: That's part of the scope of the plan that we've been looking at, is saying, these are the real costs, these are the possibilities, that's part of the reason the building is there, to help sweeten the pot.

435
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,911
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we're in the ballpark.

436
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,432
[SPEAKER_20]: The question is, how much do we have to supplement it with fundraising?

437
00:37:50,612 --> 00:37:58,797
[SPEAKER_20]: The Friends of the Brightlock Farm recently bought the land for, was it almost $8 million from the city?

438
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:01,938
[SPEAKER_20]: The city originally bought that land under the idea that they would turn around and sell it.

439
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:06,040
[SPEAKER_20]: And they, over the time that they had, were able to raise the money to buy it.

440
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,021
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of history with Malden Hospital.

441
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,863
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of people put a lot of donations toward that.

442
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:11,863
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a historic site.

443
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:15,285
[SPEAKER_20]: It's overlooking historic, nationally historic Olmstead Park.

444
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:36,366
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think there's a lot of opportunities for fundraising on the private side if we have the time So whatever we can do to buy time by locking up some sort of agreement I think would help open up the opportunity to find the money through donations as well as through a developer I'm gonna leave this just my last comment with that and Once again, I take an approach on all these things being realistic Fundraising sounds great.

445
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:41,688
[SPEAKER_22]: We've seen it many times in this community We're gonna raise a ton of dole for this project that project that guess what at the end.

446
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:41,728
[SPEAKER_22]: I

447
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:47,310
[SPEAKER_22]: It's back before the city council from the mayor looking for a bond because it sounded good.

448
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,131
[SPEAKER_22]: They were going to raise half a million dollars on their own to do it.

449
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:53,732
[SPEAKER_22]: And eventually it just didn't take off the way it was going to be.

450
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,053
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why we're not relying on that.

451
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:56,613
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

452
00:38:56,894 --> 00:38:59,374
[SPEAKER_22]: So yeah, we have, we have all the options.

453
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:01,415
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

454
00:39:01,615 --> 00:39:10,919
[SPEAKER_22]: And um, I just like to make one motion and that is to go back to council of Marx's motion, um, of several months ago, which I think is the biggest piece of this puzzle for our residents.

455
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:21,131
[SPEAKER_22]: and that is we do not want the opening at the end of the road leading into the Malden development to create the chaos and the havoc that was here post-1999.

456
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:28,735
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we could just send that resolution again, if Councilor Mark sees fit, where he was the original author, would you be okay with that, Councilor?

457
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:36,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Send that right to Malden and say that that's something that we need in order to be working with the people on this project.

458
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:40,180
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso, Councilor Marks.

459
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:41,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

460
00:39:41,939 --> 00:39:43,480
[SPEAKER_16]: And Councilor Camus was correct.

461
00:39:44,100 --> 00:40:05,929
[SPEAKER_16]: This council has taken two separate votes asking that one road be closed off to any cut-through traffic, that also the city of Medford put some type of barrier or structure so if need be, public safety vehicles can get in and out of the area if they have to.

462
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:09,090
[SPEAKER_16]: The chief of police was up here several months back.

463
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:14,442
[SPEAKER_16]: And he gave us a commitment publicly that that road will not be opened up.

464
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:20,627
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was nice to hear the chief take such a stance that that road will not be opened up at all.

465
00:40:21,848 --> 00:40:34,058
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's clear, Mr. President, when you look at the aerial view that we received, that this project was built to maximize the potential of housing on the site.

466
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:48,854
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's quite stunning when you look at it and see the greenery and Felsmere Park, and all of a sudden, smack in the middle, it looks like a mini city that's going to develop.

467
00:40:48,874 --> 00:40:58,077
[SPEAKER_16]: The question I had, and I don't know if Bob can answer it or not, is the construction timeline with the existing, has there been any type of?

468
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:06,298
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as we know, there isn't any construction timeline or plan yet.

469
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:10,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say it's probably a good thing from our point of view.

470
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:27,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that there's a lot of issues that this developer is going to have to get through before getting to the point where he could start to have a timeline and some zoning issues that would have to be worked out.

471
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:34,793
[SPEAKER_10]: all those sorts of things before a project, you know, he can really start to schedule a project.

472
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:46,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we're still early enough in this process that we can have some say because, yeah, there's no project schedule as of yet.

473
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:58,042
[SPEAKER_16]: When we met with, I believe it was one of the developers or someone from the Community Development Board in Malden, I believe at the time they mentioned that

474
00:41:58,747 --> 00:42:09,793
[SPEAKER_16]: The way the project was going to be set up, that Lund Road, even though it was supposed to be cut through for the project, was the interior roads were going to be winding roads.

475
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:14,076
[SPEAKER_16]: And that they were going to make it difficult for people to go that way.

476
00:42:14,336 --> 00:42:18,058
[SPEAKER_16]: They were trying to focus people more to Murray Hill and the back of the project.

477
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:19,859
[SPEAKER_16]: And none of us bought it.

478
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:21,800
[SPEAKER_16]: We said, that just doesn't sound right.

479
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it could open up that whole secondary cut through at Salmon Street.

480
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:31,423
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because again, that traffic, as we all know, backs up on Fellsway East.

481
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:38,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And so people say, hey, I can bail out here, cut across this development, and then past Fitzy's house and out to the highway.

482
00:42:38,946 --> 00:42:45,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I would assume people are trying to get on to the Fellsway and up onto 93 and access whichever way.

483
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:48,269
[SPEAKER_16]: And the quickest way is probably the cut through.

484
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:49,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

485
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:55,872
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think they were being disingenuous when they were saying, you know, we're going to put speed bumps, and we're going to put do not come this way.

486
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:58,987
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we're going to try to discourage people from coming in that area.

487
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:04,410
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think, clearly, the intent is to use that as a cutthroat.

488
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:11,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just ask, Mr. President, that our Office of Community Development — I know it's only staffed with one and a half people.

489
00:43:12,854 --> 00:43:16,075
[SPEAKER_16]: We had our budget discussions tonight.

490
00:43:16,915 --> 00:43:21,317
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would ask that they play a more active role in this project.

491
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:24,579
[SPEAKER_16]: I realize it's on the Malden side, but as good neighbors,

492
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure the city of Malden wants to work with the city of Medford in that.

493
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,232
[SPEAKER_16]: The OCD director pledged that to us tonight.

494
00:43:32,952 --> 00:43:36,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I know, but I'd like to see more of an active role.

495
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,133
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to see more community outreach.

496
00:43:39,614 --> 00:43:48,496
[SPEAKER_16]: We use reverse 911 for everything under the sun now, and maybe it'd be nice to notify because we could hit particular neighborhoods with the reverse 911.

497
00:43:49,517 --> 00:43:53,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Let neighbors know when there's meetings in Malden or vice versa.

498
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:54,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Let them know updates.

499
00:43:55,445 --> 00:44:01,287
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, why not use the technology that we currently have to at least keep people apprised of what's going on?

500
00:44:02,227 --> 00:44:22,453
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I think this project will vet itself out over the years, and I'm hoping that through the input of the neighborhood and your group and the community sticking together that we'll see a downscale project, one that suits both cities and makes sense.

501
00:44:22,513 --> 00:44:23,933
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we all want to see development.

502
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:28,072
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, but I think we have to do it in a manner that respects neighborhoods.

503
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:34,857
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we have, right here in Medford Square, three undeveloped parcels of property on the east side of the square.

504
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:36,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Talk about an area that's undeveloped.

505
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:44,884
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, so I'm all in favor of development, but I think we have to do it in a way that maintains the integrity of the area and so forth.

506
00:44:44,964 --> 00:44:51,869
[SPEAKER_16]: And clearly, this project, in my opinion, is oversized and is not well-suited for that particular area.

507
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:53,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

508
00:44:54,564 --> 00:45:01,189
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilors Camuso, Mox, and Councilor Camuso.

509
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:07,834
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm very sorry to speak again on this issue, but these plans were put forward by you, Mr. Kelty.

510
00:45:07,974 --> 00:45:08,835
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you draw these ones?

511
00:45:08,855 --> 00:45:18,262
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a charrette with the architect, the landscape architect did these things.

512
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:18,683
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason is?

513
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:36,471
[SPEAKER_22]: The new cut-through that's proposed on, the new proposal is diverting the traffic from Lund Road, now to Murray Hill Road, and then to Falz Ave.

514
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:43,658
[SPEAKER_22]: I think, uh, I know he, I know they talked, this says new cut-through, that's why I'm a little, I think that was just conceptual.

515
00:45:44,893 --> 00:45:53,106
[SPEAKER_06]: You see what I'm saying, the city council stance is we don't want any kind of... Jones here, Cedar Road North, that isn't a guess from the neighbors of how it's going to happen.

516
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:56,130
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a proposed... Because if you go to Murray Hill Road right now... That's not a proposed cut through.

517
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:57,733
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we know they're going to go through.

518
00:45:58,637 --> 00:45:59,037
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, OK.

519
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,117
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just a guess.

520
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:04,498
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just where you were showing us these boards, and I thought that this was the title.

521
00:46:04,518 --> 00:46:05,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

522
00:46:05,258 --> 00:46:06,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know where they're going through now.

523
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:09,359
[SPEAKER_06]: We know where they went through before, and we're just going to estimate they're going to go through again.

524
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:11,579
[SPEAKER_22]: Which, that's where the traffic commission comes into play.

525
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:14,260
[SPEAKER_22]: I just thought it was part and parcel of all.

526
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for clarifying that.

527
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:15,460
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

528
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Joan.

529
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:22,901
[SPEAKER_13]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

530
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:24,421
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

531
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:26,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion carries.

532
00:46:26,182 --> 00:46:27,242
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're under suspension,

533
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:41,752
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to do condolences offered by Councilors Knight and Camuso.

534
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:52,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council offers its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of firefighter Timothy Brennan on his recent passing.

535
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:57,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And also offered by Councilor Henta under

536
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:11,688
[SPEAKER_13]: suspension be resolved that our Medford City Council take a moment of silence and extend to the family of mentored firefighter Timothy Brennan our expression of sympathy on his untimely passing.

537
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:12,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Camuso.

538
00:47:12,669 --> 00:47:22,494
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you Mr. President and I want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Penta for for joining in and having this resolution for a wonderful person.

539
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:23,635
[SPEAKER_22]: We're all friendly

540
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:26,716
[SPEAKER_22]: here with the Brennan family in our community.

541
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:41,265
[SPEAKER_22]: I had the distinct pleasure of chatting every Tuesday night with young Timothy after our council meetings and he'd be giving me the critique in it on how we all did it on the evening and everything else.

542
00:47:41,706 --> 00:47:48,990
[SPEAKER_22]: The, um, Timmy, I remember way, way back when, when I was a little kid, Timmy was a little older working with Marilyn Perica's campaign.

543
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,712
[SPEAKER_22]: We were just little kids walking the streets.

544
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:51,252
[SPEAKER_22]: That's when, uh,

545
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:57,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Penta was a councilor back in 87, 88.

546
00:47:58,033 --> 00:48:02,214
[SPEAKER_22]: And I remember seeing all the councilors, and it was a great race.

547
00:48:02,294 --> 00:48:05,896
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just remember Timmy walking the streets, and we were just young kids.

548
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:16,481
[SPEAKER_22]: Then fast forward to 1997, I was lucky enough to have worked with Timmy in his work to get on the Medford City Council.

549
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:21,483
[SPEAKER_22]: Ultimately, Timmy landed his dream job, and that was with his dad.

550
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:26,397
[SPEAKER_22]: uh, was Bob as well as his three brothers, Tom, Eddie, and Jimmy.

551
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:28,678
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was a firefighter in the city of Medford.

552
00:48:29,399 --> 00:48:35,663
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, many people didn't realize that, uh, Timmy has been sick for a little, little while.

553
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:50,352
[SPEAKER_22]: And, um, ultimately the, um, he, uh, gave a valiant fight and unfortunately, uh, last Tuesday evening when we were wrapping up our city council meeting here, uh, Timmy passed away at the mass general hospital with his family by his side.

554
00:48:51,402 --> 00:49:05,425
[SPEAKER_22]: So just if we could send our condolences to Helen and the three boys, and if we could dedicate tonight's meeting in honor of Timothy Brennan, Medford firefighter from Engine 4, that we're going to sorely miss at the young age of 46.

555
00:49:05,665 --> 00:49:07,545
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor.

556
00:49:07,565 --> 00:49:08,065
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight.

557
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

558
00:49:10,225 --> 00:49:12,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And Councilor Camuso, I certainly echo your sentiments.

559
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:19,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we could all sit here all night long and talk about Timmy Brennan and tell Timmy Brennan stories about what a great guy he was.

560
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:22,898
[SPEAKER_09]: what a great public servant he was and what a great firefighter he was.

561
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:30,660
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think Chief Goulding from the Western Police Department, who formerly was lieutenant detective here in the city of Medford, put it best.

562
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:37,261
[SPEAKER_09]: When talking about Timmy Brennan, he said, if someone has a problem with Timmy Brennan, there's probably a problem with that person.

563
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,581
[SPEAKER_09]: And honestly, I think that that's really the way that Timmy went through life.

564
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:41,482
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a friend to many.

565
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:43,162
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a great gentleman.

566
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:47,923
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a person that I'm privileged and honored to have been able to call a friend, Mr. President, and he'll be sadly missed.

567
00:49:51,308 --> 00:49:54,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, it's, um, it is a sad day for the city of Medford.

568
00:49:55,032 --> 00:50:06,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think Timmy was looked upon by his peers as not being a lesser in rank individual, but a person who basically set a tempo, his smile, his walk, his jog.

569
00:50:07,544 --> 00:50:15,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he was, he was actively involved in this community and thought and process, um, comes from a good stock of family and God bless his mother.

570
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:19,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, at the wake, she was just tremendous.

571
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:26,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think she realized that God took him and now he's looking down and giving peace to his family.

572
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:30,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, um, it's the saddest part of life.

573
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:31,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you just don't have the right word.

574
00:50:31,832 --> 00:50:35,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't know what to say, other than the fact that he was a good individual.

575
00:50:35,454 --> 00:50:39,615
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a friend of mine and he's going to be missed.

576
00:50:42,197 --> 00:50:42,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

577
00:50:43,963 --> 00:50:44,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

578
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:50,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to echo the sentiments of my colleagues, I think we all got to know Timmy very well over the years.

579
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:57,746
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember when he first ran for public office, he ran for city council, and his slogan was, people, not politics.

580
00:50:58,326 --> 00:50:59,466
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's how he lived his life.

581
00:51:00,106 --> 00:51:02,287
[SPEAKER_16]: He was always about taking the time to talk to you.

582
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:07,968
[SPEAKER_16]: He'd sit down, as Councilor Camuso said, and we'd talk politics, or he'd talk about what's going on in the fire department.

583
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:10,188
[SPEAKER_16]: He was also active in the Elks Club.

584
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:15,191
[SPEAKER_16]: He was just a down-to-earth, real gentleman.

585
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:21,396
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, when I saw his brother the other day, he said, you know, they got the better of the brothers.

586
00:51:22,757 --> 00:51:32,145
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, words spoken, really, Timmy was just a unique person, someone that you meet and you become friends with them automatically.

587
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:35,268
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you didn't need to hang around with them every day.

588
00:51:35,288 --> 00:51:36,629
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't need to go out to dinner with them.

589
00:51:37,049 --> 00:51:38,130
[SPEAKER_16]: He just became your friend.

590
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,880
[SPEAKER_16]: And he was always warm and welcoming.

591
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:51,062
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wish Tom, Ed, and Jim and Helen, in these tough days, a lot of solace.

592
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:53,803
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope they get through it all right.

593
00:51:54,523 --> 00:51:56,883
[SPEAKER_16]: And he will be sorely missed in the fire department.

594
00:51:56,903 --> 00:52:00,704
[SPEAKER_16]: I know all his brothers and sisters in the fire department sorely miss him.

595
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:04,485
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I think we all miss him, Mr. President.

596
00:52:09,101 --> 00:52:10,782
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion, please rise for a moment of silence.

597
00:52:29,654 --> 00:52:38,920
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're on to suspension, 15-508, offered by Councilors Mox and Bento, be it resolved that the Tufts University girls softball team be congratulated for winning

598
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:41,487
[SPEAKER_13]: their national championship.

599
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:42,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta.

600
00:52:43,008 --> 00:52:49,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I think the resolution speaks volumes for Tufts University Athletic Department.

601
00:52:49,974 --> 00:52:54,818
[SPEAKER_03]: They have quite an array of individuals up there who are winning championships.

602
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:02,003
[SPEAKER_03]: But this girl's softball team, some people may want to call it women's, some people want to call it girls.

603
00:53:04,245 --> 00:53:05,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Call it what you may.

604
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:08,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Bottom line is they've won for three consecutive years in a row.

605
00:53:09,763 --> 00:53:14,447
[SPEAKER_03]: the NCAA Division III Championship.

606
00:53:14,507 --> 00:53:16,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great feat.

607
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:19,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one of the players with us in the audience tonight.

608
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:27,135
[SPEAKER_03]: The unfortunate part of getting them up here, a lot of these students are graduating or already have graduated and gone, left home.

609
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:34,220
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe the young lady that's sitting in the audience can come up, say a few words, and accept the accolades of

610
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,022
[SPEAKER_03]: doing your college proud, but you did our city of Medford proud, too, because Tufts University is part of our city of Medford.

611
00:53:40,683 --> 00:53:43,844
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Councilor Marks wants to just make a few remarks.

612
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:44,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Just if I could.

613
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:47,926
[SPEAKER_16]: And I thank my colleague, Councilor Penta, for offering this with me.

614
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:52,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Tufts went 51-0 this year.

615
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:59,471
[SPEAKER_16]: What an accomplishment.

616
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:00,992
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, Mr. President.

617
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:03,113
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't even hit a beach ball, let alone a softball.

618
00:54:03,672 --> 00:54:06,014
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, it's a true accomplishment.

619
00:54:07,195 --> 00:54:12,378
[SPEAKER_16]: The championship game was held on May 26th in Salem, Virginia.

620
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:24,126
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Councilor Penta mentioned, they've won three consecutive national Division III titles, and they were the first Division III softball team to win three titles ever.

621
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Consecutive titles.

622
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:28,229
[SPEAKER_16]: So that alone is an accomplishment, Mr. President.

623
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:32,012
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, not many people know, but for years,

624
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:40,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Tufts could not host an NCAA game because their fields weren't up to the NCAA codes.

625
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:55,532
[SPEAKER_16]: And this was the first time that they were able to host an NCAA game, which I think was a big accomplishment, especially from a team that has won the national title now to be able to play at home.

626
00:54:56,273 --> 00:55:02,137
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also have one of Medford's own, Lauren Epstein, who is the associate head coach

627
00:55:02,765 --> 00:55:04,366
[SPEAKER_16]: and played back in 2007.

628
00:55:04,486 --> 00:55:18,494
[SPEAKER_16]: We won't date you, but she played back in 2007, but has done Yeoman's work in putting together a program that now is seen nationally, which is a huge accomplishment.

629
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:20,395
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wish the girls well.

630
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:32,122
[SPEAKER_16]: You could take back word from this Medford City Council that we are on board with the Jumbos and that we are in full support of the girls softball team.

631
00:55:32,764 --> 00:55:35,927
[SPEAKER_16]: And I appreciate, Mr. President, the opportunity to speak.

632
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:38,068
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks and Council Penta.

633
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Coach.

634
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:40,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

635
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:42,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for taking the time to honor us.

636
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,034
[SPEAKER_12]: It was obviously a very good run this year.

637
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:48,296
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, I guess you could say, the best of our three runs.

638
00:55:49,257 --> 00:55:55,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Finishing the season undefeated was not something we talked about, but something everyone else wanted to talk about during the course of the year.

639
00:55:56,543 --> 00:55:59,264
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was obviously very exciting to finish the season undefeated.

640
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:05,627
[SPEAKER_12]: First team to win a national championship in Division Three with an undefeated season in the three consecutive ones.

641
00:56:05,687 --> 00:56:09,189
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think what meant the most was playing at home this year in the playoffs.

642
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:17,073
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been on the road and we called ourselves road warriors, but to be able to play at home was awesome and only something that was possible because of the new field.

643
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:18,473
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so much.

644
00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:19,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

645
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:20,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Wish you good luck.

646
00:56:20,234 --> 00:56:23,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, just if I could, and maybe Lauren

647
00:56:25,155 --> 00:56:30,337
[SPEAKER_16]: On the way back, they ran into some difficulties getting back to Tufts.

648
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:36,678
[SPEAKER_16]: And Lauren was just explaining to me, it was like that movie, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.

649
00:56:37,379 --> 00:56:40,600
[SPEAKER_16]: They went through a lot of different avenues to get back home.

650
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:47,862
[SPEAKER_16]: And we just want to welcome them all back safe and thank them for representing not only Tufts, but the city of Medford.

651
00:56:48,262 --> 00:56:48,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

652
00:56:48,882 --> 00:56:49,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

653
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta, seconded by Councilor Morocco.

654
00:56:58,968 --> 00:57:11,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, could we have a citation forwarded to the Tufts University Athletic Department, giving recognition to the girls receiving this award, and have that sent on a roll call vote, Mr. President.

655
00:57:12,274 --> 00:57:14,655
[SPEAKER_13]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

656
00:57:19,177 --> 00:57:20,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso.

657
00:57:20,378 --> 00:57:23,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

658
00:57:27,883 --> 00:57:28,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

659
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:29,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

660
00:57:31,305 --> 00:57:31,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

661
00:57:31,946 --> 00:57:34,888
[SPEAKER_13]: And the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent.

662
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:42,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion of Councilor Lungo-Curran to revert back to the regular order of business.

663
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:42,813
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

664
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,274
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

665
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:48,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion carries.

666
00:57:48,797 --> 00:57:52,379
[SPEAKER_13]: 15-498 offered by President Dello Russo and Councilor Knight.

667
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the city solicitor advise and render an opinion

668
00:57:57,398 --> 00:58:04,962
[SPEAKER_13]: to the council as to the process and parameters for the council to establish a charter review committee.

669
00:58:13,187 --> 00:58:14,147
[SPEAKER_13]: It says what it wants.

670
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:19,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

671
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak on this matter.

672
00:58:23,341 --> 00:58:26,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, this matter was filed under suspension at the request of Councilor Penta.

673
00:58:26,723 --> 00:58:31,245
[SPEAKER_09]: We tabled it for this week to have the residents have an opportunity to come up and speak.

674
00:58:32,185 --> 00:58:39,148
[SPEAKER_09]: With that being said, Mr. President, I think that we might want to allow the residents to come up and speak on whether or not they're in support of a Charter Review Commission.

675
00:58:39,168 --> 00:58:43,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's been an undercurrent of residents in the community who have spoken on this issue a number of times.

676
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:48,392
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been several meetings that have taken place by this community group to take a look at the charter.

677
00:58:49,273 --> 00:58:52,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, there is a citizen-driven effort that's out there.

678
00:58:52,323 --> 00:59:00,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe some of the citizens that are out in the audience who have participated in such can tell us about their experience, about the progress and process that they've made, and then we can go from there.

679
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:01,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

680
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:02,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Pentland, do you want to speak?

681
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,990
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

682
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:08,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

683
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Please state your name and address for the record.

684
00:59:10,795 --> 00:59:11,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

685
00:59:12,035 --> 00:59:14,797
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

686
00:59:15,478 --> 00:59:18,760
[SPEAKER_18]: It was about four years ago, I want to say,

687
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:30,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Another resident of Medford and I tried to establish a charter review committee, Dr. Stirella, that you are all very aware of.

688
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:35,403
[SPEAKER_18]: From my perspective, it's a huge undertaking.

689
00:59:35,464 --> 00:59:44,750
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we had to get something like 10,000 signatures just to get it on the ballot, and then it has to be voted on by the city at large.

690
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:51,409
[SPEAKER_18]: either the mayor or this body could vote to have one formed.

691
00:59:53,770 --> 01:00:03,413
[SPEAKER_18]: My support of a charter review commission or committee or whatever you want to call it stems from just a couple of simple things.

692
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:09,556
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been operating under the plan A strong mayor charter now for almost 30 years.

693
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:16,098
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just think it's prudent, practical, logical just to establish a review of the charter.

694
01:00:16,852 --> 01:00:27,478
[SPEAKER_18]: to see if that's the way we want to continue functioning our city government in the manner we've been operating it for decades now, almost three decades.

695
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:37,223
[SPEAKER_18]: Many businesses out there from 1988 we're talking here, maybe earlier, just don't operate under the same business model.

696
01:00:37,523 --> 01:00:44,887
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just think it makes sense for us to review it, especially with certain things that are going on.

697
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:46,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll stick to the charter.

698
01:00:47,222 --> 01:00:51,024
[SPEAKER_18]: But I mean, there are reasons why we want to review the charter.

699
01:00:51,525 --> 01:00:53,726
[SPEAKER_18]: We're understaffed in the police force.

700
01:00:53,866 --> 01:00:55,147
[SPEAKER_18]: The building's falling apart.

701
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:57,748
[SPEAKER_18]: There's water and sewer pipes.

702
01:00:58,108 --> 01:00:59,209
[SPEAKER_18]: There's pay scales.

703
01:00:59,569 --> 01:01:03,311
[SPEAKER_18]: There's all sorts of reasons why we want to look at the charter review.

704
01:01:03,551 --> 01:01:13,396
[SPEAKER_18]: And another reason to look at it is maybe we want to change it to go to ward representation as opposed to at large.

705
01:01:13,476 --> 01:01:16,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I really think that's a great thing.

706
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:26,889
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that some of you councillors are against that because it kind of like pits the city against each other, but I think that spirit of competition is good.

707
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:44,613
[SPEAKER_18]: I think when you have, like what we were talking about earlier tonight, you got the Heights, they could have like their representative on the city council, and that person could be doing all they could to become specialized and expert

708
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,989
[SPEAKER_18]: and experts on knowing what's going to go up there at the Malden Hospital.

709
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:51,812
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, there's all sorts of horse trading.

710
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:58,716
[SPEAKER_18]: We all know who pay attention and are active in politics, the way things get advanced.

711
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:11,725
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, when you have different representations from different wards, it just seems in that spirit of competition, we hold each other to higher standards and more things get done.

712
01:02:12,497 --> 01:02:39,477
[SPEAKER_18]: And finally, on the topic of ward representation, that I really think this city needs, it affords the opportunity for more voices to rise, for a diversity in background, for people to get elected in their ward, to run a smaller, more economical campaign, so that we get more different people

713
01:02:40,532 --> 01:02:48,639
[SPEAKER_18]: up here on this body, with all due respect, are that the ward can, you know, keep electing the same representative for years.

714
01:02:48,939 --> 01:03:04,592
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not that I am kind of for term limits, but I'm not against having, you know, the same representatives for sometimes decades at a time, some of whom I like very much and I would personally keep voting for.

715
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:08,155
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, it all comes back to opportunity.

716
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:16,597
[SPEAKER_18]: and providing as much opportunity for more citizens who may want to run that might not be able to afford it.

717
01:03:16,937 --> 01:03:26,902
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there were tens of thousands of dollars spent in the city election in 2013 by one candidate on the city council.

718
01:03:26,943 --> 01:03:28,383
[SPEAKER_18]: And I mean, I won't mention who.

719
01:03:28,423 --> 01:03:31,445
[SPEAKER_18]: People can look up the public record and find out for themselves.

720
01:03:31,885 --> 01:03:34,707
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's a lot of money to spend.

721
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:38,272
[SPEAKER_18]: for a job that pays much less than what was spent.

722
01:03:38,752 --> 01:03:43,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Under ward representation, somebody could possibly win a city council seat for maybe $1,000, $2,000.

723
01:03:46,535 --> 01:04:03,301
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just better to review our city charter after so many years, to look at the way city government runs, to look at some of the problems we're having in this city, and maybe open doors for new people to rise up and have a voice, because we're privileged

724
01:04:03,825 --> 01:04:14,071
[SPEAKER_18]: to live in a country where we have the freedoms that we have and the opportunities that we have, and to expand these freedoms and these opportunities only makes sense.

725
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:28,040
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope that this body, after hearing from more citizens, will deeply consider and move forward on establishing a charter commission committee and review.

726
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for your time.

727
01:04:31,782 --> 01:04:33,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

728
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:36,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

729
01:04:37,027 --> 01:04:38,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

730
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:40,129
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

731
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:41,891
[SPEAKER_19]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

732
01:04:43,712 --> 01:04:46,554
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a sad fact of local politics.

733
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:55,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Our turnout, voter turnout, only one in every four registered voters in Medford actually vote for our local elections.

734
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,461
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do you think it's so low?

735
01:04:58,322 --> 01:04:59,743
[SPEAKER_19]: There's obviously a lot of theories.

736
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:05,987
[SPEAKER_19]: But walking through the city, people are very sort of, they've given up.

737
01:05:07,149 --> 01:05:09,670
[SPEAKER_19]: on city politics, and it's heartbreaking in a way.

738
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:23,135
[SPEAKER_19]: By us reviewing the charter, we can enliven the debate, bring more people into the process, add more sunlight into the process, how the budget is made, how are zoning decisions made.

739
01:05:23,555 --> 01:05:25,596
[SPEAKER_19]: These are vital issues to our community.

740
01:05:26,376 --> 01:05:33,099
[SPEAKER_19]: To begin to work them, creating a charter review committee is essential.

741
01:05:33,732 --> 01:05:42,721
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you look through Chapter 43B, Section 10, it's in the Mass General Law, there are actually two flavors of charter review commissions.

742
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:45,484
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it's important that the council know of the two flavors.

743
01:05:46,384 --> 01:05:52,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is the question that we're looking to ask the city solicitor, correct?

744
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:55,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

745
01:05:57,721 --> 01:05:58,562
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are two flavors.

746
01:05:59,402 --> 01:06:20,117
[SPEAKER_19]: One, if this board decides to create a commission under two-thirds vote, that commission will not have the ability to answer certain questions and will not be able to even advise about term limits or other issues like changing the mayor or significant changes to the charter.

747
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:26,862
[SPEAKER_19]: An elected board, however, will have the capacity to make significant changes to the charter or actually recommend them.

748
01:06:28,368 --> 01:06:33,252
[SPEAKER_19]: In this capacity, I would recommend that we try to move forward to creating an elected commission.

749
01:06:33,992 --> 01:06:35,814
[SPEAKER_19]: So there will be a vote on the ballot.

750
01:06:35,934 --> 01:06:37,695
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to review the charter, yes or no?

751
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:42,778
[SPEAKER_19]: And then people will vote for a number of elected people that will actually be on this position.

752
01:06:43,979 --> 01:06:47,542
[SPEAKER_19]: That is the direction that we should go and I hope we have an opportunity to come to that conclusion.

753
01:06:47,842 --> 01:06:48,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

754
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:50,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

755
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:53,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

756
01:06:53,447 --> 01:06:55,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Please state your name and address for the record.

757
01:06:55,509 --> 01:06:57,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario Martin at 17 Dependent Road in Medford.

758
01:07:00,352 --> 01:07:07,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to kind of echo what Mr. Capucci and Ruggiero was saying regarding our charter.

759
01:07:08,618 --> 01:07:11,760
[SPEAKER_01]: The charter is an old document that dictates how decisions are made within the city.

760
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:22,108
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been no charter review since 1986 when it was changed from a strong city council to a more centralized and depressed and stagnant administration.

761
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:26,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I don't know why a mayor would even put himself in that position, but anyways.

762
01:07:27,788 --> 01:07:34,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the review of a charter, the new mayor can veto ordinances and resolutions passed by the city council.

763
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:40,975
[SPEAKER_01]: It also allows the mayor to chair the city's school committee and receive a stipend.

764
01:07:44,417 --> 01:07:50,300
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time this charter has ever been reviewed is to increase the mayor's salary, which sadly I think is, well, it's pretty sad.

765
01:07:52,649 --> 01:07:55,170
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds incredibly narcissistic if you really think about it.

766
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:59,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last time I checked, I think we ended this back in our Revolutionary War era.

767
01:08:00,391 --> 01:08:04,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Residents are really frustrated with this current, with this, you know, the way this is working.

768
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:13,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, granted, I mean, the City Council is the backbone of our community.

769
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:21,838
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the front end to allow community feedback and, you know, give the City Council an opportunity

770
01:08:22,518 --> 01:08:25,280
[SPEAKER_01]: to direct things to the mayor to better and improve the city.

771
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we need to be looking at.

772
01:08:30,342 --> 01:08:35,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to give these powers back to the city council so we can give it back to the community.

773
01:08:35,906 --> 01:08:41,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very strongly in favor of it, and I hope that you guys would consider it.

774
01:08:41,309 --> 01:08:41,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

775
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. Martin.

776
01:08:48,213 --> 01:08:48,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

777
01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:50,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

778
01:08:50,761 --> 01:08:52,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

779
01:08:53,822 --> 01:09:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we had a little bit of a discussion last week on this, but it's very important that we consider changing, reviewing the, the charter because, um, for instance, having in the last couple of weeks going, going over the ledgers of the city of Medford, looking at the budgets present past, um,

780
01:09:20,186 --> 01:09:22,107
[SPEAKER_04]: this oversight is missing in this city.

781
01:09:22,687 --> 01:09:27,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, you know, I hate to say this, but the spending in the city is almost like a drunken sailor.

782
01:09:27,851 --> 01:09:33,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate to use that clause, but I mean, I am amazed at what is being spent in the city.

783
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:35,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hear people say, well, we can't do this.

784
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,898
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do that because there's no money left.

785
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,479
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of money there.

786
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just how we present our budget.

787
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:45,825
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fact is that the council should have a strong say

788
01:09:46,306 --> 01:09:47,827
[SPEAKER_04]: in what we do when it comes to the budget.

789
01:09:47,847 --> 01:09:49,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying yes or no on that.

790
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:51,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying why did you present this budget?

791
01:09:51,929 --> 01:09:53,750
[SPEAKER_04]: No, go back and this is what you have to do.

792
01:09:54,190 --> 01:10:00,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, has anybody got the actual title of the type of budgeting we process in this city?

793
01:10:01,053 --> 01:10:03,674
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, is it zero-based budgeting?

794
01:10:04,175 --> 01:10:07,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just, you know, adding on from last year's budget?

795
01:10:07,857 --> 01:10:12,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one of the things I noticed is an awful lot of transfers and money, and that affects the budget.

796
01:10:13,465 --> 01:10:16,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And there shouldn't be that kind of excess money, surplus money in the budget to do that.

797
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:20,068
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is that you have to have a balance of power.

798
01:10:20,088 --> 01:10:24,630
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have one individual running a city of 56,000 people.

799
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:27,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually think there's a lot more than 56,000 people in here.

800
01:10:28,372 --> 01:10:36,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we just had an article come out on the 26,000 housing units, housing stock, with this thing saying that we're below the affordable housing percentage.

801
01:10:41,134 --> 01:10:45,057
[SPEAKER_04]: units of housing, we have 56,000 residents in the city.

802
01:10:45,877 --> 01:10:49,660
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we only have 56,000 residents?

803
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:55,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you take two times the 26,000, there's 52,000 people right there.

804
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:57,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very important.

805
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:03,650
[SPEAKER_04]: And last week I talked to you through the chair, through Councilor Knight, you had asked me some information about the previous meetings.

806
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:06,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I do recall, and I believe,

807
01:11:09,004 --> 01:11:11,886
[SPEAKER_04]: to the chair also, the city clerk may be able to confirm this.

808
01:11:11,926 --> 01:11:15,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I did post and time date the meetings.

809
01:11:15,529 --> 01:11:18,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we did have other Councilors and other prospective Councilors come to the meetings.

810
01:11:19,732 --> 01:11:26,958
[SPEAKER_04]: The minutes were, it was pretty much information that we gathered from the state and we passed on to each other and we read and looked at it.

811
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:33,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, then as I said, we got dumped on the, uh, on the issue before the council to pursue it any further.

812
01:11:34,303 --> 01:11:36,385
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, as far as your request for the minutes,

813
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:46,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the minutes were basically just chapters, verses from the State, you know, the Department of Revenue, the Secretary of State, and some from the city itself.

814
01:11:47,225 --> 01:11:51,327
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had interest in the charter review, and I think it's very important.

815
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:59,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And a point that was brought up was that with ward Councilors, I think the Councilors can do a better job in their wards.

816
01:12:01,005 --> 01:12:05,767
[SPEAKER_04]: It's difficult to be a councilor at large because you've got all these people that need and have questions.

817
01:12:06,008 --> 01:12:07,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's almost impossible to do this.

818
01:12:07,809 --> 01:12:13,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a councilor in itself is almost a 24 hour day, seven days a week job.

819
01:12:14,632 --> 01:12:18,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the people deserve much better than we're getting now.

820
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:21,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying from the council, I'm saying from the city administration.

821
01:12:22,396 --> 01:12:29,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, and I don't want people to think that because we're gonna have the city solicitor render an opinion on the charter,

822
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:41,443
[SPEAKER_04]: that this is an ongoing process and the charter is now under review, because a lot of people asked me that question last week, and I said, no, it's just for the city solicitor to render an opinion.

823
01:12:41,963 --> 01:12:50,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So please remember that, people that are listening out there, that it's only an opinion, and that it may mysteriously disappear after the election.

824
01:12:51,085 --> 01:12:56,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So please be aware of that, and please, if you're serious about a charter review, let's get it on board.

825
01:12:57,026 --> 01:12:57,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

826
01:13:01,597 --> 01:13:02,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

827
01:13:02,217 --> 01:13:04,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

828
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:09,262
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Massachusetts.

829
01:13:09,363 --> 01:13:18,649
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to thank the councilors who voted on behalf of charter change way back when you showed courage, you showed integrity, you worked for the people.

830
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:27,635
[SPEAKER_21]: The councilors that voted against it were the same ones that voted for their own pay raise and not to show my video of the mayor with the pay to park plan.

831
01:13:28,016 --> 01:13:29,597
[SPEAKER_21]: I want voters to remember that 153 days from today,

832
01:13:32,188 --> 01:13:35,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Those of us who showed up at the Charter Review hearing, we did hard work.

833
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:36,971
[SPEAKER_21]: We wrote up articles.

834
01:13:37,511 --> 01:13:38,631
[SPEAKER_21]: We fought for this.

835
01:13:38,912 --> 01:13:46,075
[SPEAKER_21]: And those councilors who are alleging they're doing the people's work, they need to vote for the people that are doing the hard work.

836
01:13:46,476 --> 01:13:48,877
[SPEAKER_21]: So the councilors that did vote for that, thank you very much.

837
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

838
01:13:56,241 --> 01:13:58,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record, Jean.

839
01:13:58,615 --> 01:13:59,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

840
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:00,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Jean Martin, 10 Coming Street.

841
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:01,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for listening.

842
01:14:03,676 --> 01:14:16,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a member of the charter review, and it is a massive undertaking if you do it through the channel that doesn't include you folks just voting for it to happen.

843
01:14:17,398 --> 01:14:18,719
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get so many votes.

844
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:21,019
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have, there's time limits for everything.

845
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an 18-month process.

846
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take a lot for the people

847
01:14:27,258 --> 01:14:29,279
[SPEAKER_05]: to get active and to get engaged.

848
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

849
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,841
[SPEAKER_05]: The people are ready for it.

850
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:33,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the city has changed.

851
01:14:33,842 --> 01:14:35,243
[SPEAKER_05]: The character of the city is changing.

852
01:14:35,803 --> 01:14:37,044
[SPEAKER_05]: From 1988 or 1986 to 2015, 2016, this city has changed a lot.

853
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:56,710
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that if it's done right, if you folks are behind it, and you invite everybody to come and to participate in the process, it's their way.

854
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:01,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can do the review, and it might stay the exact same way.

855
01:15:02,153 --> 01:15:03,374
[SPEAKER_05]: You can let it happen that way.

856
01:15:03,854 --> 01:15:06,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can tweak it, or you can change it drastically.

857
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:08,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all up to you.

858
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:11,119
[SPEAKER_05]: The options are varied.

859
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:11,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a menu.

860
01:15:13,065 --> 01:15:17,846
[SPEAKER_05]: of plan A, plan B, plan C, plan D, plan E, plan F. I broke it all down.

861
01:15:18,466 --> 01:15:20,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it at my house on a computer.

862
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:23,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And they vary differently.

863
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:28,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And the one thing that I would say is that this city needs more checks and balances.

864
01:15:28,768 --> 01:15:33,349
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a strong mayor, but that consolidates too much power in the hands of one person.

865
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:36,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to see it disseminated a little bit.

866
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:39,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be disseminated like it was

867
01:15:42,434 --> 01:15:47,319
[SPEAKER_05]: 1988, because I remember those days, and that was horrific for this city.

868
01:15:47,799 --> 01:15:49,001
[SPEAKER_05]: The E plan was horrific.

869
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:53,225
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a middle ground, and I think that we need to find that middle ground.

870
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:58,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's up to the people to decide what the menu of how they want to run their city is.

871
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the people's choice.

872
01:16:01,412 --> 01:16:05,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that if you guys invite everybody, and it's done right, we can come together,

873
01:16:06,523 --> 01:16:09,845
[SPEAKER_05]: It also is a place where you can vent your frustrations as a citizen.

874
01:16:10,765 --> 01:16:19,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And believe me, when things get tight, parking, money, developments, there's going to be a frustration in the people.

875
01:16:19,069 --> 01:16:20,750
[SPEAKER_05]: But the people will have more of a voice.

876
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:24,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they feel more heard, their frustration levels will decrease.

877
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:26,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it benefits everyone.

878
01:16:26,793 --> 01:16:28,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thank you very much for listening.

879
01:16:33,457 --> 01:16:33,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

880
01:16:34,117 --> 01:16:35,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

881
01:16:36,118 --> 01:16:39,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Michael DiBenedettino, 8 Alexander Avenue, Medford.

882
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,521
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a great opportunity right now.

883
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:50,064
[SPEAKER_17]: With your yes vote, what's gonna happen is you're gonna allow the city of Medford to prosper.

884
01:16:51,244 --> 01:16:59,327
[SPEAKER_17]: To prosper and to bring it from the age of the dinosaurs to the new era, an era of collaboration.

885
01:17:00,528 --> 01:17:03,389
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not about one person, this is about a city.

886
01:17:05,266 --> 01:17:07,047
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, you guys are doing a great job.

887
01:17:07,468 --> 01:17:09,089
[SPEAKER_17]: You are here to support the people.

888
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:12,272
[SPEAKER_17]: And you love Medford.

889
01:17:13,152 --> 01:17:14,673
[SPEAKER_17]: This is about the city that you love.

890
01:17:15,514 --> 01:17:17,035
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about the city that you care for.

891
01:17:18,797 --> 01:17:20,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's put aside our differences.

892
01:17:21,098 --> 01:17:22,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's move forward.

893
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's collaborate on this one issue at least.

894
01:17:25,622 --> 01:17:26,523
[SPEAKER_17]: At least one issue.

895
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:31,787
[SPEAKER_17]: And going forward, there'll be more issues that can be resolved.

896
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:37,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Our mayor does a good job.

897
01:17:38,365 --> 01:17:39,586
[SPEAKER_17]: He has a lot of responsibility.

898
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:48,291
[SPEAKER_17]: But we need someone that is open to new ideas, that listen to other opinions.

899
01:17:51,953 --> 01:17:54,735
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you finally make a determination.

900
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:59,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's your chance to allow Medford to move forward.

901
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:01,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Please vote yes for it.

902
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

903
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

904
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

905
01:18:12,341 --> 01:18:12,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

906
01:18:12,661 --> 01:18:12,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

907
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:15,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Ken Kraus, 50 mystic street.

908
01:18:16,182 --> 01:18:26,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I wanted to speak in favor of the resolution to, uh, seek some clarity about the process for, uh, the council to establish a charter review.

909
01:18:26,504 --> 01:18:28,265
[SPEAKER_08]: If it decides to go that course.

910
01:18:29,165 --> 01:18:37,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I was not involved with the, um, citizen effort, uh, related to the charter review, nor did I intend, uh,

911
01:18:38,091 --> 01:18:47,173
[SPEAKER_08]: any meetings, and frankly, I don't know a lot about what's in the charter, which is a good reason for it to be reviewed by the whole community.

912
01:18:47,233 --> 01:19:03,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it's an overdue thing related to what governs our community and pretty much a standard procedure that, you know, should have been built into the charter when it was established way back when.

913
01:19:04,796 --> 01:19:06,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any reason not to review it.

914
01:19:09,103 --> 01:19:12,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think it's important though that the process not be politicized.

915
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:18,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think anybody should feel threatened by the process.

916
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:27,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the purpose is to review the charter and its applicability, usefulness, and relevance to 21st century Medford.

917
01:19:28,737 --> 01:19:34,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not a critique of the people who have been in the positions provided by, for the charter.

918
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:47,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I think we need to look back at, um, you know, the discussion when this charter was, uh, approved and what were the issues back then and what were we trying to accomplish?

919
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:49,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and did it succeed?

920
01:19:50,604 --> 01:19:52,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, very likely.

921
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:56,627
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the issues with Hemming and Hawn about today were the same ones that were being discussed back then.

922
01:19:57,087 --> 01:20:02,650
[SPEAKER_08]: So those issues may kind of, um, be ongoing despite whatever, um,

923
01:20:04,308 --> 01:20:05,629
[SPEAKER_08]: plan of government we're under.

924
01:20:05,829 --> 01:20:16,017
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it would be useful to see what the dialogue was back then and evaluate where we are today and this charter, you know, from that perspective.

925
01:20:17,118 --> 01:20:24,804
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and come away with a document that we feel will best serve the community going forward.

926
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:25,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

927
01:20:33,102 --> 01:20:33,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Camuso.

928
01:20:34,723 --> 01:20:35,684
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

929
01:20:35,824 --> 01:20:40,226
[SPEAKER_22]: And this has been presented to us over the many years.

930
01:20:41,887 --> 01:20:57,877
[SPEAKER_22]: And my stance has always been and still shall be that this was citizen driven, as Jean Martin said, in 1986 and 87, a very active group of community members went out and they got the signatures and they put it on the ballot.

931
01:20:59,137 --> 01:21:01,999
[SPEAKER_22]: And if people are committed to changing the charter in this community,

932
01:21:02,565 --> 01:21:09,649
[SPEAKER_22]: then that is the process that I feel is the way it should be done, same way that it has been done in the past.

933
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:22,857
[SPEAKER_22]: So for that reason, I do not support this, but I certainly think that the charter review is a good thing, but I just don't like the mechanism of doing it opposite the way that it was done in the past.

934
01:21:23,878 --> 01:21:30,722
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something that has such a great drive in this community

935
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:36,715
[SPEAKER_22]: to move the city forward, that I just think it should be citizen-driven.

936
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:51,183
[SPEAKER_22]: Quite honestly, if we were to just do it with a flick of a pen on a Tuesday evening, it's an insult to everyone that worked so hard, including Councilor Penta and Mary-Anne Frazzoli and many, many other people back in 1986.

937
01:21:52,403 --> 01:21:55,225
[SPEAKER_22]: So, that's my reasons and that's about it.

938
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:58,086
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

939
01:21:58,747 --> 01:21:59,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Camuso.

940
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:02,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta.

941
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:10,384
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, our charter as it presently sits is, you're right, it's approximately 30 years old.

942
01:22:11,284 --> 01:22:16,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably the biggest shortcoming in that charter is the fact that there was no review process to take place.

943
01:22:17,788 --> 01:22:20,609
[SPEAKER_03]: As in everything else in government, a review is necessary.

944
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:25,332
[SPEAKER_03]: We as candidates are reviewed every two years when we're being voted on for office.

945
01:22:26,552 --> 01:22:27,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at our city's charter

946
01:22:28,513 --> 01:22:29,373
[SPEAKER_03]: is to be the future.

947
01:22:29,954 --> 01:22:32,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the future of this city as we're going forward.

948
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:37,436
[SPEAKER_03]: As Mr. DiBenedetto indicated, you know, it's the city has changed.

949
01:22:37,496 --> 01:22:38,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's changed dramatically.

950
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:48,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Dating back to the plan E and the plan A form of government, the mayor did serve both as the chairperson then as he serves now on the school committee.

951
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,862
[SPEAKER_03]: But that may be something that may want to be reviewed at and looked at right now by folks within this community.

952
01:22:54,365 --> 01:23:00,928
[SPEAKER_03]: As a candidate for mayor, one of the first things I will propose is to have the city auditor come under the control of the city council.

953
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:08,733
[SPEAKER_03]: That will present the checks and balances as to how the city administration spends its money and how it can't spend its money.

954
01:23:08,793 --> 01:23:09,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have that.

955
01:23:10,313 --> 01:23:17,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, every single department comes under the control of the mayor as it presently stands in this particular charter.

956
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:22,640
[SPEAKER_03]: What councillors, whether you're for it or against it, some people like at large,

957
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:24,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like ward Councilors.

958
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:25,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's an option.

959
01:23:25,851 --> 01:23:29,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I think after 30 years, people deserve to have that ability to look at it.

960
01:23:29,952 --> 01:23:30,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Term limits.

961
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:31,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need term limits?

962
01:23:32,032 --> 01:23:38,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it fair to say, especially for the office of mayor, the term limits should only be two years.

963
01:23:38,073 --> 01:23:40,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it should be a four, no more than two four-year terms.

964
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:48,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we should have staggered or proposed staggered city council terms, one, two, and three years, both city council and school committee.

965
01:23:48,135 --> 01:23:50,416
[SPEAKER_03]: That gives everybody an opportunity each and every year

966
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:57,566
[SPEAKER_03]: whether they want to serve or whether they don't want to serve, but it keeps the people involved in the community as to what's going on.

967
01:23:58,447 --> 01:24:04,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the fact that the mayor, under this form of government, does have an extended amount of power.

968
01:24:05,552 --> 01:24:07,473
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember what the plan A charter says.

969
01:24:07,493 --> 01:24:12,497
[SPEAKER_03]: The plan A charter says that the mayor is not required to meet with the council.

970
01:24:13,418 --> 01:24:14,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't say he can't.

971
01:24:14,999 --> 01:24:16,079
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not required to.

972
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would make a huge difference as to what I would be proposing.

973
01:24:19,602 --> 01:24:20,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I would meet with this council.

974
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:26,474
[SPEAKER_03]: when and if asked, and that should be something that should be incorporated in the new proposal for the charter.

975
01:24:27,355 --> 01:24:44,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the gentleman that talked about the affordable housing in the city of Medford, if anybody understands how you get to the affordable housing content, if a developer were to come into this community and propose 100 units, and only 25% of those units are for affordable housing, the city gets credit for all 100.

976
01:24:45,048 --> 01:24:47,770
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way this archaic 1939 law has been written.

977
01:24:48,371 --> 01:24:50,072
[SPEAKER_03]: That needs to be changed in the legislature.

978
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:58,766
[SPEAKER_03]: This city, I will say, has gone out of its way through its limited resources in the Office of Community Development to bring in as much affordable housing as they can.

979
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:07,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And even by adding on those other numbers at the very end, we still haven't been able to reach that 10% mark on new development for affordable housing.

980
01:25:09,095 --> 01:25:19,543
[SPEAKER_03]: The other parts I think that need to be looked upon is that not only the diversity that this community has, but where is the opportunity for the citizens of this community to know

981
01:25:20,331 --> 01:25:26,833
[SPEAKER_03]: that their government not only can be looked upon, it can be reviewed, but they don't have to wait for a four or a five-year period.

982
01:25:27,293 --> 01:25:40,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe if I understand the law correctly and reviewing on the charters, you can have a five-year charter review, and if it incorporates a particular aspect of it, you don't have to go through that next five-year process to make that change.

983
01:25:40,737 --> 01:25:46,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in part that's what you're asking for with this resolution with the city solicitor to talk about.

984
01:25:46,078 --> 01:25:49,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think these are the things that need to be incorporated in the speaking of it.

985
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:55,221
[SPEAKER_03]: But the checks and balances just does not exist in this city.

986
01:25:55,801 --> 01:26:02,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, campaigning for this office, am I talking against myself by having the auditor not be on my side and on the council side?

987
01:26:02,483 --> 01:26:02,703
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

988
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:08,205
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just what good government's all about, having a good audit of your system on how your government works.

989
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:13,846
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the key to let you know that your government, your tax dollars are being spent wisely and correctly.

990
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:16,427
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a hard job sometimes.

991
01:26:16,727 --> 01:26:18,167
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got our budget here tonight.

992
01:26:18,848 --> 01:26:20,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, in this budget,

993
01:26:20,794 --> 01:26:26,075
[SPEAKER_03]: that we got, it's a combination of the prior budget director and the at present budget director.

994
01:26:26,795 --> 01:26:35,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some occasions, one not talking to the other, as it relates to a particular thing that this council has asked for in each and every budget, the wishlist of each and every department head.

995
01:26:36,597 --> 01:26:42,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us the wishlist, why you need it, how much it's going to cost, and how do you think you'd be able to get to that to pay for it?

996
01:26:42,658 --> 01:26:43,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't get that.

997
01:26:43,718 --> 01:26:45,918
[SPEAKER_03]: We just get rank and file, whatever it might be.

998
01:26:46,418 --> 01:26:49,619
[SPEAKER_03]: During the past two years, we've seen increases in this city take place.

999
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:53,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year alone and last year's budget, the school department increased by $2 million.

1000
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:56,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely no conversation with the council about it.

1001
01:26:56,988 --> 01:27:02,291
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no concern as it related to rank and file teachers, books and students, but it was a lot went to administration.

1002
01:27:03,132 --> 01:27:05,073
[SPEAKER_03]: But just think about the school system we have here.

1003
01:27:05,634 --> 01:27:09,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It went for almost 50 plus years with having no rehabilitation.

1004
01:27:10,097 --> 01:27:13,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And during that course of the 50 years, the school system just deteriorated.

1005
01:27:13,973 --> 01:27:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did they do 12, 13 years ago?

1006
01:27:15,674 --> 01:27:17,115
[SPEAKER_03]: They decided to build new buildings.

1007
01:27:17,475 --> 01:27:22,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, at that time, I was against the new buildings, because I felt we could rehab our old buildings one at a time.

1008
01:27:23,659 --> 01:27:25,980
[SPEAKER_03]: But the city decided to go the other way, so be it.

1009
01:27:26,681 --> 01:27:35,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as we Councilor Calderiello disclosed in his first term, these 12-year-old buildings are over in excess of $1 million in repairs that are needed.

1010
01:27:35,706 --> 01:27:37,047
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never taken the option

1011
01:27:37,525 --> 01:27:45,531
[SPEAKER_03]: that the law has told them that 5% of the annual budget for each school needs to be put there for reconditioning, upgrading or whatever it might be.

1012
01:27:46,572 --> 01:27:52,337
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hearing comments tonight in the meeting and we will be hearing it continuously in this budget of all the needs that need to take place.

1013
01:27:52,957 --> 01:28:02,285
[SPEAKER_03]: This city needs to take a step back and look at where it's at, where it wants to go and understand that we have a brand new future that's in front of us.

1014
01:28:02,705 --> 01:28:05,227
[SPEAKER_03]: The opportunity is so unique for this city to go forward.

1015
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:14,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget the mayor's office, which is a very important issue, but we have two openings here in the city council and you have two openings on the school department, the school committee, excuse me.

1016
01:28:15,519 --> 01:28:23,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, this next election is going to bring a complete change in the philosophy of where this city of Medford by its government is going.

1017
01:28:24,406 --> 01:28:25,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to be a part of it.

1018
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:28,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to have your vote, but I do support this charter vote.

1019
01:28:28,909 --> 01:28:30,370
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is very important.

1020
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:32,292
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, as I said, right in the beginning,

1021
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:36,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the biggest drawback, the biggest drawback was not including a review process.

1022
01:28:37,088 --> 01:28:39,089
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me remind you of one thing left.

1023
01:28:39,909 --> 01:28:54,375
[SPEAKER_03]: When that charter review committee came out back then, and even though the people voted for plan A, the vote also was to include plan E or plan A. My vote went both ways to allow the taxpayers the opportunity to have their choice.

1024
01:28:54,975 --> 01:28:55,915
[SPEAKER_03]: They made their choice.

1025
01:28:56,176 --> 01:28:57,076
[SPEAKER_03]: They voted for plan A.

1026
01:28:58,514 --> 01:29:03,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Having people, giving them transparency, giving them an opportunity, that's what this city needs right now.

1027
01:29:04,139 --> 01:29:11,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that thought, with that philosophy, we can go forward in this next election in November, and we can attain that, and we'll work for it, and we will correct it.

1028
01:29:12,407 --> 01:29:12,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1029
01:29:19,194 --> 01:29:20,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

1030
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:22,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1031
01:29:24,493 --> 01:29:30,078
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we have to keep in mind we're looking for charter review, not charter change.

1032
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:33,660
[SPEAKER_16]: No one that I've talked to mentioned anything about charter change.

1033
01:29:34,021 --> 01:29:46,310
[SPEAKER_16]: We're talking about reviewing the charter and, and speakers have already spoken to the fact that most charters have a provision built right in that calls for a review, whether it's annual, whether it's every five years or so forth.

1034
01:29:46,851 --> 01:29:49,813
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, uh, I want to thank the city clerk's office.

1035
01:29:49,853 --> 01:29:50,734
[SPEAKER_16]: I asked them to pull,

1036
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:55,568
[SPEAKER_16]: resolutions that were offered regarding the city charter over the last several years.

1037
01:29:56,429 --> 01:30:07,257
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's important to note, Mr. President, December 7th, 2010, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the city charter be discussed.

1038
01:30:08,198 --> 01:30:15,424
[SPEAKER_16]: The council voted to amend the paper to refer to the committee of the whole for the purpose of establishing a charter review committee.

1039
01:30:16,224 --> 01:30:19,887
[SPEAKER_16]: It was also amended that the paper would be referred to the city solicitor

1040
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:30,112
[SPEAKER_16]: to report back on what is the legal path for the city council in establishing charter review committee and who can make recommendations in the process to make any changes to the charter.

1041
01:30:30,712 --> 01:30:32,052
[SPEAKER_16]: That was back in 2010.

1042
01:30:32,853 --> 01:30:39,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Needless to say, there wasn't support at the time in 2010 to move forward with a charter review of this council.

1043
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:42,695
[SPEAKER_16]: So, excuse me?

1044
01:30:43,595 --> 01:30:45,075
[SPEAKER_16]: There wasn't majority support, correct.

1045
01:30:45,295 --> 01:30:46,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me stand correct.

1046
01:30:46,135 --> 01:30:47,215
[SPEAKER_16]: There wasn't majority support.

1047
01:30:48,156 --> 01:30:48,556
[SPEAKER_16]: December 14, 2010.

1048
01:30:50,621 --> 01:31:01,887
[SPEAKER_16]: offered by John Stirella, that the City of Medford, that he present a history of the Medford Charter.

1049
01:31:02,688 --> 01:31:04,789
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was in 2010 December.

1050
01:31:06,069 --> 01:31:09,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Petition by John Stirella, April 12th, 2011.

1051
01:31:09,972 --> 01:31:14,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Council speak about a charter change and our children.

1052
01:31:15,274 --> 01:31:19,897
[SPEAKER_16]: January 14th, 2014, offered by Councilor Marksby, resolved the city solicitor meet

1053
01:31:20,204 --> 01:31:25,806
[SPEAKER_16]: with the city council on the process of reviewing the city charter and amending current charter.

1054
01:31:27,726 --> 01:31:34,088
[SPEAKER_16]: May 2013, offered by Dr. Starella, that he address the council on the city charter.

1055
01:31:35,868 --> 01:31:40,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Petition by Anthony D'Antonio to discuss charter review, August 12, 2014.

1056
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:49,092
[SPEAKER_16]: So the reason why I point this out, Mr. President, there's been a number of attempts over the last several years by members of this council

1057
01:31:49,553 --> 01:31:56,740
[SPEAKER_16]: to at least call for a review of the city charter, knowing that this is the tool that governs our community.

1058
01:31:57,481 --> 01:32:14,417
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you look at the definition of the charter, part of it says, it defines the structure of the city and town government for a particular community in which may create local offices and distribute duties and responsibilities among local officials.

1059
01:32:15,523 --> 01:32:16,683
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a key right there.

1060
01:32:17,003 --> 01:32:20,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Distribute duties and responsibilities among local officials.

1061
01:32:21,284 --> 01:32:27,125
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the current city charter, the mayor, whoever it is, he sets the city budget.

1062
01:32:27,905 --> 01:32:36,907
[SPEAKER_16]: He negotiates contracts, waste management, the contract we have for parking, anything in the city regarding contracts he negotiates.

1063
01:32:37,407 --> 01:32:38,767
[SPEAKER_16]: He's the hiring authority.

1064
01:32:39,407 --> 01:32:41,207
[SPEAKER_16]: He is also the chairman of the school committee.

1065
01:32:41,867 --> 01:32:44,668
[SPEAKER_16]: And he is the only one that can initiate spending in the community.

1066
01:32:45,382 --> 01:32:48,324
[SPEAKER_16]: talk about centralizing power with one person.

1067
01:32:48,764 --> 01:33:00,930
[SPEAKER_16]: That's everything that flies in the face of what the definition of a charter is, is to distribute responsibilities and powers and duties among local officials, not one official, local officials.

1068
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:06,933
[SPEAKER_16]: So clearly there's a need under our city charter that was established some 28 years ago to

1069
01:33:07,503 --> 01:33:18,754
[SPEAKER_16]: review the charter, see where lies some of the concerns, and also not just to review the charter, but create a citizen review board.

1070
01:33:18,774 --> 01:33:20,196
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what I read off last week.

1071
01:33:20,236 --> 01:33:30,086
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't read it again, but this calls for actually, it may be worth reading just because if I could, Mr. President, I think it may be worth reading because

1072
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:36,964
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we're not allowing some body or some entity to go ahead and just change the charter.

1073
01:33:37,364 --> 01:33:49,792
[SPEAKER_16]: We're asking a group to get together, look at the current city charter, see what deletions, additions, anything that could change the charter to improve how government operates.

1074
01:33:50,372 --> 01:33:55,775
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's only to benefit the residents and the stability of this community.

1075
01:33:56,336 --> 01:33:59,778
[SPEAKER_16]: But under periodic review of the charter by a charter review committee,

1076
01:34:00,397 --> 01:34:05,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Once a community has a charter, there's often a provision for the periodic appointment of a charter review committee.

1077
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, that was the first problem that Councilor Penta mentioned.

1078
01:34:09,441 --> 01:34:11,982
[SPEAKER_16]: Nowhere in our charter calls for this periodic review.

1079
01:34:12,002 --> 01:34:18,184
[SPEAKER_16]: It says the committee undertakes an examination to determine the charter's ongoing utility and accuracy.

1080
01:34:18,685 --> 01:34:23,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Such committees do not have the powers, duties, and responsibilities of an elected charter commission.

1081
01:34:24,447 --> 01:34:29,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Such committees are formed to review the charter and to make recommendations to its appointing body.

1082
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:37,746
[SPEAKER_16]: example, board of select and city council regarding the need for additions, deletions, clarifications, or other amendments that would improve the charter.

1083
01:34:38,327 --> 01:34:40,969
[SPEAKER_16]: The term of such an advisory committee is usually one year.

1084
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:52,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Recommendations of the committee may take the form of a proposal special act or proposed charter amendment, but the local legislative body must act upon the recommendations before they take effect.

1085
01:34:52,939 --> 01:34:54,060
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a check and balance.

1086
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:56,442
[SPEAKER_16]: The committee may also find, for example,

1087
01:34:56,818 --> 01:35:02,563
[SPEAKER_16]: that the charter's intent is clear, but related bylaws or ordinances may need clarification.

1088
01:35:02,943 --> 01:35:15,794
[SPEAKER_16]: The role of such committees can be important in assuring that the charter is working as intended, but the Charter Review Committee has no assigned role in achieving any change beyond its recommendation to the appointing body.

1089
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:22,640
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not some committee that we're going to appoint that's going to take their pen and start making changes to the city charter.

1090
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:24,101
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not going to happen.

1091
01:35:24,121 --> 01:35:24,882
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a process.

1092
01:35:25,275 --> 01:35:26,836
[SPEAKER_16]: laid out that needs to be followed.

1093
01:35:27,216 --> 01:35:28,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, that's only one aspect.

1094
01:35:28,537 --> 01:35:31,158
[SPEAKER_16]: There are other aspects on amending the charter.

1095
01:35:31,519 --> 01:35:37,262
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a home rule charter commission, and there's also a petition of the state legislature for a home rule petition.

1096
01:35:37,682 --> 01:35:42,005
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we're going to find this out, as Councilor Knight mentioned, with the city solicitor.

1097
01:35:42,585 --> 01:35:54,852
[SPEAKER_16]: And I am ecstatic to hear that members of this council that were in opposition over the last couple of years are now seeing the light on this and seeing the importance

1098
01:35:55,632 --> 01:36:00,715
[SPEAKER_16]: of a charter review, not charter change, a charter review, a simple charter review.

1099
01:36:01,355 --> 01:36:06,298
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm pleased to hear that that is hopefully moving forward.

1100
01:36:06,758 --> 01:36:08,399
[SPEAKER_16]: And I agree with Mr. Krause.

1101
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,921
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not a political process.

1102
01:36:11,301 --> 01:36:15,584
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not a way of trying to get the charter that benefits anyone in particular.

1103
01:36:15,924 --> 01:36:20,406
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I've always supported representation, even as a member of the council.

1104
01:36:20,947 --> 01:36:24,909
[SPEAKER_16]: I always felt it was unfair, Mr. President, that elected officials

1105
01:36:25,643 --> 01:36:31,267
[SPEAKER_16]: on the ballot, get their names put in order, and then the incumbents go after the elected official.

1106
01:36:31,587 --> 01:36:35,589
[SPEAKER_16]: That gives elected officials an unfair advantage, in my opinion.

1107
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:41,693
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a known fact that there's a certain percentage gain from where you are placed on the ballot.

1108
01:36:42,454 --> 01:36:46,116
[SPEAKER_16]: We've also talked about staggering terms, which other communities do.

1109
01:36:46,396 --> 01:36:47,617
[SPEAKER_16]: We've talked about term limits.

1110
01:36:47,877 --> 01:36:55,222
[SPEAKER_16]: We've talked about possibly having the chairman of the school committee be elected, or maybe one of, as with the council,

1111
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:59,804
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the members of the school committee serves as the chairman of the school committee.

1112
01:37:00,144 --> 01:37:03,626
[SPEAKER_16]: And that keeps the mayor in his role as the chief executive officer.

1113
01:37:04,307 --> 01:37:12,072
[SPEAKER_16]: And it keeps him free from the political struggles back and forth of the municipal side and the school side.

1114
01:37:12,532 --> 01:37:14,854
[SPEAKER_16]: So I welcome this.

1115
01:37:14,914 --> 01:37:16,115
[SPEAKER_16]: I've welcomed this for years.

1116
01:37:16,595 --> 01:37:22,239
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad to see the support from members or somewhat support.

1117
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,181
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're not willing to speak on your own resolution,

1118
01:37:25,950 --> 01:37:33,334
[SPEAKER_16]: That doesn't say too much, but hey, this is an open process and, you know, we'll follow the process through.

1119
01:37:33,394 --> 01:37:37,436
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're going to make strides in moving forward.

1120
01:37:37,836 --> 01:37:42,158
[SPEAKER_16]: And no matter who the mayor, it doesn't matter who the mayor is, this is the right thing to do.

1121
01:37:42,178 --> 01:37:44,499
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't matter who's sitting in that office.

1122
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:47,520
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be a dear friend or it could be an enemy.

1123
01:37:48,061 --> 01:37:55,444
[SPEAKER_16]: The right thing to do in this community is to make sure whatever we're governed by is working for the residents and the taxpayers of this community.

1124
01:37:55,952 --> 01:38:00,194
[SPEAKER_16]: And not looking at a provision, like Mr. Cappucci said, for 28 years.

1125
01:38:00,234 --> 01:38:04,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Who would have a business plan for 28 years is no longer in business?

1126
01:38:04,576 --> 01:38:21,165
[SPEAKER_16]: That business plan has to be looked at, if not yearly, weekly, monthly, daily, to make sure you're up with the times, to make sure you're providing effective communication, to make sure that you're outsourcing and networking and doing the communication that's necessary to run a business.

1127
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:22,506
[SPEAKER_16]: The city is no different.

1128
01:38:23,286 --> 01:38:25,327
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what we should be looking at, Mr. President.

1129
01:38:25,686 --> 01:38:29,187
[SPEAKER_16]: So I look forward to these discussions over the next several months.

1130
01:38:29,647 --> 01:38:38,809
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope under your leadership, Mr. President, that it doesn't die off like it did back in 2010, when there was a lack of support by members of this council.

1131
01:38:39,389 --> 01:38:47,531
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope we can move forward on the review in the interest of every resident and taxpayer of this community, Mr. President.

1132
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:48,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1133
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:50,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1134
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:51,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

1135
01:38:52,112 --> 01:38:52,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be brief.

1136
01:38:57,675 --> 01:39:02,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank my colleagues for speaking, but I more importantly thank the public for coming out and speaking on the issue.

1137
01:39:02,577 --> 01:39:09,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I think enough has been said, but I just want to say that in 2010, I was in support of a charter review.

1138
01:39:09,541 --> 01:39:11,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I am in support of it.

1139
01:39:11,602 --> 01:39:17,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, 2015, almost five years later, it's something that I think is important.

1140
01:39:17,325 --> 01:39:21,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I think any time you're reviewing something, it's always a good idea.

1141
01:39:22,067 --> 01:39:27,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Councilman Mark said, it's as if a business never reviewed

1142
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:30,890
[SPEAKER_07]: their plan for the last 5, 10, 28 years.

1143
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:32,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Review is a good thing.

1144
01:39:32,690 --> 01:39:33,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Change is a good thing.

1145
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:36,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this is just a review.

1146
01:39:37,151 --> 01:39:40,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe nothing needs to be changed, but everything does need to be reviewed.

1147
01:39:41,632 --> 01:39:45,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Ward representation, term limits.

1148
01:39:45,433 --> 01:39:46,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I said the same speech in 2010.

1149
01:39:47,234 --> 01:39:51,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It is time, and I'm glad that finally we will have the majority vote tonight.

1150
01:40:01,932 --> 01:40:03,393
[SPEAKER_18]: You name and address for the record, please.

1151
01:40:03,493 --> 01:40:04,894
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1152
01:40:04,954 --> 01:40:06,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans street.

1153
01:40:07,095 --> 01:40:08,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, just really brief.

1154
01:40:08,076 --> 01:40:14,840
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a question, excuse me, based on a Councilor, Marx Marxist comments.

1155
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:22,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, first of all, I want to thank everybody who came up and spoke and I, and I thank all the Councilors for their excellent commentary and concern.

1156
01:40:22,405 --> 01:40:24,387
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's through the city.

1157
01:40:24,427 --> 01:40:25,587
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a huge concern for this.

1158
01:40:25,988 --> 01:40:26,628
[SPEAKER_18]: There really is.

1159
01:40:27,028 --> 01:40:28,029
[SPEAKER_18]: But my questions are,

1160
01:40:28,942 --> 01:40:37,624
[SPEAKER_18]: The Honorable Michael Marx brought up that in the past that there were already resolutions to have the city solicitor speak on the process of this.

1161
01:40:38,084 --> 01:40:40,985
[SPEAKER_18]: My question is, A, did he come?

1162
01:40:41,525 --> 01:40:53,007
[SPEAKER_18]: And B, when he did come, were there minutes kept of any comments that he might have made so that you guys can maybe meet in a subcommittee or something and discuss them?

1163
01:40:53,907 --> 01:40:54,868
[SPEAKER_18]: But thank you for your time.

1164
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:56,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are my questions, and thanks so much.

1165
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:04,980
[SPEAKER_16]: The gentleman asked the question.

1166
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,202
[SPEAKER_16]: I, if my memory serves me correct, we never had a committee, the whole meeting on it.

1167
01:41:10,302 --> 01:41:13,083
[SPEAKER_16]: We requested one, but there was never a committee, the whole meeting.

1168
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:22,626
[SPEAKER_16]: The second part was to have the city solicitor report back to the council, um, on, uh, what avenues, uh, we can approach to do a charter review.

1169
01:41:23,147 --> 01:41:33,130
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't ever remember getting a paper, but, uh, it's possible that, uh, the city solicitor did send us something and, uh, maybe we can put in a request tonight cause he keeps all his opinions.

1170
01:41:34,035 --> 01:41:36,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Believe me, he has them all in order and index.

1171
01:41:37,338 --> 01:41:58,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, if we can ask if the city solicitor did report back in 2010 regarding the council resolution 10-707, requesting that the city solicitor report back to the council on the legal path for the city council in establishing a charter review committee.

1172
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:02,856
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we didn't get any opinion, then maybe this request

1173
01:42:04,313 --> 01:42:12,075
[SPEAKER_16]: resolution will then spur that again, Mr. President.

1174
01:42:12,135 --> 01:42:12,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1175
01:42:12,455 --> 01:42:14,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you have the records of the votes.

1176
01:42:15,236 --> 01:42:18,977
[SPEAKER_07]: From my memory, we never had the four votes to even send the question.

1177
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:23,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

1178
01:42:33,621 --> 01:42:33,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1179
01:42:34,001 --> 01:42:40,423
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a motion approved by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Matz, all those in favour?

1180
01:42:41,124 --> 01:42:41,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1181
01:42:41,484 --> 01:42:42,904
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1182
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,965
[SPEAKER_07]: The clerk will call the roll.

1183
01:42:53,408 --> 01:42:54,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso?

1184
01:42:54,469 --> 01:42:54,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1185
01:42:55,789 --> 01:42:56,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello?

1186
01:42:56,729 --> 01:42:56,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1187
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:58,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

1188
01:43:02,008 --> 01:43:02,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Martins?

1189
01:43:02,868 --> 01:43:03,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1190
01:43:03,809 --> 01:43:04,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Pater?

1191
01:43:04,489 --> 01:43:04,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1192
01:43:05,269 --> 01:43:05,909
[SPEAKER_13]: President Dello Russo?

1193
01:43:06,110 --> 01:43:06,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1194
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:09,151
[SPEAKER_13]: A vote of six in the affirmative, one negative.

1195
01:43:09,471 --> 01:43:10,311
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes.

1196
01:43:18,334 --> 01:43:21,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to suspend by Councilor Knight.

1197
01:43:21,655 --> 01:43:25,217
[SPEAKER_09]: To take papers 15504, 05 and 06, taxi operator licenses out of order.

1198
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:34,214
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 1-5-5-0-4.

1199
01:43:34,434 --> 01:43:36,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, taxi license petitions, please.

1200
01:43:37,056 --> 01:43:39,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1201
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:46,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Petition for taxi operator license by Jean Elsan Dumas, 195 Webster Street, Malden, Mass.

1202
01:43:46,643 --> 01:43:49,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Driving for Citywide Taxi, Canal Street, Method, Mass.

1203
01:43:51,286 --> 01:43:52,267

[SPEAKER_14]: 75 Madison and Malden.

1245
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:36,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think, you must have the wrong company.

1246
01:45:37,171 --> 01:45:38,532
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's Star Taxi.

1247
01:45:39,412 --> 01:45:45,635
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in like 75 Madison and Malden, that's where he lives.

1248
01:45:45,655 --> 01:45:47,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know where the business is located?

1249
01:45:50,537 --> 01:45:53,058
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the actual location, but I know the owner.

1250
01:45:54,147 --> 01:45:57,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, when you can figure out the address, then you can come back and get your license.

1251
01:45:58,470 --> 01:45:58,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1252
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:01,592
[SPEAKER_15]: You should know at least where you work.

1253
01:46:05,134 --> 01:46:08,116
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like he's the owner, it's like I'm going to be leasing.

1254
01:46:08,156 --> 01:46:10,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but you should know where the office is located.

1255
01:46:10,858 --> 01:46:12,139
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to go to an office at some point.

1256
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:15,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think he has an office.

1257
01:46:15,281 --> 01:46:16,061
[SPEAKER_15]: He has an office.

1258
01:46:16,682 --> 01:46:20,184
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you figure out where the office is, you can come back and get it.

1259
01:46:20,204 --> 01:46:21,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a motion to table?

1260
01:46:21,685 --> 01:46:22,706
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to motion to table.

1261
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:24,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you call them?

1262
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:24,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sure.

1263
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:26,111
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to call them now.

1264
01:46:26,131 --> 01:46:26,171
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1268
01:46:31,152 --> 01:46:31,693

1269
01:46:31,753 --> 01:46:32,513

01:47:13,272 --> 01:47:14,033
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

01:47:16,073 --> 01:47:17,933

1286

[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

1288
01:47:22,537 --> 01:47:23,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck driving.

1289
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:24,558

1290
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Councilor Knight.

1291
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:41,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Motions, orders, and resolutions, paper 15-500 offered by Councilor Knight, be resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere congratulations to the following MHS athletic teams for winning the GBL title.

1292
01:47:42,665 --> 01:47:47,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Boys lacrosse, girls lacrosse, boys baseball, girls softball,

1293
01:47:47,918 --> 01:47:59,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it further resolved the members of these teams, along with their coaches, be invited to appear before the city council to receive accommodations memorializing this achievement.

1294
01:47:59,621 --> 01:48:00,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1295
01:48:01,981 --> 01:48:03,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1296
01:48:03,522 --> 01:48:07,983
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford High School Mustangs have had a rather successful year all around.

1297
01:48:08,303 --> 01:48:11,864
[SPEAKER_09]: And this spring is no different than the fall and winter seasons.

1298
01:48:12,884 --> 01:48:15,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the opportunity to speak with our athletic director, Mr. Maloney,

1299
01:48:16,722 --> 01:48:24,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I was pleased to inform you that the boys lacrosse, girls lacrosse, boys baseball, and girls softball teams were named the GBL champions.

1300
01:48:24,585 --> 01:48:28,666
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very great to see the Mustangs performing so well both in the classroom and on the field.

1301
01:48:28,746 --> 01:48:31,607
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that it's appropriate that we recognize them for this great achievement.

1302
01:48:32,347 --> 01:48:40,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's very important that we recognize the fact that these student athletes represent the city of Medford across the region and their efforts in our community.

1303
01:48:41,249 --> 01:48:43,030
[SPEAKER_09]: and community building are very important.

1304
01:48:43,231 --> 01:48:52,378
[SPEAKER_09]: They're role models to our youth, Madam President, and it's also a great, great, great honor to be named a GBL champion.

1305
01:48:52,478 --> 01:48:59,043
[SPEAKER_09]: So because of those factors, I would ask that my council colleagues support me in voting in favor of this resolution.

1306
01:48:59,963 --> 01:49:02,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

1307
01:49:02,525 --> 01:49:03,226
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1308
01:49:04,107 --> 01:49:04,747
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1309
01:49:04,787 --> 01:49:05,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper passes.

1310
01:49:07,525 --> 01:49:10,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper 15501 offered by Councilor Knight.

1311
01:49:10,188 --> 01:49:16,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you resolve the traffic commission review the crosswalk and parking spaces crossing with Winthrop Street at Victory Park?

1312
01:49:17,234 --> 01:49:17,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1313
01:49:18,395 --> 01:49:19,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1314
01:49:20,136 --> 01:49:28,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the other day, I was speaking to a neighbor of mine who was driving down Winthrop Street, and a child came out behind a car, from behind a car.

1315
01:49:28,423 --> 01:49:33,968
[SPEAKER_09]: But the car was parked in an illegal parking spot, and there was a crosswalk there, and the gentleman had a problem with visibility.

1316
01:49:34,456 --> 01:49:40,681
[SPEAKER_09]: So he went around the block and he came and he approached the same intersection from the other direction to see if he had the same problem there, and he did.

1317
01:49:41,461 --> 01:49:53,450
[SPEAKER_09]: With that being said, Mr. President, with the summer months coming and Victory Park being such a great park where I take my kid quite frequently, as a matter of fact, I think it would be very important that this crosswalk be reviewed.

1318
01:49:53,931 --> 01:49:59,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we might have to take a space away or two on either side of the street just to be sure that there's enough visibility here.

1319
01:50:00,143 --> 01:50:08,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Mr. President, I did file a resolution several weeks back requesting that a crosswalk be put in between Cedar Road and King Avenue, and I'd like to amend this resolution to include that as well.

1320
01:50:09,752 --> 01:50:18,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Cedar Road and King Avenue cross Forest Street, which go to the new McNally Park, which this council voted in favor of rebuilding.

1321
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:24,965
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues support me in voting in favor of these two public safety initiatives.

1322
01:50:27,299 --> 01:50:32,760
[SPEAKER_13]: So, on the motion of Council and Knight, seconded by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, all those in favor?

1323
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:34,481
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1324
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:35,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1325
01:50:40,822 --> 01:50:41,422
[SPEAKER_08]: From the table.

1326
01:50:47,704 --> 01:50:48,664
[SPEAKER_13]: The gentleman is back.

1327
01:50:48,804 --> 01:50:53,305
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Council Marks to take 15-505 off the table, all those in favor?

1328
01:50:53,985 --> 01:50:54,685
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1329
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:55,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion carries.

1330
01:50:55,930 --> 01:51:08,218
[SPEAKER_13]: 15 5 0 5 petition for taxi operator license by Sandro Matthew, uh, 18, a 60 76 Beacon street, number five, Brookline mass driving for star taxi.

[SPEAKER_15]: And I find him in a,

1334
01:51:19,748 --> 01:51:22,810
[SPEAKER_15]: And the gentleman, I think he was a little confused earlier this evening.

1335
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:29,254
[SPEAKER_15]: You understand that you could drive in Medford, and do you know where you're picking up your cab?

1336
01:51:29,934 --> 01:51:30,754
[SPEAKER_15]: 407, Mr. Gabb.

1337
01:51:30,975 --> 01:51:31,295

[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1340
01:51:35,517 --> 01:51:38,479
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Vice President.

1350
01:52:11,522 --> 01:52:13,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1351
01:52:16,132 --> 01:52:26,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need an audit of many of our streets in Medford, potholes, divots, construction work, catch basins.

1352
01:52:27,921 --> 01:52:29,082
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a number of issues.

1353
01:52:29,202 --> 01:52:35,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the Department of Public Works is on top of many of them, and they've answered our calls on a number of things.

1354
01:52:36,488 --> 01:52:42,132
[SPEAKER_07]: But sometimes resurfacing roads is much more costly and time-consuming.

1355
01:52:43,042 --> 01:52:47,644
[SPEAKER_07]: But Belle Ave is one of those roads that really needs to be looked at.

1356
01:52:48,825 --> 01:53:03,192
[SPEAKER_07]: My children, I've received complaints on it, but I also drive down Belle once in a while, and my children call it the roller coaster road, which the heights, they put their hands up in the back seat and they kind of woo.

1357
01:53:03,572 --> 01:53:09,795
[SPEAKER_07]: So in a way, to them it's funny, but really it's a safety concern.

1358
01:53:11,944 --> 01:53:12,584
[SPEAKER_07]: despicable.

1359
01:53:13,425 --> 01:53:20,029
[SPEAKER_07]: People on my road, Richard Street, which is close to Belle Ave, believe that Richard Street needs to be repaved.

1360
01:53:20,389 --> 01:53:25,372
[SPEAKER_07]: But you look at Belle Ave, and it is horrifying.

1361
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:33,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just think that we do need to do an assessment of all our streets and put those that really need to be repaved on the repave list.

1362
01:53:33,657 --> 01:53:41,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could just have the Department of Public Works take a look at this and maybe give us a time frame of when maybe this can get repaved, that would be appreciated.

1363
01:53:42,035 --> 01:53:45,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to just amend this.

1364
01:53:45,696 --> 01:53:52,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody read the resolve and had a question about several winter sand barrels that were still in our roads.

1365
01:53:52,738 --> 01:53:54,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now, you know, June.

1366
01:53:55,018 --> 01:54:02,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could have the appropriate department take a look at maybe the winter sand barrels, that would be helpful.

1367
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:09,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's one at Brackett and Gaston Street, Belle Ave, Park and Doonan Street.

1368
01:54:10,066 --> 01:54:18,732
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could just take a look, Cleveland and Clematis and also Park Street, I believe is the number where there are several winter sand barrels.

1369
01:54:18,952 --> 01:54:21,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Just question if and when they'll be removed.

1370
01:54:22,875 --> 01:54:23,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1371
01:54:27,698 --> 01:54:33,662
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1372
01:54:34,783 --> 01:54:35,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Sir, you want to speak on that?

1373
01:54:35,843 --> 01:54:36,324
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize.

1374
01:54:38,193 --> 01:54:39,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thanks, Brian.

1375
01:54:40,014 --> 01:54:41,675
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great that you brought that up.

1376
01:54:42,075 --> 01:54:47,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to add that up the top of the heights, Fell's Ave area, we've got a few up there as well.

1377
01:54:47,639 --> 01:54:50,821
[SPEAKER_10]: So people are starting to throw trash in them.

1378
01:54:51,241 --> 01:54:52,602
[SPEAKER_10]: It's getting a little gross.

1379
01:54:53,082 --> 01:54:54,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're blocking the sidewalk.

1380
01:54:54,503 --> 01:54:55,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.

1381
01:54:55,123 --> 01:55:01,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say, they're all blocking the sidewalk, which is, you know, elderly, handicapped, baby strollers.

1382
01:55:01,947 --> 01:55:04,489
[SPEAKER_10]: They're out in Fell's Ave walking into traffic.

1383
01:55:05,629 --> 01:55:05,710
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1384
01:55:07,048 --> 01:55:08,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we get some of those streets?

1385
01:55:08,388 --> 01:55:10,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we get some of those streets, Mr. Finn?

1386
01:55:10,729 --> 01:55:11,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk Finn.

1387
01:55:11,609 --> 01:55:13,050
[SPEAKER_13]: On the winter barrels.

1388
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:17,591
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that at the budget hearing when we talk DPW that we make recommendations for more iron.

1389
01:55:18,771 --> 01:55:23,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can put that as an amendment to the resolve, remove the winter sand barrels.

1390
01:55:24,313 --> 01:55:25,353
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk has that.

1391
01:55:25,593 --> 01:55:25,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1392
01:55:25,913 --> 01:55:29,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilman Max.

1393
01:55:33,857 --> 01:55:34,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1394
01:55:35,018 --> 01:55:38,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And I agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn about the condition of our roads.

1395
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:45,725
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was Councilor Penter, last couple of weeks, has been mentioning about a capital improvement road project.

1396
01:55:46,506 --> 01:55:56,412
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, doing roads piecemeal is fine, but we need to have a long-term plan in place where we can address many, many roads.

1397
01:55:56,492 --> 01:56:02,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Because in this community, it's fair to say our streets and our sidewalks are in a tough condition.

1398
01:56:02,655 --> 01:56:05,177
[SPEAKER_16]: And piecemeal is not going to make a good approach.

1399
01:56:05,597 --> 01:56:14,103
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I agree with you, during budget time, this is when we should be laying out the plan to look at a five-year plan of doing many of our thoroughfares.

1400
01:56:14,123 --> 01:56:17,445
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if you go down Winthrop Street towards — The President Well, let's all bring a list with us.

1401
01:56:17,465 --> 01:56:25,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Secretary Vilsack Well, I think what we have to do is, rather than us bringing a list, I think the city should be surveying what areas need to be done.

1402
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:29,833
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can tell you, Winthrop Street, the lower half of Winthrop going towards Boston Ave,

1403
01:56:30,503 --> 01:56:37,226
[SPEAKER_16]: has been mentioned 1,000 times, and that road, you take your life in your own hands going down that street, and it's thorough.

1404
01:56:37,286 --> 01:56:39,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Riverside Ave is in tough shape.

1405
01:56:39,387 --> 01:56:41,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Salem Street, parts of Salem Street is in tough shape.

1406
01:56:41,808 --> 01:56:56,015
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I won't go on, but I really believe what Councilor Penta mentioned about the capital improvement road project makes sense, and we can do many, many streets if we put aside funding, Mr. President.

1407
01:56:56,414 --> 01:57:06,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So on that motion, all those in favor, all those opposed carries 15-five Oh seven offered by consulate Penta be resolved at the governor's Avenue wall be discussed.

1408
01:57:06,798 --> 01:57:07,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta.

1409
01:57:07,919 --> 01:57:20,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, some years ago, um, I think it was 2001 when the city finally got to the wall, because I think my resolutions dated back years before that the city went out of its way.

1410
01:57:21,184 --> 01:57:24,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe we refurbished the wall that was falling down.

1411
01:57:25,852 --> 01:57:43,504
[SPEAKER_03]: on Governor's Avenue, and also I think they took out the trees that sort of like sat on the top of the walls almost five feet back, and that took some time because they believed Mr. Rumley had to go out and get insecure releases from the people who owned the property who abutted the top part of the wall.

1412
01:57:43,904 --> 01:57:53,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you go down there today, what you're going to look at is a complete distraction to the entire community's beautification over there.

1413
01:57:53,629 --> 01:58:14,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Beside the street being in a real tough condition, if you look at the wall and if you look at the sidewalk and if you look at all the brush that's growing and all the sand and the gravel that's on the sidewalks, which almost makes some part of it unwalkable, as a street that's a gateway into the city, it really needs to be addressed.

1414
01:58:15,643 --> 01:58:17,445
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a perfect type of a project.

1415
01:58:18,553 --> 01:58:24,837
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could use summer help for, you would hire kids for the city, and you would pick out spots like that for them to go up there and clean.

1416
01:58:25,977 --> 01:58:30,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that brush that's up, that's growing on the bottom part of the street next to the sidewalk.

1417
01:58:31,481 --> 01:58:38,365
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even blocking at one point for anybody walking down the street on the sidewalk, especially if you have a doll carriage, a baby carriage, or anything like that.

1418
01:58:38,725 --> 01:58:44,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But just the walking down there, the cement pieces, the sand, the gravel, and the street in and of itself,

1419
01:58:46,336 --> 01:58:53,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't do the city justice for spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on that wall and then to let it now run itself into a state of disrepair.

1420
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,881
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like the same thing of building new schools.

1421
01:58:56,441 --> 01:58:58,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely no follow-up, no maintenance to it.

1422
01:58:58,703 --> 01:59:00,143
[SPEAKER_03]: The disrepair is taking place.

1423
01:59:00,584 --> 01:59:03,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what's happening right here on Governor's Avenue.

1424
01:59:03,926 --> 01:59:12,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move that to the Department of Public Works to get a response back to them as it relates to the cleanup

1425
01:59:12,827 --> 01:59:25,098
[SPEAKER_03]: the removal of the brush, the overgrown brush, and the trees that are overhanging on that wall, all the length of Governor's Avenue, and have a report back, Mr. President.

1426
01:59:25,639 --> 01:59:25,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1427
01:59:25,939 --> 01:59:27,981
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Penter, all those in favor?

1428
01:59:28,621 --> 01:59:29,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

1429
01:59:29,322 --> 01:59:30,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1430
01:59:31,203 --> 01:59:32,244
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of things.

1431
01:59:33,785 --> 01:59:43,490
[SPEAKER_13]: The folks that are following the Committee of the Whole meetings for the budget, we're going to be making some adjustments in the coming days to the schedule.

1432
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:46,271
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't get through everything that we need to get through tonight.

1433
01:59:46,911 --> 01:59:52,034
[SPEAKER_13]: So as time moves along, we'll reassess the schedule and

1434
01:59:53,094 --> 01:59:58,017
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, departments to some of the existing nights and we still have to solidify our meeting on the school budget.

1435
01:59:58,577 --> 02:00:11,805
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, if I could, uh, have a motion for suspension by council Marks, all those in favor of the motion to take papers under suspension, 15-five Oh eight offered by councilors night and commute.

1436
02:00:11,825 --> 02:00:20,530
[SPEAKER_13]: So be it resolved that the city council extend it's a deep and sincere condolences to the family of Kenneth Nestor on his recent passing council night.

1437
02:00:21,595 --> 02:00:22,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1438
02:00:23,796 --> 02:00:28,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Today, as a matter of fact, marks the day that Kenneth Nesta was laid to rest.

1439
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:38,206
[SPEAKER_09]: And Kenneth was a long-time public servant at the post office, had a root here in the city of Medford for a number of years.

1440
02:00:39,126 --> 02:00:49,873
[SPEAKER_09]: But more often than not, you'd be able to find him down in one of our baseball fields watching his son, Michael, Park Superintendent, coach the Medford High School baseball team or watch one of his many grandchildren play.

1441
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,403
[SPEAKER_09]: baseball or down the county rink playing hockey.

1442
02:00:53,804 --> 02:00:57,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Kenneth died unexpectedly, and he will be sadly missed, Mr. President.

1443
02:00:58,485 --> 02:01:01,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm honored and privileged to have been able to call him a friend as well.

1444
02:01:02,105 --> 02:01:06,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And today was a very difficult day for the family and for Kenneth's friends.

1445
02:01:06,746 --> 02:01:13,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd ask that this council join me in Councilor Camuso in offering and extending their deep and sincere condolences.

1446
02:01:14,848 --> 02:01:15,448
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor.

1447
02:01:15,488 --> 02:01:16,048
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Camuso.

1448
02:01:17,182 --> 02:01:23,364
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on this evening for the two of us.

1449
02:01:23,464 --> 02:01:24,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Kenny Nesta was a great guy.

1450
02:01:25,245 --> 02:01:30,286
[SPEAKER_22]: Many people would not only know him from the baseball field, but as a retired post mailman.

1451
02:01:31,027 --> 02:01:34,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Did the West Medford route for, I'd say, 20 plus years or so.

1452
02:01:35,548 --> 02:01:42,590
[SPEAKER_22]: And then in his golden years of retirement, he was a custodian for the Malden Catholic Lancers over at MC.

1453
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:44,471
[SPEAKER_22]: So just a great, fantastic guy.

1454
02:01:45,407 --> 02:01:46,828
[SPEAKER_22]: has wonderful kids.

1455
02:01:46,908 --> 02:01:52,111
[SPEAKER_22]: One of them is our PAC superintendent, Mike Nesta, another great kid and loving grandchildren.

1456
02:01:52,191 --> 02:01:53,312
[SPEAKER_22]: And just, he's gotta be missed.

1457
02:01:53,352 --> 02:01:54,452
[SPEAKER_22]: Just an all around good guy.

1458
02:01:55,753 --> 02:01:56,633
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, council.

1459
02:01:56,653 --> 02:01:59,175
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion, please stand for a moment of silence.

1460
02:02:12,082 --> 02:02:13,903
[SPEAKER_13]: One more I have here, be it resolved,

1461
02:02:14,874 --> 02:02:16,235
[SPEAKER_13]: This is offered by Councilor Knight.

1462
02:02:16,635 --> 02:02:22,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the city solicitor update the council on the status of 56 of Boynton Road.

1463
02:02:22,899 --> 02:02:23,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1464
02:02:23,859 --> 02:02:25,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1465
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:30,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently, a gentleman from Boynton Road came up to discuss a house that was condemned and in disrepair in his neighborhood.

1466
02:02:31,303 --> 02:02:40,829
[SPEAKER_09]: The city solicitor gave a report back to this council indicating that on the 28th of last month, the case was going to be heard in probate court.

1467
02:02:41,815 --> 02:02:57,667
[SPEAKER_09]: With that being said, Mr. President, I'm hoping we can get an update as to the status of that property, because I feel as though if we don't see any action take place shortly, this council may have to take action to determine that the building is unsafe and the location is unsafe and take the appropriate steps to be sure that the neighborhood is protected.

1468
02:02:58,108 --> 02:02:59,349
[SPEAKER_13]: So a motion to Council Knight.

1469
02:02:59,389 --> 02:03:00,049
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1470
02:03:00,069 --> 02:03:00,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1471
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:01,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

1472
02:03:01,410 --> 02:03:02,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Vice President.

1473
02:03:03,512 --> 02:03:05,974
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could let our citizens speak regarding the budget.

1474
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:11,405
[SPEAKER_07]: something I think we've asked for a number of times, and you can reiterate.

1475
02:03:11,445 --> 02:03:11,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1476
02:03:11,865 --> 02:03:13,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1477
02:03:13,646 --> 02:03:14,346
[SPEAKER_19]: Michael Ruggiero.

1478
02:03:14,386 --> 02:03:15,827
[SPEAKER_19]: I live on 18 Pembroke street.

1479
02:03:16,127 --> 02:03:20,189
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish to discuss the budget that was presented at the meeting of the whole.

1480
02:03:20,849 --> 02:03:24,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, while the budget is, you know, there's a lot of thorough paperwork here.

1481
02:03:24,731 --> 02:03:29,513
[SPEAKER_19]: It is concerning that some residents might not be able to access this document digitally.

1482
02:03:30,273 --> 02:03:34,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, um, this document, if it's presented digitally can be searched more thoroughly.

1483
02:03:35,469 --> 02:03:38,690
[SPEAKER_19]: than if it's presented sort of in loose leaf paper, or if I lose it today.

1484
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:45,292
[SPEAKER_19]: I asked the council to present a resolution to Louise Miller to make sure that this document is presented digitally.

1485
02:03:45,332 --> 02:03:51,374
[SPEAKER_19]: I know she's very busy, and she's taking over a new role in the accounting office.

1486
02:03:51,554 --> 02:03:59,236
[SPEAKER_19]: But this document should definitely be digital so we can search it, use it, and reference it online for people that might not be able to come in.

1487
02:04:02,377 --> 02:04:02,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

1488
02:04:03,838 --> 02:04:04,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1489
02:04:10,488 --> 02:04:22,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just move that as a, put that in motion form and send that to the administration and Louise Miller, that's something that the city council has asked for a number of times, just to have the budget accessible online on the website.

1490
02:04:22,922 --> 02:04:26,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's as simple as probably scanning and attaching it as a document.

1491
02:04:27,052 --> 02:04:29,614
[SPEAKER_19]: If she can print this, she can save it as a PDF.

1492
02:04:30,175 --> 02:04:37,461
[SPEAKER_19]: So it would be better to save it as a PDF, because then it would be much easier to search machine-wise.

1493
02:04:37,541 --> 02:04:40,003
[SPEAKER_19]: If she scans it in, it will be much more difficult to search.

1494
02:04:40,063 --> 02:04:41,464
[SPEAKER_19]: It can be transferred as well.

1495
02:04:42,024 --> 02:04:45,227
[SPEAKER_19]: But if she can print this document, then she should be able to do it as a PDF.

1496
02:04:45,267 --> 02:04:51,953
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I realize it's more work for her to do, but it's important that the citizens have access to this digitally.

1497
02:04:51,973 --> 02:04:52,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1498
02:04:52,173 --> 02:04:52,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1499
02:04:52,813 --> 02:04:53,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1500
02:04:53,494 --> 02:04:54,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could request that they

1501
02:04:57,184 --> 02:05:00,808
[SPEAKER_07]: submitted as a PDF so that people can access it online.

1502
02:05:01,188 --> 02:05:07,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's something that more people from home would definitely would like to access and have the right to access.

1503
02:05:07,775 --> 02:05:12,580
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their tax dollars that go to paying the budget, so I would just move that, move approval.

1504
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:16,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I rest, Mr. President.

1505
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:36,204
[SPEAKER_13]: The records of the May 26, 2015, council meeting were passed to Councilor Penta.

1506
02:05:37,285 --> 02:05:38,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta.

1507
02:05:38,305 --> 02:05:39,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I found them.

1508
02:05:39,665 --> 02:05:40,985
[SPEAKER_13]: How did you find those records?

1509
02:05:41,186 --> 02:05:41,586
[SPEAKER_13]: In order.

1510
02:05:42,786 --> 02:05:44,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Found those records in order.

1511
02:05:44,426 --> 02:05:46,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you wish to motion their approval?

1512
02:05:48,627 --> 02:05:50,488
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1513
02:05:50,508 --> 02:05:51,348
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1514
02:05:51,388 --> 02:05:52,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

1515
02:05:53,148 --> 02:05:54,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to adjourn?

1516
02:05:57,234 --> 02:05:57,541
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?
