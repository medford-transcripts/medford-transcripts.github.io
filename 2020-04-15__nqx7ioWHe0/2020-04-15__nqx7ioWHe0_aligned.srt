1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,832
Thanks for being here.

2
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:07,096
This is Solidarity Live, where we discuss how COVID-19 is affecting Medford and Somerville.

3
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:11,238
This show is really about getting through this crisis together.

4
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:23,786
So if you have been affected by COVID-19, if you have lost income, if you're worried about a family member in a hospital, in a nursing home, in a jail, if you're struggling with school closures or anything else, please reach out.

5
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:27,609
Good policy is based on hearing directly from people in need.

6
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:33,192
And this show is about uplifting those stories so that we can solve these problems together as a community.

7
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:39,376
One example of how we are doing that is with the SNAP, a food assistance program.

8
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:52,123
Someone did reach out to the show a week or two ago to say that his doctor had told him that he needed to stay indoors because of his lung condition, but he cannot use his SNAP card to purchase groceries online.

9
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:54,445
He has to go to the grocery store in person.

10
00:00:55,305 --> 00:01:07,148
So we had an expert come on the show and give some advice, but it turns out that other states are allowing people to do online grocery delivery, and that is where you, viewers of the show, come in.

11
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:14,350
Please sign our petition to make Massachusetts one of the states that allows SNAP recipients to get their groceries delivered.

12
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,011
Together, we can help our neighbors through this crisis.

13
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:24,653
Our campaign is hearing directly from people in need, uplifting their voices, and engaging the community to solve these issues.

14
00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:32,677
So today I have on Hannah O'Hanlon from the Somerville Homelessness Coalition.

15
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:37,361
She's going to talk about the homeless population here and how they're being affected.

16
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:47,088
Then we'll have David Tissell from the Somerville Community Corporation to talk about the tenants that they have and what they're doing to keep them in their homes.

17
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:57,231
And after that, we will have Mavami Callahan, who's a Medford doctor, and she will be talking about how our medical system is holding up under the stress of COVID-19.

18
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,631
So I will go ahead and get us started here.

19
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:05,633
I'm gonna bring in Hannah O'Hanlon.

20
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:12,675
I just have to get her on the screen.

21
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:13,615
Oh, there we go.

22
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,059
I...

23
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:21,743
There we go.

24
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:24,885
I have managed to find the right button.

25
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:39,595
And by the way, anyone who is watching on YouTube, you can simply comment in YouTube's comment box and then ask any question you like and I can pull that question in and we'll answer those questions live.

26
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:41,496
So, great.

27
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:44,077
Hannah, thank you so much for being here.

28
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,060
I would love to hear a little bit just about your organization in general and the work that you do.

29
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:52,434
Yeah, you know, thank you so much for having me.

30
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:54,095
First of all, I really appreciate it.

31
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:58,716
So like you said, I work for the Somerville Homeless Coalition.

32
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:04,518
It's a really small nonprofit in Somerville, but we serve a lot of people.

33
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,380
We serve, you know, pretty much all greater Boston.

34
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,861
We're part of what's called the balance of state.

35
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,042
So we're not really just stuck to Somerville.

36
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:17,943
We do take a regional approach to serving people experiencing homelessness.

37
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:21,706
as well as people on the brink of homelessness.

38
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:27,127
So my particular role there is called the Emergency Services Program Manager.

39
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:31,429
So I kind of have two focuses.

40
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:40,171
My main one is to supervise and kind of control the daily operations of our two shelters.

41
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:45,893
So we have an individual shelter and a state funded family shelter.

42
00:03:46,793 --> 00:04:03,338
And then the second part of my job is to oversee our street outreach program, where we're going out into encampments in the area, hitting the streets where people are sleeping at night, kind of the most vulnerable homeless people that we see, and really trying to engage with them.

43
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:06,659
So that's what I do.

44
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,139
That is great.

45
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,400
Really needed work.

46
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:21,811
Do you have an idea of how many folks you interact with as a homeless population in need on a daily or weekly basis?

47
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:34,873
So our individual shelter alone services 16 people and our family shelter holds five families at a time, a maximum of 20 people.

48
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:47,436
At a given time, like I did street outreach today and I would say we probably saw 15 people out in encampment and then probably another maybe five to ten people sitting in Davis Square.

49
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:58,851
Separate from that, we also provide what's called permanent supportive housing, which is when we go out and we rent apartments, take people out of homelessness and put them in those apartments.

50
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:04,614
So through that program, we lease up over 60 units and house probably over 100 people.

51
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:05,394
That's amazing.

52
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:12,978
And then, yeah, we also have our food pantry that on an average month, we see probably 300 to 400 people.

53
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:16,439
Currently, we're definitely seeing that number kind of double.

54
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:21,950
So it really all depends on the program as far as how many people we see.

55
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:22,851
Yeah.

56
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,413
And where does your funding come from?

57
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:29,038
Oh, kind of everywhere, honestly.

58
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,884
Our family shelter is primarily funded through DHCD.

59
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:38,950
The state, our adult shelter has city funding, has state funding.

60
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,402
the federal government.

61
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:44,504
A lot of our homelessness prevention comes from the city of Somerville.

62
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:49,808
We just kind of pieced together a lot of different funding sources to make sure we can stay open.

63
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,909
And a lot of fundraising, that's for sure.

64
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:59,274
We just did an online campaign where we raised, to the best of my knowledge, I think over $100,000, which was huge for us.

65
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:01,956
Yeah, that's amazing.

66
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:07,780
Can you talk about how COVID-19 is affecting the people that you're helping?

67
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:14,856
You know, it's stressful, much like everybody else.

68
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,539
And again, it kind of divides up into the different sections.

69
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,763
Like our permanent supportive housing program, their services are now remote.

70
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:35,212
And it's really hard to provide case management to an 18-year-old in recovery and living on their own for the first time when it's just a phone call.

71
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:48,569
Or our shelter, now we're only, we've capped it at 13 right now, hoping to move out some more people, that way we can lower the number even more, because social distancing just does not exist in a homeless shelter.

72
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:50,129
It's real hard.

73
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:57,410
Our family shelter, the kids aren't in school, so we're trying to engage them, we're trying to educate them.

74
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,671
All of a sudden, the direct care workers are now teachers, just as much as parents are.

75
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,831
Yeah, it's definitely hard.

76
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:16,296
I think we're all tired, and we'll be grateful when it's over, but we're showing up every day.

77
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,317
Our services remain open.

78
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:22,199
We're still street outreaching, which is great.

79
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,142
We have our masks on, we have our gloves on when we go out there, but

80
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:39,888
You know, today when I was in the woods, a lot of people that typically make their money off of hand handling aren't getting money because people aren't going to work or people are afraid to stick their hand out the car window and give money.

81
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:44,532
So people now are starving in the woods because they don't have any money to buy food.

82
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:48,514
So when we go out there, it is constantly like, do you have food today?

83
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,515
Do you have water?

84
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:51,156
You know, those basic needs that

85
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:57,000
normally aren't as dire, really are dire at this point.

86
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:05,001
So things that I never thought kind of would have come up, like money from panhandling, but we're definitely seeing a lot of it.

87
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:06,502
Wow.

88
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:13,963
What do you think is the best way for people to be able to help out?

89
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,363
Where can they donate?

90
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:17,584
Can they volunteer?

91
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,704
Are there other ways that they can help?

92
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:27,357
Yeah, I know our food pantry is taking volunteers because they are getting absolutely swamped.

93
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:32,699
I think it was the month of March, typically we see 300 people and it was over 800 people.

94
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,562
You know, surrounding cities that have had to close their food pantries, people are now coming to Somerville.

95
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:40,703
That typically

96
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:44,735
You know, we don't service, but we're not going to turn somebody away for food.

97
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:51,740
So we are, you know, really looking for people to donate food to Project Soup, our food pantry.

98
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,085
They can go, they can help sort cans because we're just handing out bags of food at this point.

99
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,026
So we need to pack those bags.

100
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:03,903
As well as, you know, you can always go on the website and donate money.

101
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:09,484
Honestly, we're operating our shelter 24-7 right now, and that's not something we have funding for.

102
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:16,326
Typically, our shelter's only open 16 hours a day, and since the beginning of March, we've been open 24-7.

103
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:19,487
So, that's something that, you know, we need to find funding for.

104
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:23,348
And that's one way the community could help, that's for sure.

105
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:24,948
Absolutely.

106
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:32,807
Do you have any final thoughts, anything else that you want people to know about what's happening?

107
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:54,901
Oh, you know, I heard on WBUR there was a segment on homeless shelters, and all I remember is hearing that they had gotten enough tests to test an entire homeless shelter, like every single person in the shelter, and that some crazy high percentage of them

108
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,331
One in three.

109
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:01,354
Yeah, that's what I remember, but I didn't want to quote it because it seems so high.

110
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:06,498
But a lot of them were asymptomatic and they didn't show signs of the disease.

111
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:08,840
What do you think that that means?

112
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:17,907
You know, I think it's hard because we've really heard when it comes to, you know, the shelters, we need three things.

113
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:21,469
We need depopulation, we need quarantine, and we need isolation.

114
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:21,549
And

115
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:32,584
I feel like this is always an issue with homelessness is, is it going to be a state response, is it going to be a regional response, a federal response, or a local response?

116
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:35,484
And I've never seen that more present than I do right now.

117
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:36,945
You know, how are we going to respond?

118
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:38,005
Is it going to be the city?

119
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,025
Is it going to be the state?

120
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,105
Is it going to be regional?

121
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:47,607
And so as we kind of sort that out, you know, things start, people get symptomatic, people get sick.

122
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:51,006
It hit Boston hard.

123
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:53,727
It hit the Boston shelters really hard, one in three.

124
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,488
And now it's starting to make its way over the river.

125
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:59,770
It's going to hit Cambridge, and then it's going to slowly progress.

126
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:14,297
So the more we can do to get ahead of it and depopulate our shelters and set up those quarantine sites is going to really make the difference from Boston to the city of Somerville and Medford and the surrounding areas.

127
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:15,929
Yeah, absolutely.

128
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:21,411
And so it sounds like the program that you have where you actually house people is the safest for them.

129
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:23,751
Correct.

130
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:27,492
In addition to being obviously the best for them.

131
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:31,573
When you can house people and they can have their own home, it's clearly better for many reasons.

132
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:34,314
But here in COVID-19, it's even more crucial.

133
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:36,017
Exactly.

134
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:45,185
It's really showing kind of the holes in the system and what really will make the difference for homelessness in the future, which in reality will always be housing.

135
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:48,408
It will always be what makes the difference for someone experiencing homelessness.

136
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,525
Well, thank you so much.

137
00:11:53,726 --> 00:12:01,848
The work you guys do is totally amazing, and I don't envy you the amount of work that you have to do these days.

138
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:07,949
So, you know, we will be encouraging people to help you out, to volunteer and donate.

139
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:10,030
Thank you so much.

140
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,831
Yeah, it's really good to have an update, and stay safe.

141
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:17,351
Do personal care.

142
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:17,931
Thank you.

143
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:19,692
Everything that you need to do.

144
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,153
And thank you so much.

145
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:23,913
Thank you.

146
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:24,534
I appreciate it.

147
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:26,074
Yeah.

148
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:36,798
I'm going to go ahead and bring on David Tissell from the Somerville Community Corporation.

149
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:40,900
Let me just switch the titles here.

150
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,300
Here he is.

151
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,421
Hey, we've got you on.

152
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:43,481
Hi.

153
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:43,661
Hey.

154
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:44,781
Hi, Anna.

155
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,091
Thanks for being on.

156
00:12:49,111 --> 00:13:00,741
I would love to hear a little bit about what the Somerville Community Corporation does and your role specifically.

157
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:03,783
Sure.

158
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:12,211
So the Somerville Community Corporation or SCC is a nonprofit community development corporation for the city of Somerville.

159
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:20,731
Our main areas of work are building and owning and operating affordable housing.

160
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:26,854
We have about 275 units throughout the city scattered around in different buildings.

161
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:35,658
We also have a team of people that helps Somerville and other nearby area residents get jobs in the community.

162
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:40,660
And we also do community organizing for policies that

163
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:44,320
support economic justice locally and in the state.

164
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:51,966
So my work is on the affordable housing side with my supervisor, Scott.

165
00:13:53,047 --> 00:14:10,541
I manage a program called 100 Homes where we purchase buildings in Somerville and convert them to affordable housing using subsidy from the city of Somerville, sometimes also from state and federal, but mostly from the city, and then also like private mortgages

166
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:19,814
And so in this program, we have right now 85 units in the 100 homes program.

167
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:20,975
You're getting close.

168
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:31,480
And it differs from sort of traditional affordable housing development in that it's the already existing structures that become affordable rather than creating a new building.

169
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,482
Yeah, that's very important.

170
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:43,628
I mean, it seems like there's only a certain amount of new construction you can do in the densest city in the whole of New England.

171
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:57,791
Right, and it's really expensive now to buy anything in Somerville, but especially to purchase land, hold it, try to get your zoning, try to get in line for tax credits and everything to do the traditional development is really hard now.

172
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:00,212
We still are doing that and trying to do that.

173
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,933
But in addition, we decided that based on

174
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:11,397
just the community and the market that we're in, that this was a way to further our mission at this time through purchasing buildings.

175
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,619
Yeah, that is great.

176
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:22,967
So I'd love to hear how COVID-19 is affecting your organizing, is affecting your tenants, like what do you see happening?

177
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:27,030
Yeah, so my, I know

178
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:33,946
I guess the most about just on the landlord side, because once we buy these places, we own them.

179
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:41,330
And definitely our rent collections are less than usual for this time of month.

180
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:49,154
We've had a large number of tenants reach out to us that they've lost their jobs or that their hours have been cut.

181
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:53,196
And a lot of them are trying to apply for unemployment.

182
00:15:55,105 --> 00:16:08,672
And our team of people that helps people get jobs is mostly focusing on helping people get unemployment now, because there aren't that many new jobs, except there's some at Be Fresh, I guess, and some other places where they're hiring more people.

183
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:21,538
And we have a large number of tenants that are immigrants, and some of them have different statuses.

184
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:37,129
immigration status, and so people that are undocumented typically can't utilize the same benefits that people that are residents or permanent residents or citizens can.

185
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:49,112
So it's especially tough for some of those people, some of those tenants that we have that can't work now, so they're like zero income, so they can't pay their rent.

186
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:59,030
You know, we are trying to help everyone to the extent we can, and there are some funds set up.

187
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:06,212
For example, there's one, Cosecha has a fund, and also there's a new one that just is launched, I think, today.

188
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:15,715
United Way and City of Somerville, with CAS, the Community Action Agency of Somerville, sort of came together and launched this fund for Somerville residents.

189
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:19,677
So we're steering people towards those resources in addition to trying to help them

190
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:35,212
get unemployment or there's also what's called RAFT, which is a state-funded, state of Massachusetts-funded rental arrears, rental assistance program.

191
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:36,673
So we're helping people apply for that too.

192
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,994
Is that something new to COVID-19 or is that something that existed before?

193
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:44,977
It existed before, but it's been expanded because of COVID-19.

194
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:45,117
Yeah.

195
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:52,734
So can you talk just a little bit more about that in case there are people listening who might be interested in looking into that?

196
00:17:53,894 --> 00:18:02,978
Yeah, so RAFT is administered around Somerville by Metro Housing Boston, and the information is on their website.

197
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,600
And basically, you can apply for arrears

198
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:16,775
or up to $4,000 of budget, or it could be a mix of arrears and future budget.

199
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:25,646
So like if you're behind, if your rent's like $2,000 and you're behind one month, you could apply for the month you're behind and next month.

200
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,325
And you have to provide a lot of documentation.

201
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:34,288
I'm not going to go over all of it, and I can't remember all of it.

202
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:39,414
But if you look for RAFT in Metro Housing Boston, you'll see the application.

203
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:47,443
You'll see what type of stuff you have to attach, like stuff about your income status and documentation of your income.

204
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,219
Okay, good to know.

205
00:18:49,239 --> 00:19:01,003
You know, it's funny, shortly before this call, I happened to be talking to my mom who lives in California, and she was saying that Governor Gavin Newsom

206
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:21,032
you know, had very recently given a speech or a talk where he was saying that 10% of Californians are undocumented and that these undocumented workers were the people growing the food, were the people

207
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:36,903
delivering the food and other essentials, they were the people working in the grocery stores, that these are the essential workers, and that he was going to ensure that they had medical care, that they were all gonna get unemployment.

208
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:50,031
And I just wanna, I haven't looked into that from a policy, like I don't know what exact policies he passed, because I literally just got off the phone with her, but I'd love to hear from you a little bit about your thoughts on that.

209
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:54,120
Yeah, I think that I agree with that totally.

210
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:01,622
And I honestly, I don't know what documentation you need in Massachusetts to get unemployment.

211
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:06,924
I think you have to be a lawful permanent resident, but I'm not an immigration lawyer.

212
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:11,685
I know that there's some different programs that have different needs.

213
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:17,087
I think for RAFT, you need to show a social security number for the applicant.

214
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,348
I'm not sure how it works if you have like a mixed household,

215
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:41,477
But I think, I mean, immigrants, regardless of status, are what makes this country what it is, and it's who we are, is my opinion, and I think it's also a lot of people that are most at risk right now because of their jobs.

216
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:44,118
So.

217
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,099
Absolutely.

218
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,681
Are there other ways that people can get involved?

219
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:55,993
can help out in the work that you guys are doing.

220
00:20:56,133 --> 00:21:01,616
Tell us what we can do as far as... Yeah, thanks.

221
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:12,421
I mean, if you want to try and help people directly, I think that the best is this new fund for Somerville residents that just came out and they're fundraising.

222
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:19,344
And also, if you're specifically concerned about undocumented people in general, there's the Cosecha Fund.

223
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:27,248
SCC is a nonprofit and we also rely on fundraising, so if you want to donate to SCC, that's great.

224
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:34,720
We have a community investment tax credit program as well that you can learn more about on our website, summervillecc.org.

225
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:42,750
And I guess this is a little out there, but if you're trying to sell your house, maybe we buy it.

226
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:50,132
Or maybe not a house, but if you have a triple decker or something with tenants, you want to try and keep people there.

227
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:59,095
Most investors that buy investment property, their business model is to displace people, and ours is to keep people there.

228
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:00,495
So something to think about, too.

229
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:01,355
Wow.

230
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:05,316
And shout out to SHC, Senegal Homeless Coalition.

231
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:06,277
We work with you guys a lot.

232
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:10,063
Thank you, Hannah.

233
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:12,445
Absolutely.

234
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:13,125
Great.

235
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:15,708
Thank you so much, David.

236
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:16,548
Great to see you.

237
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,270
Thanks, Hannah.

238
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,512
And thanks for coming on and talking about the great work that you guys do.

239
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:22,033
Thank you.

240
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:25,794
Wonderful.

241
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:47,152
We are going to wrap up this episode with having my sister come on one more time because there are always updates in the medical community and we want to know what is happening

242
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,310
with our medical personnel?

243
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,150
What is happening?

244
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,071
How are doctors and nurses doing?

245
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:54,292
How are hospitals doing?

246
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,953
Are they able to cope with the stress of all of the new patients?

247
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:58,714
Are there enough beds?

248
00:22:58,754 --> 00:22:59,694
Are there enough ventilators?

249
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:01,555
What are the numbers?

250
00:23:01,835 --> 00:23:05,517
Tell us your updates.

251
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:06,857
And I apologize.

252
00:23:06,937 --> 00:23:08,218
I asked all these questions, but you know what?

253
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:12,040
People who didn't see the episode two weeks ago, please introduce yourself.

254
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,401
I'm Mufanami Callahan.

255
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,904
I work at Atrius Health in the center of Medford, and I'm a primary care doctor.

256
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:33,937
So I can tell a little bit of the story just from my experience as a primary care doctor, but I also just recently got completely up to date on the numbers in Massachusetts as well, because as people know, we are approaching the peak numbers for coronavirus.

257
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:41,343
So the latest numbers, we have nearly 30,000 cases in the state of Massachusetts and over a thousand deaths from coronavirus.

258
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,883
So it is very real for many people.

259
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:48,325
I think more and more people will know someone who had coronavirus.

260
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:52,226
And unfortunately, there will be more deaths as well.

261
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:55,888
The expectation is it's going to peak around Patriots Day.

262
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:57,949
So it's going to be very unusual for everyone.

263
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:04,892
On a day when everyone is used to going out to the marathon and having all sorts of gatherings, this is going to be a quiet day.

264
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:08,434
And it's going to be really the peak of activity for all the medical personnel.

265
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:11,655
What I can say that's really hopeful

266
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,403
is that we have not reached peak capacity in terms of our ICU beds.

267
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:18,284
Massachusetts has been amazing.

268
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:20,986
They nearly doubled the ICU beds in the state.

269
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:21,247
Wow.

270
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,989
So we went from 1,500 to 2,700 beds.

271
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:25,169
In three weeks?

272
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,111
In a month?

273
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:29,433
Right, just in the last month or so.

274
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:36,278
They also basically built a hospital at the Boston Convention Center, a 1,000-bed hospital.

275
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:40,881
And I actually think it's wonderful that we have the Homeless Coalition and other groups on today.

276
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:49,227
because half of that convention center is intended for the homeless population and it's being run by healthcare for the homeless.

277
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:55,191
So as we just talked about, it's a huge risk to be in a homeless shelter.

278
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:58,173
Obviously there's really no way to socially isolate.

279
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:10,962
So that convention center is gonna provide beds for patients who may be doing better in terms of their coronavirus, but they have no home to go to, or they really can't isolate.

280
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:14,617
And so that's going to be a place where people can convalesce.

281
00:25:14,857 --> 00:25:15,697
They can get better.

282
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,698
But it's staffed by medical personnel.

283
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:21,599
Atria sent 40 docs and nurses over there.

284
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:32,101
There's docs and nurses from partners and other hospitals all coming together so that we have this facility that can take a lot of the extra patients off of the hospitals.

285
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:37,062
So the patients who are really struggling and really need ventilators, they can get the care that they need.

286
00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:37,483
Yeah.

287
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:42,257
That's incredible that all these beds have been built.

288
00:25:42,337 --> 00:25:43,878
It's really amazing.

289
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:51,964
I believe that we've done everything that we can, and I truly hope that we're going to have enough to meet the surge.

290
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:55,286
So far, we are doing it, and we're meeting that need.

291
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:59,729
It is really tough, I would say, on the ER docs and on the ICU docs.

292
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,332
They have never needed to manage so many patients on ventilators.

293
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:09,562
It's not just the doctors but the respiratory techs who are there adjusting the machines and all the nurses.

294
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:15,987
They're the ones that are really getting exposed to the virus and there are medical personnel getting sick.

295
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:30,530
And I know there was a ballot measure recently to limit the number of patients that nurses would have to deal with at a time, and that didn't pass.

296
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:44,278
Do you have any sense of whether, I mean, obviously there's no avoiding in a pandemic that people are gonna have more patients, doctors are gonna have more patients, nurses are gonna have more patients, everybody, you know, and some medical health professionals

297
00:26:45,218 --> 00:26:46,519
are going to get sick and be out.

298
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:55,047
So as far as just the medical professionals, are people working crazy hours?

299
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:58,110
I know there was some sort of rotation happening.

300
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:00,132
How is that working out?

301
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:05,237
So I can't really speak to inpatient experience.

302
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:08,580
I believe they really are working crazy hours, just to be perfectly frank with it.

303
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,133
From the outpatient experience, there's not really vacation or weekends anymore.

304
00:27:13,813 --> 00:27:16,635
We are all working seven days a week.

305
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:24,621
Right now, our whole practice has really been transformed because we're trying the best we can to actually promote social distancing.

306
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:28,744
So we're avoiding bringing people in unless they really need to be seen physically.

307
00:27:29,345 --> 00:27:34,568
So for that blood pressure check, if they've got a blood pressure cuff at home, we can call them, we can talk to them.

308
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:38,231
Even things like rash, we're getting everyone trained up to do video visits.

309
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:43,745
so that you can see someone in their home and not necessarily bring them into the clinic where they might be exposed.

310
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,326
So we're completely transforming how we do care.

311
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:56,869
But what we're finding is while people aren't coming into the clinic, a ton of people are calling with questions about coronavirus exposure, symptoms.

312
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:03,031
And so a lot of our staff have been switched over really to receiving all those calls.

313
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:07,592
And just as you would imagine, that's happening at every time of day and night.

314
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:16,113
So we have teams of people just rotating on to try to answer those calls, and then to convert those to visits if we need to bring someone in.

315
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:20,954
We've got drive-through testing, and we're trying to ramp that up as well.

316
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:25,136
With drive-through testing, how long does it take to get the test results?

317
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,897
Or are you just getting tested and then you get the results later?

318
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:30,018
That is an improvement.

319
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:33,919
So right now, tests are coming back in one to two days.

320
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:36,820
It used to be four or five days to get the test back.

321
00:28:37,372 --> 00:28:43,177
Now, one to two days is still a long time when you're waiting and your family's concerned and you're concerned and you can't go back to work.

322
00:28:43,837 --> 00:28:54,746
So, there are tests that are in testing, you may have heard from the Broad Institute and for Abbott Labs, that will be shorter, within an hour or even within 15 minutes.

323
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:57,108
It's not widely distributed yet.

324
00:28:57,428 --> 00:29:00,771
I think that's going to be, once again, transformative.

325
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,502
Unfortunately, I think we'll probably see a second wave in the fall.

326
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:10,245
I'm hoping by then we'll have a rapid test that'll be like walking into a clinic for a flu test.

327
00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:18,012
Once we have that, it'll be much easier to really tell who has this disease and who doesn't, and to isolate if you need to.

328
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:19,753
Yeah.

329
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:22,556
How is it going with personal protective equipment?

330
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:25,478
I know that's something that you see in the news all the time.

331
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:26,679
There's not enough equipment.

332
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:29,582
People are having to wear the same mask for many shifts in a row.

333
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,283
Has that changed?

334
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:33,976
It's changed in a way.

335
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:37,839
So we've gotten better about reduce, reuse, recycle.

336
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,244
And what I would say is a lot of these masks and gowns were designed to be disposable.

337
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,587
And what we're finding is we have to find a better way.

338
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:56,113
And what we've done is there are washable, waterproof lab coats that we can use throughout a shift.

339
00:29:56,754 --> 00:30:01,077
And 95 masks, instead of changing them with each patient, we're using them throughout a shift

340
00:30:01,715 --> 00:30:03,216
then they're being decontaminated.

341
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:09,838
So I believe all the hospitals are decontaminating their N95 masks so they can be used up to 20 times.

342
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:10,379
Wow.

343
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,340
Now this is a huge change.

344
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,722
As long as it's safe to do this is amazing because then we don't need to buy millions of masks.

345
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:23,084
We just need to safely decontaminate them and then get them back into circulation.

346
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,625
So right now we're doing okay.

347
00:30:25,985 --> 00:30:26,485
I think the

348
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:34,500
The limitation is always getting enough masks and really the right kind of mask, so the N95 that provides a good seal.

349
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:39,162
Those are really the key, but so far we've been able to meet the demand.

350
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:41,543
Okay, that is good to know.

351
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:42,143
Great.

352
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:50,107
I would love to, first let me ask if you have other thoughts, if you have other things that you think people might find interesting?

353
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:58,102
The only other piece that I'm going to put in there, which is a little bit less about coronavirus, but just about how medicine is going to change.

354
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:02,123
I think people will like not coming into the clinic.

355
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:10,425
I think a lot of these changes, making virtual visits, making it easier for people who maybe have our mobility challenge.

356
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:11,525
They can't get out of the house.

357
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:14,586
A lot of these things are going to stay with us.

358
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:16,387
And that's a good thing.

359
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:21,248
So we've been making the changes more rapidly than we ever imagined.

360
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:24,988
But I think some of these are going to be really good changes that we can take forward.

361
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:26,630
Yeah.

362
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:35,099
And I'm just going to go ahead and have you finish up with a reminder, like washing hands.

363
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,665
What is a reminder of what is the proper, how do we best protect ourselves and others?

364
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:42,467
Right.

365
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:50,519
As you have heard a million times before, this is a time for physical distancing.

366
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:53,240
I like saying physical distancing instead of social distancing.

367
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,761
When you cross the street, you can still wave and say hi.

368
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:57,701
You just can't be right there with the person.

369
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:00,662
And that is the most important.

370
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:04,384
So really do not go on errands unless you absolutely need to.

371
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:10,266
If you can do grocery shopping once every two weeks instead of every twice a week, that's better.

372
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:14,127
Reduce the number of times that you really have to go out and about amongst other people.

373
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:19,758
Then the very best thing is washing your hands with soap and water.

374
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,581
Gloves, you might have seen a few things on the Internet.

375
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:25,503
It's very easy to cross-contaminate.

376
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:29,507
You wear your gloves and you touch your cell phone, you've got it all over your cell phone.

377
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:33,030
The best thing of all is really to wash with soap and water, 20 seconds.

378
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,551
That'll kill the virus.

379
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:36,813
It has that little coat of fat on the outside.

380
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,574
If you use soap, that'll take care of it.

381
00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:42,838
I wanted to mention one last thing because as we go on,

382
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:48,206
we're gonna have more and more people that have recovered from this virus, which is a wonderful thing.

383
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:51,806
And it is something where most people recover and do all right.

384
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,967
There's a real need for convalescent plasma.

385
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:58,728
And what that is, is a blood donation from patients who have had it.

386
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:05,949
Because of all the drugs and all the treatments that they have found, the one that really works is antibodies from someone who's recovered.

387
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:12,410
So for people, if they know they had it, if they had a test, and they are recovered and feeling well,

388
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:14,195
please call the Red Cross.

389
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:15,455
Think about donating.

390
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,256
You could absolutely save lives.

391
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:19,456
That is amazing.

392
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:21,517
Thanks so much for that tip.

393
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:22,497
That is really great.

394
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:34,359
Hopefully we'll soon get enough testing that everybody can know whether they have it, whether they had it, if they have been interacting with someone who has it or had it.

395
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:38,340
So hopefully we'll be there very soon.

396
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:42,145
Great, thank you so much for the update.

397
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:47,607
It's really great to hear about how the medical community is coping and that it seems like it's going okay.

398
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:48,768
We're not gonna be totally overwhelmed.

399
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:49,748
Yay!

400
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:54,910
And of course, thank you for being the front lines of this fight.

401
00:33:56,351 --> 00:34:03,314
It is really, you guys are all the heroes of the coronavirus.

402
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,327
We're glad to do it.

403
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:07,989
We're glad to do it.

404
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:08,570
Wonderful.

405
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:09,333
Thank you.

406
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:10,035
Thank you.

407
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:16,914
I think that is the end of our show this week.

408
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:26,919
As I mentioned before, please do send us your stories of how COVID-19 is affecting you, is affecting your family.

409
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:43,727
Let us know what sorts of issues we can dig into, what things you're interested in, and we will bring people on to talk about those issues to uplift the stories of what's happening to people in our community and to try and solve things together.

410
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:45,083
Thank you so much.
