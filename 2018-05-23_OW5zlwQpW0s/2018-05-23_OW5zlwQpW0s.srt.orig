[SPEAKER_10]: It's from the warrant, 18-0-1-3-8.

23
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:17,765
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the minimum regional high school tuition out of state, out of, sorry, district tuition expenses.

24
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:18,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Which page are you on?

25
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:20,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Eight of 11, excuse me.

26
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,128
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fourth from the bottom.

27
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to know, what are the two programs that most of the students are enrolled in?

28
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:34,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know that it's just two programs.

29
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:40,161
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a specific breakdown of which programs can certainly look into that for you.

30
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:41,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Milestones.

31
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:42,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that correct?

32
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:42,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Milestones?

33
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:45,844
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Minuteman Regional High School and Vocational High School.

34
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:46,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Minuteman.

35
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:47,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Out of district.

36
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Belson, did you want to say?

37
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:50,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Minuteman?

38
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:51,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you looking at Minuteman or Milestones?

39
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:52,627
[SPEAKER_20]: Minuteman.

40
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:53,227
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

41
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:58,669
[SPEAKER_20]: So Minuteman is a vocational technical chapter 74 program.

42
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,871
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes the payments are grouped.

43
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:05,474
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking?

44
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:06,555
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the 63 and the 25.

45
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:13,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was, what do you call it, a payment that was- He's inquiring what specific Chapter 74 program they're enrolled in.

46
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:13,797
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have that.

47
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:19,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know of this program, what is the one that most of the students are enrolled in?

48
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:19,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Plumbing.

49
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:19,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it plumbing?

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

51
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:20,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Plumbing still?

52
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Not really, not really.

53
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,861
[SPEAKER_20]: It's changed.

54
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:28,243
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not.

55
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:31,824
[SPEAKER_20]: By next year, they're likely to have two or three kids.

56
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:32,666
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

57
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:34,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's really going down.

58
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:35,928
[SPEAKER_20]: It went down from 50 kids.

59
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:38,490
[SPEAKER_10]: How many kids do we have currently in the program?

60
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably, what, three or four?

61
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:41,232
[SPEAKER_20]: Seven right now, maybe?

62
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:44,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Six or seven at minimum.

63
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:44,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Nine.

64
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:47,316
[SPEAKER_20]: Nine at minimum, that's including Essex, no?

65
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:49,297
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Essex is separate.

66
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:49,898
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, all right.

67
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:53,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you just give me a breakdown of the program when you have time?

68
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly.

69
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you give me a breakdown of what programs are enrolled in?

70
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:55,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely, ma'am.

71

120
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:17,224
[SPEAKER_22]: Anthony Petralas, fifth grade teacher at McGlynn Elementary School.

121
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Chris Murphy, 70 Windsor Road.

122
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:24,609
[SPEAKER_22]: So we just want to say thank you for taking the time to allow us to speak here tonight.

123
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:29,552
[SPEAKER_22]: We're here to promote our event that we're running in Medford this year, which is the One Mission Buzz Off.

124
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,913
[SPEAKER_22]: It started about five years ago.

125
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:34,875
[SPEAKER_22]: We had a student at McGlynn who passed away of cancer, a third grader.

126
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:40,404
[SPEAKER_22]: And it started off as a few teachers going to Gillette Stadium every year to buzz their heads in his remembrance.

127
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:47,794
[SPEAKER_22]: And last year was the first year that we decided to host our own fundraiser for it before we traveled up to Gillette.

128
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,176
[SPEAKER_22]: We had a really successful fundraiser.

129
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:54,119
[SPEAKER_22]: We set a goal for $3,000 and we raised over seven.

130
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,862
[SPEAKER_22]: So we had a lot of community participation.

131
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,303
[SPEAKER_22]: We had over 100 people attend.

132
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:05,848
[SPEAKER_22]: And we were really excited and we thought this year it would be great to actually host a community buzz off ourselves.

133
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:08,830
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're not only gonna host our own fundraiser in Mefford,

134
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,491
[SPEAKER_22]: We're also going to actually be buzzing that day.

135
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:21,293
[SPEAKER_22]: So we've had, you know, our team grow from year one of four people going to Gillette Stadium to buzz their heads to now over 20 people who are going to be buzzing their heads at the event.

136
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:26,194
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's at John Brewer's Tavern, Saturday, June 2nd from 6 to 11 o'clock at night.

137
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:32,376
[SPEAKER_22]: The event, we're going to have, you know, 10 to 12 small raffle items, 10 to 12 large raffle items.

138
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:37,977
[SPEAKER_22]: We have KBK Sports coming in, sports memorabilia place to do a sign on auction for us for the night.

139
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:39,314
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a 50-50 raffle.

140
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,776
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have a cornhole challenge.

141
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:47,361
[SPEAKER_22]: And we have barbers and hairdressers coming in to be buzzing people's hair at the event.

142
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:50,905
[SPEAKER_22]: I know the mayor is going to be participating and helping out in some aspect with it.

143
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:54,708
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know we're really excited about the community participation.

144
00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:03,497
[SPEAKER_22]: This year we were able to have the police and the fire presidents of the union have a contest of who could raise more money between the fire station and the police station.

145
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:06,275
[SPEAKER_22]: to help us raise money for our event.

146
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:09,736
[SPEAKER_22]: And we couldn't be more excited to have the community involved.

147
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:20,059
[SPEAKER_22]: And we came to city council last week and spoke and we got a great, when we left that day, we had a lot of people emailing us and calling us to join the team or to help out in some capacity.

148
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:27,262
[SPEAKER_22]: So we were really excited to be able to speak there and we felt coming here, we could just spread the word and let people know about our event.

149
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:30,203
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is why we're here presenting to you guys.

150
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to see you again.

151
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:39,424
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a great event last year, and I'm so glad you're here and going to continue the tradition.

152
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:40,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:41,185

[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for taking this on and moving it back home.

[SPEAKER_17]: We'll call it home.

00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,228
[SPEAKER_17]: More or less home.

157
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,389
[SPEAKER_17]: And thanks for bringing it here.

158
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:49,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course.

159
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,170
[SPEAKER_17]: We really appreciate it.

160
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,732
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a great community event, and you guys are wonderful for doing this and continuing to do it.

161
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:57,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

162
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:01,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say thank you also.

163
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:02,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great event.

164
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I attended last year.

165
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:04,414
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much fun.

166
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:12,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to also read that the students at the vocational school created the t-shirts and the high school, the video department made a great video.

167
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's fantastic.

168
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:21,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I saw it already posted on like Facebook with the blog and I continue to share it once it gets closer.

169
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:22,706
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, absolutely.

170
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:27,590
[SPEAKER_22]: There's been a lot of the schools have been promoting it on their parent teacher group pages and so on.

171
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:32,504
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we're anticipating a lot of people and we're pretty excited about, you know, what the turnout will look like.

172
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:33,944
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you want that.

173
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:37,766
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to let people know they can still join the team.

174
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:52,251
[SPEAKER_19]: You can sign up that day, make a donation, get your head shaved that day, or you can join the team online at buzzforkids.org, actually join the team, and then you can solicit donations through the website.

175
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,613
[SPEAKER_19]: If there is anybody watching that wants to donate,

176
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:10,067
[SPEAKER_19]: online that can't go is buzzforkids.org and just search team emo and you can donate directly to the team and we do you can still sign up you can join that day.

177
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:16,194
[SPEAKER_19]: We have teachers, board and commission members, we have cops, firemen,

178
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:19,434
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we have a DPW guy.

179
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:20,854
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't have any elected officials yet.

180
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:26,698
[SPEAKER_19]: We have women on the team.

181
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:28,719
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we have three women on the team this year.

182
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:32,261
[SPEAKER_19]: We have three women who are buzzing their heads so far.

183
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:33,822
[SPEAKER_19]: Just saying.

184
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:39,465
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's going to be periodic.

185
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,425
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be periodic.

186
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:55,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Between 8, 830, I know the firefighters, I think, have said they're going to be coming in throughout the night, getting their head shaved, some of the cops as well.

187
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:58,896
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I shave one of their heads, please?

188
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:01,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Periodically throughout the night, I think you'll see.

189
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:03,240
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to try to spread it out.

190
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,042
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be a really fun event.

191
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:07,745
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a really great time last year.

192
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,322
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, Anthony's been doing this for a couple of years now.

193
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:14,463
[SPEAKER_19]: It was his goal to us to do this.

194
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:20,588
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, our goal is to make it bigger and bigger and bigger and, you know, eventually just, you know, an all-day affair one day, hopefully.

195
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:25,472
[SPEAKER_19]: And you guys in the City Council have been excellent.

196
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:30,115
[SPEAKER_19]: John Brewer's Tavern has been awesome in helping us with this.

197
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,157
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're really looking forward to this.

198
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,359
[SPEAKER_19]: We're looking to, you know, we set a goal of 10,000.

199
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully we beat that.

200
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:55,557
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just wondering how many people buzzed their heads last year and what's your goal for this year?

201
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,739
[SPEAKER_22]: So last year I think we had about seven or eight people on our team buzz.

202
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,700
[SPEAKER_22]: Our team was over like

203
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:02,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, maybe 10, somewhere around there, yeah.

204
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:23,950
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think you have a set amount of money you have to raise as an individual when you do a community buzz off.

205
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:28,977
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's just all the money that's raised through the community goes to the actual charity.

206
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:33,243
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can be a little looser on what people actually have to raise to participate.

207
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:37,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, last year we raised, as a team, when it was all said and done, about $35,000.

208
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:44,956
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're hoping to kind of get within the same ballpark, you know, hosting our own event this year, as opposed to just going to Gillette that day.

209
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:46,577
[SPEAKER_22]: So, kind of new ground for us.

210
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:50,542
[SPEAKER_16]: So will you guys get buzzed at John Brewer's, or wait and get buzzed at Gillette?

211
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:53,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we're all gonna just do it at John Brewer's that night, yeah.

212
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:58,919
[SPEAKER_22]: So the actual buzz off is the next day at Gillette Stadium, but we're going to do it the day before, yeah.

213
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:05,582
[SPEAKER_22]: So one mission's been great in sending us all the stuff that we need, t-shirts and banners and everything else that we're going to be decorating that night.

214
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:07,123
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're excited.

215
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:09,284
[SPEAKER_22]: We're really excited to try something new and see how it goes.

216
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.

217
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:13,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Go team BMO.

218
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:13,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much.

219
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,006
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for taking the time.

220
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:15,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

221
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:15,866
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see you there.

222
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:35,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, while we're into suspension, community participation, we were supposed to have Sean Driscoll Gomez from CCSR, but I believe he is receiving an award tonight up at the high school, so we have three individuals that will be presenting.

223
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,611
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the Orkton Project.

224
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:44,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Your name and address, please, for our record.

225
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:46,595
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Kaylee Boulay.

226
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:49,878
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Emily Gatti.

227
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:52,145
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Parviti Rana.

228
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:53,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

229
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and school committee members.

230
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:02,352
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Kaylee Boulay and I'm here with Parviti Rana and Emily Gotti.

231
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:08,676
[SPEAKER_07]: We are students in the ninth grade at Medford High School and we would like to present our CCSR project to you.

232
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:14,480
[SPEAKER_07]: CCSR, also known as Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility,

233
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:19,113
[SPEAKER_07]: is a group that creates projects that work toward helping others and the environment.

234
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:27,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Our project is known as One Sapling at a Time, and we are here today to ask for your permission to create a fruit orchard on the Medford High Campus.

235
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:34,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Good afternoon once again.

236
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:43,340
[SPEAKER_08]: As determined ninth grade students, we strive to achieve our goals to make a community a better place,

237
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:52,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Our project, as you heard, is titled One Sapling at a Time, and we would essentially like to place an orchard in the back of the Medford High campus.

238
00:12:53,062 --> 00:13:03,163
[SPEAKER_08]: We would specifically like the trees to be placed on the hill outside of the community school's entrance, which if you see in the packet you have received, it's on the second page.

239
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,664
[SPEAKER_08]: For our project, we are working with the CCSR, our advisor, Ms.

240
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:13,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Smith, Ben Barkin, Michael Ruggiero,

241
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:15,793
[SPEAKER_08]: kindly.

242
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,856
[SPEAKER_08]: We would like to proceed on our project in the fall of 2018.

243
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:31,263
[SPEAKER_08]: We would like to accomplish this by using generous donations of Mr. Ruggiero, which include blueberry bushes, labor, and soil preparations, and Mr. Barkin, which include the trees.

244
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:37,266
[SPEAKER_08]: We also will receive a small amount of funding through the Cummings Foundation, which is a CCSR mini-grant.

245
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:42,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, we are seeking additional grant funding as well to support our project.

246
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you may have questions about maintenance, in which I will guide your attention to my colleague, Emily.

247
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

248
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:49,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

249
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:54,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my name is Emily Gatti, and I'm a freshman at Medford High.

250
00:13:55,454 --> 00:14:02,239
[SPEAKER_00]: So harvesting and caring for the plants is obviously not going to be an easy feat, and it's definitely not one that can be done alone.

251
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:08,043
[SPEAKER_00]: So our solution to find help would be to reach out and recruit school clubs, such as the CCSR,

252
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:20,425
[SPEAKER_00]: or other clubs to help sometime after school or on another planned date to help harvest and plant the trees during peak times, which, as Praviti said, would be later in the fall of this year.

253
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:29,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would also like to reach out to any other Medford High students willing to sign up, and we would, in turn, provide community service hours to them.

254
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:38,369
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also ask community volunteers, such as the Redemption Hill Church and the Medford Family Network garden play groups.

255
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:47,193
[SPEAKER_07]: We feel that planting fruit trees on the grounds of Medford High will have numerous benefits.

256
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:54,314
[SPEAKER_07]: The fruit trees will provide fresh fruit that will be handed out for no charge to students at the Medford High School.

257
00:14:55,775 --> 00:15:05,637
[SPEAKER_07]: The fruit trees will provide an educational opportunity for students to learn about the planting and harvesting of the fruit trees as well as the life cycle of the trees.

258
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:14,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Having fruit trees on the grounds of Medford High will beautify the grounds on the outside area of the school by adding color and making it a more positive environment for the students.

259
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:20,847
[SPEAKER_07]: We feel that this project is very important for many reasons, including it will make Medford a nicer and happier place.

260
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:25,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Helping the environment makes me feel happy and feel like a better person.

261
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:30,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make not just the environment a better place, but the people living in it too.

262
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:38,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I want, we want to plant this orchard for it to benefit students at the Medford High School and people that live throughout Medford.

263
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:44,971
[SPEAKER_07]: This one change to Medford High will make the grounds in Medford High a more positive environment and a more positive school.

264
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:51,754
[SPEAKER_08]: You may be wondering why this project is so important to us.

265
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:58,238
[SPEAKER_08]: As ninth graders, we want to beautify the school and improve the general lifestyle of the school.

266
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:07,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, the Medford High School has a basic connotation of a cement building, but with a unique orchard, it's a whole boost.

267
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:13,330
[SPEAKER_08]: And, I mean, I haven't heard of any other school with an orchard right in their backyard.

268
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a really unique aspect that I think would be a great add to Medford High.

269
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:32,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, this project is important because as of now, I've been at Medford High for almost a year, and I consider it to be a home away from home, just as it is to many other kids.

270
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:43,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, I attended the Day on the Hill event in Boston, and one of the issues that we talked about with Medford High is trying to increase the enthusiasm

271
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:53,241
[SPEAKER_00]: of Medford High and in creating an orchard we could boost school spirit in the students because it sets Medford High apart from other schools.

272
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:56,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates a beautiful place to learn.

273
00:16:57,522 --> 00:17:03,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Having an orchard in the fells and adding new plant life will hopefully recharge the likeliness of the student body as well.

274
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:08,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any of you have any questions for us?

275
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:08,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

276
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Van de Kloot.

277
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:13,549
[SPEAKER_03]: So first I want to say I think this is an absolutely wonderful idea.

278
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:26,015
[SPEAKER_03]: When that entranceway was refurbished some years ago, the idea always was that there should be plantings on that hill adjacent to the steps.

279
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:33,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's always made me very sad that that, you know, it's just kind of a dull space rather than an exciting space.

280
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:40,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very enthusiastic about this project, and I really appreciate the idea.

281
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:45,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I have only one concern, which, you know, maybe you've thought about.

282
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:56,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that a fallen apple could make a great missile, ball, substitute ball.

283
00:17:57,203 --> 00:18:02,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So, projectile is probably the word that I really want.

284
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to

285
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:17,215
[SPEAKER_03]: ask if you've considered that, and how would you make sure that students are respectful of the fallen fruit and that we wouldn't find it being used for target practice against the side of the school?

286
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:33,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we have considered that, and along with the maintenance, with the people volunteering, we would like to create a sort of schedule to maintain the fallen apples, so we could keep as many apples from off the field as possible.

287
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:42,598
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe some signage, too, about this project and what it is might help so that the students really are respectful of it.

288
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:49,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, there will be rules and regulations to the orchard for no harmfulness being done.

289
00:18:50,920 --> 00:19:00,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in terms of the slope of the area that is to be planted, is that slope okay for the trees that you've suggested?

290
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:02,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it matter that there's a slope?

291
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:10,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we've met with a landscaper who has laid out for us the position of the trees, which Ms.

292
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,585
[SPEAKER_26]: Smith will address.

293
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,606
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, the slope actually is beneficial.

294
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:15,347
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, great.

295
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:21,551
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so it gets all of the sun, so they'll get, you know, all the way up the orchard, they'll get sun kind of evenly distributed that way.

296
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:23,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and how about watering the trees?

297
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,714
[SPEAKER_03]: making sure they've got enough water.

298
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:31,996
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, there is water access on the side of the building, so we'll have to figure some way to do that.

299
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:40,540
[SPEAKER_26]: But I know I think our buddy Mr. Ruggiero over there has experience with drip irrigation and can help us set something up.

300
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:48,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to also thank my colleague for donating the blueberries and being a help in this project.

301
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:49,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great, girls.

302
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:51,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your presentation tonight.

303
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:53,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

304
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:54,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Benedetto?

305
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:05,983
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, I just wanted to express how impressed I am with your presentation and how comfortable you seem coming up to the podium.

306
00:20:07,063 --> 00:20:19,168
[SPEAKER_16]: The colored pictures, really knowing all your facts, and also giving your own personal reasons why it would matter to you really brings that emotional peace home.

307
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,529
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted this time to motion to approve

308
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:30,674
[SPEAKER_16]: the apple orchard and all the other fruit at Meffitt High School.

309
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:40,679
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a great hands-on learning opportunity for not only our high school students, but also all students educated there, especially our early childhood students.

310
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,660
[SPEAKER_16]: So, at this time, I make that motion.

311
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,261
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion on the floor for approval, seconded by Ms.

312
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:46,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloof.

313
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:47,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

314
00:20:48,295 --> 00:20:48,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

315
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:50,196
[SPEAKER_09]: This is lovely.

316
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:59,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's an exciting project and certainly I'd be happy to not look at that current field.

317
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:12,491
[SPEAKER_09]: The soil is, I mean, I realize these are not just fruits where you have to care a lot about a regular vegetable garden where soil matters a lot, but is the soil acceptable as it's been tested and is perfectly fine?

318
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:13,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

319
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:14,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

320
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,534
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I wanted to know.

321
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:16,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

322
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:19,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero, you have the floor.

323
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:28,292
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had the reddismith and the landscaper and I, we walked the area and sort of viewed and we also did some soil tests.

324
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:32,174
[SPEAKER_10]: For the high bush blueberries, the soil isn't quite acidic enough.

325
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:37,137
[SPEAKER_10]: If possible, I'm happy to donate the plastic mulch, the thyme, and also the sulfur.

326
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:42,420
[SPEAKER_10]: But if possible, I'd like to start preparing the soil so we can get the pH.

327
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now the pH is around six, which is

328
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:49,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It's way too high for blueberries, so we have to drop that around to about 4.5 or 5.

329
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:57,911
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm happy to donate all the preparations for blueberries, but these other plants that were chosen, I looked them up and I talked to some horticultural friends.

330
00:21:57,931 --> 00:22:00,413
[SPEAKER_10]: These are all really great plants that they've chosen.

331
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,454
[SPEAKER_10]: We just have to touch up a little bit with the blueberries.

332
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:04,995
[SPEAKER_17]: What work is involved in doing that?

333
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:10,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it depends if the club would like to plant this September.

334
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,459
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a couple of options that we have.

335
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:15,800
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be best to rototill the area for the blueberries.

336
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I already have about 30 plants and containers, and I have all the plastic mulch.

337
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:36,205
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I would recommend would be to rototill the area, spread some sulfur, and then give it a couple of months, and then we can apply some, I have prepared some acidic wood chips, so that'll help as well.

338
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,637
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would prefer to get that done as soon as possible.

339
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:41,938
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll take me probably about a couple of days, I guess.

340
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:45,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I just need to rototill it, lay down the plastic mulch.

341
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,640
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to measure it.

342
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I also can, I'll send down all the drip irrigation.

343
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:51,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.

344
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.

345
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I just have a question also.

346
00:22:55,704 --> 00:22:55,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.

347
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:59,046
[SPEAKER_17]: If we're curious to see.

348
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:02,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, of course, happy to.

349
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:03,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

350
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:03,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Kretz.

351
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,884
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to thank you for the presentation.

352
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:07,525
[SPEAKER_01]: It was excellent.

353
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And the brochure with the pictures, I can see the vision.

354
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:15,353
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks so beautiful with the plants and the trees and the blueberries.

355
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:17,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Michael, for your donations.

356
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:23,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just had a question about the deer population that is in the fells.

357
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:25,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that we're going to attract

358
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:29,163
[SPEAKER_01]: deers and maybe coming close to the school.

359
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:35,153
[SPEAKER_17]: This would be up to the school committee, how we handle this problem.

360
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:38,658
[SPEAKER_10]: The way I handle this on my farm is we have an electric fence.

361
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:46,125
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to, once again, I'll donate the T-poles and the wiring, and I'll set it up for everyone.

362
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,926
[SPEAKER_10]: My fence has 7,000 volts that run through it.

363
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:55,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously it won't hurt anyone, but it could be a great prank for kids to mess around with, so we'll have to talk with the community.

364
00:23:55,209 --> 00:24:01,032
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want me to install it, we definitely need to shut it down during school hours, and we'll have to talk.

365
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:06,815
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's possible we could turn it on once school is not in session, and then I could put it on a timer.

366
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:12,436
[SPEAKER_10]: and then we can shut it off once it's on eight o'clock and deer won't bother you.

367
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:16,337
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a person was to walk towards the electric fence, would they get shocked?

368
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:16,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

369
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:23,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm just one of the people with that night.

370
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,279
[SPEAKER_10]: We could actually choose a lower voltage.

371
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:28,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a higher voltage on my farm because I want the deers to get shocked.

372
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,221
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we have people around, we can have a lower voltage.

373
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,622
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically like someone, a little bee sting.

374
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:41,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Like someone hits you kind of hard with a pencil eraser is what it feels like.

375
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:43,017
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't leave any permanent damage.

376
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:44,698
[SPEAKER_10]: It's humane to the animals as well.

377
00:24:44,978 --> 00:24:49,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe with the people again, the rules and regulations would also follow.

378
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'd have to figure out.

379
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,681
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want, I'll be happy to lay down the fence.

380
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:54,861
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll hold off.

381
00:24:55,021 --> 00:24:56,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Or we'll hold off.

382
00:24:56,102 --> 00:24:56,862
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine too.

383
00:24:57,942 --> 00:24:59,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Liability, we're not going to.

384
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:00,143
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I understand.

385
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:01,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Good question, Kat.

386
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:01,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

387
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:01,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

388
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:03,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you all set, Ms.

389
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:03,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz?

390
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:04,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

391
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:05,025
OK.

392
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,315
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, thank you, Carly, Robert E., and Emily.

393
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:10,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

394
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:16,340
[SPEAKER_17]: And your adjectives that you use, boost and recharge, great words, and they mean a lot.

395
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,142
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that many of the students will feel the same way as you.

396
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:20,223
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a great project.

397
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:21,684
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Sean, for us as well.

398
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:24,986
[SPEAKER_17]: I know he won't be able to do any of the hard work, though, right?

399
00:25:25,747 --> 00:25:26,587
[SPEAKER_17]: He's graduating.

400
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:28,829
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's up to you three.

401
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:30,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

402
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Van de Kloot.

403
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:33,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that one of the things which makes this particularly

404
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:43,690
[SPEAKER_03]: is that the fact that you guys are just freshmen now and you're gonna be able to, you're gonna have a piece of this throughout the rest of your high school career.

405
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really makes this even more meaningful than if you were seniors going out the door.

406
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you so much.

407
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:50,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

408
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:51,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, ladies.

409
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:53,632
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor.

410
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:58,033
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor for approval.

411
00:25:58,773 --> 00:25:59,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

412
00:25:59,793 --> 00:25:59,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Fritz.

413
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:02,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanna make sure it's in the committee.

414
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:06,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Supporting the tilling.

415
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:08,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Just coordinate with John.

416
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:20,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

417
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

418
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

419
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:25,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

420
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:25,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Great job.

421
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:26,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice job tonight.

422
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:28,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

423
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:28,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay.

424
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:43,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Also while we're in the suspension, we have a report on the student award for foreign languages.

425
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:49,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like to come up here and say a few words so you can speak out to everyone?

426
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:12,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, Mr. Carlin.

427
00:27:12,303 --> 00:27:13,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, good evening.

428
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,305
[SPEAKER_06]: The floor is yours.

429
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:14,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

430
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:29,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am pleased to announce that a student, Medford High School sophomore, Cheng Cheng, scored in the top 1% of international Italian exams.

431
00:27:29,802 --> 00:27:30,623
[SPEAKER_06]: She was the only one.

432
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:38,365
[SPEAKER_06]: She's not the only one in Massachusetts to do so.

433
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:55,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, she got a gold medal and a check for $50, but the exciting part is that she also got a two-week all-paid expense to study in Italy, of course, in Italy, which includes tuition and accommodations.

434
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:59,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are three schools in Italy that she can choose from.

435
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:08,565
[SPEAKER_06]: And she also gets $10, excuse me, not $10,000, $1,000 to help with the cost for the airfare.

436
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're very proud of Jane.

437
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:14,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's here with her family.

438
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:18,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

439
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:19,967
[SPEAKER_21]: You can say it in Italian if you want.

440
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:20,527
[SPEAKER_21]: In Italian.

441
00:28:20,547 --> 00:28:22,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Say something in Italian.

442
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,528
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for everything.

443
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:44,468
[SPEAKER_17]: So the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Chen Chang, gold medal recipient, National Italian Exam 2018, signed by all members of the school committee.

444
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:45,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations, Chen.

445
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:48,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Wonderful, great job.

446
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,151
[SPEAKER_17]: You must be so proud.

447
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:51,512
[SPEAKER_17]: We are very proud, thank you.

448
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:52,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice, thank you.

449
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:10,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, would you like to do a picture with the parents and all the school committee members?

450
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,024
Would Cheng's parents like to come forward?

451
00:29:44,560 --> 00:30:04,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody get closer.

452
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,481
[SPEAKER_25]: Say pizza.

453
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:25,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, we haven't approved him yet.

454
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:30,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, we have them.

455
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,679
[SPEAKER_20]: So there is none?

456
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:35,281
[SPEAKER_20]: So we don't have a full minute.

457
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:35,761
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

458
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,542
[SPEAKER_17]: All set?

459
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:51,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

460
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,477
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

461
00:31:52,837 --> 00:31:53,457
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

462
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:54,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

463
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:58,240
[SPEAKER_17]: The committee of the whole minutes are not complete from May 17th.

464
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,583
[SPEAKER_17]: They will be provided to us at our next meeting, correct, Mr. Superintendent?

465
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:06,726
[SPEAKER_17]: So the packet that you have is actually for the old business item.

466
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,607
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you could just move that to the back.

467
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:10,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, report of superintendent.

468
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Report on building bridges to kindergarten.

469
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

470
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,112
[SPEAKER_20]: Call upon our assistant superintendent to give this report.

471
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:17,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

472
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:17,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Caldwell.

473
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:19,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everybody.

474
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:32,114
[SPEAKER_11]: So our Building Bridges to Kindergarten took place on Tuesday, April 10th at Medford High School and on May 3rd at the Roberts Elementary School from 7 to 8 p.m.

475
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:40,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Extended hours for registration were offered on March 20th and were offered again on April 10th as well.

476
00:32:41,496 --> 00:32:46,597
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, we've had some inclement weather this past winter, so we had to rearrange our schedules.

477
00:32:47,615 --> 00:33:00,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Maria Michelli, who was a kindergarten teacher at the Brooks Elementary School, presented to our new kindergarten families what to expect when their children go into kindergarten, and as you know, we had a lot of anxious parents mulling about.

478
00:33:01,303 --> 00:33:07,267
[SPEAKER_11]: There were discussions and questions about curriculum, snacks and lunch, safety protocols in each building,

479
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:12,875
[SPEAKER_11]: the before and after school programs, and how the kiddos ride the bus.

480
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:19,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Shelly Gross, our early childhood director, was available to discuss transition plans for preschool,

481
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:23,671
[SPEAKER_11]: and after school, and we had before school, as well as CPAC.

482
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:27,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Attached is the letter and flyer that we sent home to parents.

483
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:30,897
[SPEAKER_11]: This information is also listed on our website.

484
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:43,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Our enrollment is consistent with what it has been in the years past, but I actually checked with Maria Ibrahim this morning, and we're up 13 students at the same time as last year.

485
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:47,612
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, the Columbus Elementary School has increased by a good margin.

486
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:55,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Kindergarten Open House was on Wednesday, May 9th, at each of our elementary schools, from two to three o'clock.

487
00:33:55,936 --> 00:34:01,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Early Childhood Director Shelly Gross was available to provide a welcome packet to each of our families.

488
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:05,820
[SPEAKER_11]: And before and after school programs still have the registration in progress.

489
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:16,363
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to show you what the kindergarten packets look like, that each family, this was designed by our students, and inside the bag,

490
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:22,797
[SPEAKER_11]: each of our families received a Welcome to Kindergarten packet that goes to parents.

491
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:31,881
[SPEAKER_11]: For children, this is what we do in kindergarten, and just a couple of manipulatives and some toys for the kids to talk so they can write.

492
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:39,004
[SPEAKER_11]: So each of our parents and families received these little gifts and welcome when they went to the elementary schools.

493
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:40,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.

494
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:42,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any questions?

495
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:46,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

496
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to comment how awesome that little bag is.

497
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:53,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for putting that together as a father who's about to have a kid go into kindergarten.

498
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,771
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty frightening time.

499
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that makes a lot of people a little more nervous.

500
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:57,133
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a scary.

501
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:58,194
[SPEAKER_17]: And it only gets worse.

502
00:34:58,674 --> 00:35:00,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

503
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:01,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Or so I've heard.

504
00:35:01,837 --> 00:35:02,698
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a difficult time.

505
00:35:02,758 --> 00:35:06,921
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's your first student going, a child going into kindergarten, you don't know what to expect.

506
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:14,628
[SPEAKER_11]: So our kindergarten teachers are available to talk to you and to show you around the rooms, the different centers that they have

507
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:21,027
[SPEAKER_11]: the play areas, which is still really important because kids learn through play that we do in kindergarten.

508
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:30,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know, have you heard much interest expressed in the community about starting a pre-K program that's also available for everyone?

509
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:31,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, for everyone.

510
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:33,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we do have preschools available.

511
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:36,339
[SPEAKER_11]: We have three or four at the high school.

512
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:40,222
[SPEAKER_11]: We have two at the Brooks preschool.

513
00:35:40,282 --> 00:35:42,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Each of the other schools have at least one preschool.

514
00:35:42,784 --> 00:35:44,225
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're right, there's a cost to it.

515
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:47,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to have universal preschool.

516
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would, if we can get the children as early as we can, it would be a great thing to do.

517
00:35:51,873 --> 00:35:53,154
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm on board.

518
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:56,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a sense of what the cost of that kind of program would be in the community?

519
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:57,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not.

520
00:35:57,057 --> 00:35:58,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I could look into that for you.

521
00:35:58,598 --> 00:35:58,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

522
00:35:58,898 --> 00:36:05,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we ask that as a report from the superintendent that we could ask to see how much a universal 3K program would cost Medford?

523
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:08,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's a cost associated, but it'd be interesting to at least know the figures.

524
00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:10,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

525
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:11,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

526
00:36:12,808 --> 00:36:13,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

527
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:14,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

528
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:20,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Diane, we were talking recently about after school and before school programming.

529
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:27,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Were there a lot of new enrollees with this kindergarten open houses for those programs?

530
00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:30,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we going to be able to accommodate all of our students?

531
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:33,806
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, the answer to the question is yes.

532
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:38,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of our new kindergarten parents want before and after school.

533
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:45,072
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are trying to increase our Columbus after school program, because that's growing in leaps and bounds.

534
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:47,514
[SPEAKER_11]: The Brooks is always a large program.

535
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:50,816
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you know, the staffing is always an issue.

536
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:56,439
[SPEAKER_11]: The before school program runs pretty smoothly, and that's mostly because it's an hour before school begins.

537
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,560
[SPEAKER_11]: But our staffing does change.

538
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this year I have a teacher at the Brooks School that won't be able to do it next year.

539
00:37:03,062 --> 00:37:07,505
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're always searching for the right people to work with the kids and make sure they get breakfast.

540
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:11,040
[SPEAKER_11]: But the after school is going to be our charge.

541
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

542
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:23,166
[SPEAKER_16]: We did get an email from a prospective new parent for next year, and they were concerned especially about the capability of after school care.

543
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:28,228
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are going to assure that all new students that enroll are probably going to have a spot?

544
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:30,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I cannot say all students yet.

545
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to be able to tell you that, but I can't do that yet.

546
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:36,312
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to make sure that staffing is in place.

547
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:37,896
[SPEAKER_11]: before we enroll all.

548
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:41,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say two of the four schools are consistent.

549
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:46,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Our staffing is consistent at the McGlynn and at the Roberts in terms of the after school program.

550
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:53,243
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have to look at the Columbus Elementary School because that's grown in leaps and bounds for after school, not so much before school.

551
00:37:53,863 --> 00:37:58,645
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Brooks, we've always had a large number of children who want to come in.

552
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:03,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, I think we only have a few on the waiting list for the Brooks School, but we just need to get the staffing in place.

553
00:38:04,942 --> 00:38:08,985
[SPEAKER_16]: And when would we know and be able to tell parents?

554
00:38:09,065 --> 00:38:19,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm sure if they don't qualify for an after school program, they need as much notice as possible to have a safe place for their children.

555
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:20,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

556
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:26,816
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, Shelly Gross is in charge of the after school program, and she is retiring this year.

557
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:34,641
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're in the process of looking at a possible coordinator for before and after school, putting it under one umbrella.

558
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:43,102
[SPEAKER_11]: And once we get that in place, we're hoping that parents would know, at least in July, whether they're in the program or not, so that they can make other arrangements if they have to.

559
00:38:43,502 --> 00:38:43,582
OK.

560
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:44,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

561
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:44,923
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

562
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:45,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

563
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

564
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:49,506
[SPEAKER_17]: So moved.

565
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:50,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

566
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:51,747
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

567
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:51,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

568
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:53,108
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

569
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:53,908
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion passes.

570
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:55,749
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

571
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Report on Columbus Afterschool Math Tutoring Program.

572
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:00,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello again.

573
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:17,500
[SPEAKER_11]: So I provided each of you with an updated document because, unfortunately, when copies were being made, I didn't get the back pages, so I wanted to give you the new and improved version of the after-school program.

574
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:28,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Kathleen Kay is with us this evening in case you have any questions, but she consulted with her staff and administrators

575
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:35,365
[SPEAKER_11]: who worked on Tuesdays and Thursdays from January 30th until May.

576
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:43,928
[SPEAKER_11]: She's talked about the strengths and some of the concerns we had and maybe some recommendations for next year if we continue to have this program.

577
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:56,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to take a moment to thank the teachers and administrators, specifically Dr. Kaye and Nancy Sherman-Hudson for working so hard to make this program a success and implementing the pilot program.

578
00:39:57,453 --> 00:40:00,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Many thanks to our National Honor Society students.

579
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:06,197
[SPEAKER_11]: They were volunteering to work with the children, specifically Erin Diskin.

580
00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:11,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Erin Diskin is actually the daughter of one of our secretaries at the Columbus Elementary School.

581
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:18,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And she came to me one day with this proposal about wanting to help the kids at the Columbus Elementary School.

582
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:20,843
[SPEAKER_11]: She had a lot of things in place.

583
00:40:21,263 --> 00:40:22,343
[SPEAKER_11]: She wanted to do snacks.

584
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:26,525
[SPEAKER_11]: She wanted to make sure that she understood the behavior mechanisms and what

585
00:40:26,952 --> 00:40:29,034
[SPEAKER_11]: teachers were going to be doing to work with their kids.

586
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:33,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And she promised me other National Honor students to help out as well.

587
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:46,527
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to thank Erin for her work, and her brother Danny who also helped us out, Jenna Agnone, Sophia DeMayo, Hannah Chan, and Michaela Rothermel.

588
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:51,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like to thank the teachers who went out of their way to work with us, Ms.

589
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:53,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Rebecca Cogbill, Ms.

590
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:54,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Karina Merg, Ms.

591
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:55,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Victoria Cavallo,

592
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:56,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

593
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Noelle Lattarella, Ms.

594
00:40:58,195 --> 00:40:59,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Patty Donley, and Ms.

595
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:04,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Lisa DiPersio, the teachers of those grade levels at the Columbus Elementary School.

596
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,338
[SPEAKER_11]: And I need to acknowledge Ms.

597
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:13,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Christine Patterson and Tatiana Hall for helping us arrange the transportation for these children.

598
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:24,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you look at the next page in your packet, it tells you a little bit about what Dr. Kathy Kay put together

599
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:25,959
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of reading.

600
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:29,502
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do that on your own, but I just came up with some highlights for you.

601
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:37,008
[SPEAKER_11]: What I gathered from this math tutoring program is that many students participated in the program.

602
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:42,693
[SPEAKER_11]: The extended day and bus was just such a plus for the kiddos.

603
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are the highlights.

604
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,495
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the good things about the program.

605
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:50,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Teachers and high school honor class students stepped up when they needed to.

606
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:54,296
[SPEAKER_11]: And the timing of the program was great, too.

607
00:41:54,316 --> 00:42:03,838
[SPEAKER_11]: It was only 45 minutes, and that was just enough time for the kiddos to finish school, have a snack in the cafeteria, and then the teachers came and brought them up to the classrooms.

608
00:42:04,598 --> 00:42:09,719
[SPEAKER_11]: But we do have some concerns moving forward about maybe some ways we might be able to change things for the program.

609
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,741
[SPEAKER_11]: One, Dr. K thought we might want to break this up into two sessions.

610
00:42:14,821 --> 00:42:16,041
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's here tonight.

611
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:19,802
[SPEAKER_11]: We can go into more information on that if you would like.

612
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:35,328
[SPEAKER_11]: We also want to work with more targeted groups, so instead of opening it up to every single child to participate in, choose the students who actually need the most amount of help, because those are the kiddos that we need to work with the most.

613
00:42:36,529 --> 00:42:40,392
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to look at our data and our analysis through our teachers.

614
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:44,975
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the other things that I gathered from the report from Dr. Kay,

615
00:42:45,594 --> 00:42:49,135
[SPEAKER_11]: was that we need to be consistent in the way we manage the program.

616
00:42:49,195 --> 00:42:53,096
[SPEAKER_11]: So some teachers were working on Tuesdays but not on Thursdays.

617
00:42:53,676 --> 00:43:01,118
[SPEAKER_11]: We feel that it's a better fit for the children if we have the teachers who are going to work Tuesdays and Thursdays for consistency.

618
00:43:01,698 --> 00:43:06,860
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd like to invite Dr. Kay up to the podium to see if she'd like to add anything or if you have any questions.

619
00:43:08,658 --> 00:43:09,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

620
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mrs. Caldwell did a great synopsis of the program and how it ran this year.

621
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:19,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think the biggest pitfall was that we didn't open it up to everybody.

622
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:31,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the children who were there, really math was a strength for them, and so it was good they were getting more math, but some of the classes had 20 kids in them, and it was almost like doing another math class.

623
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:39,322
[SPEAKER_05]: because what we wanted to do was make it a tutoring program so that maybe there were six to eight kids tops in a group.

624
00:43:39,762 --> 00:43:45,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And so perhaps we could still afford to have more children involved if we had two sessions.

625
00:43:45,786 --> 00:43:51,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we took half the kids for the first eight or six weeks and then the other half for another eight or six weeks.

626
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So the kids can get a little bit more targeted instruction.

627
00:43:55,192 --> 00:43:57,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the teachers really wanted to look at our data.

628
00:43:58,014 --> 00:44:00,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the kids who didn't do well on MCAS last year,

629
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:08,692
[SPEAKER_05]: we didn't want to just focus on, we wanted to help those kids who look like they would have the chance to move into the next category.

630
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:15,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those children were doing well in math class on the day to day, so maybe those just aren't good test takers.

631
00:44:15,673 --> 00:44:21,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe what we need to do is have a little bit more of tutoring that focuses on that need to make the kids, because now it's online,

632
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:29,004
[SPEAKER_05]: to be more proficient at using the computer and answering questions in that mode.

633
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:38,670
[SPEAKER_05]: The other piece was that some of the kids were not doing well in math class, but they did okay on the MCAS, and those kids might have fallen through the cracks.

634
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:45,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we wanted to do is really kind of hone it in a little bit more, make it a little bit more concentrated, and I guess, if you will, make it more of a

635
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,741
[SPEAKER_05]: a suggested program.

636
00:44:47,781 --> 00:44:49,301
[SPEAKER_05]: We suggest that you come.

637
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:51,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Some teachers did write that on some of the forms.

638
00:44:51,262 --> 00:45:02,208
[SPEAKER_05]: We really would like Johnny to be involved this year, but if it was a little bit more of, I don't want to say invite, but a more tailored program to fit the kids' needs so that the teachers could really work in a small group.

639
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:09,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Mrs. Sherman-Hudson and I worked with a group, I took Tuesdays and she worked Thursdays, and it was a large group.

640
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:13,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes there were some behavioral issues because it was so large and you're sitting here trying to help

641
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:18,358
[SPEAKER_05]: one group of children, where the others are kind of like, ah, they don't really need to be there, because they were good at math.

642
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:21,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would, I think, be the biggest thing.

643
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:31,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the teachers, if they would be more apt to sign up for it, too, if there's a beginning date and an end date, so two sessions, I'll do six weeks, and then you do the other six from the outset.

644
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:32,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

645
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:33,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

646
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:36,882
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really glad that we were able to offer this.

647
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:41,703
[SPEAKER_16]: This came about because of MCAF scores, and was there any,

648
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,943
[SPEAKER_16]: growth, any way to show growth from the beginning of the program for the students to the end of the program?

649
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:53,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the teachers all gave a pre-test and a post-test at the beginning and the end.

650
00:45:53,826 --> 00:45:58,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the children did better, some of them did not, some of them stayed the same.

651
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:07,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So the average, when you take the average of the students' scores, they all did better, but that's relative to where they started at for some of the grades.

652
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the third grade group was really, really large.

653
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:17,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So when Mrs. Sherman-Hudson and I weren't teaching a class because we had someone who had to leave the position, we would go up and support in that classroom.

654
00:46:18,595 --> 00:46:25,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And the teachers did a lot of great center-type activities or learning games, which would just be much more effective if the group wasn't quite so large.

655
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:33,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like I said, there were children who did improve, you know, not to the degrees that we would have hoped if it was a little bit more concentrated.

656
00:46:33,663 --> 00:46:46,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, when I saw the amount of absences, maybe some regulations within the program, like if you're absent more than, if it's a six-week program, if you're absent more than three times, we're gonna give you a spot to the next person on the wait list.

657
00:46:47,448 --> 00:47:00,453
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe have a contract for people rather than inconsistency, because the real, we wanna put people that have the opportunity to grow in those spots, and we don't wanna.

658
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:02,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I think part of it, that may be the reason, because some kids,

659
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:14,324
[SPEAKER_05]: were invited and their parents signed them up, and then, oh, I don't wanna go, and you know, but I think if we told the parents it was really important, then they needed to be here, we were suggesting they were there, that we might have a better success rate there.

660
00:47:15,545 --> 00:47:17,286
[SPEAKER_16]: I have two more questions.

661
00:47:17,586 --> 00:47:32,333
[SPEAKER_16]: One is what was the cost involved, so that way we could plan for next year, because I do think that this may be necessary, depending on MCAT scores, and we'll know that in October, or maybe a little sooner when the superintendents

662
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:33,602
[SPEAKER_16]: get that data.

663
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:38,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So the cost is the cost of a bus every Tuesday and Thursday, and I think Ms.

664
00:47:38,703 --> 00:47:40,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Patterson probably knows the answer to that.

665
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:46,185
[SPEAKER_16]: The cost of the teachers, is that right?

666
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:52,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Could we get a report of a breakdown of that through the mayor to the superintendent?

667
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:59,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Could we get a report of the cost involved so that way we can make it a priority during our budget season?

668
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:01,868
[SPEAKER_16]: And then like, you know, or if math,

669
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:09,085
[SPEAKER_16]: coaches or during the day type situation might be more affordable.

670
00:48:09,505 --> 00:48:20,992
[SPEAKER_16]: But I like the idea of having a later time at different schools for kids to go home and they can take advantage of other programming, not just this programming at the school.

671
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:25,474
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a great advantage for students that have no other way home.

672
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And the bus did really work well.

673
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:30,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised, though.

674
00:48:30,257 --> 00:48:32,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought more students would take the bus than did.

675
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,281
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a number of children who got picked up still.

676
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:42,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was encouraging, too, because sometimes we always think they wouldn't stay after if there wasn't a bus available.

677
00:48:43,605 --> 00:48:44,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was nice to see.

678
00:48:44,325 --> 00:48:56,052
[SPEAKER_16]: So we should know how much the bus was utilized, and if it's necessary, or a smaller bus, or any ways that we could save money and still provide the programming and not be wasteful.

679
00:48:57,205 --> 00:49:00,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So my last question is really not to both of you.

680
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:08,635
[SPEAKER_16]: The need of this came out because of last year's, especially former fifth graders, scores on MCAS.

681
00:49:09,096 --> 00:49:14,921
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to know how we're continuing to follow those students in the sixth grade.

682
00:49:15,081 --> 00:49:19,425
[SPEAKER_16]: And if anybody is checking in, I know we've asked before and reports were given to us.

683
00:49:19,785 --> 00:49:21,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Now that we're getting closer to the end of the year,

684
00:49:22,143 --> 00:49:29,389
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we should have an update on those students and make sure that they received everything they needed for this current MCAS that they just took.

685
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:41,398
[SPEAKER_16]: And we want a report on how those specific students did as soon as we get the release of their MCAS scores to make sure those students don't fall through any cracks.

686
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:41,959
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

687
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:43,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you referring to the current fifth grade students?

688
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:44,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Current sixth grade.

689
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:46,182
[SPEAKER_11]: No, current sixth grade.

690
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:49,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I did provide a report earlier for the current sixth graders.

691
00:49:50,623 --> 00:49:59,431
[SPEAKER_11]: spoke at the time it was to Mr. Edwards and to Mr. DeLava that provided me with the information on how the students were doing and they were making steady progress.

692
00:49:59,451 --> 00:50:02,233
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was happy to notice that.

693
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:06,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just asking for a follow-up now that they've completed their MCAS.

694
00:50:07,017 --> 00:50:12,842
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see the growth from their fifth grade to the sixth grade MCAS scores and make sure that every student that

695
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:22,677
[SPEAKER_16]: might not have done well last year is moving and showing growth, and if not, they get the services they need in any way, shape, or form that we don't.

696
00:50:22,697 --> 00:50:23,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Next fall.

697
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:23,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

698
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:24,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Next fall, we'll get an update.

699
00:50:25,098 --> 00:50:25,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

700
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:29,981
[SPEAKER_16]: So if that could be added to the reports request list for October.

701
00:50:31,122 --> 00:50:35,544
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to make sure we don't drop a link.

702
00:50:35,644 --> 00:50:36,265
[SPEAKER_17]: That we track.

703
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:36,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

704
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:37,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Track progress.

705
00:50:38,306 --> 00:50:38,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

706
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:39,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

707
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:41,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you so much for this report.

708
00:50:42,277 --> 00:50:46,641
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, I'm just educational and a huge fan of after-school tutoring programs.

709
00:50:47,482 --> 00:50:56,230
[SPEAKER_10]: I know for my own students, I feel like, you know, during class, I could just sort of run them in circles sometimes, but when I was one-on-one with them, that's when the learning really happened.

710
00:50:57,331 --> 00:51:04,478
[SPEAKER_10]: But to that point, I noticed, you know, in your report, as you mentioned, you know, the ratio of students to teachers, probably not ideal.

711
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:10,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think that if we added two more teachers to the program, that would have really solved the problem?

712
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:13,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you think, how many teachers would you want it ideally?

713
00:51:14,643 --> 00:51:18,527
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I just want to, it's not easy to get the teachers to do this, first of all.

714
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:25,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Teachers have worked a long day, and now we're asking them to do planning, organizing for another 45 minutes to an hour.

715
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:29,760
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be one of the issues that we would have to come up with.

716
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:37,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I still think that we just need smaller groups, that that would really give us a targeted assistance we need to do with the kiddos.

717
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:37,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

718
00:51:37,985 --> 00:51:38,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Please let me know.

719
00:51:39,126 --> 00:51:44,489
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if you ever need help in that way, I'm always happy to find one or two days a week to help you out.

720
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's good.

721
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I need the teaching hours for my license anyway to keep it good.

722
00:51:49,838 --> 00:52:00,148
[SPEAKER_10]: My second point is, can you just give me a sense of what percentage, I know maybe you don't have the numbers handy right now, but of the 68 students that participated in the program, how many used the bus?

723
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:02,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Just ballpark.

724
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:05,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Ballpark, I would say probably one.

725
00:52:06,464 --> 00:52:06,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

726
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:11,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some days it seemed like there were a lot of kids, and some days it seemed like most.

727
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:17,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that... A lot of kids belonged to the after-school program as well, so they didn't need transportation.

728
00:52:17,615 --> 00:52:20,217
[SPEAKER_05]: They went straight up to the... Right, right.

729
00:52:24,025 --> 00:52:28,288
[SPEAKER_10]: The next question I have for you is, do you know why all these students were participating?

730
00:52:28,428 --> 00:52:30,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Has there been any conversation with the parents?

731
00:52:30,149 --> 00:52:33,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it just that their parents want them to have more math time?

732
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:35,132
[SPEAKER_10]: The students are hungry for more math time?

733
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:38,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it they saw their MCAS scores and it was like, let's just put out fires?

734
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:42,495
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that it was, everyone was invited.

735
00:52:42,515 --> 00:52:47,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're all invited to the party, and some parents were like, oh, this is a good thing, why don't you go, you know, two days a week.

736
00:52:47,836 --> 00:52:54,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, for some of them, when the invitation went out, teachers really wrote, I strongly recommend that so-and-so attend this class.

737
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:59,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it was really parental preference which kids were involved and which kids weren't.

738
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,900
[SPEAKER_05]: There were children that we specifically targeted to, you know, with that, and didn't sometimes.

739
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:16,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, in the future, I think that these type of, and I would like to sort of make this point to my colleagues as well, I think that for our school district to be one of the best in Massachusetts, this is the type of program we're gonna have to have district-wide.

740
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:19,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I've seen how effective they can be.

741
00:53:20,122 --> 00:53:21,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a really good point.

742
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:43,038
[SPEAKER_10]: a district-wide program if we can, and sort of use Columbus as a pilot, learn what we can from it.

743
00:53:43,198 --> 00:53:44,699
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you so much for all this hard work.

744
00:53:44,739 --> 00:53:46,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really very excited about moving forward.

745
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:53,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and thank you for making it available to us, too, because we wouldn't have this information if you didn't support it, so thank you.

746
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:59,106
[SPEAKER_10]: As Member DiVendetto mentioned, unfortunately, this program came about sort of in an emergency.

747
00:53:59,166 --> 00:53:59,927
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to do it.

748
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:04,990
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that now that the fire is out, there's a lot that we can learn moving forward.

749
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:05,750
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you so much.

750
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:07,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

751
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:07,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Vance, please.

752
00:54:08,337 --> 00:54:08,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

753
00:54:09,638 --> 00:54:11,618
[SPEAKER_03]: So, obviously, there's a lot we can learn.

754
00:54:12,558 --> 00:54:26,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Smaller groups, more targeted groups, particularly, you know, with the struggling students, and being able to have extra hands like the high school students is great, just so that you can do a little bit more one-on-one.

755
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:35,023
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I also would like to say, let's say that if this was a six-week opportunity twice a week,

756
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,117
[SPEAKER_03]: that we might also think about.

757
00:54:37,197 --> 00:54:52,277
[SPEAKER_03]: There are kids who excel, and it would be great to have maybe not as long, but if they're excited about math and they want it to come so badly, I mean, in an ideal world, if we can afford it, we should also have maybe a shorter, maybe a three-week, you know, session

758
00:54:52,687 --> 00:54:55,470
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, for the kids who excel so that we're bringing them up.

759
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:59,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'd really like to see both of those happen.

760
00:55:00,595 --> 00:55:07,242
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were doing it again next year, this year we did it starting, I think it was in February, was it?

761
00:55:07,282 --> 00:55:07,662
[SPEAKER_11]: January.

762
00:55:07,822 --> 00:55:08,283
[SPEAKER_03]: January.

763
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:09,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Very end of January.

764
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:09,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

765
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:14,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So would you do a session in the fall and then a session in the early winter?

766
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,931
[SPEAKER_03]: What would your optimum

767
00:55:17,024 --> 00:55:18,465
[SPEAKER_03]: timing be?

768
00:55:18,645 --> 00:55:25,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I think based on getting the MCAS scores back and having the time to analyze them earlier than January would probably be better, maybe November.

769
00:55:27,088 --> 00:55:29,589
[SPEAKER_05]: But weather is always a problem.

770
00:55:29,749 --> 00:55:37,091
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes weather's better in November than it is in... And then we could fit in more sessions that way if we start earlier in the year.

771
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:41,733
[SPEAKER_05]: To get those kids who may not be succeeding right away in their classwork early,

772
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:47,911
[SPEAKER_05]: to maybe boost them up so that they can go out of the program and other kids who are continuing to struggle can stay or join.

773
00:55:49,532 --> 00:55:49,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

774
00:55:49,872 --> 00:55:50,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

775
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:54,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think this really sort of lays the foundation for us.

776
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:55,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize that it is difficult to get

777
00:55:56,191 --> 00:56:03,978
[SPEAKER_03]: faculty members to want to stay and do this, and that we need to be creative and see how else we can get all hands on deck for the kids.

778
00:56:04,058 --> 00:56:06,941
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you very much, and thank your teachers who participated.

779
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:12,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very helpful that Mrs. Caldwell was able to get us the high school honor society students to help us, too.

780
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:16,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know those kids enjoyed it, and the children who worked with them enjoyed having them there.

781
00:56:17,135 --> 00:56:25,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if we had some of our brighter fifth grade students who wanted to help in the third grade, you know, that might be something we could look into too.

782
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:28,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if they had transportation to go home, parents might be more willing to let them stay.

783
00:56:31,697 --> 00:56:32,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

784
00:56:32,398 --> 00:56:32,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

785
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:33,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

786
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to thank you for the report.

787
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:35,558
[SPEAKER_01]: It was excellent.

788
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:42,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I really like the way that you prepared it with all the feedback and the different ideas for the future.

789
00:56:43,439 --> 00:56:46,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do like the idea of like the smaller focus groups

790
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:52,645
[SPEAKER_01]: and then sending out maybe a letter home to parents, detailing everything in the different time frames.

791
00:56:53,826 --> 00:57:03,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think at the high school, when they had a grant for the MCAS tutoring, they did something similar like that, where a letter went home to the families, and it was structured.

792
00:57:03,314 --> 00:57:04,835
[SPEAKER_01]: It had all the details in it.

793
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:09,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had to sign that your child would make that attendance.

794
00:57:09,579 --> 00:57:13,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that would help cut down, of course, the attendance the next time the programs rolled out.

795
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:28,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I also loved reading about all the positives where some of the students the next day were saying, you know, we did this in tutoring, and they were just more, they felt successful and more confident in the classroom.

796
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:29,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So I liked reading that.

797
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:37,356
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounded, you know, that makes me feel very happy for the students that they felt that now they can, you know, maybe accomplish a little bit more with math.

798
00:57:39,096 --> 00:57:42,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanna thank the National Honor Society students for all their help.

799
00:57:42,998 --> 00:57:44,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, that's unbelievable, and thank them.

800
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:46,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all.

801
00:57:46,834 --> 00:58:00,322
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one thing that kind of jumped out for me, having taught some of the kids, was, so the teachers use little teaching tips or clues that they come up with over time that may not be consistent across the grade levels.

802
00:58:00,362 --> 00:58:03,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that it's not part of the math program, it's still they're teaching the skills.

803
00:58:03,404 --> 00:58:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is when you divide, you know, a sentence that I taught was, does Mac sell cheeseburgers?

804
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:09,208
[SPEAKER_05]: For the steps of that you have to do.

805
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:18,061
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was using the sentence that I had heard Mrs. DiPersio use, who's a fifth grade teacher, but the fourth grade students were arguing with me that that wasn't the right sentence.

806
00:58:19,182 --> 00:58:29,168
[SPEAKER_05]: So what it took away to me was, I spoke to Lisa and I said, you know what, maybe the fourth grade, third grade, and fifth grade team could get together and share these little tips so that third grade can use whatever you want them.

807
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:34,232
[SPEAKER_05]: You agree together as a cross unit what you're going to do because the tips are very helpful.

808
00:58:34,863 --> 00:58:42,189
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I'm going to have kids arguing with me, that's not the right one, then it kind of loses its flavor, if you know what I mean.

809
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:49,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was just a nice takeaway for me to say that this is a good way for colleagues to talk across grade levels to make the education better.

810
00:58:50,255 --> 00:58:50,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

811
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:53,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the report.

812
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:59,963
[SPEAKER_09]: For children that had 504s and IEPs, were they fully integrated and supported in whatever they needed?

813
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:01,536
[SPEAKER_05]: They were in the groups, yes.

814
00:59:01,556 --> 00:59:02,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

815
00:59:02,396 --> 00:59:07,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I noticed there was some commentary about disruptive student, maybe just one or more, I don't know.

816
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:12,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to be sure the disruptive did not have anything to do with either of those.

817
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:13,081
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

818
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:14,902
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was just a behavioral type.

819
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:17,243
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, cool.

820
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:27,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And the issue of the PTO and the PTO would love to be able to use the bus.

821
00:59:29,215 --> 00:59:30,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you explain that?

822
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:32,337
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, what did they want and why isn't it?

823
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:34,298
[SPEAKER_05]: The PTO does after-school programs.

824
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:39,801
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it the Columbus Clubhouse, which we're trying to get used to the name because it gets confused with the after-school program.

825
00:59:40,622 --> 00:59:42,042
[SPEAKER_05]: So kids tell us about the after-school program.

826
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:42,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, well, which one?

827
00:59:42,903 --> 00:59:44,264
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know.

828
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:56,811
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the Columbus Clubhouse, there are activities, enrichment-type events, karate, Lego club, pottery, whatever they can get for volunteers or someone that's affordable to come in and teach the kids so that they can stay after school.

829
00:59:57,321 --> 01:00:02,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of those children really can't participate because they have no transportation at home.

830
01:00:02,284 --> 01:00:05,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would quite possibly mean that we'd need more buses.

831
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:14,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what happens is we have parents manning the Columbus Clubhouse, whereas we as a school are doing the math.

832
01:00:14,592 --> 01:00:23,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one more task now to put onto the school for after hours, and is it manageable, and is there enough room, and how much does it cost, and that kind of thing.

833
01:00:24,198 --> 01:00:26,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know that when I've talked about

834
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:38,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm never gonna get used to the clubhouse name, by the way, but for the afterschool enrichment activities, I mean, in my six years at the Columbus, you know, it's sort of a running joke that it's always the same kids.

835
01:00:38,816 --> 01:00:39,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's true.

836
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:41,037
[SPEAKER_09]: It tends to be.

837
01:00:41,177 --> 01:00:47,439
[SPEAKER_09]: There can be lots of reasons why other kids aren't participating, but it's pretty clear that one of those reasons certainly is transportation.

838
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:53,062
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, figuring, and if we were to reduce the number of students participating in this,

839
01:00:54,588 --> 01:01:01,173
[SPEAKER_09]: by invitation or whatever method happens, I want to make sure we don't end up paying for a bus where there's four kids on it.

840
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:14,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would just hate to be in a position where we have to decide to cut the bus and lose those four kids when we have another way to fill up the bus, even though it might be more complicated.

841
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:21,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think one of the things that might also be a part of the Columbus Clubhouse, it's not long enough.

842
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:22,728
[SPEAKER_05]: After school is longer.

843
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:28,212
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe some of those kids don't come to the after school enrichment clubs because the parents need a longer time.

844
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:29,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can't get them home.

845
01:01:30,393 --> 01:01:32,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they get them home, who's with them?

846
01:01:32,835 --> 01:01:34,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the after school program runs until 6.

847
01:01:35,356 --> 01:01:39,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go to the Y or the Boys and Girls Club, they run later.

848
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:44,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that might be why some of those kids aren't involved in the Columbus Clubhouse, just one factor.

849
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:48,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ms.

850
01:01:48,448 --> 01:02:05,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Caldwell, you also mentioned earlier the, I think you and I had discussed earlier about the sixth graders and trying to track them, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there was, we didn't see any correlation between the students that had low MCAS scores at the Columbus last year and their grades now.

851
01:02:06,628 --> 01:02:07,249
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

852
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:21,681
[SPEAKER_11]: When we looked at the data that we had and I checked with the principals and the teachers of the various middle schools, the two middle schools, there was no correlation between the low MCAS scores and how the kiddos were doing in school this year, which is great for us.

853
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:27,246
[SPEAKER_09]: It is great and also makes me just... Yes, I know it makes you... I've got to stamp the soapbox so we'll be here all night.

854
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:29,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to make sure that we're not...

855
01:02:30,773 --> 01:02:41,526
[SPEAKER_09]: the curriculum or the tutoring now or when it gets to be smaller groups, which obviously I agree would be much better, is not test prep?

856
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:42,827
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

857
01:02:43,248 --> 01:02:43,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

858
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:46,612
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they were definitely doing skills.

859
01:02:46,692 --> 01:02:47,252
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not...

860
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:52,651
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, we didn't even really go into the computer labs to do that part.

861
01:02:53,732 --> 01:03:00,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that I met with Mrs. O'Donohue, who gave me some, literally there were word problem-solvings that had lots of different ways to go about it.

862
01:03:00,856 --> 01:03:04,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had the kids use whiteboards, and they would work together as twos and all that sort of stuff.

863
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:06,260
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, it was definitely not a test.

864
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:12,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It was things they needed to be successful on the test, but it wasn't MCAS and Rockwell.

865
01:03:13,504 --> 01:03:13,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

866
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:28,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's really important that we design this program to touch both students that are struggling and students that are excelling.

867
01:03:28,992 --> 01:03:32,593
[SPEAKER_10]: What I found personally, there's a really great program called the AMC8s.

868
01:03:33,514 --> 01:03:35,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently I'm talking with Ms.

869
01:03:35,254 --> 01:03:38,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Carolyn Joy about this idea, maybe we could add this to the curriculum.

870
01:03:39,036 --> 01:03:45,318
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really wonderful because AMC, the American Math Competition, and they're designed for eighth graders.

871
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:53,021
[SPEAKER_10]: When I taught them to seventh and eighth graders, the problems themselves aren't just like, you know, where's the formula, chunk the formula, and you're done.

872
01:03:53,081 --> 01:03:54,502
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually involve a lot of creativity.

873
01:03:55,242 --> 01:03:59,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And they feel a lot more like undergraduate mathematics, as it should be.

874
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So the problems are very engaging to students.

875
01:04:01,485 --> 01:04:07,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes it could just be the type of thing where you print out a big packet of problems to students, hand them to them,

876
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:15,341
[SPEAKER_10]: help out the kids that are, you know, struggling a bit, and then check in with your students that are really accelerating.

877
01:04:15,882 --> 01:04:20,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, I mean, from my own educational experience, I really saw a huge impact.

878
01:04:20,544 --> 01:04:26,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, math can be, you know, it's taught and this isn't anyone's fault, obviously, but when you're teaching to a test,

879
01:04:27,048 --> 01:04:36,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Math can seem soulless, but the AMC 8s, you really feel the creativity and the beauty of mathematics, which is something we really should have.

880
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Students really should touch that as well.

881
01:04:39,521 --> 01:04:43,465
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just, while I understand the cost, and I certainly appreciate it,

882
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:56,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes, you know, kids that are accelerating really can kind of cruise a little bit, while teachers help the ones that are struggling, give some challenging, more advanced problems to those students, so they can get a taste of what math really feels like.

883
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, it's a beautiful subject.

884
01:04:59,977 --> 01:05:04,642
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope we can design this program, and I hope we can pilot this program for the whole district.

885
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,441
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be great, thank you.

886
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:07,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

887
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:19,450
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion to accept this report as amended with the answers to follow on the cost of the program and for next fall to track the progress of the students from last year, MCAS.

888
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,013
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion, all those in favor?

889
01:05:23,473 --> 01:05:23,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

890
01:05:23,974 --> 01:05:24,754
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

891
01:05:25,115 --> 01:05:26,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes, thank you.

892
01:05:30,439 --> 01:05:32,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Report on seal of biliteracy.

893
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:34,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Carlo.

894
01:05:41,693 --> 01:05:42,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening again.

895
01:05:44,655 --> 01:05:48,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So on my pre-budget report, I put as one of my goals.

896
01:05:48,418 --> 01:05:48,998
[SPEAKER_17]: Biliteracy first.

897
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:50,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Biliteracy?

898
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:50,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

899
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:51,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am doing that.

900
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:58,865
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the pre-budget report, I did put list as one of the goals for next year to implement this seal of biliteracy.

901
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:00,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is this seal?

902
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:05,189
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a seal that's made by the State Department of Education.

903
01:06:06,183 --> 01:06:17,147
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's given by districts to students who have achieved a certain proficiency in English and another foreign language, at least another foreign language.

904
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,688
[SPEAKER_06]: This started in California.

905
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:30,072
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2008, a group of parents, students, teachers got together and they thought that students should be recognized if they have these skills.

906
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:31,212
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2012, they awarded the first

907
01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:38,025
[SPEAKER_06]: seals in California, and then other states followed.

908
01:06:38,565 --> 01:07:00,202
[SPEAKER_06]: In Massachusetts, it was just passed this past November, November 22, 2017, and DESE had on their website, well, they created the regulations and it was open for public comment, and up until two days ago, so they just

909
01:07:00,705 --> 01:07:06,609
[SPEAKER_06]: put in everything together now, and the seal should be ready for September.

910
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:22,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure how it's going to be, if it's a seal that's stuck on there, or we got an email today saying that it's going to be sent to the district electronically, so I'm not sure how that's going to work.

911
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:29,283
[SPEAKER_06]: But we piloted sort of the seal of biliteracy a little bit this year, and actually,

912
01:07:29,753 --> 01:07:29,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

913
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:39,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Vilma Bibo, who's here with me tonight, she did her practicum for supervisor director with me this year, and she took on this project.

914
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:40,900
[SPEAKER_06]: She did a lot of research.

915
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:52,507
[SPEAKER_06]: She joined the group, the Massachusetts group, did monthly webinars and so on, researched the tests, and we picked a test called APPL, it's A-A-P-P-L,

916
01:07:53,263 --> 01:08:08,616
[SPEAKER_06]: that tests proficiency in a language, and we gave it to about 20 students this year in the languages of Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, and Arabic.

917
01:08:10,618 --> 01:08:20,547
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably not gonna get the results on time for graduation, but we will mail certificates to the students who pass the test, pass the regulations.

918
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:24,577
[SPEAKER_06]: for this year.

919
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:27,218
[SPEAKER_06]: This year was just a pilot, so it'll just be a certificate.

920
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:29,920
[SPEAKER_06]: For next year, it'll be the actual seal, the state seal.

921
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Fabulous.

922
01:08:32,881 --> 01:08:33,001
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

923
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:34,281
[SPEAKER_17]: van der Kloot.

924
01:08:35,182 --> 01:08:35,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the idea.

925
01:08:36,002 --> 01:08:39,284
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of questions in terms of practicality.

926
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:46,066
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the Italian exams that you take where the kids just like- The national exams.

927
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:46,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

928
01:08:46,307 --> 01:08:47,727
[SPEAKER_03]: We do it in all three languages.

929
01:08:47,747 --> 01:08:49,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Would a certain score indicate

930
01:08:50,307 --> 01:08:51,809
[SPEAKER_06]: No, those scores are not valid.

931
01:08:51,889 --> 01:08:56,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be a specific test that's nationally approved, yes.

932
01:08:57,474 --> 01:09:00,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so how much does the AAPPL?

933
01:09:00,818 --> 01:09:11,068
[SPEAKER_06]: That's $20, but there is a stamp test that's just a little bit less, maybe $18 per student, and it should be available to all students.

934
01:09:12,637 --> 01:09:14,018
[SPEAKER_06]: who want to take the test.

935
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:18,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And students take it as in their, win of their senior year.

936
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:19,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Senior year.

937
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:24,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be for senior, but it would be right around January, February maybe.

938
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:26,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So that they can get it in time.

939
01:09:26,102 --> 01:09:29,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So that they can get it for the graduation, on time of graduation.

940
01:09:29,383 --> 01:09:39,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't get it, I mean, it would be even more helpful to our students to get some indication of the proficiency level when they're applying to colleges or.

941
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:40,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

942
01:09:41,193 --> 01:09:43,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't really come then.

943
01:09:43,094 --> 01:09:45,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really given at graduation.

944
01:09:47,356 --> 01:09:48,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see what you're saying.

945
01:09:49,837 --> 01:09:50,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

946
01:09:50,097 --> 01:09:52,459
[SPEAKER_06]: They usually apply to colleges in the fall.

947
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:52,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

948
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:54,760
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really given at graduation.

949
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:55,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

950
01:09:56,681 --> 01:10:09,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for me, if it would inspire kids to do well in language, and for certain some kids it will, because they would like to get it.

951
01:10:10,426 --> 01:10:11,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a relatively small cost.

952
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,328
[SPEAKER_03]: How many kids do you anticipate would take it?

953
01:10:14,348 --> 01:10:15,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you were 20.

954
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:16,510
[SPEAKER_06]: This year.

955
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:17,070
[SPEAKER_06]: This year.

956
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:29,939
[SPEAKER_06]: We opened it up to a small group of seniors, including ELL students, and we got about 20 that wanted to do it.

957
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:32,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we might have 40 or 60?

958
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,842
[SPEAKER_06]: For next year?

959
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:34,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

960
01:10:34,302 --> 01:10:35,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably more.

961
01:10:35,043 --> 01:10:37,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping about 60, 75.

962
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:43,074
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have to be a senior to take it?

963
01:10:43,094 --> 01:10:44,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Could you take it as a junior?

964
01:10:44,174 --> 01:10:45,675
[SPEAKER_06]: You could take it, right.

965
01:10:45,755 --> 01:10:46,616
[SPEAKER_06]: You could take it.

966
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:50,398
[SPEAKER_06]: They have what's called the path to biliteracy.

967
01:10:50,878 --> 01:10:55,901
[SPEAKER_06]: You would take it junior year, but that doesn't really guarantee you the seal.

968
01:10:55,961 --> 01:11:00,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to show that you continue through senior year with your language and proficiency.

969
01:11:00,884 --> 01:11:01,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

970
01:11:02,145 --> 01:11:02,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

971
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:03,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

972
01:11:04,186 --> 01:11:05,867
[SPEAKER_16]: So, so you're proposing,

973
01:11:06,788 --> 01:11:09,950
[SPEAKER_16]: that students pay the $18 or $20 per thing?

974
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:11,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Because students already pay.

975
01:11:11,251 --> 01:11:18,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, this year we did it, but I put a line item on my pre-budget report for next year.

976
01:11:18,476 --> 01:11:20,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so a few questions.

977
01:11:21,117 --> 01:11:24,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one, students can pay for it, and it's either $18 or $20 per test.

978
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:29,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Students are already paying for their AP exams, which are what, at least 63 last time I knew.

979
01:11:29,883 --> 01:11:30,703
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they're more like 95.

980
01:11:31,904 --> 01:11:34,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so that's over $100

981
01:11:35,818 --> 01:11:40,501
[SPEAKER_16]: for just their language, not counting any other AP that they might be taking.

982
01:11:41,121 --> 01:11:46,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, the $2,000 that's allocated in your budget report, is that the cost of the seal?

983
01:11:46,784 --> 01:11:47,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that-

984
01:11:48,731 --> 01:11:49,312
[SPEAKER_06]: for the test.

985
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:52,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there is any cost for the seal, if they send it electronically.

986
01:11:52,895 --> 01:11:53,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

987
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:55,997
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there is a cost, is it annually?

988
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:59,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It would probably be $2, maybe a couple of dollars per student.

989
01:11:59,421 --> 01:11:59,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Per student?

990
01:12:00,261 --> 01:12:01,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say per student, right?

991
01:12:01,582 --> 01:12:02,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something you heard?

992
01:12:02,343 --> 01:12:03,764
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have those answers yet.

993
01:12:04,005 --> 01:12:07,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a minute, is that something you heard, or is that?

994
01:12:07,628 --> 01:12:14,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, that's something that we're thinking, but there's nothing official on that yet, because this was just passed.

995
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:22,057
[SPEAKER_16]: can we wait till we get more information from DESC about the cost involved and what's involved?

996
01:12:23,098 --> 01:12:25,580
[SPEAKER_17]: The budget won't be for another few weeks.

997
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:31,805
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just the pre-budget report, so it could be amended based upon the information.

998
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:40,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate Mrs. DeCarlo for bringing us this information.

999
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:42,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's a really interesting initiative, so thank you.

1000
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:46,395
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's exciting, yes.

1001
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:53,600
[SPEAKER_18]: You had just read the six languages, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic.

1002
01:12:54,122 --> 01:12:56,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there any other language that is taught at the high school?

1003
01:12:57,344 --> 01:12:58,945
[SPEAKER_06]: These aren't languages taught.

1004
01:12:59,326 --> 01:13:03,388
[SPEAKER_06]: We only teach French, Italian, and Spanish.

1005
01:13:03,889 --> 01:13:06,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are students that know these languages.

1006
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:08,211
[SPEAKER_06]: They speak it at home.

1007
01:13:08,772 --> 01:13:10,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And know Latin at the high school?

1008
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,213
[SPEAKER_06]: They could be ELL students.

1009
01:13:11,714 --> 01:13:14,276
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a test for Latin, yes, also.

1010
01:13:14,316 --> 01:13:15,736
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't have it at the high school.

1011
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:17,017
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't teach Latin at high school?

1012
01:13:17,237 --> 01:13:17,278
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1013
01:13:17,298 --> 01:13:17,358
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1014
01:13:17,378 --> 01:13:17,578
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1015
01:13:18,799 --> 01:13:20,900
[SPEAKER_18]: So what are the three languages, again, that are taught at the high school?

1016
01:13:21,535 --> 01:13:23,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Spanish, Italian, and French.

1017
01:13:23,396 --> 01:13:24,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

1018
01:13:24,257 --> 01:13:25,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

1019
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:29,820
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1020
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:31,581
[SPEAKER_17]: So moved.

1021
01:13:33,203 --> 01:13:34,924
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion, all those in favor?

1022
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:35,744
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1023
01:13:35,764 --> 01:13:36,525
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1024
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:37,325
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1025
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:38,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you on that.

1026
01:13:38,966 --> 01:13:41,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Now we will be moving on to your pre-budget report.

1027
01:13:41,428 --> 01:13:42,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now we go to that.

1028
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll be brief.

1029
01:13:47,183 --> 01:13:53,820
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the full report with you, and I'll just outline a few things, and then if you have any questions.

1030
01:13:55,921 --> 01:14:04,466
[SPEAKER_06]: The program that we have, foreign language study, or the introduction to foreign language, starts in second grade with Italian.

1031
01:14:04,526 --> 01:14:11,850
[SPEAKER_06]: They have classes once a week, 45 minutes classes, and they go through fifth grade with that.

1032
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's supported by a grant from CASIT.

1033
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:20,615
[SPEAKER_06]: In the middle school, students can choose between Spanish or Italian.

1034
01:14:21,318 --> 01:14:23,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the high school, we also have French.

1035
01:14:24,099 --> 01:14:26,141
[SPEAKER_06]: They can choose French, Italian, or Spanish.

1036
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:34,125
[SPEAKER_06]: At the high school, we have courses that go from the very beginning, so year one, level one, all the way up to AP.

1037
01:14:37,326 --> 01:14:49,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Number of teachers that we have, we have four foreign language teachers at the middle school, two at each middle school, and one additional one that travels between the two middle schools.

1038
01:14:50,397 --> 01:14:53,058
[SPEAKER_06]: and we have 10 teachers at the high school.

1039
01:14:55,039 --> 01:15:02,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Funding from this year, 17-18 school year, all funds were used as allocated in the budget.

1040
01:15:04,443 --> 01:15:06,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Some highlights for this past year.

1041
01:15:09,826 --> 01:15:10,766
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some trips.

1042
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:15,348
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an overnight trip with the Italian AP students.

1043
01:15:16,003 --> 01:15:22,767
[SPEAKER_06]: They went to Carnegie Hall to see a concert by an Italian composer they had studied in class.

1044
01:15:24,188 --> 01:15:28,711
[SPEAKER_06]: During the February vacation, we had a group of students go to Spain.

1045
01:15:28,731 --> 01:15:30,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very successful trip.

1046
01:15:30,832 --> 01:15:36,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And then during April vacation, a group of students went to Montreal and Quebec City.

1047
01:15:38,157 --> 01:15:42,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the contests and awards for this year in our department

1048
01:15:43,466 --> 01:15:48,387
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an AP Italian student win $1,000 scholarship in the fall.

1049
01:15:49,348 --> 01:15:57,470
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a French student who earned second prize and won $200 at the French Oratory Contest.

1050
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:04,072
[SPEAKER_06]: A group of Italian students won second prize in a contest at Northeastern University.

1051
01:16:05,848 --> 01:16:12,973
[SPEAKER_06]: A fourth grade class at the Roberts and four Italian students at the high school won the Cassett contest.

1052
01:16:13,233 --> 01:16:17,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And these awards were given yesterday at a function they had.

1053
01:16:17,856 --> 01:16:18,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I attended.

1054
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:19,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very nice.

1055
01:16:19,437 --> 01:16:24,100
[SPEAKER_06]: The families came, the students came, also from surrounding cities.

1056
01:16:24,901 --> 01:16:29,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it wasn't included in the report because we found out after.

1057
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:41,216
[SPEAKER_06]: two students from the Andrews Middle School won a contest, a poster contest given by the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese.

1058
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:43,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So our students are doing well.

1059
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:55,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the events that we had, we had Italian students attending a night at the opera in Boston in the fall, AP students of

[SPEAKER_06]: And the foreign language club sponsored It Takes Two to Ultimate Tango.

1062
01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:10,943
[SPEAKER_06]: They brought some Hispanic culture to students at the high school.

1063
01:17:10,963 --> 01:17:11,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very nice.

1064
01:17:13,704 --> 01:17:18,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Professional development for teachers, we get professional development at every department meeting we have.

1065
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:25,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Some teachers attended the MAFLA conference, which is the Massachusetts Foreign Language Association.

1066
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,809
[SPEAKER_06]: conference, which is given on a weekend.

1067
01:17:29,849 --> 01:17:33,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it starts on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and even goes into Sunday.

1068
01:17:35,191 --> 01:17:40,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was some Saturday workshops that teachers took advantage of.

1069
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:48,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Exams that we administer are the national exams, and we had about 360 students this year taking these tests.

1070
01:17:49,476 --> 01:17:51,616
[SPEAKER_06]: AP exams, that's been going up.

1071
01:17:51,877 --> 01:17:56,018
[SPEAKER_06]: We had 36 students this year taking AP exams, and then we

1072
01:17:56,565 --> 01:18:00,467
[SPEAKER_06]: administered that Apple exam to about 20 students.

1073
01:18:01,527 --> 01:18:06,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Requests for budget for 2018-2019 is gonna be level funded.

1074

1075
01:18:13,032 --> 01:18:18,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Number of current staff, we have 15 foreign language teachers and no additional staff is needed.

1076
01:18:19,275 --> 01:18:25,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Goals and objectives for next year, as you know, I am retiring as of June 30th,

1077
01:18:26,694 --> 01:18:41,485
[SPEAKER_06]: but I hope that my successor will continue with the proficiency journey and continue to update and refine the curriculum because that's a continual thing to do and implement the seal of bite literacy.

1078
01:18:42,283 --> 01:18:43,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Carlo.

1079
01:18:43,424 --> 01:18:43,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1080
01:18:43,744 --> 01:18:44,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero?

1081
01:18:45,145 --> 01:18:46,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I had a question.

1082
01:18:46,607 --> 01:18:47,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1083
01:18:47,327 --> 01:18:53,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know if there's interest in the student body in other languages, other than the Romance languages?

1084
01:18:53,712 --> 01:18:59,798
[SPEAKER_06]: It seemed almost two years ago that I took a survey with the students, all the students in Medford High.

1085
01:19:00,398 --> 01:19:09,866
[SPEAKER_06]: If they were given the chance of taking any language they wanted, list them in the order that they wanted, and Spanish came number one.

1086
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:16,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Italian was number two, French was number three, so those are the three languages that we offer.

1087
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:21,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Portuguese was four, and then there were other languages.

1088
01:19:21,872 --> 01:19:27,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Chinese was there, but it was lower in the choices.

1089
01:19:27,653 --> 01:19:31,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I did send the report to some of you, right, some of the members.

1090
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:32,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1091
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:33,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's interesting.

1092
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:35,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, that was my question.

1093
01:19:35,674 --> 01:19:35,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1094
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:36,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Postone.

1095
01:19:36,974 --> 01:19:39,315
[SPEAKER_18]: For the 36 students who took AP,

1096
01:19:41,338 --> 01:19:42,258
[SPEAKER_18]: 12, 12, and 12, so Spanish.

1097
01:19:42,298 --> 01:19:47,500
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, there were three in French, 10 in Italian, and 23 in Spanish.

1098
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:48,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1099
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,320
[SPEAKER_01]: All set?

1100
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

1101
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:52,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

1102
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:52,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Kritz?

1103
01:19:53,161 --> 01:19:55,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I just want to thank Ms.

1104
01:19:55,762 --> 01:19:58,782
[SPEAKER_01]: DeCarlo for her years of service and congratulate her on her retirement.

1105
01:19:58,803 --> 01:19:59,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

1106
01:19:59,723 --> 01:20:00,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1107
01:20:03,486 --> 01:20:04,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1108
01:20:04,087 --> 01:20:04,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1109
01:20:05,068 --> 01:20:05,489
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1110
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:09,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Mrs. DeCarlo, do you know what the breakdown of students are?

1111
01:20:09,274 --> 01:20:15,583
[SPEAKER_16]: How many children at Meffitt High School are in Spanish, French, and Italian?

1112
01:20:15,663 --> 01:20:17,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the exact numbers.

1113
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I could send them to you.

1114
01:20:18,497 --> 01:20:24,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm just curious, like, what students, and do students get to pick what they want as freshmen?

1115
01:20:24,461 --> 01:20:24,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1116
01:20:25,181 --> 01:20:25,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1117
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Especially because we don't offer French at the middle schools.

1118
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:29,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, that's hard.

1119
01:20:29,644 --> 01:20:32,226
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm wondering if that has any impact on the other students.

1120
01:20:32,246 --> 01:20:33,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, it does have an impact.

1121
01:20:33,346 --> 01:20:43,933
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why when Mrs. Stone asked, you know, we only had three French because they start later, and so the only ones that can arrive to the AP level

1122
01:20:44,546 --> 01:20:49,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Those that know some French to begin with are those that are native speakers.

1123
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:58,383
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so is there any way that, I know that you're retiring soon, is there any way that you could provide us with that breakdown even in an email?

1124
01:20:58,743 --> 01:20:58,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1125
01:20:59,103 --> 01:21:04,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Just so we can plan and I want to see how strong the programs are and where the interest is.

1126
01:21:04,786 --> 01:21:11,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I can give you the current students now and even what the requests are for the following year, so far.

1127
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:13,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that would be awesome, thank you so much.

1128
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:21,040
[SPEAKER_16]: You send him to the superintendent, I'm sure he's happy to email us that if that's okay.

1129
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,381
[SPEAKER_16]: He can get them.

1130
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:23,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, thanks.

1131
01:21:23,562 --> 01:21:30,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, we always have some students, even yesterday at the ceremony, the mother came to me that her daughter wants to take French and Italian.

1132
01:21:30,789 --> 01:21:33,572
[SPEAKER_06]: She's taking Italian now, but she also knows French.

1133
01:21:33,632 --> 01:21:40,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very hard to fit two languages in the schedule the way it is, the high school schedule.

1134
01:21:40,655 --> 01:21:45,680
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have one student right now, she's a junior, she's taking Italian and Spanish.

1135
01:21:46,121 --> 01:21:49,084
[SPEAKER_06]: We were able to somehow figure that out.

1136
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:55,471
[SPEAKER_16]: And especially now, because a few years ago we changed the program so that students take languages all six days.

1137
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:56,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, every day.

1138
01:21:56,632 --> 01:22:01,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead of, they used to have five day block, like five out of the six day block.

1139
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:03,508
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

1140
01:22:03,568 --> 01:22:03,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1141
01:22:03,948 --> 01:22:05,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Your report was very thorough.

1142
01:22:05,249 --> 01:22:05,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1143
01:22:06,169 --> 01:22:07,370
[SPEAKER_16]: I know your level of funding.

1144
01:22:08,071 --> 01:22:30,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I just personally, I've known you for many, many years, and I can't thank you enough for not only the academic service that you've given these students, but the global opportunities in taking them across the other side of the world and touring Italy and Spain and really giving them an opportunity and seeing the world outside of MedFit.

1145
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:33,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very grateful for those opportunities.

1146
01:22:33,653 --> 01:22:35,355
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wish I had gone with you.

1147
01:22:36,296 --> 01:22:42,903
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are going to... I just went to the Montreal one, Montreal and Quebec.

1148
01:22:43,163 --> 01:22:44,384
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a fun trip too.

1149
01:22:44,504 --> 01:22:46,026
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's my only regret.

1150
01:22:46,426 --> 01:22:48,709
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you very much for your time and dedication.

1151
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:51,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your support over the years.

1152
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:51,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1153
01:22:59,018 --> 01:23:13,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I just too wanted to add my thoughts, and I know we're going to see you again, but it's been a long wonderful journey with you, and we really, you know, seeing the department grow so much, and thank you for all your dedication and the opportunities that have been afforded to our students.

1154
01:23:14,085 --> 01:23:14,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1155
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,275
[SPEAKER_17]: You will be missed.

1156
01:23:17,015 --> 01:23:17,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1157
01:23:18,797 --> 01:23:23,521
[SPEAKER_17]: A motion for approval of the pre-budget report offered by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

1158
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:29,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz, and the request is to get the enrollment by language for this year and projected for next year by Mr. Benedetto.

1159
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:30,827
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1160
01:23:31,567 --> 01:23:31,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1161
01:23:31,908 --> 01:23:32,648
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1162
01:23:33,289 --> 01:23:34,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1163
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:40,515
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have an item in our agenda that was not listed, so I'd ask the body to take this under suspension.

1164
01:23:40,655 --> 01:23:40,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1165
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:41,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Vliet?

1166
01:23:42,312 --> 01:23:49,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Mr. Russo, motion for suspension of the rules to take an Italy student trip.

1167
01:23:50,854 --> 01:23:58,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. DeCarlo, or Mr. Belson actually, would like to request the approval of a trip to Italy, which will coincide with April vacation week 2019.

1168
01:23:59,517 --> 01:24:01,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Serving as trip leader for this trip will be Ms.

1169
01:24:01,577 --> 01:24:05,739
[SPEAKER_17]: Nicole Chalafo, who served as a chaperone on our 2015 French Italy voyage.

1170
01:24:07,559 --> 01:24:10,641
[SPEAKER_17]: and lead teacher for this 2017 Italy trip.

1171
01:24:11,342 --> 01:24:19,567
[SPEAKER_17]: For this trip, we will use Travel Design Italy, an educational travel agency which we have used in the past and have been very satisfied with their service.

1172
01:24:20,027 --> 01:24:24,650
[SPEAKER_17]: This organization uses major airlines and provides professional liability and medical insurance.

1173
01:24:27,147 --> 01:24:29,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

1174
01:24:29,728 --> 01:24:31,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this is approval to go.

1175
01:24:31,249 --> 01:24:31,990
[SPEAKER_06]: She wants to go.

1176
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:32,970
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need another.

1177
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:35,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they have, they have the whole report.

1178
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:35,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1179
01:24:35,851 --> 01:24:37,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see, no, we didn't get to pricing.

1180
01:24:56,995 --> 01:25:04,642
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have, yes, if you look on, here it is, on the page, what is it?

1181
01:25:04,662 --> 01:25:11,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, one, two, three, page three, this is the cost breakdown.

1182
01:25:11,728 --> 01:25:12,889
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't get page three.

1183
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:14,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And four?

1184
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:15,240
[SPEAKER_17]: No?

1185
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:15,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we can do two.

1186
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:18,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve the trip?

1187
01:25:18,183 --> 01:25:18,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Ms.

1188
01:25:19,204 --> 01:25:19,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

1189
01:25:19,424 --> 01:25:20,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please.

1190
01:25:20,785 --> 01:25:22,327
[SPEAKER_06]: The price for the trip right now is $30,300.

1191
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:40,511
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is inclusive of the base travel insurance.

1192
01:25:40,551 --> 01:25:52,334
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a cancel-for-any-reason insurance that's available at an additional $100 if we want to insist that the students get that one.

1193
01:25:52,354 --> 01:25:52,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1194
01:25:52,975 --> 01:25:57,096
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is less than in previous years.

1195
01:25:57,136 --> 01:25:57,936
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good value.

1196
01:26:08,715 --> 01:26:10,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1197
01:26:10,936 --> 01:26:11,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1198
01:26:14,139 --> 01:26:15,680
[SPEAKER_17]: The superintendent would like to make an announcement.

1199
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:28,150
[SPEAKER_20]: So as much as we're going to miss Rita, and we are going to miss Rita and her wonderful work, this week we begin the formal interviews of foreign language department directors starting Wednesday.

1200
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:32,253
[SPEAKER_20]: So there'll be a team from the department.

1201
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:34,274
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Osborne is also participating.

1202
01:26:34,354 --> 01:26:37,637
[SPEAKER_20]: And we hope to have something in front of the committee very soon.

1203
01:26:38,884 --> 01:26:39,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1204
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:39,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1205
01:26:40,805 --> 01:26:41,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1206
01:26:42,746 --> 01:26:43,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1207
01:26:43,726 --> 01:26:44,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto?

1208
01:26:45,187 --> 01:26:48,368
[SPEAKER_16]: So will the incoming superintendent be part of this process?

1209
01:26:49,168 --> 01:26:49,828
[SPEAKER_20]: She'll be involved.

1210
01:26:50,649 --> 01:26:52,209
[SPEAKER_16]: In what way, Mr. Bellson?

1211
01:26:52,549 --> 01:26:59,672
[SPEAKER_20]: She'll get to see the people that the department screens out, and then she can make some decisions along with everyone else.

1212
01:26:59,712 --> 01:27:01,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Give us feedback.

1213
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:06,415
[SPEAKER_16]: She'll be there for the interview process and for the decision-making process?

1214
01:27:06,851 --> 01:27:09,213
[SPEAKER_17]: dependent upon her schedule.

1215
01:27:09,273 --> 01:27:15,159
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't tie her up every day so I mean so when we get it down to a few people that people are comfortable with we'll have her involved.

1216
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:16,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1217
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,343
[SPEAKER_20]: She'll give me a feedback as well and we'll move on.

1218
01:27:20,484 --> 01:27:20,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1219
01:27:21,365 --> 01:27:23,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Next item, English Learner Department.

1220
01:27:25,209 --> 01:27:26,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Taxera.

1221
01:27:29,733 --> 01:27:30,734
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, good evening everyone.

1222
01:28:00,978 --> 01:28:26,317
[SPEAKER_24]: The program in the middle school program is a school within a school model, and that includes students at Yale levels one through three, that are basically in self-contained classes until more students are hired.

1223
01:28:26,337 --> 01:28:27,518
[SPEAKER_24]: And then in the high school,

1224
01:28:28,484 --> 01:28:30,811
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what you're saying, but that's fine.

1225
01:29:06,111 --> 01:29:11,586
you know, that we have the coordinated

1226
01:29:43,368 --> 01:29:54,534
[SPEAKER_24]: The school model was created six years ago under another CPR and that was the model that the department that wanted.

1227
01:29:54,894 --> 01:29:56,415
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, sorry.

1228
01:29:59,029 --> 01:30:03,611
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was the model that the Department of Ed wanted six years ago.

1229
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:06,191
[SPEAKER_23]: But now that's changed.

1230
01:30:07,352 --> 01:30:11,633
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's come out of retail for the state.

1231
01:30:12,233 --> 01:30:16,815
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, when this went into effect in the middle schools,

1232
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:24,221
[SPEAKER_23]: the numbers were a lot smaller, so it was easier for all of our middle school students to get what they needed.

1233
01:30:25,302 --> 01:30:33,366
[SPEAKER_23]: As the numbers have continually grown, and with the changes in the regs, this model no longer works, and that's what they'd like to see change.

1234
01:30:37,257 --> 01:30:52,534
[SPEAKER_23]: probably the beginning of April, we started the McGlynn EL redesign program, which involved McGlynn middle school teachers and the McGlynn administration on looking at ways to

1235
01:30:53,094 --> 01:31:09,107
[SPEAKER_23]: redo the schedule to have our students be at grade level and still get all of the classes that they need to support their English language development and the content at grade level with their grade level peers, moving away from that school within a school model.

1236
01:31:09,967 --> 01:31:12,069
[SPEAKER_23]: We're at about 80% finished.

1237
01:31:12,449 --> 01:31:15,492
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure you'll be getting a report on that, on what that will look like.

1238
01:31:16,339 --> 01:31:18,380
[SPEAKER_23]: We actually met today after school.

1239
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:23,002
[SPEAKER_23]: There's about 15 people on the team putting this together.

1240
01:31:25,343 --> 01:31:34,006
[SPEAKER_23]: So with those changes is why when I go down, well, I guess let me finish the highlights before I go to money.

1241
01:31:35,487 --> 01:31:41,069
[SPEAKER_23]: So we offered some pre-K through 12 professional development.

1242
01:31:43,302 --> 01:31:55,829
[SPEAKER_23]: We tied into the union contract with providing teachers with 15 PDPs that could be used for salary credit, and the focus on that was working with English learners.

1243
01:31:57,030 --> 01:32:03,333
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was on Saturdays at the McGlynn with a combination of face-to-face and online sessions.

1244
01:32:05,276 --> 01:32:10,337
[SPEAKER_23]: We also offered some PD on working with students from Haiti.

1245
01:32:10,897 --> 01:32:14,578
[SPEAKER_23]: And actually, Mr. Rousseau was in attendance at that.

1246
01:32:14,959 --> 01:32:20,240
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there were about 35 teachers that came to the McGlynn on a Saturday to be a part of that.

1247
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:28,462
[SPEAKER_23]: We also offered professional development for our pre-K teachers, which even though we don't necessarily have an EL pre-K program,

1248
01:32:29,013 --> 01:32:45,617
[SPEAKER_23]: Our pre-K teachers do work with English learners, and so we provided professional development for pre-K teachers, which also gave them the opportunity to get their 15 PDPs for license renewal and just also kind of learn about the process of working with English learners.

1249
01:32:47,603 --> 01:33:07,459
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the things instituted this year were grade level English language development progress reports, so every student in the district got a progress report that broke down the four domains of language, reading, writing, listening, and speaking, and you can actually track the student's progress throughout the year.

1250
01:33:09,814 --> 01:33:12,016
[SPEAKER_23]: We did the fall and spring common writing prompts.

1251
01:33:12,637 --> 01:33:15,299
[SPEAKER_23]: So we did that across grade level in every school.

1252
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:20,564
[SPEAKER_23]: We're using, the teachers are actually finishing up the spring prompts now.

1253
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:33,235
[SPEAKER_23]: We're using that as part of data collection to monitor student progress and also identify areas of need to help us group students better and support them with what they need.

1254
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:41,416
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a partnership with Starbase STEM Labs at Hanscom Air Force Base for a summer program.

1255
01:33:41,956 --> 01:33:45,861
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a one-week STEM program at the Air Force Base.

1256
01:33:45,901 --> 01:33:50,807
[SPEAKER_23]: They have this incredible STEM lab where students get to go.

1257
01:33:51,287 --> 01:33:53,590
[SPEAKER_23]: It's only available for fifth grade students.

1258
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:56,972
[SPEAKER_23]: They get to go to the lab.

1259
01:33:57,872 --> 01:33:58,992
[SPEAKER_23]: They get robotics.

1260
01:33:59,052 --> 01:34:01,633
[SPEAKER_23]: They get to work with 3D printers.

1261
01:34:01,773 --> 01:34:04,514
[SPEAKER_23]: There's the engineering design process.

1262
01:34:04,674 --> 01:34:06,474
[SPEAKER_23]: Every day is a different topic.

1263
01:34:07,035 --> 01:34:13,396
[SPEAKER_23]: And that will be offered as a summer program for the one, a summer camp basically for the one week.

1264
01:34:13,536 --> 01:34:19,358
[SPEAKER_23]: It is free, but I can use Title III to pay for the transportation costs to get the students out there.

1265
01:34:20,703 --> 01:34:26,686
[SPEAKER_23]: We're starting an English learner parent advisory council, although I may change the name on that because I was at a conference on Friday.

1266
01:34:26,706 --> 01:34:34,349
[SPEAKER_23]: I always struggle with parent advisory council because many of our students, especially our English learners, may not be here with their parents.

1267
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:40,151
[SPEAKER_23]: So I might take the parent piece out and maybe call it a district council and call it LDAC.

1268
01:34:42,574 --> 01:34:46,037
[SPEAKER_23]: So that is part of what came out of the look bill in November 2017.

1269
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:55,746
[SPEAKER_23]: All districts who have more than 100 English learners or 5% of the population need to have this LPAC.

1270
01:34:56,046 --> 01:35:00,750
[SPEAKER_23]: And so the first meeting is to just inform parents about it.

1271
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:04,493
[SPEAKER_23]: And I believe that is set for the second week in June.

1272
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:06,375
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know the exact date off the top of my head.

1273
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:13,998
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we started a student translation community service program at Medford High.

1274
01:35:14,559 --> 01:35:24,231
[SPEAKER_23]: This allows students at the high school to act as translators for public events, not report card conferences or anything confidential.

1275
01:35:25,473 --> 01:35:29,878
[SPEAKER_23]: The students, high school students, went down to the elementary schools for their open houses.

1276
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:33,001
[SPEAKER_23]: They went to the family math nights.

1277
01:35:33,502 --> 01:35:37,466
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is also a program, we give the students community service hours for this.

1278
01:35:38,287 --> 01:35:45,254
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're actually tying that into the seal of biliteracy because English learners are entitled to earn the seal of biliteracy.

1279
01:35:46,035 --> 01:35:51,639
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, our second largest language group is Haitian Creole, but there aren't tests for that.

1280
01:35:51,859 --> 01:36:04,268
[SPEAKER_23]: So the Department of Education is actually coming up with alternative criteria to allow students who can't take that online test to be able to earn the seal, and this is one way that we can fold that into it.

1281
01:36:06,762 --> 01:36:13,865
[SPEAKER_23]: We've established language acquisition teams in every building, and we're doing this for our end-of-the-year placement meetings.

1282
01:36:14,506 --> 01:36:36,096
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're taking, like, the writing data, MCAS scores, you know, the history of MCAS, if available, when the students access scores, which won't be released until May 30th now, and then all of their internal measures, the DRAs that they, the DRA scores that they get are found to some, you know,

1283
01:36:36,516 --> 01:36:47,679
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're going to look at the whole student to make placement decisions, especially if we're exiting a student from the program or if we're moving somebody from newcomers to EL pullout.

1284
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,640
[SPEAKER_23]: We're establishing protocols to do that.

1285
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,702
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, that's consistent, you know, throughout the district and we're looking at multiple data points to make that happen.

1286
01:36:56,526 --> 01:36:59,568
[SPEAKER_23]: We did have 100% participation in the access testing.

1287
01:37:00,549 --> 01:37:08,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I also worked with principals and lead teachers in the buildings to decrease the number of days that the students were tested.

1288
01:37:09,255 --> 01:37:14,799
[SPEAKER_23]: And we did actually decrease the testing time so we could get back to actual teaching.

1289
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:23,545
[SPEAKER_23]: We streamlined the EL testing procedures and parent guardian notification at the Parent Information Center, and then also when the

1290
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:25,866
[SPEAKER_23]: access scores come out.

1291
01:37:26,047 --> 01:37:27,509
[SPEAKER_23]: We're not waiting until summer.

1292
01:37:27,549 --> 01:37:31,894
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to get that all taken care of before the students leave in June.

1293
01:37:33,002 --> 01:37:40,304
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there was a life after high school program at Medford High School run by Ami Sanye, one of the EL teachers.

1294
01:37:41,264 --> 01:37:42,625
[SPEAKER_23]: She had speakers come in.

1295
01:37:43,085 --> 01:37:53,168
[SPEAKER_23]: She worked with the librarian to secure the space and set it all up for students to look at their options after high school.

1296
01:37:53,188 --> 01:37:54,488
[SPEAKER_23]: And it wasn't just for seniors.

1297
01:37:54,868 --> 01:38:03,315
[SPEAKER_23]: But it used to be done during the summer, but we moved it up to April so she could get the seniors, because waiting until the summer would preclude them from being a part of it.

1298
01:38:04,235 --> 01:38:05,276
[SPEAKER_23]: So those were our highlights.

1299
01:38:06,757 --> 01:38:18,927
[SPEAKER_23]: So the funding for 2017-18, the textbook budget, a big chunk of it went to the EL Intro to Physics course, which was a new course last year.

1300
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:23,528
[SPEAKER_23]: We do our summer testing and registration of L's.

1301
01:38:23,948 --> 01:38:26,370
[SPEAKER_23]: That's probably our busiest time of summer.

1302
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:36,560
[SPEAKER_23]: And then instructional materials office supply for the Yale program K through 12, and then the translation budget, which it's my understanding that was also increased last year.

1303
01:38:38,075 --> 01:38:47,637
[SPEAKER_23]: So the funding request for 18-19, so we can level fund for the summer labor, for the translations, office supplies, and instructional materials.

1304
01:38:48,237 --> 01:38:52,378
[SPEAKER_23]: Where I'm hoping to have an increase is on the textbook budget from $4,000 to $7,000.

1305
01:38:53,178 --> 01:39:03,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, I'm trying to streamline what's going on in the district across grade levels and also even within schools at the same level.

1306
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,921
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a lot of teacher-created materials.

1307
01:39:07,882 --> 01:39:13,244
[SPEAKER_23]: The Yale curriculum that was left by my predecessor is amazing.

1308
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:16,625
[SPEAKER_23]: It really is streamlined.

1309
01:39:17,105 --> 01:39:20,647
[SPEAKER_23]: It allowed the teachers to bring in a lot of their own materials.

1310
01:39:21,147 --> 01:39:22,188
[SPEAKER_23]: The struggle with it is

1311
01:39:24,195 --> 01:39:27,759
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not, we don't have a consistent foundation.

1312
01:39:27,859 --> 01:39:31,022
[SPEAKER_23]: So we can have two EL1 classes at the high school.

1313
01:39:31,443 --> 01:39:37,929
[SPEAKER_23]: And now at the McGlynn, with the redesign, we're going to have three EL1 classrooms because there'll be grade level.

1314
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:41,733
[SPEAKER_23]: Three, you know, EL2 classrooms by grade level.

1315
01:39:42,214 --> 01:39:44,216
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we need a consistent measure.

1316
01:39:44,576 --> 01:39:47,319
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we need a foundation, which would be the textbook.

1317
01:39:47,639 --> 01:40:01,453
[SPEAKER_23]: not to replace the curriculum, because the curriculum is still the heart of what we do, but we need a common teaching and assessment tool across the board, and so that's why I'm asking for the additional funding for that.

1318
01:40:02,013 --> 01:40:04,496
[SPEAKER_23]: We've identified the textbook series that we'll be using.

1319
01:40:04,516 --> 01:40:05,336
[SPEAKER_23]: It's in the packet.

1320
01:40:05,717 --> 01:40:10,742
[SPEAKER_23]: For the middle school, it's National Geographics Inside, and for the high school, it's National Geographic Edge.

1321
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:21,079
[SPEAKER_23]: And they actually do, it's the same format and structure, so it does go up basically from middle school to high school.

1322
01:40:23,871 --> 01:40:28,014
[SPEAKER_23]: And then for the positions, I'm asking for an additional middle school teacher.

1323
01:40:28,454 --> 01:40:31,836
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was actually something that they did ask for in the budget last year.

1324
01:40:31,856 --> 01:40:37,359
[SPEAKER_23]: And it ended up, I think, going to the high school because of that need.

1325
01:40:37,759 --> 01:40:39,160
[SPEAKER_23]: As you know, our numbers are fluid.

1326
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:46,504
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I put in here we're 40 students above what we had last year, which is basically an entire class.

1327
01:40:49,346 --> 01:40:58,577
[SPEAKER_23]: And then that teacher is needed because now once we split the students, they're no longer by language proficiency level, they're now by grade level.

1328
01:40:58,998 --> 01:41:08,630
[SPEAKER_23]: And in order to give the students everything we need to give them, especially our newcomer students, we're going to need the extra teacher to make that happen.

1329
01:41:10,197 --> 01:41:20,186
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we had a long-term sub at the high school asking that that position be converted into a full-time position rather than paying a substitute teacher.

1330
01:41:21,307 --> 01:41:31,275
[SPEAKER_23]: There were issues with certification, which won't be a problem next year, and that's why she was a sub and paid at the sub rate.

1331
01:41:32,315 --> 01:41:37,620
[SPEAKER_23]: But that will be a full-fledged teacher next year, and that's the Intro to Physics course.

1332
01:41:39,759 --> 01:41:39,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1333
01:41:40,019 --> 01:41:40,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Vander Ploet.

1334
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:42,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Teixeira.

1335
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:54,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the one question I have for you is with the redesign of the middle school EL program, it still keeps the whole EL population at the McGlynn.

1336
01:41:55,324 --> 01:41:55,584
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1337
01:41:55,944 --> 01:42:03,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I understand was done six years ago because it was the way that at the time seemed the most efficient.

1338
01:42:03,746 --> 01:42:08,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet at the same time, I think that there isn't any equity that builds into our system

1339
01:42:09,395 --> 01:42:13,778
[SPEAKER_03]: where we don't have EL students at the Andrews.

1340
01:42:14,778 --> 01:42:17,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Given the numbers that we have now and

1341
01:42:18,231 --> 01:42:24,213
[SPEAKER_03]: the redesign you're talking about, does it still make sense to have all the EL students at the McGlynn?

1342
01:42:24,493 --> 01:42:39,356
[SPEAKER_23]: So when I ran those statistics, the McGlynn is at 11.6% of an EL population, which is just slightly higher than 10%, which is kind of, I don't want to say a norm, because every district is different.

1343
01:42:39,516 --> 01:42:45,358
[SPEAKER_23]: But to be in that 10% range is perfectly acceptable.

1344
01:42:46,195 --> 01:43:04,909
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the advantages of the redesign is that the students are kind of clustered together now, so it seems like a bigger program at the MacLenn than it really is, because they essentially travel as a group, and that goes for their UA classes, it goes for their

1345
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:08,132
[SPEAKER_23]: even their content classes.

1346
01:43:08,692 --> 01:43:12,496
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're distributing the students, and they're all just on one team.

1347
01:43:13,197 --> 01:43:17,241
[SPEAKER_23]: So now, with this new design, we're putting them on two teams.

1348
01:43:17,542 --> 01:43:24,909
[SPEAKER_23]: They're on the A team and the B team, so the students will be more absorbed into the general school population.

1349
01:43:26,271 --> 01:43:31,256
[SPEAKER_23]: In terms of putting a program at the Andrews, I could do that, and I know space is an issue.

1350
01:43:31,816 --> 01:43:43,647
[SPEAKER_23]: But then, now once I put, and this came up in the Department of Ed's CPR, I asked, you know, we have two middle schools, we have a program only in one, are we in compliance?

1351
01:43:43,707 --> 01:43:46,570
[SPEAKER_23]: And she said, yes, that's not a compliance issue.

1352
01:43:47,591 --> 01:43:50,394
[SPEAKER_23]: But if we do move a program over to the Andrews,

1353
01:43:50,714 --> 01:43:57,897
[SPEAKER_23]: the program at the Andrews needs to look the same way as it does at the McGlynn, because then it becomes an inequity issue.

1354
01:43:58,418 --> 01:44:02,699
[SPEAKER_23]: So I can put a program at the Andrews, but that will require four teachers.

1355
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:04,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1356
01:44:08,922 --> 01:44:09,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1357
01:44:10,063 --> 01:44:17,046
[SPEAKER_10]: So of this A team and B team, it's not simply that we can put the B team at the Andrews and the A teams at the McGlynn.

1358
01:44:18,386 --> 01:44:31,581
[SPEAKER_23]: No, because then it would, so the, within the school, so, and, and if anyone from the McGlynn is watching this, this isn't set in stone, but one team would have the, um, the newcomer strand of students.

1359
01:44:31,741 --> 01:44:32,922
[SPEAKER_23]: So that would be the A team.

1360
01:44:33,423 --> 01:44:36,886
[SPEAKER_23]: The B team would have the level three, four, and five students.

1361
01:44:37,707 --> 01:44:47,790
[SPEAKER_23]: So if I took the newcomer program over and put it at the Andrews, say that A-team, which I think that was in the proposal that I gave you back in October, I could move that.

1362
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:51,572
[SPEAKER_23]: That would require three teachers to go over to the...

1363
01:44:53,237 --> 01:45:02,202
[SPEAKER_23]: to go over to the Andrews, and two, to remain at the McGlynn to have the three, fours, and fives.

1364
01:45:02,943 --> 01:45:19,453
[SPEAKER_23]: We can just keep the newcomer program in one of the buildings, but as those newcomer students become fluent and become grade level and go from being a newcomer to a level three, four, well then they need an EL teacher as well, and that's where the equity is.

1365
01:45:19,993 --> 01:45:21,114
[SPEAKER_23]: So that would be,

1366
01:45:21,994 --> 01:45:24,958
[SPEAKER_23]: additional teaching, you know, in year two, year three.

1367
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:26,039
[SPEAKER_10]: To just transfer them?

1368
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:32,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Like once they're, let's say they get to, you have a newcomer student, he's a really quick learner, he moves up to level four.

1369
01:45:33,107 --> 01:45:34,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Couldn't we just move him to the other school?

1370
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:37,272
[SPEAKER_23]: That is not a desired

1371
01:45:38,873 --> 01:45:43,557
[SPEAKER_23]: scenario for any of our students, because the idea, excuse me?

1372
01:45:43,577 --> 01:45:44,979
[SPEAKER_17]: There are other teachers, correct?

1373
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:51,364
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, there are other teachers, but it's also, it's challenging for any student to move around.

1374
01:45:51,384 --> 01:45:53,286
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, you're with your friends, you're with your peer group.

1375
01:45:53,346 --> 01:45:55,048
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, now we're moving you this year.

1376
01:45:55,128 --> 01:45:56,409
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, next year you're moving.

1377
01:45:56,509 --> 01:46:02,474
[SPEAKER_23]: So, if it were a student who, say, came in at the end of fifth grade, who was a newcomer.

1378
01:46:02,494 --> 01:46:04,956
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, they're at the Roberts, and everybody does,

1379
01:46:05,697 --> 01:46:05,977
[SPEAKER_23]: move.

1380
01:46:06,518 --> 01:46:11,483
[SPEAKER_23]: So then they go to the Andrews for one year, and then we're sending them to the McGlynn for another year.

1381
01:46:11,964 --> 01:46:14,907
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's not an ideal situation for any student.

1382
01:46:15,147 --> 01:46:27,139
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's a struggle that I'm having with the Brooks program being separated, because we could conceivably have a second grade student come in halfway through the year, so they're in the newcomer program.

1383
01:46:28,108 --> 01:46:33,631
[SPEAKER_23]: Now they still need newcomer in September, so we transfer them to the Brooks, I mean to the Roberts.

1384
01:46:34,171 --> 01:46:38,173
[SPEAKER_23]: So then they finish their newcomer program, but their neighborhood school is the Columbus.

1385
01:46:38,653 --> 01:46:42,976
[SPEAKER_23]: And in a two and a half year period, we have moved that student to three different schools.

1386
01:46:43,376 --> 01:46:45,917
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's not really what's in the best interest of the student.

1387
01:46:46,217 --> 01:46:48,398
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I'd hate to do that at the middle school level.

1388
01:46:49,739 --> 01:46:51,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I follow up, please?

1389
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:52,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1390
01:46:52,961 --> 01:46:57,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess my concern would be when you have a large concentration

1391
01:46:57,833 --> 01:47:04,218
[SPEAKER_10]: of EL students at one school, then you also have EL parents also at that same school.

1392
01:47:04,298 --> 01:47:13,686
[SPEAKER_10]: It creates an environment where you might have one program just happens to be wealthier because of the sociodynamics versus the other program.

1393
01:47:14,066 --> 01:47:24,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think that we have to recognize as a board that there aren't necessarily perfect solutions, but do we have a sense of how many students are in the A team versus the B team?

1394
01:47:26,025 --> 01:47:26,205
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

1395
01:47:27,006 --> 01:47:30,489
[SPEAKER_23]: The teachers were actually working on putting the schedules together today.

1396
01:47:30,509 --> 01:47:31,650
[SPEAKER_23]: I see.

1397
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:34,752
[SPEAKER_10]: If you had to just give me a rough estimate, I'd try to put you on the spot.

1398
01:47:35,453 --> 01:47:36,694
[SPEAKER_23]: Hang on for a moment.

1399
01:47:37,094 --> 01:47:39,256
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't have the number broken down by newcomers.

1400
01:47:39,637 --> 01:47:51,506
[SPEAKER_23]: And a lot of this will be driven by those lab meetings that we have at the end of the year, because that's when we make the decision if a student is still classified as a newcomer, if they're going on to level three, or if they're being reclassified as a fellow.

1401
01:47:53,348 --> 01:48:08,136
[SPEAKER_23]: I wouldn't be able to give you those numbers, but after we, so the lab meetings are the first week in June because, or first into the second week of June because the access scores, which are a major component of that, like I said, don't come up until May 30th.

1402
01:48:08,916 --> 01:48:13,759
[SPEAKER_23]: Once we have that, I'll have a clear picture of every student currently in the district and where they're going to be.

1403
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:16,220
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, thank you.

1404
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:16,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1405
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:16,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Vanden Heuvel.

1406
01:48:17,281 --> 01:48:17,981
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I, yes, I'm fine.

1407
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:18,681
[SPEAKER_17]: You're set.

1408
01:48:19,262 --> 01:48:21,023
[SPEAKER_17]: And now Mia, Ms.

1409
01:48:21,083 --> 01:48:21,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustone.

1410
01:48:23,761 --> 01:48:29,324
[SPEAKER_18]: The scenario where someone would start at the Brooks, then go to the Roberts, and then go to the neighborhood school, do we actually do that?

1411
01:48:29,344 --> 01:48:38,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I've been at the Roberts, and it was my understanding that if the child started at the Roberts in third and newcomers, they did stay through for fourth and fifth.

1412
01:48:38,789 --> 01:48:39,269
[SPEAKER_23]: No, they don't.

1413
01:48:39,529 --> 01:48:39,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1414
01:48:40,009 --> 01:48:40,730
[SPEAKER_18]: That I did not know.

1415
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:48,994
[SPEAKER_18]: So how many would you say students a year leave the Brooks or the Roberts to go back to their neighborhood school from the newcomers program?

1416
01:48:50,095 --> 01:48:51,316
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll, again, I'll know.

1417
01:48:51,417 --> 01:48:55,881
[SPEAKER_23]: Like last year, I don't know, because those decisions were all made before I came on board.

1418
01:48:57,063 --> 01:49:01,888
[SPEAKER_23]: But they did, the state came out with new exit criteria.

1419
01:49:02,208 --> 01:49:08,675
[SPEAKER_23]: And so there were students, even over the summer, that did, you know, I know of three students that did change schools.

1420
01:49:09,396 --> 01:49:11,358
[SPEAKER_23]: And sometimes it's just for one year.

1421
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:26,148
[SPEAKER_23]: which is problematic because you've had the student that's been, you know, has only known the Roberts and then in that final year is going to another school where they don't necessarily have a peer group that they grew up with.

1422
01:49:27,349 --> 01:49:27,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Russo.

1423
01:49:29,490 --> 01:49:36,455
[SPEAKER_09]: So the scenario where we're treating children like luggage, I can't even believe that that's a real scenario.

1424
01:49:36,535 --> 01:49:40,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something that as a school committee policy we can change or is there a reason why we can't just

1425
01:49:41,927 --> 01:49:48,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is it there's not enough space?

1426
01:49:48,549 --> 01:49:50,229
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we need to do to stop that?

1427
01:49:50,249 --> 01:49:53,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's totally written beyond acceptable in my mind.

1428
01:49:55,230 --> 01:49:56,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, you could do that.

1429
01:50:03,950 --> 01:50:07,752
[SPEAKER_18]: that I know were in other school districts' neighborhoods, they've all stayed.

1430
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:10,294
[SPEAKER_18]: And granted, that's maybe going back a few years.

1431
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:12,855
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm thinking of certain friends of some of my children.

1432
01:50:13,396 --> 01:50:16,257
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't know if it was a parent's request to stay at the Roberts.

1433
01:50:16,297 --> 01:50:17,999
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if there's a back story.

1434
01:50:18,019 --> 01:50:20,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you know, Mr. Bosco?

1435
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:23,042
[SPEAKER_20]: So it really depends on the parent.

1436
01:50:23,442 --> 01:50:27,364
[SPEAKER_20]: Some parents like the youngsters to stay with who they've grown up with or who they've gone with.

1437
01:50:27,404 --> 01:50:29,045
[SPEAKER_20]: And other parents want them back in their neighborhood.

1438
01:50:29,385 --> 01:50:32,447
[SPEAKER_20]: They may have siblings back in their neighborhood, and they want them back with the siblings.

1439
01:50:32,467 --> 01:50:33,648
[SPEAKER_20]: There may be daycare issues.

1440
01:50:34,713 --> 01:50:37,214
[SPEAKER_20]: The issues and the variables are tremendous.

1441
01:50:37,234 --> 01:50:41,176
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no perfect solution, and that's the issue.

1442
01:50:41,437 --> 01:50:46,479
[SPEAKER_20]: So when you talk to policymakers in town, what they tell you is focus on the child.

1443
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,460
[SPEAKER_20]: What's best for the child?

1444
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,901
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't want the child moving around any more than you have to.

1445
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:54,783
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't want a lot of dislocation.

1446
01:50:55,744 --> 01:51:03,908
[SPEAKER_20]: And you can't just simply concentrate everything in one place all the time, especially elementary, because you will overload that school.

1447
01:51:04,515 --> 01:51:07,976
[SPEAKER_20]: In middle school, it becomes a little bit more believable because kids are a little bit older.

1448
01:51:08,696 --> 01:51:12,537
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's only two of them, whereas we've got four elementary schools.

1449
01:51:13,157 --> 01:51:13,818
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very tricky.

1450
01:51:13,858 --> 01:51:15,238
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the state makes rules.

1451
01:51:15,278 --> 01:51:16,858
[SPEAKER_20]: The state makes all kinds of policies.

1452
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:20,139
[SPEAKER_20]: They've got a new pro look, which we'll have to see how that plays out.

1453
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:24,480
[SPEAKER_20]: But sometimes they don't take into account space.

1454
01:51:25,441 --> 01:51:27,301
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't take into account adding additional staff.

1455
01:51:27,321 --> 01:51:33,923
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, what Paul was telling you is that to move things over to the Andrews, he needs four additional people.

1456
01:51:35,457 --> 01:51:38,338
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got to tell you, that's over a quarter of a million dollars plus benefits.

1457
01:51:38,938 --> 01:51:40,199
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, just for that alone.

1458
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:42,900
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I mean, there's a lot of tradeoffs here.

1459
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,721
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, tonight as you're talking about different programs, you're talking about you want to add this, you want to do that.

1460
01:51:48,502 --> 01:51:49,022
[SPEAKER_20]: You're wiped out.

1461
01:51:49,982 --> 01:51:51,603
[SPEAKER_20]: You're wiped out if you're going to try and do some of this stuff.

1462
01:51:53,053 --> 01:52:17,497
[SPEAKER_23]: So one of the things that I could do this year, because I don't know what the official district policy is, but when we have our lab meetings, if we're recommending that a student no longer needs newcomers, I can create a form to go home to the parents that's translated, giving them the option to either stay at the Roberts or to

1463
01:52:18,377 --> 01:52:27,543
[SPEAKER_23]: go to their neighborhood school, because ultimately, the parents need to make the decision that works best for, or the guardians need to make the decision that works best for the family.

1464
01:52:27,863 --> 01:52:33,887
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's been no official policy that I know of on one side of this or the other.

1465
01:52:33,907 --> 01:52:40,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Originally, when the numbers were lower, the thought was always go back to your school, your neighborhood.

1466
01:52:41,711 --> 01:52:42,472
[SPEAKER_20]: But things have changed.

1467
01:52:45,377 --> 01:52:45,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1468
01:52:46,458 --> 01:52:48,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to accept this report?

1469
01:52:48,279 --> 01:52:48,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Ms.

1470
01:52:48,619 --> 01:52:48,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustone.

1471
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:55,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I think this is a conversation that we're having a lot with parents at different schools.

1472
01:52:56,024 --> 01:52:59,846
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are currently five teachers at the McGlynn Middle.

1473
01:53:00,267 --> 01:53:01,187
[SPEAKER_18]: Two for newcomers?

1474
01:53:01,447 --> 01:53:01,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Four.

1475
01:53:01,848 --> 01:53:02,988
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm asking for a fifth.

1476
01:53:03,329 --> 01:53:05,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so two for newcomers.

1477
01:53:07,478 --> 01:53:20,648
[SPEAKER_23]: They all teach newcomers, and they teach all levels, because the program at the McGlynn Middle School is one that the students are grouped by language proficiency, not by grade level.

1478
01:53:21,149 --> 01:53:29,235
[SPEAKER_23]: So a classroom at the McGlynn right now could have level one students, but you have students who are grade six, seven, and eight in one classroom.

1479
01:53:33,739 --> 01:53:36,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it possible that two teachers would stay at the book lab?

1480
01:53:36,961 --> 01:53:40,043
[SPEAKER_18]: One would have newcomers grades six, seven, and eight, and one would have?

1481
01:53:40,623 --> 01:53:44,926
[SPEAKER_23]: One teacher can't do newcomers because of, see, it's not just one.

1482
01:53:45,286 --> 01:53:52,370
[SPEAKER_23]: So the state dictates how many periods of ESL the teacher, I mean, the students need.

1483
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:55,512
[SPEAKER_23]: So newcomers are a minimum of two.

1484
01:53:56,545 --> 01:54:00,150
[SPEAKER_23]: recommended three periods of English language development daily.

1485
01:54:00,731 --> 01:54:03,956
[SPEAKER_23]: So one teacher couldn't teach nine classes.

1486
01:54:03,996 --> 01:54:07,501
[SPEAKER_23]: There's just not enough periods in the day to handle all the newcomers.

1487
01:54:07,821 --> 01:54:09,203
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's just the newcomers.

1488
01:54:09,323 --> 01:54:10,986
[SPEAKER_23]: You have the level twos that also

1489
01:54:12,097 --> 01:54:14,258
[SPEAKER_23]: get two periods a day on minimum.

1490
01:54:14,818 --> 01:54:18,760
[SPEAKER_23]: Threes get one or two, depending upon where they fall on the range.

1491
01:54:19,221 --> 01:54:20,481
[SPEAKER_23]: Fours get one period.

1492
01:54:20,821 --> 01:54:22,422
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we also have the support.

1493
01:54:22,863 --> 01:54:27,545
[SPEAKER_23]: And we also have what we call former English learners, FELs.

1494
01:54:27,865 --> 01:54:29,346
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, I don't make these acronyms.

1495
01:54:30,747 --> 01:54:32,367
[SPEAKER_23]: And those students are monitored.

1496
01:54:32,588 --> 01:54:37,570
[SPEAKER_23]: And then if they need support, they're brought back into the fold to get the support.

1497
01:54:38,410 --> 01:54:41,312
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we just, so I can have

1498
01:54:42,012 --> 01:54:43,393
[SPEAKER_18]: answers to parents' questions.

1499
01:54:43,513 --> 01:54:53,282
[SPEAKER_18]: If we duplicated the same exact middle school model at the Andrews, you would need four, you'd have to keep four at the McGlenn, and you'd need four at the Andrews.

1500
01:54:54,724 --> 01:54:56,926
[SPEAKER_23]: If we did newcomers in both buildings.

1501
01:54:57,827 --> 01:55:07,996
[SPEAKER_23]: If we did newcomers just in one of the buildings, which would be permissible, that would be four in one building, and then two, a minimum of two at the other building.

1502
01:55:08,558 --> 01:55:11,779
[SPEAKER_18]: but then we would run into moving the kids from the Andrews back to the McLintock.

1503
01:55:12,339 --> 01:55:15,640
[SPEAKER_18]: So how many teachers would you need if you needed newcomers at both?

1504
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:17,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Would it then be seven?

1505
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:18,840
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be eight total.

1506
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:19,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Eight, okay.

1507
01:55:21,881 --> 01:55:33,183
[SPEAKER_20]: So one of the things that, listening to the whole discussion this evening, dealing with extra help and all the other things, we've got to begin to actively and more actively explore the use of software and technology.

1508
01:55:33,763 --> 01:55:36,424
[SPEAKER_20]: Because as long as something is labor intensive,

1509
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:40,040
[SPEAKER_20]: You require more and more staff, more and more benefits.

1510
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:41,400
[SPEAKER_20]: One, you can't afford it.

1511
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:42,520
[SPEAKER_20]: Two, you can't schedule it.

1512
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:43,600
[SPEAKER_20]: Three, you don't have enough space.

1513
01:55:44,681 --> 01:55:53,582
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got to find ways to use the technology more effectively and find those pieces that will attract youngsters, whether it's math or it's language arts or whatever the case may be.

1514
01:55:53,602 --> 01:56:01,684
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got to work with some people to see if there's technology assists we can use that also can go home with the youngsters to build language skills.

1515
01:56:01,924 --> 01:56:06,145
[SPEAKER_20]: Because we are just not going to have enough personnel, space,

1516
01:56:07,317 --> 01:56:11,620
[SPEAKER_20]: materials to do everything the state says we're supposed to do on a regular basis.

1517
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:13,441
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's not just Medford, that's across the board.

1518
01:56:14,642 --> 01:56:15,342
[SPEAKER_20]: That's across the board.

1519
01:56:16,603 --> 01:56:17,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. O'Gara.

1520
01:56:18,064 --> 01:56:25,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one of the options that have been floated with some of the parents that have talked to me about this issue is this idea of creating a language magnet school.

1521
01:56:26,495 --> 01:56:27,415
[SPEAKER_10]: at the McGlynn.

1522
01:56:27,816 --> 01:56:34,078
[SPEAKER_10]: So it would be the reason why people want to go there is that they actually maybe has a full bilingual option.

1523
01:56:34,498 --> 01:56:43,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So every kid that goes through the McGlynn gets both, I don't know, whichever of the EL students that you have the most of, and that language.

1524
01:56:44,601 --> 01:56:49,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you give me, I mean, I know that I'm asking you to do a lot of ballparking, but is such a program possible?

1525
01:56:50,283 --> 01:56:51,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that an option that's on our table?

1526
01:56:51,904 --> 01:56:55,465
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's an option under the Look Bill, and that would be,

1527
01:56:57,253 --> 01:57:00,235
[SPEAKER_23]: The old model was the transitional bilingual program.

1528
01:57:00,616 --> 01:57:06,560
[SPEAKER_23]: What's permissible is a two-way bilingual program, and that's what you're describing.

1529
01:57:06,821 --> 01:57:14,207
[SPEAKER_23]: So our major languages, our two top languages are Portuguese and Haitian Creole.

1530
01:57:14,627 --> 01:57:17,309
[SPEAKER_23]: Our Spanish numbers are on the lower side.

1531
01:57:17,329 --> 01:57:22,033
[SPEAKER_23]: We wouldn't be able to support a program for Spanish.

1532
01:57:22,995 --> 01:57:28,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any other magnet schools in the area that do either Haitian Creole or Portuguese?

1533
01:57:29,497 --> 01:57:34,799
[SPEAKER_23]: Framingham is the only district that I know of that does the Portuguese program.

1534
01:57:37,019 --> 01:57:46,502
[SPEAKER_23]: And there is a Cape Verdean program in, not New Bedford, but yeah.

1535
01:57:47,682 --> 01:57:49,163
[SPEAKER_19]: Brockton?

1536
01:57:49,183 --> 01:57:49,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Brockton.

1537
01:57:51,219 --> 01:57:58,746
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we did a bilingual Portuguese magnet school, we'd be the only one in the state that has that program, is that correct?

1538
01:57:58,806 --> 01:58:00,528
[SPEAKER_23]: Except for Framingham.

1539
01:58:01,188 --> 01:58:03,290
[SPEAKER_23]: So Haitian Creole would be the only one?

1540
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:04,852
[SPEAKER_23]: Haitian Creole would be the only one.

1541
01:58:04,892 --> 01:58:07,715
[SPEAKER_23]: I know of no Haitian Creole.

1542
01:58:08,035 --> 01:58:10,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you give us a sense of what it would take to actually architect

1543
01:58:10,527 --> 01:58:12,107
[SPEAKER_10]: like bill for that type of program?

1544
01:58:12,247 --> 01:58:14,968
[SPEAKER_23]: So the state's working on those regs right now.

1545
01:58:16,168 --> 01:58:21,510
[SPEAKER_23]: And what would be acceptable, basically, the draft, because the draft form that Ms.

1546
01:58:21,530 --> 01:58:26,371
[SPEAKER_23]: DeCarlo was just talking about included all of these other features of the look bill.

1547
01:58:27,111 --> 01:58:39,374
[SPEAKER_23]: And one of them was the requirements for educators to obtain, similar to the SEI endorsement, an endorsement, a bilingual endorsement that would allow them to teach in that native language.

1548
01:58:40,910 --> 01:58:43,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, what's the status of Title III right now?

1549
01:58:43,651 --> 01:58:45,371
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, obviously, everything's up in the air federal.

1550
01:58:45,391 --> 01:58:48,012
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have a sense of that?

1551
01:58:48,132 --> 01:58:49,653
[SPEAKER_23]: I was just at a meeting on Friday.

1552
01:58:49,673 --> 01:58:51,273
[SPEAKER_23]: Nobody gave good news, bad news.

1553
01:58:51,373 --> 01:58:54,975
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm hoping it's at least at the minimum status quo.

1554
01:58:57,676 --> 01:58:59,836
[SPEAKER_10]: So just one last point.

1555
01:59:00,256 --> 01:59:07,659
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we did a bilingual Haitian Creole program, every teacher that's in there now, we'd have to find a new home for them.

1556
01:59:08,148 --> 01:59:12,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'd have to make sure that, or at least they'd find a way to get certified in Haitian Creole.

1557
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:24,475
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, and that's the thing, to find the teachers who are, you know, and then to, you know, it's, that's, like, I'm excited if I can find an EL teacher who's certified in math.

1558
01:59:24,615 --> 01:59:25,875
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the uniform.

1559
01:59:26,876 --> 01:59:37,000
[SPEAKER_23]: So to find somebody who is certified in math who's also, you know, bilingual and, you know, Haitian Creole or English, you know, that's, that's going to be a tough, a tough one to find.

1560
01:59:39,567 --> 01:59:40,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

1561
01:59:40,888 --> 01:59:41,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your report.

1562
01:59:42,269 --> 01:59:48,573
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was very good to see how your first year went and all the initiatives that you put forth.

1563
01:59:48,694 --> 01:59:49,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for all of them.

1564
01:59:50,935 --> 01:59:54,698
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm seeing an increase in EL programs throughout the state.

1565
01:59:55,739 --> 02:00:00,902
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know you commented that we have 40 new students from the beginning of this year till now.

1566
02:00:01,202 --> 02:00:04,044
[SPEAKER_16]: How many students throughout our district are EL students?

1567
02:00:04,445 --> 02:00:06,306
[SPEAKER_23]: So the total number of ELs are 499.

1568
02:00:08,143 --> 02:00:13,307
[SPEAKER_16]: So what is that, 10, 11% district-wide, not just at the McGlynn, but?

1569
02:00:13,327 --> 02:00:14,829
[SPEAKER_23]: That's district-wide.

1570
02:00:14,849 --> 02:00:18,792
[SPEAKER_16]: District-wide, so 11% of our students, and rising yearly.

1571
02:00:19,653 --> 02:00:22,815
[SPEAKER_23]: The 11% that I mentioned earlier, that was just the McGlynn numbers.

1572
02:00:22,835 --> 02:00:24,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, and this almost matches it.

1573
02:00:24,617 --> 02:00:25,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Matches it.

1574
02:00:25,277 --> 02:00:28,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so it's indicative of the whole district.

1575
02:00:29,881 --> 02:00:36,086
[SPEAKER_16]: So with it, with the growth that we've seen in the last, what, three to five years,

1576
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:46,983
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we need to pre-plan for more EL programs and to have a short-term plan for EL and a long-term plan.

1577
02:00:47,063 --> 02:01:03,508
[SPEAKER_16]: So as the new superintendent comes forward, I'd love to see that and maybe the curriculum subcommittee to talk about this so we can start putting those, I said years ago that EL is gonna be bigger than special education as far as, or equal to it.

1578
02:01:03,921 --> 02:01:23,976
[SPEAKER_16]: as far as programming and some of the programming that you're talking about, the required PAC or DAC, whichever one you choose, and all of those things seem to be following in line of how the special education programs are run throughout the district and their requirements, at least I see that.

1579
02:01:25,911 --> 02:01:30,116
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm also wondering, are we in compliance with the federal government's policy on the

1580
02:01:42,353 --> 02:01:47,637
[SPEAKER_16]: per child per teacher ratios as far as state requirements?

1581
02:01:47,858 --> 02:02:00,568
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, because we're meeting, it's not a ratio between students and teachers, it's are we delivering service hours based on their access scores.

1582
02:02:01,068 --> 02:02:07,474
[SPEAKER_23]: And so one of the things that we did this year was I do a monthly census, maybe more like every six weeks,

1583
02:02:08,014 --> 02:02:17,898
[SPEAKER_23]: And it goes out to all of the Yale teachers, and they have their students, they have their access scores, they indicate how many periods they're seeing them for because there are exceptions.

1584
02:02:18,878 --> 02:02:31,503
[SPEAKER_23]: When we have duly identified students who are getting support from special education, there's just not enough hours in the day for some students to get all the services, and the department recognizes that.

1585
02:02:32,188 --> 02:02:37,855
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, as long as we're, you know, honoring the spirit of the required hours, we're in compliance.

1586
02:02:37,975 --> 02:02:39,336
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're in good shape there.

1587
02:02:39,837 --> 02:02:49,208
[SPEAKER_16]: And as far as our teachers that need EL training or certification for the retail.

1588
02:02:50,199 --> 02:02:51,380
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we on track with that?

1589
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:53,422
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we track that for teachers?

1590
02:02:53,522 --> 02:02:53,742
[SPEAKER_16]: We are.

1591
02:02:53,802 --> 02:03:05,170
[SPEAKER_23]: So the curriculum directors have all been managing that for their departments, so they know if they have a teacher who needs to get the endorsement, and they're dealing with that within their department level.

1592
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:09,033
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure the 15 required hours in EL has helped.

1593
02:03:10,956 --> 02:03:12,617
[SPEAKER_16]: with that, with re-licensure?

1594
02:03:13,017 --> 02:03:15,099
[SPEAKER_23]: With re-licensure, definitely.

1595
02:03:15,119 --> 02:03:23,185
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, anything to do with licensing, as I tell teachers, that's your agreement between you and the state of Massachusetts.

1596
02:03:23,285 --> 02:03:27,087
[SPEAKER_23]: We just have to make sure that you're credentialed to do what we're asking you to do.

1597
02:03:29,049 --> 02:03:37,995
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not going to make an official motion for you to meet with the curriculum subcommittee, but in September or October, maybe,

1598
02:03:38,507 --> 02:03:46,794
[SPEAKER_16]: we could regroup and possibly ask the chairperson to call a meeting and just have short-term and long-term goals with the new superintendent.

1599
02:03:47,174 --> 02:03:50,837
[SPEAKER_16]: She may have some different ideas, having been an instructional

1600
02:03:52,012 --> 02:03:57,437
[SPEAKER_16]: superintendent for 15 schools in EL is a big commitment there in Boston as well.

1601
02:03:57,617 --> 02:04:11,830
[SPEAKER_23]: So one of the things that we've talked about in the EL redesign committee is, you know, if the numbers continue to grow, you know, we would have to move the program over to the Andrews because then we would be repeating the issue that exists there now.

1602
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:15,273
[SPEAKER_23]: Right now, once we spread them between the two teams,

1603
02:04:16,569 --> 02:04:18,570
[SPEAKER_23]: It's now taking some pressure off.

1604
02:04:18,630 --> 02:04:24,392
[SPEAKER_23]: But as the numbers grow, even between the two teams, so we would need to look at the program with the Andrews.

1605
02:04:24,892 --> 02:04:30,194
[SPEAKER_23]: And so, you know, it would be one teacher this year, and then next year, you know, if we do it in increments.

1606
02:04:31,934 --> 02:04:42,178
[SPEAKER_23]: As the incoming superintendent proposed her upper school, lower middle school, upper middle school plan, that would alleviate a lot of these problems.

1607
02:04:42,702 --> 02:04:55,568
[SPEAKER_23]: And one of the things that the McGlynn teachers are excited about is, because there is a lot of change on the horizon, that whatever plan we create as the EL redesign team will work in almost any scenario.

1608
02:04:56,308 --> 02:04:58,549
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're very happy about that.

1609
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:07,514
[SPEAKER_16]: And my final question is, have you gotten any feedback from the McGlynn teachers about the change that's gonna take place next year?

1610
02:05:07,534 --> 02:05:09,975
[SPEAKER_16]: Have they been informed, any feedback?

1611
02:05:11,505 --> 02:05:13,507
[SPEAKER_16]: How are they, in general, feeling about it?

1612
02:05:13,547 --> 02:05:20,632
[SPEAKER_16]: They've had a lot of change through the year, and I just want to make sure that they're incorporated in the communication as well as decision-making.

1613
02:05:20,692 --> 02:05:31,080
[SPEAKER_23]: So the way I set up the team was, the email went out through Nick Tucci after he was appointed, asking for representatives from each grade-level team.

1614
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,242
[SPEAKER_23]: So a representative from the A team, the B team.

1615
02:05:33,955 --> 02:05:40,497
[SPEAKER_23]: for every grade level, special education, guidance, administration, EL, the UA teachers.

1616
02:05:40,697 --> 02:05:44,518
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's why it's such a big group, because everybody's involved.

1617
02:05:45,498 --> 02:05:52,360
[SPEAKER_23]: Their task between every meeting is to go back to their team, whether it's their grade level team or their department team, and share.

1618
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:57,121
[SPEAKER_23]: And we start every new session with getting feedback from the rest of the teachers.

1619
02:05:58,201 --> 02:06:00,242
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's the overall?

1620
02:06:01,187 --> 02:06:09,851
[SPEAKER_23]: They're excited about the change, and this has been coming for a while, and they're glad to be a part of it.

1621
02:06:10,551 --> 02:06:11,852
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't bring any of my posters.

1622
02:06:11,892 --> 02:06:13,633
[SPEAKER_23]: Like I said, we just did this today.

1623
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:16,154
[SPEAKER_23]: But they're glad the dialogue is happening.

1624
02:06:16,894 --> 02:06:18,595
[SPEAKER_23]: They're glad that they have a voice in it.

1625
02:06:20,056 --> 02:06:22,237
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're excited about the programs being built.

1626
02:06:22,257 --> 02:06:25,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being so inclusive with that situation.

1627
02:06:25,518 --> 02:06:27,279
[SPEAKER_16]: That's important for that community.

1628
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:32,401
[SPEAKER_16]: A great report, thank you, and I motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1629
02:06:32,941 --> 02:06:35,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to accept the report, seconded by Ms.

1630
02:06:35,541 --> 02:06:36,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustone.

1631
02:06:36,802 --> 02:06:37,542
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1632
02:06:37,562 --> 02:06:37,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1633
02:06:38,662 --> 02:06:39,242
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1634
02:06:39,282 --> 02:06:39,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1635
02:06:40,022 --> 02:06:40,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1636
02:06:40,642 --> 02:06:41,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1637
02:06:43,223 --> 02:06:48,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion for suspension of the rules to move negotiations and legal matters to the end of the agenda?

1638
02:06:48,484 --> 02:06:49,464
[SPEAKER_17]: So moved by Ms.

1639
02:06:49,544 --> 02:06:51,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1640
02:06:52,284 --> 02:06:52,905
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1641
02:06:52,925 --> 02:06:52,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1642
02:06:53,765 --> 02:06:54,485
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1643
02:06:54,665 --> 02:06:55,325
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1644
02:06:56,105 --> 02:07:00,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Old Business, Lesley University and Metro Public Schools Partnership Agreement.

1645
02:07:00,646 --> 02:07:01,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

1646
02:07:04,287 --> 02:07:06,668
[SPEAKER_20]: So last Thursday we had a committee of the whole.

1647
02:07:07,528 --> 02:07:20,971
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the conclusion of the committee of the whole, you voted 7-0 to approve the concept of the plan, but you wanted to understand procurement better and how we were able to do it under the rules so that we could move forward.

1648
02:07:21,651 --> 02:07:22,912
[SPEAKER_20]: Tonight I've handed you a

1649
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:27,870
[SPEAKER_20]: sheet, two sides, which goes over that.

1650
02:07:27,910 --> 02:07:43,360
[SPEAKER_20]: And we've had substantial discussion, Christine, myself, Mark Rumley, Howard Greenspan, Howard's here, going over these various things and also phone calls into the AG and the IG and all these things as to what we could or couldn't do, and also with Lesley College.

1651
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:48,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we have to move forward if we're going to get this thing done.

1652
02:07:49,524 --> 02:07:54,427
[SPEAKER_20]: But in order to do it, we have to deal with it a little bit differently than we originally intended.

1653
02:07:55,085 --> 02:07:57,826
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm gonna go over this a little bit as a partnership procurement plan.

1654
02:08:00,007 --> 02:08:14,431
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to develop an RFP, which is a request for proposals for the partnership that would include rental, renovation, and professional services between the Medford Public Schools and an area university, an area university, not necessarily any one.

1655
02:08:15,192 --> 02:08:22,414
[SPEAKER_20]: A request for proposals allows us to seek proposals from qualified vendors and to select the most appropriate respondents

1656
02:08:22,935 --> 02:08:25,958
[SPEAKER_20]: based on established criteria first and not price alone.

1657
02:08:26,598 --> 02:08:27,899
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a price issue initially.

1658
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:31,803
[SPEAKER_20]: This RFP cycle is a two-week posting process.

1659
02:08:31,843 --> 02:08:41,151
[SPEAKER_20]: That means once we generate the RFP, hopefully sometime this week with help, we would go out two weeks and put it out there and see who responds.

1660
02:08:42,052 --> 02:08:49,679
[SPEAKER_20]: The RFP would require the successful respondent to meet and agree to all the terms of the RFP specifications, everything we would put in.

1661
02:08:51,302 --> 02:08:59,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Funding for the project would be incorporated into the RFP, we would say what we're looking for, for negotiation between the successful respondent and the Medford Public Schools.

1662
02:09:00,769 --> 02:09:10,417
[SPEAKER_20]: The successful respondent would then be allowed to carry out the construction and renovation of the high school gymnasium facility with provisions for quality control.

1663
02:09:11,037 --> 02:09:16,381
[SPEAKER_20]: In other words, saying they would do it as opposed to we would do it, okay?

1664
02:09:17,262 --> 02:09:18,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Appropriate insurance coverage.

1665
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:23,462
[SPEAKER_20]: would be in place to cover any unforeseen issues, any liabilities that would be involved.

1666
02:09:24,343 --> 02:09:28,805
[SPEAKER_20]: The plan would allow for a successful respondent to move quickly towards implementation this summer.

1667
02:09:29,565 --> 02:09:36,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they would be able to do things in the private sector, and we would insist on prevailing wage and things of that type.

1668
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:43,472
[SPEAKER_20]: They would be able to move a lot faster than a public entity can move under these rules.

1669
02:09:44,818 --> 02:09:50,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Under the plan, Medford would reap all the benefits intended under the previous idea and still retain control.

1670
02:09:51,703 --> 02:10:00,029
[SPEAKER_20]: We believe it's an effective approach because it clearly spells out each expected item and it could be implemented without unnecessary delay.

1671
02:10:01,230 --> 02:10:03,812
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it was a good discussion that we had.

1672
02:10:04,112 --> 02:10:11,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Christine did a great job working in town with people, Mark and Howard back and forth covering the issues legally.

1673
02:10:12,422 --> 02:10:20,226
[SPEAKER_20]: And with help from, you know, legal in town, I think we've come up with a plan that allows us to go forward and to get this in place.

1674
02:10:21,727 --> 02:10:23,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Take any questions you have.

1675
02:10:23,108 --> 02:10:23,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Russo.

1676
02:10:24,229 --> 02:10:24,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1677
02:10:25,189 --> 02:10:36,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so, um, I did ask a question in the committee of the whole, which didn't seem relevant at the time because we were going to be doing the work ourselves, but can the RFP legally include that it must be union labor?

1678
02:10:37,316 --> 02:10:38,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.

1679
02:10:38,156 --> 02:10:39,057
[SPEAKER_17]: We put a prevailing wage.

1680
02:10:39,077 --> 02:10:39,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that,

1681
02:10:43,103 --> 02:10:43,963
[SPEAKER_20]: We put it in the RFP.

1682
02:10:44,043 --> 02:10:44,283
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1683
02:10:44,344 --> 02:10:44,724
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1684
02:10:44,744 --> 02:10:45,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

1685
02:10:45,324 --> 02:10:47,686
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything we put in there, the respondent has to accept.

1686
02:10:49,748 --> 02:10:51,129
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1687
02:10:51,469 --> 02:11:01,276
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if I talk to a union person, is that going to be the same thing?

1688
02:11:01,296 --> 02:11:02,397
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be like, oh, no big deal.

1689
02:11:03,151 --> 02:11:03,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Or.

1690
02:11:05,692 --> 02:11:10,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, one would think that if they're paying prevailing wage, there's no reason not to use.

1691
02:11:11,213 --> 02:11:11,673
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course.

1692
02:11:12,334 --> 02:11:12,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1693
02:11:12,674 --> 02:11:18,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I just like, you know, I feel like every week I drive by a giant construction site with people picketing because somebody wanted to get the cheapest wage.

1694
02:11:18,916 --> 02:11:20,356
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't go prevailing wage.

1695
02:11:20,916 --> 02:11:23,437
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just.

1696
02:11:24,877 --> 02:11:25,617
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be our goal.

1697
02:11:25,657 --> 02:11:27,318
[SPEAKER_20]: We've done all our projects that way.

1698
02:11:28,351 --> 02:11:31,152
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I did read in the emails that, you know, that like all these universities would

1699
02:11:43,376 --> 02:11:53,640
[SPEAKER_09]: They seem to think they have no money, but I just worry about cutting corners on the backs of people who are going to be doing the work for us.

1700
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:54,521
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to happen.

1701
02:11:54,541 --> 02:11:57,322
[SPEAKER_09]: We get to reap the benefits, which- Not going to happen.

1702
02:11:57,482 --> 02:11:58,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1703
02:11:58,782 --> 02:11:59,363
[SPEAKER_16]: That's important.

1704
02:12:01,063 --> 02:12:01,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1705
02:12:02,284 --> 02:12:02,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1706
02:12:02,824 --> 02:12:03,764
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a few questions.

1707
02:12:04,825 --> 02:12:10,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Bilson, why in number one, did you emphasize area university?

1708
02:12:11,672 --> 02:12:20,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, because in order for it to work, based on our concept of an interaction with an area university, we would want one in the area.

1709
02:12:20,156 --> 02:12:24,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if they weren't in the area, it would become very difficult to have the interaction that we want.

1710
02:12:25,319 --> 02:12:31,202
[SPEAKER_20]: It probably would not be attractive to a non-area university to want to rent one of our facilities.

1711
02:12:31,802 --> 02:12:35,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you define how far in the area you're talking?

1712
02:12:36,024 --> 02:12:38,366
[SPEAKER_16]: So that way, we're all on the same page.

1713
02:12:38,406 --> 02:12:40,927
[SPEAKER_20]: I would say you've got to have a radius of, you know,

1714
02:12:41,733 --> 02:12:42,373
[SPEAKER_20]: So many miles.

1715
02:12:43,714 --> 02:12:46,555
[SPEAKER_20]: We could come up with that, but I wouldn't expect it.

1716
02:12:46,595 --> 02:12:48,135
[SPEAKER_17]: We could specify.

1717
02:12:48,155 --> 02:12:48,436
[SPEAKER_17]: 20 miles.

1718
02:12:49,036 --> 02:12:49,776
[SPEAKER_20]: We could specify.

1719
02:12:51,057 --> 02:12:58,239
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd just like to be on the same page with this, because interpretation can be different for different people.

1720
02:12:58,259 --> 02:12:59,440
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't see us.

1721
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:07,683
[SPEAKER_20]: The benefit to us is to have a university that's accessible to our teachers, accessible to our students, accessible to programs and the like.

1722
02:13:09,782 --> 02:13:22,287
[SPEAKER_16]: So my next question is in section four, why did it change from us being responsible for the renovations and oversight of the renovations to now the bid?

1723
02:13:22,367 --> 02:13:32,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they can go out and do it and attract a vendor without going through multiple layers of bidding and the like.

1724
02:13:33,011 --> 02:13:36,372
[SPEAKER_20]: And since the money will be the same, I mean, it's up to them.

1725
02:13:36,392 --> 02:13:37,673
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, we might even do better.

1726
02:13:38,548 --> 02:13:44,872
[SPEAKER_20]: because essentially they can work on it and we can work on the numbers with them.

1727
02:13:46,653 --> 02:13:48,014
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

1728
02:13:48,074 --> 02:13:48,955
[SPEAKER_20]: That's on the RFP.

1729
02:13:49,415 --> 02:13:50,115
[SPEAKER_20]: That's in the RFP.

1730
02:13:50,756 --> 02:13:50,936
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1731
02:13:50,956 --> 02:13:56,039
[SPEAKER_16]: And my last question is for our attorney that's in the audience tonight.

1732
02:13:56,439 --> 02:14:04,925
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wondering if this is different in any way than any other RFP that we usually do.

1733
02:14:06,016 --> 02:14:09,498
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you mentioned that you went into town and talked to the people there.

1734
02:14:09,618 --> 02:14:13,360
[SPEAKER_20]: We've done RFPs before, and RFP is a standard operation.

1735
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:15,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it the time frame that's shorter?

1736
02:14:15,481 --> 02:14:19,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you made it seem like it was a little bit different than the usual.

1737
02:14:19,282 --> 02:14:20,803
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it's a little bit different than we started out.

1738
02:14:21,623 --> 02:14:22,344
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not different.

1739
02:14:22,384 --> 02:14:27,746
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, RFPs are generally a very interesting tool, because you're not stuck strictly on price.

1740
02:14:27,786 --> 02:14:31,908
[SPEAKER_20]: You're able to look at criteria, and you're able to look at who can provide what.

1741
02:14:32,269 --> 02:14:35,250
[SPEAKER_20]: And since this is a lot of qualitative interaction that's involved,

1742
02:14:35,815 --> 02:14:39,836
[SPEAKER_20]: You want to be able to look at the criteria rather than just strictly a dollar factor.

1743
02:14:40,516 --> 02:14:41,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1744
02:14:41,336 --> 02:14:46,577
[SPEAKER_16]: And my last question is, is two weeks a typical time frame for an RFP to be posting?

1745
02:14:46,657 --> 02:14:47,197
[SPEAKER_20]: For posting.

1746
02:14:47,497 --> 02:14:47,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1747
02:14:47,777 --> 02:14:50,858
[SPEAKER_20]: It may take a little bit more time to actually construct the RFP.

1748
02:14:50,878 --> 02:14:52,898
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to go over very carefully.

1749
02:14:52,918 --> 02:14:54,338
[SPEAKER_20]: But once it's out, it's two weeks.

1750
02:14:54,618 --> 02:14:54,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1751
02:14:55,139 --> 02:14:56,979
[SPEAKER_16]: And do we advertise this?

1752
02:14:57,139 --> 02:14:57,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah.

1753
02:14:57,859 --> 02:15:02,580
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to be each week in the newspaper, in a prominent newspaper.

1754
02:15:03,247 --> 02:15:07,070
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we telling of any of our neighbor communities?

1755
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:11,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we reaching out and saying, hey, we're looking for a partnership and this is what we're looking for?

1756
02:15:11,934 --> 02:15:14,616
[SPEAKER_20]: If someone shows up that we haven't thought of, that's interesting.

1757
02:15:14,636 --> 02:15:16,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Publicly post it and see what comes back.

1758
02:15:17,819 --> 02:15:18,760
[SPEAKER_20]: We may get surprised.

1759
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:19,720
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

1760
02:15:24,104 --> 02:15:24,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1761
02:15:25,325 --> 02:15:26,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just two questions.

1762
02:15:27,166 --> 02:15:31,350
[SPEAKER_10]: The first is on subsection four, where you talk about provisions for quality control.

1763
02:15:32,258 --> 02:15:37,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I, I just, I really do support the idea of doing partnership programs with local universities.

1764
02:15:38,021 --> 02:15:40,203
[SPEAKER_10]: I really commend the administration for working on this.

1765
02:15:40,283 --> 02:15:43,045
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you guys have been cooking this up since like December.

1766
02:15:43,285 --> 02:15:47,327
[SPEAKER_10]: But could you just outline what are the provisions for quality control?

1767
02:15:47,347 --> 02:15:52,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we're allowing them to hire the contractors, how do we really know that they won't shaft us?

1768
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:54,071
[SPEAKER_20]: So let's walk through it a little bit.

1769
02:15:54,331 --> 02:15:54,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1770
02:15:54,551 --> 02:15:54,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1771
02:15:55,412 --> 02:16:00,555
[SPEAKER_20]: If an entity wants to use the item, they certainly want to play on something that's quality.

1772
02:16:01,338 --> 02:16:05,143
[SPEAKER_20]: They certainly don't want to play on something that's less than quality if they can help it, okay?

1773
02:16:05,583 --> 02:16:12,352
[SPEAKER_20]: Two, they have to meet NCAA standards, okay, which will immediately ensure a certain level of quality.

1774
02:16:12,712 --> 02:16:13,934
[SPEAKER_20]: And three, we'll have a clerk of the works.

1775
02:16:14,535 --> 02:16:16,617
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll make sure that they follow certain specifications.

1776
02:16:18,347 --> 02:16:31,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And sort of just to branch off Paul's concern, which is my concern as well, I just want to understand, so prevailing wages, how do we know that let's say they find some company, they say, oh, they're prevailing wages, don't worry about it.

1777
02:16:31,609 --> 02:16:34,790
[SPEAKER_17]: They submit reports, weekly payroll reports.

1778
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:36,830
[SPEAKER_10]: All that will be verified and we'll make sure.

1779
02:16:36,970 --> 02:16:37,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1780
02:16:37,350 --> 02:16:37,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1781
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:39,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, I just really appreciate all the work you're doing.

1782
02:16:39,231 --> 02:16:41,151
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, it's good that you're asking because I want you to understand.

1783
02:16:41,191 --> 02:16:43,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.

1784
02:16:43,391 --> 02:16:44,792
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no disasters.

1785
02:16:44,852 --> 02:16:45,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1786
02:16:47,797 --> 02:16:53,841
[SPEAKER_03]: So once we get responses to the RFP, let's say that we're surprised, because all of a sudden, we've got three.

1787
02:16:54,161 --> 02:16:58,324
[SPEAKER_03]: One's from Salem State, one's from Bunker Hill, and one's from Leslie.

1788
02:16:58,905 --> 02:17:02,867
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, do we get to sit down and look at them and decide which is the best?

1789
02:17:02,887 --> 02:17:03,528
[SPEAKER_20]: We would look at it.

1790
02:17:03,548 --> 02:17:04,949
[SPEAKER_20]: We would look at it.

1791
02:17:05,449 --> 02:17:13,554
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, because it's an RFP, we have a lot of factors with qualitative discretion in it.

1792
02:17:13,775 --> 02:17:14,635
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not just price.

1793
02:17:17,153 --> 02:17:21,096
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have a university that already has physical facilities, they're not coming to us for another one.

1794
02:17:22,538 --> 02:17:30,464
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have a university that doesn't provide certain programs in areas that we're interested in, they're not meeting another criteria.

1795
02:17:31,825 --> 02:17:36,049
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could, you establish criteria and then they're graded.

1796
02:17:36,970 --> 02:17:43,095
[SPEAKER_17]: So you might see, contains educational, it's a teaching college, and then you'd say, meets it as a five.

1797
02:17:44,242 --> 02:17:45,442
[SPEAKER_17]: has a couple of four.

1798
02:17:45,642 --> 02:17:47,483
[SPEAKER_17]: So you put everything into pockets.

1799
02:17:48,083 --> 02:17:53,844
[SPEAKER_17]: And so you're consistently applying your same ratings to each, whoever replies to the RFP.

1800
02:17:53,884 --> 02:17:57,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you can't just say, I give you a five, we want you.

1801
02:17:57,685 --> 02:18:01,226
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you need to document why you're giving them a five versus a four.

1802
02:18:02,767 --> 02:18:10,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight you'd like a motion to go forward with putting together an RFP and putting it out to bid.

1803
02:18:10,788 --> 02:18:11,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1804
02:18:11,329 --> 02:18:12,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd make a motion that we

1805
02:18:13,408 --> 02:18:17,151
[SPEAKER_03]: go forward with creating the RFP and then putting it out to bid.

1806
02:18:17,972 --> 02:18:19,313
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor.

1807
02:18:19,333 --> 02:18:27,440
[SPEAKER_17]: It would probably be circulated to you, but it wouldn't come back for an approval.

1808
02:18:29,462 --> 02:18:31,063
[SPEAKER_17]: So motion for approval, is there a second?

1809
02:18:31,264 --> 02:18:31,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo?

1810
02:18:32,365 --> 02:18:33,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

1811
02:18:33,365 --> 02:18:33,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Krebs.

1812
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:43,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1813
02:18:44,281 --> 02:18:46,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1814
02:18:46,483 --> 02:18:47,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1815
02:18:47,303 --> 02:18:47,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1816
02:18:48,004 --> 02:18:48,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1817
02:18:50,085 --> 02:18:54,389
[SPEAKER_17]: The second item under old business is the middle school selection decisions.

1818
02:18:55,590 --> 02:18:55,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1819
02:18:55,850 --> 02:18:56,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Nelson.

1820
02:18:58,932 --> 02:18:59,513
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

1821
02:18:59,533 --> 02:19:03,195
[SPEAKER_25]: The update from two weeks ago, we left off

1822
02:19:05,133 --> 02:19:06,434
[SPEAKER_25]: We gave you numbers.

1823
02:19:06,934 --> 02:19:17,099
[SPEAKER_25]: We saw that there was a large imbalance with most, a lot of students, more students going to the Andrews for grade six than the McGlynn.

1824
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:33,508
[SPEAKER_25]: That was on our meeting May 7th, and it was decided by the committee that we would try, before we go to the partial lottery, we would try one more time to convince people to make the choice and to have more

1825
02:19:34,012 --> 02:19:35,472
[SPEAKER_25]: students go over to the McGlynn.

1826
02:19:35,892 --> 02:19:44,734
[SPEAKER_25]: The very next day, Mrs. Caldwell and I met with the principals and we drafted a letter that you have attached to the cover sheet.

1827
02:19:45,314 --> 02:20:01,358
[SPEAKER_25]: And the letter basically said to parents and guardians that if they would voluntarily make their, and the letter was just to those parents who had selected the Inders, that if they would make the change to the McGlynn, we would ensure that their children could be with

1828
02:20:02,029 --> 02:20:02,609
[SPEAKER_25]: They're friends.

1829
02:20:02,889 --> 02:20:11,294
[SPEAKER_25]: And so you can see from the sign-up sheet that the list would ask for multiple parents to sign on.

1830
02:20:12,174 --> 02:20:22,619
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, a partial lottery, as we explained, means that you run the risk that your child may not have his or her closest friend with them or their second closest friend.

1831
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:29,483
[SPEAKER_25]: So we were hoping to convince parents that by keeping your children together, this would be something that they would want to do.

1832
02:20:30,362 --> 02:20:32,523
[SPEAKER_25]: We got some movement on this, but not enough.

1833
02:20:33,583 --> 02:20:52,390
[SPEAKER_25]: Currently, if we look at the numbers, we get five students that originally selected the Andrews from the McGlynn, opted to go back to the McGlynn, and then just, this doesn't reflect actually, because this happened today, we have one additional student at the Columbus who opted to change from the Andrews to the McGlynn.

1834
02:20:52,730 --> 02:20:58,212
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have a movement of six students, which gives us our current latest numbers,

1835
02:21:01,837 --> 02:21:06,958
[SPEAKER_25]: The Andrews is 169 and the McGlynn is 124.

1836
02:21:08,618 --> 02:21:10,279
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have an imbalance.

1837
02:21:10,339 --> 02:21:15,820
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to really move students, about 20 students in the other direction.

1838
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:27,382
[SPEAKER_25]: If you look at the numbers, you can see that all of the elementary schools except the Brooks have opted for at least 20 students to go to the McGlynn.

1839
02:21:28,082 --> 02:21:30,963
[SPEAKER_25]: So again, we're looking to take our next step

1840
02:21:32,906 --> 02:21:35,907
[SPEAKER_25]: We would like to have seen more people voluntarily.

1841
02:21:35,927 --> 02:21:41,529
[SPEAKER_25]: It would just be another 15, 20 people to do that, but so far, they haven't come forward.

1842
02:21:41,549 --> 02:21:45,350
[SPEAKER_25]: We did have a deadline last week, which is a little bit flexible.

1843
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:51,072
[SPEAKER_25]: Some parents emailed me, said they got the letters late for whatever reason, and we said, of course, you can take more time.

1844
02:21:51,452 --> 02:21:58,114
[SPEAKER_25]: That was our goal, to have people move voluntarily, but it's not happening, and I think it's time to take the next step.

1845
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:02,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

1846
02:22:03,001 --> 02:22:03,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Nelson, for your work.

1847
02:22:05,362 --> 02:22:08,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Two things I want to say.

1848
02:22:08,243 --> 02:22:15,166
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, can we make sure that the five students that did voluntarily switch are all placed in the same block if there's no major schedule?

1849
02:22:15,206 --> 02:22:15,747
[SPEAKER_09]: We did.

1850
02:22:15,787 --> 02:22:17,247
[SPEAKER_25]: The parents asked for that.

1851
02:22:17,988 --> 02:22:23,150
[SPEAKER_25]: We went to Mr. Tucci, and we asked that they be on the same team, and he ensured that could be done.

1852
02:22:23,430 --> 02:22:23,791
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1853
02:22:24,151 --> 02:22:28,173
[SPEAKER_09]: And second, you know,

1854
02:22:29,115 --> 02:22:35,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been running the numbers endlessly, and I just wanna make sure that when we do the, I've decided to no longer use the word lottery.

1855
02:22:36,418 --> 02:22:37,419
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know what a lottery is.

1856
02:22:37,459 --> 02:22:42,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We either win or we lose, and I'm going to continue to move forward that both schools are equally good.

1857
02:22:43,722 --> 02:22:48,204
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm calling everything randomization placement or something along those lines.

1858
02:22:48,344 --> 02:22:58,469
[SPEAKER_09]: But looking at the numbers and making sure that we are selecting the students that will be randomized into the McGlynn,

1859
02:22:59,902 --> 02:23:06,785
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's, as you mentioned, Columbus, because of this additional student, needs to send zero more students over.

1860
02:23:08,346 --> 02:23:26,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I'm seeing that if we're gonna send 20, then we have to send 17 from the Brooks and three from the Roberts, and I just wanna make sure that we are not taking all the students from those schools and then just randomizing them all, in that, in fact, proportionally,

1861
02:23:27,937 --> 02:23:33,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberts will be sending 17 students that they do not select that school, and three students from the Roberts.

1862
02:23:35,642 --> 02:23:38,484
[SPEAKER_09]: But we can work out the details of how that will actually happen.

1863
02:23:38,504 --> 02:23:43,127
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, as you look at the numbers, I mean, this could be simplified somewhat.

1864
02:23:44,188 --> 02:23:51,193
[SPEAKER_25]: Because each three of the four elementary schools are sending at least 20 students to the McGlynn.

1865
02:23:51,920 --> 02:24:01,885
[SPEAKER_25]: The only school that is not, and again, those six students that are placed at the Brooks are EL students, I'm sorry, placed at the McGlynn from the Brooks are EL, so that's a given.

1866
02:24:02,786 --> 02:24:10,090
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's the only big discrepancy that you see as you look at the numbers here, but it's how the committee wants to proceed with that.

1867
02:24:10,450 --> 02:24:13,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I just follow up on the report you gave us two weeks ago from the Brooks?

1868
02:24:14,012 --> 02:24:16,693
[SPEAKER_17]: You said six no requests, two ELLs.

1869
02:24:17,274 --> 02:24:19,315
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I guess that was that, yeah.

1870
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:25,341
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a lot of sheets here.

1871
02:24:25,381 --> 02:24:26,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto is next.

1872
02:24:27,061 --> 02:24:27,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have a question.

1873
02:24:28,201 --> 02:24:28,761
OK.

1874
02:24:29,622 --> 02:24:29,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1875
02:24:29,782 --> 02:24:30,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Kloot.

1876
02:24:30,642 --> 02:24:33,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to ask a question in a different way.

1877
02:24:33,862 --> 02:24:38,983
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, we've got 169 kids at the Andrews.

1878
02:24:40,063 --> 02:24:43,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have two teams.

1879
02:24:43,824 --> 02:24:45,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Each team is made up of four classes.

1880
02:24:47,205 --> 02:24:48,785
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do the math, that means

1881
02:24:49,545 --> 02:24:54,289
[SPEAKER_03]: that there would be 21 kids in each of those classes, right?

1882
02:24:54,369 --> 02:24:55,430
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't say that for sure.

1883
02:24:55,450 --> 02:25:00,974
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd have to, you know, have the principal here because, again, are you talking about core academic classes?

1884
02:25:01,014 --> 02:25:04,657
[SPEAKER_25]: And then sometimes we have the special education students that filter in.

1885
02:25:04,677 --> 02:25:07,799
[SPEAKER_25]: So class size being 21, I cannot say that's a given.

1886
02:25:07,839 --> 02:25:10,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was talking about core academic classes.

1887
02:25:10,201 --> 02:25:12,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the two teams, if you would, it means there's

1888
02:25:12,954 --> 02:25:14,716
[SPEAKER_03]: there would be 85 on each team.

1889
02:25:15,336 --> 02:25:27,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, then in the corresponding school, there would be 15 kids in a class if you divide the number by eight, which obviously is great.

1890
02:25:27,828 --> 02:25:34,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we've been very proud of our class size numbers, and frankly, 21 at middle school is not bad.

1891
02:25:38,732 --> 02:25:45,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly for the McGlynn, where we have the EL and newcomers and whatever, it's an advantage to be there because it's smaller class size.

1892
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:49,718
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look at the numbers, 21 isn't awful.

1893
02:25:49,898 --> 02:25:53,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got many elementary kids classrooms where there might be 21.

1894
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:59,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just looking at it in a different way and wondering and saying this is causing us a great deal of pain.

1895
02:25:59,242 --> 02:26:01,424
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand how much pain this causes parents.

1896
02:26:03,184 --> 02:26:08,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know in terms of the inequity, in terms of our teaching staff, there may be teachers at the

1897
02:26:11,894 --> 02:26:16,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrews who feel unfair, but they're still very much within contractual limits.

1898
02:26:17,679 --> 02:26:19,500
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it impacts the exploratories.

1899
02:26:20,541 --> 02:26:26,165
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, you know, when you have these kids now in the exploratories, they're larger groups mixed together.

1900
02:26:26,326 --> 02:26:29,188
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's, I think, is what the issue is.

1901
02:26:29,288 --> 02:26:35,252
[SPEAKER_25]: Because yes, the teams were designed to take 100 kids per team.

1902
02:26:35,833 --> 02:26:38,495
[SPEAKER_25]: But it has to do with the exploratories and how that factors in.

1903
02:26:39,830 --> 02:26:45,954
[SPEAKER_25]: The other thing with the Andrews you want to keep in mind is that we also have a pretty big imbalance in grade seven.

1904
02:26:46,354 --> 02:26:52,518
[SPEAKER_25]: So in other words, it's far more kids if we have a large imbalance entering grade six, we have it in grade seven.

1905
02:26:52,958 --> 02:26:56,220
[SPEAKER_25]: Eight is okay, but we have several more students.

1906
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:59,782
[SPEAKER_25]: We'd have about 60 or 70 more students in that school.

1907
02:27:01,202 --> 02:27:06,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, history has told us that there is a swing, that, I mean, that's, when we looked at

1908
02:27:08,686 --> 02:27:11,908
[SPEAKER_03]: at the projections over all the years, it was a clear swing.

1909
02:27:11,948 --> 02:27:14,509
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it balanced out amazingly so in the end.

1910
02:27:14,529 --> 02:27:15,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1911
02:27:17,870 --> 02:27:19,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it a point of information?

1912
02:27:19,571 --> 02:27:21,512
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a clarification.

1913
02:27:21,532 --> 02:27:35,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to ask, have you made any assumption of any groups of students coming into the classroom that may increase the numbers of changes in a way that might be this 21 assumption?

1914
02:27:36,518 --> 02:27:36,958
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be.

1915
02:27:38,596 --> 02:27:38,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1916
02:27:39,477 --> 02:27:40,798
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was looking at her face.

1917
02:27:41,779 --> 02:27:42,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1918
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:42,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1919
02:27:43,321 --> 02:27:53,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to point out that if we spent a lot of time trying to make sure that the special education population of students are evenly distributed between the two buildings.

1920
02:27:53,832 --> 02:27:57,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of that work has already, you know, been taking place.

1921
02:27:58,722 --> 02:28:13,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there is a larger number of students who are not eligible for special education and not ELL students going to one building over the other, it has the effect of elevating the percentage of students who are high needs and require direct services in that same building.

1922
02:28:14,689 --> 02:28:26,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, a general education classroom that may have special education students and full inclusion programs, as well as ELL students and full inclusion programs

1923
02:28:26,527 --> 02:28:32,169
[SPEAKER_04]: the class, we really risk having the class being mostly students who are EL and who are special ed.

1924
02:28:33,050 --> 02:28:41,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just a consideration when we look at having unequal enrollments at both schools.

1925
02:28:41,533 --> 02:28:54,559
[SPEAKER_04]: The other factor is that if we have openings in one school over the other school, as new students move into the district, they tend to be students who are highly mobile, and a lot of those students end up being special education students,

1926
02:28:55,701 --> 02:28:59,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Yale students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

1927
02:29:00,325 --> 02:29:03,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, all of these students come to a school with significant needs.

1928
02:29:03,967 --> 02:29:07,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just a factor to consider when we're talking about enrollment numbers.

1929
02:29:08,650 --> 02:29:10,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry for interrupting.

1930
02:29:10,352 --> 02:29:10,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1931
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:13,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I do, I understand that.

1932
02:29:14,214 --> 02:29:23,341
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the difference is if we split them evenly, then our class size is 19 in each versus 21.

1933
02:29:27,243 --> 02:29:29,725
[SPEAKER_03]: So just throwing it out there, because I looked at it differently.

1934
02:29:32,707 --> 02:29:36,549
[SPEAKER_25]: There are a lot of issues, and Kathy, I think, has identified one very important.

1935
02:29:36,609 --> 02:29:45,795
[SPEAKER_25]: As we have inclusion, if you have many more SPED students and EL than regular students, then the inclusion is not really what it should be.

1936
02:29:46,596 --> 02:29:54,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of the split that currently is in place, are there...

1937
02:29:57,870 --> 02:30:03,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the special education population equally recognized between the two schools?

1938
02:30:03,856 --> 02:30:17,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we went through and we put all the students who need special programs in the proper schools, but then they balanced out the students who need special education services among the two different groups.

1939
02:30:17,428 --> 02:30:17,669
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1940
02:30:19,310 --> 02:30:19,590
[SPEAKER_25]: Darn.

1941
02:30:20,411 --> 02:30:21,372
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

1942
02:30:21,412 --> 02:30:22,353
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that first.

1943
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:24,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't help but trust you.

1944
02:30:24,721 --> 02:30:25,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris.

1945
02:30:26,001 --> 02:30:26,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

1946
02:30:27,182 --> 02:30:34,728
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have a couple of questions, because I've been just looking at this all weekend and just reaching out to some people.

1947
02:30:34,848 --> 02:30:41,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just, is it fair to do a partial lottery?

1948
02:30:42,313 --> 02:30:43,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do something like that?

1949
02:30:43,514 --> 02:30:47,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it just seemed very unfair, where we're just going to pull the names,

1950
02:30:49,873 --> 02:30:50,834
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we gonna do that?

1951
02:30:50,954 --> 02:30:52,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm confused about that.

1952
02:30:53,076 --> 02:31:08,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a partial lottery, we're gonna put all the names into a lottery system and it's gonna kick out, so every student that applied to the Andrews, it's going to kick out a report and put them in one school or the other?

1953
02:31:08,330 --> 02:31:10,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Has this ever been done before?

1954
02:31:10,312 --> 02:31:13,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

1955
02:31:13,955 --> 02:31:15,056
[SPEAKER_20]: So let's answer it this way.

1956
02:31:15,997 --> 02:31:20,058
[SPEAKER_20]: You just heard Kathy Medaglio tell you that they've balanced special ed students.

1957
02:31:20,078 --> 02:31:24,839
[SPEAKER_20]: You heard Paul Teixeira tell you that they've also allocated EL students.

1958
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:31,001
[SPEAKER_20]: Those students can't go into the partial lottery because they've already been balanced, okay?

1959
02:31:31,341 --> 02:31:34,402
[SPEAKER_20]: So what's left are the students who we'll call typically developing.

1960
02:31:35,102 --> 02:31:42,404
[SPEAKER_20]: Students who have, you know, just basically doing their thing and don't have a designation as either EL or special ed.

1961
02:31:43,418 --> 02:31:44,518
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not part of that balance.

1962
02:31:45,179 --> 02:31:47,199
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, you can look at it in different ways.

1963
02:31:47,579 --> 02:31:54,622
[SPEAKER_20]: You can say that three of the schools have done some of their job, and they've sent some people to the school, and one school didn't.

1964
02:31:55,662 --> 02:31:57,943
[SPEAKER_20]: That's partial lottery going to the school that didn't.

1965
02:31:58,723 --> 02:32:07,506
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise, you encourage people, perhaps, to never send anybody, figuring, well, their chances are better if they don't send anybody.

1966
02:32:08,887 --> 02:32:12,268
[SPEAKER_20]: On the other hand, you can say that you have a school that

1967
02:32:12,652 --> 02:32:17,156
[SPEAKER_20]: that's a natural feeder into the McGlynn Elementary.

1968
02:32:17,196 --> 02:32:21,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe you could take the 10, 15 kids that are still there and say, well, at least they're still in the same building.

1969
02:32:22,079 --> 02:32:22,840
[SPEAKER_20]: They know the building.

1970
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,341
[SPEAKER_20]: That's another way of looking at it.

1971
02:32:25,282 --> 02:32:29,445
[SPEAKER_20]: A third way to do it would be to take all three of them, put them in the pot, and pull them out.

1972
02:32:30,046 --> 02:32:33,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever you do, someone is probably not going to be happy.

1973
02:32:34,169 --> 02:32:35,450
[SPEAKER_20]: During the course of the year,

1974
02:32:36,891 --> 02:32:45,875
[SPEAKER_20]: We have heard repeatedly from you about some people that wanted to move from one school to the other, and because they had all kinds of issues with that.

1975
02:32:45,895 --> 02:32:48,336
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, you know, okay, I'm not going to argue that point.

1976
02:32:48,376 --> 02:32:49,556
[SPEAKER_20]: They had all kinds of issues with it.

1977
02:32:50,116 --> 02:32:50,917
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's incessant.

1978
02:32:51,677 --> 02:32:56,579
[SPEAKER_20]: So somebody who maybe doesn't get what they want is not going to be happy.

1979
02:32:57,299 --> 02:33:05,763
[SPEAKER_20]: The idea that we could move some people in cohorts was a good one, because they go with their friends, because that's one of the biggest reasons why

1980
02:33:06,227 --> 02:33:08,388
[SPEAKER_20]: people go to one school or the other and want to be with their friends.

1981
02:33:09,988 --> 02:33:12,730
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, that's another way of looking at the lottery.

1982
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:16,931
[SPEAKER_20]: If you move the rest of the McGlynn over, they're all with their friends.

1983
02:33:18,792 --> 02:33:28,136
[SPEAKER_20]: If you, in fact, go with some of the other places, you've got to take a significant number of people from one school in order so they have friends.

1984
02:33:28,176 --> 02:33:31,437
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you put all three into the pot, there's a chance that

1985
02:33:32,397 --> 02:33:42,823
[SPEAKER_20]: and you're looking only for 15 kids, there's a chance that the school that doesn't send them might only have three friends, might only have two kids that anyone knows because the numbers could skew back to the other people.

1986
02:33:43,383 --> 02:33:47,465
[SPEAKER_20]: So no matter what you do, there's going to be a tradeoff someplace.

1987
02:33:47,485 --> 02:33:49,406
[SPEAKER_20]: There's going to be a tradeoff someplace.

1988
02:33:49,887 --> 02:33:51,167
[SPEAKER_20]: So we just got to decide.

1989
02:33:51,788 --> 02:33:53,369
[SPEAKER_20]: We just got to decide what's going to work.

1990
02:33:54,009 --> 02:33:55,370
[SPEAKER_20]: They're both good schools.

1991
02:33:56,090 --> 02:33:57,791
[SPEAKER_20]: They both have the same curriculum.

1992
02:33:58,551 --> 02:34:01,433
[SPEAKER_20]: They both have people that will give them leadership.

1993
02:34:02,275 --> 02:34:09,318
[SPEAKER_20]: It's up to us as a school system to work hard to rebuild some of the thinking and work at it.

1994
02:34:10,299 --> 02:34:12,300
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're gonna make a decision because we gotta get on with it.

1995
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:20,944
[SPEAKER_20]: Because people are scheduling, there's resources that have to be allocated, we're working on a budget, and we gotta know what we're doing.

1996
02:34:21,024 --> 02:34:22,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had one more question.

1997
02:34:22,824 --> 02:34:27,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the sibling rule, will that be affected?

1998
02:34:27,306 --> 02:34:30,628
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody had a sibling or has a sibling,

1999
02:34:31,137 --> 02:34:37,539
[SPEAKER_01]: at one of the schools, will those people be put into the partial lottery?

2000
02:34:38,119 --> 02:34:39,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there like a time period?

2001
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:50,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody had a sibling two to three years ago, but that sibling moved up to high school, is that still considered a sibling that went to the handouts?

2002
02:34:50,362 --> 02:34:50,522
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

2003
02:34:50,642 --> 02:34:50,923
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

2004
02:34:50,943 --> 02:34:50,983
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

2005
02:34:51,003 --> 02:34:52,243
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be in the school.

2006
02:34:52,263 --> 02:34:53,243
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stretching it.

2007
02:34:53,303 --> 02:34:54,023
[SPEAKER_17]: In the school, OK.

2008
02:34:54,043 --> 02:34:56,504
[SPEAKER_20]: That's stretching it.

2009
02:34:57,664 --> 02:34:59,605
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we've taken care of siblings at this point, haven't we?

2010
02:34:59,796 --> 02:35:04,058
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, we want to make sure that if we went with the partial Lottery to One School that we accounted for that.

2011
02:35:04,078 --> 02:35:06,479
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we took a good eye to look at siblings.

2012
02:35:06,859 --> 02:35:10,981
[SPEAKER_20]: And plus, there's going to be a few new people coming in, you know, between now and the end of the year, and a few people leaving.

2013
02:35:11,001 --> 02:35:11,721
[SPEAKER_20]: That's going to happen too.

2014
02:35:11,741 --> 02:35:13,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2015
02:35:15,583 --> 02:35:16,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

2016
02:35:16,763 --> 02:35:17,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2017
02:35:18,524 --> 02:35:22,046
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know the administration is working very hard to deal with this problem.

2018
02:35:22,106 --> 02:35:25,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to funnel Cassandra, but this is a very frustrating report to me.

2019
02:35:26,033 --> 02:35:43,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all kind of hoped it would go away, but here we are now at the last minute with no options of really solving it other than take them all from Brooks, which means that 33% of one out of every three kids that applied to go to the Andrews might get sent to the McGlynn.

2020
02:35:43,661 --> 02:35:45,402
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it means, one out of every three.

2021
02:35:45,622 --> 02:35:53,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Or we take 11% out of the general population and we say to the 16 kids that go to McGlynn Elementary that they're just

2022
02:35:54,440 --> 02:36:02,826
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, even though that they want to go to Andrews, you know, they went to the McGlynn, they kind of wanted to do something new, you know, we're saying you also have to handle that.

2023
02:36:02,866 --> 02:36:04,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a very frustrating report to me.

2024
02:36:05,407 --> 02:36:15,474
[SPEAKER_10]: What's most frustrating about this whole point is sort of this false choice that's being laid out in front of us that, oh, you can choose, but they're equal.

2025
02:36:16,095 --> 02:36:17,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, then why are you choosing, right?

2026
02:36:18,296 --> 02:36:21,178
[SPEAKER_10]: If these schools are equivalent, they're truly equivalent,

2027
02:36:22,065 --> 02:36:23,306
[SPEAKER_10]: And then why choose?

2028
02:36:23,606 --> 02:36:31,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we have more room for ELL students at one school, I understand that, but it's just everyone's randomly drawn.

2029
02:36:32,133 --> 02:36:33,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Or there's a reason to choose one school.

2030
02:36:34,295 --> 02:36:45,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe having, I love the idea of having a Haitian Creole magnet school in Medford, make us unique in Massachusetts, but that's a huge investment of time and energy.

2031
02:36:45,204 --> 02:36:46,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we could do a math magnet.

2032
02:36:46,905 --> 02:36:49,267
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be easier to draw our STEM magnet.

2033
02:36:49,976 --> 02:36:51,017
[SPEAKER_10]: might be easier to create.

2034
02:36:51,117 --> 02:36:54,939
[SPEAKER_10]: One school has more of a STEM focus, another school has more of a liberal arts focus.

2035
02:36:55,599 --> 02:37:03,263
[SPEAKER_10]: These are choices that we could have made, and now here we are at the 11th hour, and those choices are not in front of us anymore.

2036
02:37:03,383 --> 02:37:06,565
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we've talked about all these things, Mike.

2037
02:37:06,605 --> 02:37:09,547
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't like, you know, this is the first time we're discussing it.

2038
02:37:09,567 --> 02:37:10,947
[SPEAKER_20]: This has been going on for a year.

2039
02:37:11,748 --> 02:37:19,392
[SPEAKER_20]: And the reality is there are some dynamic forces in the background that created maybe some preferences that are there.

2040
02:37:19,912 --> 02:37:23,455
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, historically, balance has shifted between the places.

2041
02:37:24,336 --> 02:37:30,721
[SPEAKER_20]: We're hopeful with some changes at one school that this won't be a permanent situation.

2042
02:37:30,761 --> 02:37:31,381
[SPEAKER_20]: This will change.

2043
02:37:33,002 --> 02:37:44,451
[SPEAKER_20]: But at any one point in time, at any one point in time, is it necessary, what do you call it, to, you know, hang our heads and say we didn't do it?

2044
02:37:44,812 --> 02:37:47,674
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, is choice more important right now than

2045
02:37:48,147 --> 02:37:53,429
[SPEAKER_20]: making sure the schools are balanced so the teachers have enough kids in the classroom, and we need to move forward.

2046
02:37:53,469 --> 02:37:54,930
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our choice.

2047
02:37:54,970 --> 02:37:55,490
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our choice.

2048
02:37:55,530 --> 02:37:56,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand.

2049
02:37:56,491 --> 02:37:59,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to take someone to the woodshed here, and that's not my intent.

2050
02:38:00,032 --> 02:38:04,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what's frustrating to me about this report is I think it was kind of obvious.

2051
02:38:05,295 --> 02:38:06,275
[SPEAKER_10]: We all kind of saw it coming.

2052
02:38:06,295 --> 02:38:08,897
[SPEAKER_10]: We just hoped it wouldn't be here at the 11th hour.

2053
02:38:09,617 --> 02:38:11,098
[SPEAKER_10]: What I would like to suggest is this.

2054
02:38:11,618 --> 02:38:16,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, no matter what we decide, it's going to cause a little bit of trouble.

2055
02:38:17,157 --> 02:38:29,429
[SPEAKER_10]: But it seems like if we expect that every school sort of has a reasonable distribution, it seems only fair to me that the Brooks School would be, you know, we say 17 or 20 kids have to go.

2056
02:38:30,289 --> 02:38:39,858
[SPEAKER_10]: And that just, you know, maybe that seems, you know, when we think of like what is fair for the community, is it fair for the entire community to say,

2057
02:38:40,442 --> 02:38:43,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you know, you're at the McGlynn Elementary.

2058
02:38:43,202 --> 02:38:44,543
[SPEAKER_10]: There's 16 kids there.

2059
02:38:44,943 --> 02:38:47,583
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, these are people that, friends that want to be together.

2060
02:38:48,423 --> 02:38:52,444
[SPEAKER_10]: They also should share, even though their school doesn't have this problem.

2061
02:38:52,524 --> 02:38:58,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the future, I would really like to start considering more seriously the idea that there is a choice to be made.

2062
02:38:58,825 --> 02:39:01,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, there isn't, right?

2063
02:39:01,105 --> 02:39:02,906
[SPEAKER_10]: We're saying they're equal, they're both great.

2064
02:39:03,526 --> 02:39:04,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it's a false choice.

2065
02:39:05,186 --> 02:39:07,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's have a reason for kids to go to one school versus the other.

2066
02:39:07,847 --> 02:39:08,547
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we want to be careful.

2067
02:39:08,567 --> 02:39:10,007
[SPEAKER_20]: The vast majority of people got their choice.

2068
02:39:10,868 --> 02:39:12,128
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a percentage right now.

2069
02:39:12,768 --> 02:39:14,589
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you could use the NBA rule.

2070
02:39:14,609 --> 02:39:16,209
[SPEAKER_20]: You want to play the NBA game?

2071
02:39:16,769 --> 02:39:20,530
[SPEAKER_20]: Whereas some schools have a weighted number versus other schools.

2072
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:25,251
[SPEAKER_20]: So you might say that a school that has no one going there would have to send more.

2073
02:39:25,952 --> 02:39:31,113
[SPEAKER_20]: A second school might send, you know, which has more kids going, might send less, a smaller percentage.

2074
02:39:31,653 --> 02:39:36,134
[SPEAKER_20]: And a third school, which has even more going, might send an even smaller percentage so that no school

2075
02:39:37,069 --> 02:39:37,990
[SPEAKER_20]: gets hit totally.

2076
02:39:38,210 --> 02:39:40,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I am in strong support of a weighted average option.

2077
02:39:41,953 --> 02:39:43,675
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be another way to play it.

2078
02:39:43,915 --> 02:39:48,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it seems only fair that we expect every school to basically feed into one.

2079
02:39:48,158 --> 02:39:53,122
[SPEAKER_10]: And unfortunately, that means one school will have more of a percentage of kids broken up.

2080
02:39:53,623 --> 02:39:58,767
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think the ELLs have to be called out because they're forced to go to one or another.

2081
02:39:58,827 --> 02:40:02,410
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think you should pull out the ELLs, then look at the proportion.

2082
02:40:04,328 --> 02:40:09,952
[SPEAKER_25]: We want to be careful, you know, that we promised people we were going to do something a certain way with the initial letters.

2083
02:40:10,153 --> 02:40:14,256
[SPEAKER_25]: And those initial letters, which the committee agreed on, would have two steps.

2084
02:40:14,516 --> 02:40:18,539
[SPEAKER_25]: Step one would be the choice, because nobody really wanted to yank that away totally.

2085
02:40:18,599 --> 02:40:20,340
[SPEAKER_25]: We wanted to see how it worked out.

2086
02:40:20,380 --> 02:40:25,984
[SPEAKER_25]: But we also, in that initial letter, said if it didn't work out equitably, we would go to a partial lottery.

2087
02:40:26,525 --> 02:40:32,489
[SPEAKER_25]: To go back and to develop something different, like take all the McGlynn kids and make them go, doesn't seem fair to me.

2088
02:40:33,188 --> 02:40:43,631
[SPEAKER_25]: The biggest objection, you know, this summer when we listened to people that were upset if they didn't get the school of their choice, the objection was, my child's not gonna be with any of their friends.

2089
02:40:44,271 --> 02:40:54,293
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think, if possible, trying to keep, you know, as much as possible, large groups of kids going to each school so they have a friend.

2090
02:40:54,653 --> 02:40:58,894
[SPEAKER_25]: Because that's what we felt kids wanted, to be with their friends.

2091
02:40:59,274 --> 02:41:01,935
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's why we were hoping the second

2092
02:41:02,389 --> 02:41:06,050
[SPEAKER_25]: phase here, choosing a cohort, would be a little bit better.

2093
02:41:06,130 --> 02:41:11,692
[SPEAKER_25]: All we needed was another three cohorts, and we would not be having this discussion this evening.

2094
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:16,193
[SPEAKER_25]: But right now, we don't have them, and so here we are, having the discussion.

2095
02:41:16,453 --> 02:41:20,354
[SPEAKER_25]: But we need to go back to what we told parents originally, too, and I think that's important.

2096
02:41:20,554 --> 02:41:21,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

2097
02:41:23,055 --> 02:41:26,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you to my colleague.

2098
02:41:29,677 --> 02:41:30,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that

2099
02:41:31,133 --> 02:41:42,097
[SPEAKER_09]: we really need to have a conversation, perhaps as a committee of the whole, not right now, please, about just removing choice 100% and just being done with it.

2100
02:41:42,677 --> 02:41:45,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I keep hearing how the balance swings back and forth.

2101
02:41:45,918 --> 02:41:56,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And magnet options, like if you create a magnet stem on math, it's like, well, I'm going to have 250 kids that want to go to the McGlynn with the magnet stem stuff.

2102
02:41:56,642 --> 02:42:00,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And the swinging back and forth to me is like,

2103
02:42:01,218 --> 02:42:03,899
[SPEAKER_09]: for one second in the middle of the pendulum, it's good.

2104
02:42:03,939 --> 02:42:07,120
[SPEAKER_09]: And then otherwise, we're all talking about this stuff endlessly.

2105
02:42:07,941 --> 02:42:15,103
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only real way to get rid of this is to get rid of choice.

2106
02:42:18,664 --> 02:42:29,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that the idea of trying to find, if we send 17 of the Brooks fifth graders, I think it's too much to ask that you try to make sure that those 17

2107
02:42:31,377 --> 02:42:31,897
[SPEAKER_09]: know each other.

2108
02:42:31,917 --> 02:42:34,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the time for that is over.

2109
02:42:34,339 --> 02:42:39,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you said that the Brooks parents did not get the form, then I think we would have a reason to talk.

2110
02:42:39,863 --> 02:42:40,143
[SPEAKER_09]: They did.

2111
02:42:40,163 --> 02:42:40,783
[SPEAKER_09]: They got the form.

2112
02:42:40,804 --> 02:42:47,408
[SPEAKER_09]: But they did get the form, and they did not return the form saying they cared whether their children would go with their friends enough to choose the McGlynn.

2113
02:42:48,048 --> 02:42:51,551
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is what they said by not returning the form, whether they want to admit it or not.

2114
02:42:52,231 --> 02:43:00,337
[SPEAKER_09]: So they are going to risk that their kid will go to McGlynn, or they'll move from Medford, or whatever their other solution is.

2115
02:43:01,333 --> 02:43:02,874
[SPEAKER_09]: rather than choosing the McGlynn.

2116
02:43:03,554 --> 02:43:21,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And this committee cannot pretend that maintaining anything other than both schools are actually equal, which I believe completely, and which is why I'm comfortable saying choice is a ridiculous idea.

2117
02:43:23,701 --> 02:43:28,363
[SPEAKER_09]: For non-ELL and non, I understand the programmatic

2118
02:43:29,047 --> 02:43:32,509
[SPEAKER_09]: placement is required, and for now, because of budgets and all that other stuff.

2119
02:43:32,549 --> 02:43:53,903
[SPEAKER_09]: So, at this point, I mean, you know, I'd like to make a motion that we go to the lottery and that 17 children from the Brooks are selected for the, I used percentage of rising fifth graders for each of the schools to try and get it, to make it proportional.

2120
02:43:55,484 --> 02:43:58,266
[SPEAKER_09]: So, while it's true that the Brooks sent the least number,

2121
02:43:58,854 --> 02:44:04,897
[SPEAKER_09]: they don't need to send 20 to be proportional to the other schools, and that three children from the Roberts are sent.

2122
02:44:05,517 --> 02:44:08,499
[SPEAKER_18]: Just so we all know how you did it.

2123
02:44:09,379 --> 02:44:13,041
[SPEAKER_09]: It's three pages long, my math, and I'm happy to share it afterwards.

2124
02:44:13,061 --> 02:44:18,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so you would do a percent of the number of fifth graders in each of the four elementary schools?

2125
02:44:19,184 --> 02:44:24,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct, I used percentage of rising fifth graders, and then McGlynn,

2126
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:26,441
[SPEAKER_09]: has offset that somewhat.

2127
02:44:26,541 --> 02:44:34,407
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Brooks has 22% of rising fifth graders, Columbus has 20%, Roberts has 28%, and McGlynn has 30.

2128
02:44:35,488 --> 02:44:42,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the McGlynn's overselection is reducing the need for us to choose children from the other schools.

2129
02:44:44,774 --> 02:44:52,360
[SPEAKER_09]: The number of students from the Columbus that selected the McGlynn and the Andrews is actually exactly the right number, 20%.

2130
02:44:54,629 --> 02:44:56,591
[SPEAKER_09]: the total, they split.

2131
02:44:58,032 --> 02:45:03,997
[SPEAKER_09]: The Columbus is the only school that has exactly the right number of students going to each of the two schools.

2132
02:45:05,299 --> 02:45:07,881
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts is short four, and the Brooks is short 18.

2133
02:45:08,021 --> 02:45:10,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not following your math.

2134
02:45:11,104 --> 02:45:13,646
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have 294 rising fifth graders.

2135
02:45:13,666 --> 02:45:15,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you pulling out the ELLs?

2136
02:45:16,068 --> 02:45:16,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you including them?

2137
02:45:17,129 --> 02:45:19,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, they won't be included in the lottery.

2138
02:45:19,969 --> 02:45:22,771
[SPEAKER_17]: But are they in your numbers of factors of who's being sent?

2139
02:45:22,851 --> 02:45:25,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Because ELLs have to go one way.

2140
02:45:25,653 --> 02:45:26,433
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no choice.

2141
02:45:27,133 --> 02:45:32,757
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not a problem, because there are not 18 ELL students at the Bronx that are rising fifth graders.

2142
02:45:33,077 --> 02:45:33,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Only two.

2143
02:45:34,338 --> 02:45:34,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2144
02:45:35,238 --> 02:45:45,765
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have 65 rising fifth graders, 41 of them have, I'm sorry, six of them have selected or are going to the McGlynn.

2145
02:45:45,845 --> 02:45:47,166
[SPEAKER_17]: It's under 10%.

2146
02:45:47,206 --> 02:45:47,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

2147
02:45:50,313 --> 02:45:54,615
[SPEAKER_09]: The other 59 rising fifth graders at the end will go into the lottery.

2148
02:45:56,596 --> 02:45:57,616
[SPEAKER_09]: The randomized selection.

2149
02:45:59,297 --> 02:46:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And 17 of those students will go to McLin.

2150
02:46:02,918 --> 02:46:05,019
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's proportional.

2151
02:46:05,039 --> 02:46:07,260
[SPEAKER_25]: So 17 from the Brooks and three from the Roberts?

2152
02:46:07,780 --> 02:46:09,381
[SPEAKER_09]: 17 from the Brooks, I just said McLin, sorry.

2153
02:46:09,701 --> 02:46:11,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And three from the Roberts, correct.

2154
02:46:11,962 --> 02:46:12,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Three from the Roberts.

2155
02:46:13,163 --> 02:46:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will share these with all the math.

2156
02:46:14,883 --> 02:46:18,345
[SPEAKER_09]: But member Kretz asked the question about is this fair?

2157
02:46:18,910 --> 02:46:23,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, I had to really work on what the principle was to even begin this math.

2158
02:46:24,212 --> 02:46:30,113
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only principle I could come up with is that all elementary schools will send precisely half of their rising fifth graders to each school.

2159
02:46:30,953 --> 02:46:33,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they don't have to actually do that, thanks to the McGlynn.

2160
02:46:34,995 --> 02:46:44,437
[SPEAKER_09]: But going forward, we might want to rethink whether the McGlynn, you know, that's a different conversation about the K through eight kind of model.

2161
02:46:44,697 --> 02:46:46,358
[SPEAKER_09]: But if that's the principle,

2162
02:46:47,719 --> 02:46:48,780
[SPEAKER_09]: then those are the numbers.

2163
02:46:49,240 --> 02:46:52,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not complicated at all, actually.

2164
02:47:19,434 --> 02:47:31,383
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is it possible that we could only have a chance of 17 or is the number 20 a hard one?

2165
02:47:31,423 --> 02:47:33,244
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I think we can get just closer.

2166
02:47:33,264 --> 02:47:36,787
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I think 15, we'd be comfortable with 15.

2167
02:47:37,027 --> 02:47:41,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Because again, if you had 20 moving, you'd have 149 to 144.

2168
02:47:42,051 --> 02:47:45,613
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't really have to just have that limited to differential.

2169
02:47:47,530 --> 02:47:53,655
[SPEAKER_17]: But- Okay, Mr. Russo has the floor.

2170
02:47:53,835 --> 02:48:02,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point out though, if it's any number 18 or under, they are all coming from the Brooks.

2171
02:48:05,025 --> 02:48:05,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so we're clear.

2172
02:48:06,146 --> 02:48:10,910
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you can bring it down to 15, that just means there are three less parents who are angry at the Brooks.

2173
02:48:11,838 --> 02:48:14,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Giro, please, we have to follow order.

2174
02:48:14,559 --> 02:48:16,299
[SPEAKER_17]: There's others that are in the queue here.

2175
02:48:16,659 --> 02:48:20,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anyone else want to comment on Mr. Russo's recommendation?

2176
02:48:22,921 --> 02:48:23,181
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

2177
02:48:23,561 --> 02:48:23,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz?

2178
02:48:24,742 --> 02:48:25,502
[SPEAKER_01]: On Mr. Russo's?

2179
02:48:28,002 --> 02:48:37,385
[SPEAKER_01]: In regards to the fairness in the way that you were talking about doing the lottery, so I kind of don't agree with, you know,

2180
02:48:37,764 --> 02:48:40,766
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the lottery with just the Brooke School.

2181
02:48:40,886 --> 02:48:42,327
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems so unfair.

2182
02:48:42,407 --> 02:48:47,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they didn't make that selection, but we do have school choice in Medford.

2183
02:48:48,012 --> 02:48:53,996
[SPEAKER_01]: So the families from that school sent in their selection form because we had the school choice.

2184
02:48:54,436 --> 02:49:04,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we were talking about doing the lottery, we never really talked about that maybe one school would have a lottery.

2185
02:49:05,525 --> 02:49:07,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the way that I read this packet,

2186
02:49:07,683 --> 02:49:19,273
[SPEAKER_01]: was it says here, all the students who have selected the Andrews, all of them, will be randomly selected to move to the McGlynn, you know, based on class size.

2187
02:49:19,553 --> 02:49:21,495
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be put into the partial lottery.

2188
02:49:22,115 --> 02:49:28,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, I don't really like the idea of doing a lottery for just one school.

2189
02:49:28,961 --> 02:49:30,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that just, it sounds horrible.

2190
02:49:30,483 --> 02:49:32,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just think it just sounds horrible.

2191
02:49:32,284 --> 02:49:35,507
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know they didn't make the choice and it didn't,

2192
02:49:36,490 --> 02:49:39,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I get it, it's just something that I'm just having a hard time with.

2193
02:49:39,893 --> 02:49:41,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information, Mr. Russo.

2194
02:49:42,175 --> 02:49:49,100
[SPEAKER_09]: All the schools will go through the lottery, but the number of students that need to come from the other schools is zero.

2195
02:49:51,662 --> 02:49:53,203
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's a semantic thing.

2196
02:49:54,104 --> 02:49:55,104
[SPEAKER_09]: All the schools go through the lottery.

2197
02:49:55,164 --> 02:49:56,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know, because I see the numbers.

2198
02:49:56,385 --> 02:49:58,387
[SPEAKER_09]: The other schools send enough, so they don't need to send more.

2199
02:49:58,667 --> 02:50:03,691
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not that the other schools aren't going through the lottery, it's just that they don't need to send any more kids, to be fair.

2200
02:50:04,792 --> 02:50:06,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't pick any of their kids.

2201
02:50:06,473 --> 02:50:20,304
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to take all the kids that selected Andrews through the whole district, stick them in a pile, and make all of them have an equal chance of going to the Andrews, because that would be incredibly unfair.

2202
02:50:21,926 --> 02:50:24,187
[SPEAKER_17]: That's Mr. Russo's recommendation.

2203
02:50:24,207 --> 02:50:24,708
[SPEAKER_17]: It was mine.

2204
02:50:24,948 --> 02:50:33,615
[SPEAKER_20]: The plan you approved when we put this in front of you was a partial lottery, and the partial lottery spoke to the issue of disproportionality.

2205
02:50:34,393 --> 02:50:37,215
[SPEAKER_20]: It actually listed the concept of disproportionality.

2206
02:50:37,255 --> 02:50:41,738
[SPEAKER_20]: If one place did not send anybody, then that place would be the partial lottery.

2207
02:50:41,778 --> 02:50:43,079
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise, it's a total lottery.

2208
02:50:44,280 --> 02:50:55,027
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can get around it a little bit by saying, okay, we'll wait it a little bit with, you know, to some degree, because it's an experimental year.

2209
02:50:56,568 --> 02:51:03,013
[SPEAKER_20]: But at some point, you've got to deal with the concept of partial lottery, which is based on disproportionality.

2210
02:51:05,350 --> 02:51:13,192
[SPEAKER_20]: Because one other point you want to make is that if you send, let's say you only send two kids from the Brooks, then what are you going to hear?

2211
02:51:13,552 --> 02:51:14,453
[SPEAKER_20]: My kid has no friends.

2212
02:51:15,633 --> 02:51:18,754
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you send a group over there, at least you've got, the kid's got some friends.

2213
02:51:19,534 --> 02:51:21,295
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a, you know, that's a thought.

2214
02:51:22,635 --> 02:51:24,235
[SPEAKER_17]: There's others in the queue first.

2215
02:51:24,255 --> 02:51:26,236
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to shut you guys off.

2216
02:51:26,676 --> 02:51:26,896
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2217
02:51:27,416 --> 02:51:27,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

2218
02:51:27,676 --> 02:51:28,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Vanderkloof.

2219
02:51:29,117 --> 02:51:33,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So along that same line of thinking, we,

2220
02:51:34,142 --> 02:51:39,967
[SPEAKER_03]: have said six kids need to go to the McGlynn because of their program, the ELL program.

2221
02:51:42,729 --> 02:51:44,811
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have any additional friends there.

2222
02:51:45,332 --> 02:51:46,833
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been made to go to a program.

2223
02:51:47,794 --> 02:51:50,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So frankly, they're pretty isolated from their group of friends.

2224
02:51:50,796 --> 02:51:54,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you getting the six from?

2225
02:51:54,660 --> 02:51:55,120
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

2226
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:58,203
[SPEAKER_03]: The six who are going to the

2227
02:51:59,110 --> 02:51:59,470
[SPEAKER_03]: The two?

2228
02:51:59,630 --> 02:52:00,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Two are ELL.

2229
02:52:00,831 --> 02:52:03,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Six didn't request anything, and they're going.

2230
02:52:03,553 --> 02:52:03,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.

2231
02:52:03,993 --> 02:52:05,614
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so then two.

2232
02:52:05,834 --> 02:52:06,555
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, it's two.

2233
02:52:06,815 --> 02:52:10,797
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, it's not a lot of familiar faces, so I don't know.

2234
02:52:11,998 --> 02:52:14,499
[SPEAKER_20]: And you're going to get some people walking into the 12th Tower.

2235
02:52:15,220 --> 02:52:18,062
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the summer, you're going to have some walk-ins, and you're going to have some people leaving.

2236
02:52:18,582 --> 02:52:19,983
[SPEAKER_20]: But the number's not going to be great.

2237
02:52:20,023 --> 02:52:21,524
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not going to change the balance.

2238
02:52:21,564 --> 02:52:22,604
[SPEAKER_20]: But you will get a few more.

2239
02:52:22,985 --> 02:52:24,846
[SPEAKER_20]: And anyone new coming in is going to the McGlynn.

2240
02:52:24,866 --> 02:52:27,628
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just that simple.

2241
02:52:27,668 --> 02:52:28,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto?

2242
02:52:30,180 --> 02:52:50,453
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't push my button, but I think it's a tough call for this committee, and I'm just listening to some of the members on the committee with children close to this age, and I'm just taking in the information at this point and just seeing what's best for the community as a whole.

2243
02:52:50,813 --> 02:52:55,896
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that both schools are very good schools in that

2244
02:52:56,444 --> 02:53:03,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Eventually people will be happy, but I think it's difficult for any parent or any child to swallow a change this late in the year.

2245
02:53:03,888 --> 02:53:10,571
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope that we move to make a total lottery at some point for these schools.

2246
02:53:11,251 --> 02:53:14,032
[SPEAKER_16]: And my colleague, Ms.

2247
02:53:14,052 --> 02:53:16,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Stone, called that way back when.

2248
02:53:17,574 --> 02:53:18,895
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was like, you're crazy.

2249
02:53:19,535 --> 02:53:23,697
[SPEAKER_16]: And she actually turned out to be right on the money.

2250
02:53:23,817 --> 02:53:25,438
[SPEAKER_16]: And she was getting phone calls on the way

2251
02:53:25,874 --> 02:53:33,097
[SPEAKER_16]: to that last meeting saying, don't you vote for a lottery by people that have supported her through the years.

2252
02:53:33,178 --> 02:53:37,079
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm sitting here and that's what I'm thinking.

2253
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:39,641
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm hoping to learn.

2254
02:53:40,221 --> 02:53:40,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2255
02:53:42,642 --> 02:53:42,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

2256
02:53:42,862 --> 02:53:43,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Kretz?

2257
02:53:43,502 --> 02:53:44,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2258
02:53:44,623 --> 02:53:50,406
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to mention that I did like when Dr. Vincent mentioned a long-term plan.

2259
02:53:51,312 --> 02:53:56,593
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, having grades five to six at one middle school and seven to eight at another middle school.

2260
02:53:57,174 --> 02:54:00,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that, you know, we could talk about for the future?

2261
02:54:00,754 --> 02:54:06,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not something because I was, I was even thinking it was something that was more doable, but then I said, Oh, great five.

2262
02:54:06,256 --> 02:54:07,776
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, they're in elementary right now.

2263
02:54:08,116 --> 02:54:11,497
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's something that maybe we could talk about for next year.

2264
02:54:12,237 --> 02:54:14,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, in that would be,

2265
02:54:14,812 --> 02:54:15,973
[SPEAKER_01]: we wouldn't have to do a lottery.

2266
02:54:16,013 --> 02:54:17,253
[SPEAKER_17]: For next year, yep.

2267
02:54:18,014 --> 02:54:18,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2268
02:54:18,434 --> 02:54:19,514
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

2269
02:54:20,035 --> 02:54:20,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just two points.

2270
02:54:20,995 --> 02:54:23,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, first, I just want to address the community at large.

2271
02:54:23,736 --> 02:54:26,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, this is not a choice anyone here wants to make.

2272
02:54:26,378 --> 02:54:33,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone wants everyone to get what they want or, you know, what their kids, but just talking about sort of the choice.

2273
02:54:33,521 --> 02:54:34,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to have to do a lottery.

2274
02:54:34,782 --> 02:54:36,262
[SPEAKER_10]: We're basically forced into this choice.

2275
02:54:36,302 --> 02:54:38,864
[SPEAKER_10]: The question is, what is most fair and what is best?

2276
02:54:39,504 --> 02:54:41,885
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we can all kind of agree

2277
02:54:42,315 --> 02:54:47,639
[SPEAKER_10]: that what's most fair is sending kids from the school that is only sending 9% of their students.

2278
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:55,345
[SPEAKER_10]: What's best also, though, if we're trying to prevent friends from being broken up, that's the best way to do it.

2279
02:54:55,866 --> 02:55:11,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Have one school that's not sending their kids actually make, because the probability, if you have three buddies, of two of them getting selected, so at least you have Tom, you might not have Bob, but at least you have Tom with you, is much, much better.

2280
02:55:12,295 --> 02:55:20,181
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we have a system where 11% of every school is dropped off, we're going to be breaking up friendships.

2281
02:55:20,241 --> 02:55:23,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And the likelihood is they're not going to have cohorts with them.

2282
02:55:24,604 --> 02:55:31,629
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that we're looking at, we're surveying what's not only best and fairest, but what is best for the kids.

2283
02:55:32,069 --> 02:55:40,255
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really do believe that this plan of Paul's, which is something we're kind of cooking up with two minds while he's working in parallel, I guess is the phrase.

2284
02:55:41,145 --> 02:55:43,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like this is the best way forward.

2285
02:55:44,106 --> 02:55:46,026
[SPEAKER_10]: It's best for the students, and it's fairest.

2286
02:55:50,908 --> 02:56:00,910
[SPEAKER_09]: So your recommendation is?

2287
02:56:00,930 --> 02:56:07,872
[SPEAKER_09]: 17 eligible children from the Brooks be randomized into the McGlynn, and that three children

2288
02:56:08,617 --> 02:56:16,799
[SPEAKER_09]: from the Roberts be randomized, three eligible children from the Roberts be randomized into the McLennan?

2289
02:56:16,839 --> 02:56:18,599
[SPEAKER_10]: May I make a friendly amendment to that?

2290
02:56:18,719 --> 02:56:20,300
[SPEAKER_17]: Friendly amendment, Mr. Regera?

2291
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:24,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it possible, seeing that we only need 17 students, would be acceptable?

2292
02:56:25,681 --> 02:56:31,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, I, and maybe that's the wrong thing to say, I'm sorry, I'm suddenly used to that stuff.

2293
02:56:32,263 --> 02:56:36,564
[SPEAKER_09]: When I had emailed, an even distribution would be 23 students to each.

2294
02:56:38,207 --> 02:56:40,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I emailed to ask, does it really need to be 23?

2295
02:56:40,429 --> 02:56:41,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got 20.

2296
02:56:42,290 --> 02:56:44,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm hearing 17 or 15.

2297
02:56:45,071 --> 02:56:52,416
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I'm a parent whose kid might get selected into the school that they didn't want, is it 23?

2298
02:56:52,716 --> 02:56:53,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it 20?

2299
02:56:53,557 --> 02:56:54,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it 19, 17, 15?

2300
02:56:54,817 --> 02:56:57,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to 13, because then my kid wouldn't have been 14, 15.

2301
02:56:58,019 --> 02:56:59,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's ask the administration.

2302
02:56:59,260 --> 02:57:00,801
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the experts right before us.

2303
02:57:00,821 --> 02:57:02,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is the real number?

2304
02:57:03,103 --> 02:57:04,704
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have to pick a number.

2305
02:57:05,657 --> 02:57:07,258
[SPEAKER_09]: It isn't just unimportant.

2306
02:57:07,518 --> 02:57:10,299
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really important for whoever happens to be there.

2307
02:57:10,879 --> 02:57:15,741
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll know who those kids are, because it's going to be one, two, three, four.

2308
02:57:16,261 --> 02:57:17,961
[SPEAKER_20]: So the number doesn't have to be perfect.

2309
02:57:18,021 --> 02:57:21,102
[SPEAKER_20]: It's never perfect one-to-one every year, even when it was working well.

2310
02:57:22,003 --> 02:57:29,945
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you get a number that brings it closer, you have less pain that you're inflicting on people that might not want it, you probably can live with 15.

2311
02:57:29,985 --> 02:57:32,086
[SPEAKER_20]: You probably could live with 15.

2312
02:57:32,526 --> 02:57:34,207
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there'll be other kids coming in during the summer.

2313
02:57:36,057 --> 02:57:38,578
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, that's probably a good compromise.

2314
02:57:40,658 --> 02:57:41,038
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2315
02:57:41,439 --> 02:57:44,560
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a parent that would like to speak.

2316
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:46,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Your name and address, please.

2317
02:58:04,483 --> 02:58:06,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Jenny Graham, 7 Runnelly Road.

2318
02:58:07,525 --> 02:58:10,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a couple of practical suggestions.

2319
02:58:10,727 --> 02:58:16,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Has Nick Tucci been to any of these elementary schools to talk to the kids and establish any kind of a relationship?

2320
02:58:19,972 --> 02:58:23,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Has Mr. Tucci gone to any of the elementary schools?

2321
02:58:23,314 --> 02:58:26,095
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know Beverly and I spoke about that as well.

2322
02:58:29,597 --> 02:58:32,439
[SPEAKER_12]: What we're trying to do is change hearts and minds.

2323
02:58:32,499 --> 02:58:35,180
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't do that with vague letters.

2324
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:40,903
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that you have to do some level of kind of standardized communication.

2325
02:58:41,583 --> 02:58:48,247
[SPEAKER_12]: But to date, the letters have all been fairly vague and not descriptive.

2326
02:58:48,287 --> 02:58:49,767
[SPEAKER_12]: And I totally understand why.

2327
02:58:50,408 --> 02:58:58,612
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you want people to feel good about going to a school with a newly appointed principal who wasn't in the mix when people made their original selection,

2328
02:58:59,175 --> 02:59:04,559
[SPEAKER_12]: And when that note went home, he could be really valuable in the discussion.

2329
02:59:04,719 --> 02:59:16,848
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would definitely suggest that he's potentially someone who should be out in front of this and not waiting for parents to be upset and disappointed.

2330
02:59:17,409 --> 02:59:28,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if he's as fabulous as everyone says he is, and a former baseball player, and an athlete, and all of these great things, he should have some credibility

2331
02:59:29,162 --> 02:59:35,228
[SPEAKER_12]: All he may need to do is put his face out there in particular populations.

2332
02:59:35,568 --> 02:59:38,491
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm a Brooks parent and I'm not somebody affected by this right now.

2333
02:59:39,192 --> 02:59:47,100
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would also say, if you're going to run a lottery and you're going to pull 17 students, 20 students, however many students from a particular school,

2334
02:59:48,110 --> 02:59:53,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I would go ahead and send that information home and say, this is your last chance, folks.

2335
02:59:53,595 --> 03:00:03,683
[SPEAKER_12]: You got 17, we are gonna pull 17 folks, 15, I don't care how many it is, but you have one more chance, and then we're gonna do this and it's gonna be completely random.

2336
03:00:05,545 --> 03:00:10,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think you have to be transparent about the plan and what those consequences are.

2337
03:00:12,623 --> 03:00:18,547
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to go this route, but if you'd like to make one final, you know, cohort and submit it, we'll obviously take that to the end of the week.

2338
03:00:20,107 --> 03:00:20,508
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's it.

2339
03:00:20,528 --> 03:00:27,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think, you know, as a parent, hearing partial lottery, it's never been clear what that means.

2340
03:00:27,932 --> 03:00:31,534
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's because you guys aren't even clear exactly what that means even tonight.

2341
03:00:31,614 --> 03:00:33,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's why you're talking about it.

2342
03:00:33,235 --> 03:00:38,278
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you hear that, you might take from that whatever it is that you want to take from it.

2343
03:00:38,438 --> 03:00:40,900
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you're intending to do something specific,

2344
03:00:41,823 --> 03:00:46,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Generally speaking, giving people those specific guidelines helps them make the best decision.

2345
03:00:46,544 --> 03:00:50,325
[SPEAKER_12]: And you may see people make a different choice.

2346
03:00:50,485 --> 03:00:58,527
[SPEAKER_12]: You may not, but if you don't do it, you are certain to have 17, 20, however many parents who are infuriated.

2347
03:00:59,467 --> 03:01:04,828
[SPEAKER_12]: So at least you have a chance to do something to lessen the impact of the people who are upset.

2348
03:01:05,429 --> 03:01:05,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

2349
03:01:05,649 --> 03:01:06,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Nelson, could you comment on

2350
03:01:07,715 --> 03:01:09,396
[SPEAKER_17]: having Nick go to the fifth graders.

2351
03:01:09,877 --> 03:01:11,698
[SPEAKER_17]: We discussed this.

2352
03:01:11,998 --> 03:01:21,805
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that having Nick try to get around to the schools and have parent meetings is a little ambitious with his schedule and the time frame we're in.

2353
03:01:21,825 --> 03:01:22,406
[SPEAKER_14]: The Brooks School.

2354
03:01:22,826 --> 03:01:23,587
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, to the Brooks?

2355
03:01:23,607 --> 03:01:24,827
[SPEAKER_25]: The Brooks School.

2356
03:01:26,229 --> 03:01:29,911
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure how we would schedule an evening or when that would be.

2357
03:01:31,152 --> 03:01:32,393
[SPEAKER_25]: It's up to what you want to do.

2358
03:01:32,473 --> 03:01:35,075
[SPEAKER_25]: But again, we'd be further delayed.

2359
03:01:36,323 --> 03:01:42,505
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever you want to do, though, is what we'll ask Mr. Tucci if he wants to try to hold a parent meeting at the Brooks.

2360
03:01:44,006 --> 03:01:47,006
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know his schedule or if that's feasible.

2361
03:01:47,527 --> 03:01:49,207
[SPEAKER_25]: But again, we're getting into June.

2362
03:01:49,987 --> 03:01:51,588
[SPEAKER_25]: Principals cannot schedule buildings.

2363
03:01:51,628 --> 03:01:52,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Fingers are up.

2364
03:01:53,088 --> 03:01:53,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

2365
03:01:53,249 --> 03:01:53,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Van de Kloot.

2366
03:01:53,869 --> 03:01:58,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, the last time we discussed this, I had recommended that Mr. Tucci go to the schools.

2367
03:01:58,290 --> 03:01:59,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, he didn't have time.

2368
03:02:00,131 --> 03:02:02,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're zeroing in on one particular school.

2369
03:02:04,553 --> 03:02:17,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Setting up a parent meeting, I'm not sure, but how about first, I think we need to allow Mr. Tucci time to be down there at the beginning of school, on a day, or the end, just where parents might be there.

2370
03:02:17,763 --> 03:02:28,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to send home a letter saying, giving them one last time, but saying Mr. Tucci's gonna be at the school at these times to give you a chance, and he's going to be visiting the fifth grade classes.

2371
03:02:30,173 --> 03:02:32,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's how I'd go about it.

2372
03:02:33,144 --> 03:02:34,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think you set a date.

2373
03:02:34,445 --> 03:02:45,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you set the date for the randomization of numbers, as my colleague says, to be sometime next week.

2374
03:02:45,113 --> 03:02:46,313
[SPEAKER_03]: But you set that up this week.

2375
03:02:46,954 --> 03:02:48,315
[SPEAKER_03]: You said send a letter home.

2376
03:02:49,135 --> 03:02:56,721
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Mr. Tucci be at the school at times when parents can meet with him.

2377
03:02:56,841 --> 03:03:02,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You have him be out maybe at the playground or something with students, fifth grade students, so he can get a chance to meet them.

2378
03:03:04,286 --> 03:03:20,517
[SPEAKER_03]: At the very least, it will at least give students familiarity with Mr. Tucci so that if they are the ones selected, they will at least have a face rather than just a name.

2379
03:03:21,117 --> 03:03:23,559
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that would be beneficial no matter what.

2380
03:03:24,039 --> 03:03:27,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand Mr. Tucci's just taking on a new position.

2381
03:03:28,722 --> 03:03:29,363
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just

2382
03:03:30,463 --> 03:03:34,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that we need to get other people to cover it for the time that he's at the Brooks.

2383
03:03:34,466 --> 03:03:45,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, you know, suggesting he spend the whole day there, but I'm suggesting he be there when parents might reasonably be there and visit the classrooms, the fifth grade classrooms.

2384
03:03:47,337 --> 03:03:58,666
[SPEAKER_25]: So the message to the parents would be that we are doing the partial lottery, but there's an opportunity to switch to the McGlynn.

2385
03:03:59,429 --> 03:04:07,516
[SPEAKER_25]: and Mr. Tucci would be meeting with them to answer any questions, or do we wait and just, I don't know.

2386
03:04:07,536 --> 03:04:25,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that you would schedule a meeting for Mr. Tucci to meet with the fifth grade parents, schedule it by next Monday, so maybe Thursday night or next Monday night, possibly the PTO could host, that's their last opportunity to get to know him, otherwise there will be a lottery on X date and we are taking 16,

2387
03:04:28,310 --> 03:04:29,811
[SPEAKER_17]: potential kids from the Brooks.

2388
03:04:34,233 --> 03:04:37,654
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm hearing Paulette, you said you during the day to what evening?

2389
03:04:37,674 --> 03:04:41,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think you need a night meeting when parents can... To be honest with you, I would do both.

2390
03:04:41,856 --> 03:04:46,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have him there where he's around and either drop off or pick up.

2391
03:04:46,699 --> 03:04:47,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, certainly Ms.

2392
03:04:47,839 --> 03:04:53,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Galluzzi can give you an idea of how many of the fifth graders' parents actually drop them off and if that is

2393
03:04:53,918 --> 03:04:55,999
[SPEAKER_03]: whether there would be any to talk to.

2394
03:04:56,620 --> 03:05:01,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd certainly have him go into the fifth grade classes to introduce himself and let him.

2395
03:05:03,104 --> 03:05:06,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the kids might go home and say, hey, I met the new principal.

2396
03:05:06,306 --> 03:05:10,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we make it clear that it's going to happen.

2397
03:05:10,869 --> 03:05:12,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least we've given it another shot.

2398
03:05:12,610 --> 03:05:16,093
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, Mr. Russo.

2399
03:05:16,973 --> 03:05:17,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Last thing.

2400
03:05:17,334 --> 03:05:22,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure we're just focusing on the Brooks, not just because

2401
03:05:22,673 --> 03:05:24,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Tucci can only be in so many places at once.

2402
03:05:25,854 --> 03:05:28,214
[SPEAKER_17]: For parity, to get into the 20 percentile.

2403
03:05:28,234 --> 03:05:28,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely, yes.

2404
03:05:29,435 --> 03:05:29,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2405
03:05:29,755 --> 03:05:30,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Participation.

2406
03:05:30,675 --> 03:05:32,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done.

2407
03:05:32,575 --> 03:05:32,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2408
03:05:32,836 --> 03:05:33,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Vergero.

2409
03:05:33,536 --> 03:05:36,536
[SPEAKER_10]: One last point in support of this idea of Mr. Tucci going down.

2410
03:05:36,756 --> 03:05:44,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important for the community that for, you know, we don't want kids to just be forced at the last minute with no recall.

2411
03:05:44,978 --> 03:05:48,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We want parents to have as many options as they can and many possibilities.

2412
03:05:49,019 --> 03:05:50,960
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we can get, you know, 10 people

2413
03:05:52,012 --> 03:05:55,935
[SPEAKER_10]: to move over, that's only five that we have to select from the rest of the cohort.

2414
03:05:56,015 --> 03:05:58,057
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really do support this idea.

2415
03:05:58,077 --> 03:06:05,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I think either we're paying now or we're paying later, because there's going to be a certain, there's going to be feelings about this, especially when we're taking such a large percentage.

2416
03:06:06,002 --> 03:06:19,492
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to get the communication clear to parents, because we can do all of the Mr. Tucci meeting with parents and all that, but the letter would go out to parents saying that we are going to do the lottery,

2417
03:06:20,433 --> 03:06:22,574
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I'm sorry?

2418
03:06:28,055 --> 03:06:34,738
[SPEAKER_18]: Tuesday.

2419
03:06:34,978 --> 03:06:40,319
[SPEAKER_25]: So on Wednesday, there'd be the partial lottery if no one came forward by Tuesday.

2420
03:06:45,634 --> 03:06:52,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I will get to this tomorrow and Diane and I will draft a letter.

2421
03:06:56,140 --> 03:06:56,840
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion.

2422
03:06:59,382 --> 03:07:01,503
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion that those steps be followed.

2423
03:07:02,263 --> 03:07:03,144
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

2424
03:07:03,424 --> 03:07:03,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

2425
03:07:03,924 --> 03:07:04,825
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

2426
03:07:05,245 --> 03:07:06,025
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion is granted.

2427
03:07:06,626 --> 03:07:12,189
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to comment also that when we announced Mr. Tucci at the McGlynn School,

2428
03:07:13,275 --> 03:07:19,938
[SPEAKER_17]: It was, it might have been one of the most fabulous days that I have had in a school setting.

2429
03:07:20,499 --> 03:07:23,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Both the students, teachers made signs for him.

2430
03:07:24,060 --> 03:07:26,441
[SPEAKER_17]: The students were elated, cheering.

2431
03:07:26,481 --> 03:07:31,624
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like a pep rally for Thanksgiving game back in the day when Medford High was like, you know,

2432
03:07:32,054 --> 03:07:32,955
[SPEAKER_17]: first in the JBL.

2433
03:07:33,475 --> 03:07:38,359
[SPEAKER_17]: It was phenomenal, and it just showed how the community has come together.

2434
03:07:38,439 --> 03:07:43,763
[SPEAKER_17]: So I hope that people have seen some of the video from that day, because it was really, really amazing.

2435
03:07:44,404 --> 03:07:47,246
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just really proud of that school for standing tall, so.

2436
03:07:48,667 --> 03:07:51,390
[SPEAKER_17]: All righty, next order of business.

2437
03:07:51,750 --> 03:07:54,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Under new, show a collaborative quarterly report.

2438
03:07:54,973 --> 03:07:57,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to receive and place this on file by Mr. Russo?

2439
03:07:58,669 --> 03:07:59,310
[SPEAKER_17]: So moved.

2440
03:07:59,750 --> 03:08:00,771
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second by Ms.

2441
03:08:00,831 --> 03:08:01,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Mostone?

2442
03:08:01,491 --> 03:08:02,232
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

2443
03:08:03,012 --> 03:08:03,793
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

2444
03:08:03,893 --> 03:08:04,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion carries.

2445
03:08:08,196 --> 03:08:12,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Discussion of application of open meeting law to electronic devices.

2446
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:13,380
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Russo.

2447
03:08:15,682 --> 03:08:16,062
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

2448
03:08:16,403 --> 03:08:19,005
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2449
03:08:20,249 --> 03:08:27,571
[SPEAKER_09]: When somebody in the public comes to speak, they come to the podium, and they state their name and their address.

2450
03:08:27,731 --> 03:08:35,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody in the room, everybody in the audience, everybody on TV knows who is asking questions or saying what they have to say.

2451
03:08:35,314 --> 03:08:49,718
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know from my own experience sitting here that I have sort of been receiving messages to try and what I see as you assert the point of open meetings, and that is,

2452
03:08:50,762 --> 03:08:52,983
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, texting, hey, Paul, ask this question.

2453
03:08:53,023 --> 03:08:53,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Paul, do this.

2454
03:08:54,243 --> 03:09:16,830
[SPEAKER_09]: And, well, I don't wear an earpiece, and I'm not, you know, I was going to say the president, but, and I think it's really important that the people that are here, that have taken the time to come here and ask questions, are the people who are asking the questions, and that we are not just mouthpieces for any number of people who could be sitting at home texting us.

2455
03:09:18,297 --> 03:09:26,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I also want to point out that the Attorney General's website makes it clear that the open meeting law does not specifically address this issue.

2456
03:09:27,023 --> 03:09:31,246
[SPEAKER_09]: The Attorney General does say it is not recommended that we do this.

2457
03:09:32,766 --> 03:09:40,531
[SPEAKER_09]: That includes texting each other across the room, although, frankly, the only time I've been involved in these kinds of texts are, oh, my God, could it be any hotter in here?

2458
03:09:41,172 --> 03:09:43,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know, are we going drinking afterwards?

2459
03:09:47,155 --> 03:09:50,457
[SPEAKER_09]: It was you, of course it was you.

2460
03:09:50,957 --> 03:10:05,426
[SPEAKER_09]: But for matters that are actually before us, I just feel that it's important that at least I make the stand that I will not be having private deliberations or communications with the public during or with other members.

2461
03:10:06,187 --> 03:10:11,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Make it a school committee rule that phones should be turned off.

2462
03:10:11,170 --> 03:10:11,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's,

2463
03:10:15,347 --> 03:10:18,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's unfortunate if we aren't all on board with this.

2464
03:10:20,831 --> 03:10:33,940
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, obviously this isn't enforceable, but this is just something that I have seen and I have received messages from the public, you know, to ask questions of the people at the podium or to ask questions of other members or whatever.

2465
03:10:34,060 --> 03:10:36,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just don't find that to be above board.

2466
03:10:36,301 --> 03:10:40,364
[SPEAKER_09]: It clearly is not officially illegal, but I just wanted to bring that up.

2467
03:10:41,205 --> 03:10:44,587
[SPEAKER_17]: Make it in a motion for school committee rule to be adopted.

2468
03:10:46,546 --> 03:10:48,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any other discussion before I make that motion?

2469
03:10:48,387 --> 03:10:49,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, well, make the motion.

2470
03:10:49,567 --> 03:10:57,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to make a motion that a school committee rule is that we do not have private deliberations with anyone during open session.

2471
03:10:59,332 --> 03:10:59,392
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

2472
03:10:59,412 --> 03:10:59,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

2473
03:10:59,552 --> 03:11:00,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Vander Kloof up next.

2474
03:11:00,952 --> 03:11:15,739
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I'd like to clarify is that the only message that I've received along the lines of what you're talking was, in fact, at a recent meeting when the person texted me to let me know

2475
03:11:16,269 --> 03:11:19,611
[SPEAKER_03]: that we were not, the sound was not on.

2476
03:11:20,951 --> 03:11:23,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was actually very helpful for us to know.

2477
03:11:23,833 --> 03:11:32,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, I mean, that wasn't a question, that was just a point of information which was useful for us to know so that we were responsive.

2478
03:11:33,497 --> 03:11:42,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just need to be clear that that is a decidedly different type of message than someone asking you something.

2479
03:11:45,257 --> 03:11:54,980
[SPEAKER_03]: The only other way to do it is if someone were to, and I'm just throwing this out, is to announce this question comes from.

2480
03:11:55,900 --> 03:11:59,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wondered, I just sort of wondered, Paul, what your reaction to that is.

2481
03:12:00,842 --> 03:12:01,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

2482
03:12:02,102 --> 03:12:03,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, thank you.

2483
03:12:03,082 --> 03:12:11,765
[SPEAKER_09]: So actually, I did put that in my email that I sent to Mayor Burke and Mr. Belson, saying that that was something that I had considered as an alternative.

2484
03:12:13,945 --> 03:12:19,126
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do question whether or not the, well, first of all, who's going to text us?

2485
03:12:19,206 --> 03:12:28,569
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have to say, well, from the public, so-and-so who lives at, which, I mean, I don't get text messages that give me their address, but would like to know this question.

2486
03:12:28,929 --> 03:12:32,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, I guess that wouldn't really bother me.

2487
03:12:32,850 --> 03:12:42,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just like to amend whatever it is I said before to say that within the private communications that are within our authority, if I get a text that, you know,

2488
03:12:44,022 --> 03:12:49,527
[SPEAKER_09]: or that the sound isn't working.

2489
03:12:49,567 --> 03:12:51,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anybody has an issue with that.

2490
03:12:51,788 --> 03:12:54,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And I suppose that does mean that, you know, do we go drinking?

2491
03:12:54,531 --> 03:13:08,962
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can clarify it by simply saying the only electronic communications allowable will be those for emergencies or for personal in nature, but not anything that impacts the discussion on the floor.

2492
03:13:09,022 --> 03:13:09,723
[SPEAKER_13]: School committee business.

2493
03:13:09,743 --> 03:13:10,583
[SPEAKER_20]: School committee business.

2494
03:13:11,244 --> 03:13:12,345
[SPEAKER_20]: And that way you, you know,

2495
03:13:13,257 --> 03:13:15,358
[SPEAKER_20]: That way you cover it, because obviously it's an emergency.

2496
03:13:15,398 --> 03:13:16,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Something's happening at home.

2497
03:13:16,638 --> 03:13:17,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Something's happening in your life.

2498
03:13:17,698 --> 03:13:18,598
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to want to get that.

2499
03:13:19,579 --> 03:13:21,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the emergency cover the sound off?

2500
03:13:22,159 --> 03:13:22,720
[SPEAKER_20]: Cover what?

2501
03:13:23,300 --> 03:13:25,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the emergency cover that the sound is off?

2502
03:13:26,681 --> 03:13:26,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2503
03:13:26,941 --> 03:13:32,562
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I mean, I think that would be for effects to the general operation of the meeting.

2504
03:13:32,602 --> 03:13:33,283
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not our business.

2505
03:13:33,303 --> 03:13:34,463
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not our business.

2506
03:13:34,723 --> 03:13:35,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Our docket.

2507
03:13:35,283 --> 03:13:35,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2508
03:13:35,483 --> 03:13:42,165
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, you wouldn't want the difference between someone telling you how to vote on a particular topic versus someone telling you that

2509
03:13:42,528 --> 03:13:43,669
[SPEAKER_20]: They can't hear what you're saying.

2510
03:13:43,829 --> 03:13:44,129
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

2511
03:13:44,489 --> 03:13:49,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's, I certainly support Mr. Rousseau's motion.

2512
03:13:50,553 --> 03:13:51,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make the clarification.

2513
03:13:52,054 --> 03:13:53,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Second on the motion?

2514
03:13:53,295 --> 03:13:53,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2515
03:13:54,356 --> 03:13:55,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

2516
03:13:55,677 --> 03:13:56,998
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2517
03:13:57,058 --> 03:13:58,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Overall, I definitely support the spirit.

2518
03:13:58,659 --> 03:14:00,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I leave my cell phone in the car for this very reason.

2519
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:04,423
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I have my computer here, but I'm not receiving texts to it.

2520
03:14:05,083 --> 03:14:07,765
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's important for us to recognize as a group

2521
03:14:08,239 --> 03:14:12,681
[SPEAKER_10]: that we live in an age where people that do have serious disabilities can still participate.

2522
03:14:13,762 --> 03:14:16,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would be great if we create an environment for that to happen.

2523
03:14:17,484 --> 03:14:29,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree that we should have all of our personal, like, you know, someone shouldn't be sending member Ruggiero a message or member Paul a message, because that's kind of, it's kind of working beyond the spirit of open meeting.

2524
03:14:30,371 --> 03:14:32,272
[SPEAKER_10]: But it would be nice if we had a number.

2525
03:14:33,066 --> 03:14:46,311
[SPEAKER_10]: or a Twitter feed or something where maybe the chair could make, you know, Martin, who has a serious disability, wasn't able to come today, but he had a really great suggestion.

2526
03:14:46,671 --> 03:14:47,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Martin lives on this address.

2527
03:14:48,132 --> 03:14:50,353
[SPEAKER_10]: He wishes me to bring this point up.

2528
03:14:51,093 --> 03:14:56,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I really would feel, I think, you know, we live in a time where we can make that possible.

2529
03:14:57,015 --> 03:15:00,697
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to suggest, once again, a friendly amendment that we, for now,

2530
03:15:01,351 --> 03:15:03,752
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we can all agree that this is probably for the best.

2531
03:15:03,853 --> 03:15:05,814
[SPEAKER_10]: I leave my cell phone because I get texts during meetings.

2532
03:15:05,874 --> 03:15:07,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't prefer, I don't like it either.

2533
03:15:07,495 --> 03:15:12,498
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the same kind of, and I don't want to, you know, I don't think it's fair for me to like, hey Mia, do you really want to do this?

2534
03:15:12,518 --> 03:15:12,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go.

2535
03:15:12,878 --> 03:15:15,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's, that's also seems to be subverting the spirit.

2536
03:15:16,380 --> 03:15:23,104
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the same token, I think it's important for us to pursue avenues that people that do have serious issues that they can't come to meetings.

2537
03:15:23,552 --> 03:15:25,592
[SPEAKER_10]: can also have a means of communicating with us.

2538
03:15:25,612 --> 03:15:29,513
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to look that we think about ways to make that possible in the future.

2539
03:15:29,533 --> 03:15:33,614
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can make a friendly amendment for us to sort of figure out the wording together now.

2540
03:15:35,074 --> 03:15:42,676
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, one of the things you do have, people can, under community participation, provide me with a document that they want me to introduce.

2541
03:15:42,696 --> 03:15:45,757
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't have to necessarily present it, but I can distribute it.

2542
03:15:46,737 --> 03:15:52,058
[SPEAKER_20]: So another way to say if you have a document or some position paper you want the committee to take under consideration,

2543
03:15:52,797 --> 03:15:55,759
[SPEAKER_20]: You send it to the office by such and such, and we'll distribute it for you.

2544
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:58,221
[SPEAKER_17]: And our agenda is very thorough.

2545
03:15:58,261 --> 03:16:02,584
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't do much under suspension like other bodies may do.

2546
03:16:03,064 --> 03:16:06,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Ours are written out and pretty clear on what we're talking about.

2547
03:16:06,087 --> 03:16:06,867
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not vague.

2548
03:16:07,187 --> 03:16:12,992
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think someone could submit comments if they see it on Friday for the meeting on Monday.

2549
03:16:15,073 --> 03:16:17,175
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Mr. Brussaux.

2550
03:16:17,595 --> 03:16:18,616
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you already spoke.

2551
03:16:19,016 --> 03:16:20,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto, sorry.

2552
03:16:20,217 --> 03:16:20,917
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go up next.

2553
03:16:21,257 --> 03:16:21,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2554
03:16:22,432 --> 03:16:36,355
[SPEAKER_16]: My only concern with this is a lot of our population could be single parents that might want something brought forward, and they can't leave their children unattended to attend these meetings, but they could be watching it at home.

2555
03:16:36,915 --> 03:16:43,096
[SPEAKER_16]: So I agree that less use is best, less is best in this forum.

2556
03:16:44,417 --> 03:16:50,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I do agree that announcing who it was, if it's commented on or looked at,

2557
03:16:50,793 --> 03:16:56,276
[SPEAKER_16]: throughout the meeting and not later, then I do agree that that should be announced.

2558
03:16:56,756 --> 03:17:06,681
[SPEAKER_16]: But there are people that don't have the ability to leave their home at seven o'clock at nighttime because they're not able, and they're not gonna bring their children out at that time.

2559
03:17:07,162 --> 03:17:12,785
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would be a concern to me, that people wanted to speak about an item and we're not reaching them.

2560
03:17:14,025 --> 03:17:15,266
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my only concern.

2561
03:17:17,623 --> 03:17:24,008
[SPEAKER_18]: I hear you, but I think we get emails often from parents that you've referenced tonight, the after school.

2562
03:17:24,128 --> 03:17:36,657
[SPEAKER_18]: So I almost feel like Paul's taking the weight off my own shoulders by saying it's not something we want to do, because I do get texts regularly from friends who are also parents in the school system.

2563
03:17:36,937 --> 03:17:45,884
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we've gotten a number of emails that all of us have shared here that if parents have a concern or a resident, we can bring it and say, we got this email from this person.

2564
03:17:45,984 --> 03:17:46,945
[SPEAKER_18]: So I second.

2565
03:17:47,499 --> 03:17:49,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Paul's motion.

2566
03:17:51,142 --> 03:17:51,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, sorry, Paulette.

2567
03:17:51,902 --> 03:17:52,783
[SPEAKER_17]: I third Paul's motion.

2568
03:17:52,843 --> 03:17:53,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, she thirds it.

2569
03:17:54,704 --> 03:17:57,406
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion offered by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

2570
03:17:57,466 --> 03:18:12,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Kloot and Mustone, that the use of personal devices be restricted to only items that are personal in nature, not from the public regarding school committee business.

2571
03:18:21,810 --> 03:18:26,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just say that, you know, we can all have our phones out.

2572
03:18:26,592 --> 03:18:31,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's our, you know, I have Word on my phone and you can have your laptop open.

2573
03:18:31,133 --> 03:18:32,413
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a trust issue.

2574
03:18:32,553 --> 03:18:38,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not expecting you to, you know, wrap your device in some lead so it can't get the internet.

2575
03:18:38,895 --> 03:18:40,015
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, so.

2576
03:18:48,874 --> 03:18:49,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2577
03:18:50,155 --> 03:18:50,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2578
03:18:52,957 --> 03:18:54,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2579
03:18:56,058 --> 03:18:56,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2580
03:18:56,939 --> 03:18:57,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2581
03:18:57,419 --> 03:19:00,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

2582
03:19:00,220 --> 03:19:03,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to just ask a question.

2583
03:19:03,182 --> 03:19:17,630
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a case where someone gets a message and they think that it is critical for us to hear, but they announce who it's from and what the message is,

2584
03:19:20,516 --> 03:19:27,078
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, they can email us the next day and we can bring it up at our next meeting.

2585
03:19:27,878 --> 03:19:28,639
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not honest.

2586
03:19:28,699 --> 03:19:29,839
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't feel honest to me.

2587
03:19:30,139 --> 03:19:32,480
[SPEAKER_18]: And I am totally guilty of it.

2588
03:19:32,520 --> 03:19:36,142
[SPEAKER_18]: For the past two years, people have texted me and I've brought up issues that people have texted me.

2589
03:19:36,622 --> 03:19:37,442
[SPEAKER_18]: And it felt yucky.

2590
03:19:38,102 --> 03:19:40,703
[SPEAKER_18]: And I never even thought of going this route with Paul.

2591
03:19:40,764 --> 03:19:42,684
[SPEAKER_18]: I respect him for addressing this.

2592
03:19:46,773 --> 03:19:50,195
[SPEAKER_17]: On the next item, discussion of pending legislation on recess.

2593
03:19:50,316 --> 03:19:51,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Rousseau.

2594
03:19:55,799 --> 03:19:56,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry.

2595
03:19:57,240 --> 03:19:57,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

2596
03:19:57,961 --> 03:19:58,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello again.

2597
03:19:58,841 --> 03:20:01,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So, do I have to read the front page?

2598
03:20:01,383 --> 03:20:01,603
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2599
03:20:01,703 --> 03:20:02,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good.

2600
03:20:02,724 --> 03:20:12,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I, there are two, there's a Senate bill and a House bill currently in the State House, State Legislature for, related to

2601
03:20:13,400 --> 03:20:15,882
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of things, but primarily recess.

2602
03:20:17,023 --> 03:20:19,324
[SPEAKER_09]: And I won't read the entire resolution.

2603
03:20:19,344 --> 03:20:20,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2604
03:20:20,025 --> 03:20:22,466
[SPEAKER_17]: Waive the reading of the entire proclamation here.

2605
03:20:22,606 --> 03:20:23,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's quite long.

2606
03:20:24,147 --> 03:20:30,892
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would like to thank the Summerville School Committee for having written this, that I've gotten their permission to just steal it.

2607
03:20:30,912 --> 03:20:31,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, that's pretty common.

2608
03:20:33,474 --> 03:20:41,439
[SPEAKER_09]: But the gist of these two bills is that unstructured recess becomes time on learning.

2609
03:20:42,924 --> 03:20:55,889
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the issues we have is as a committee, we could simply say recess is gonna be 45 minutes every day, but then there isn't enough time on learning unless we then go to contract negotiations and extend the day and pay the teachers more and on and on.

2610
03:20:56,389 --> 03:21:03,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So this really changes the nature of recess in that it is, it must be unstructured recess.

2611
03:21:03,232 --> 03:21:10,375
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not gym, not phys ed, and it counts as time on learning, which alleviates the issue of

2612
03:21:11,116 --> 03:21:15,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we still have plenty of other issues around scheduling it, but if we decided to increase it.

2613
03:21:15,777 --> 03:21:16,658
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 20 minutes a day.

2614
03:21:16,678 --> 03:21:26,381
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 20 minutes a day, and it cannot be, and the recess cannot be denied for disciplinary reasons.

2615
03:21:27,081 --> 03:21:28,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

2616
03:21:28,961 --> 03:21:29,742
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's any questions.

2617
03:21:31,102 --> 03:21:31,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.

2618
03:21:31,722 --> 03:21:32,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval.

2619
03:21:32,783 --> 03:21:33,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Moved by Ms.

2620
03:21:33,683 --> 03:21:35,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

2621
03:21:36,844 --> 03:21:37,184
[SPEAKER_09]: She's second.

2622
03:21:37,544 --> 03:21:38,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

2623
03:21:41,531 --> 03:21:42,192
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

2624
03:21:42,612 --> 03:21:42,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2625
03:21:43,092 --> 03:21:43,753
