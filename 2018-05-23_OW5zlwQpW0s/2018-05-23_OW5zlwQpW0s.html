    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=77.785s">Which</a>  page are you on?</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=79.426s">Eight</a>  of 11, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=81.567s">It's</a>  fourth from the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=84.409s">I</a>  just wanted to know, what are the two programs that most of the students are enrolled in?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=92.738s">I</a>  don't know that it's just two programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=94.999s">I</a>  don't have a specific breakdown of which programs can certainly look into that for you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=100.662s">Milestones.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=101.282s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=102.062s">Milestones?</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=102.722s">It's</a>  the Minuteman Regional High School and Vocational High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=105.904s">Oh,</a>  Minuteman.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=106.404s">Out</a>  of district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=107.585s">Mr.</a>  Belson, did you want to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=109.926s">Minuteman?</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=110.386s">Are</a>  you looking at Minuteman or Milestones? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=112.307s">Minuteman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=113.007s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=113.667s">So</a>  Minuteman is a vocational technical chapter 74 program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=120.31s">Sometimes</a>  the payments are grouped. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=122.553s">And</a>  I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=125.614s">Yeah,</a>  the 63 and the 25.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=126.695s">I</a>  think that was, what do you call it, a payment that was- He's inquiring what specific Chapter 74 program they're enrolled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=133.077s">I</a>  don't have that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=133.957s">Do</a>  you know of this program, what is the one that most of the students are enrolled in? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=139.179s">Plumbing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=139.459s">Is</a>  it plumbing? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=140.0s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=140.58s">Plumbing</a>  still?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=141.34s">Not</a>  really, not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=143.041s">It's</a>  changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=143.921s">I</a>  mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=149.843s">By</a>  next year, they're likely to have two or three kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=152.506s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=153.327s">Because</a>  it's really going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=154.347s">It</a>  went down from 50 kids.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=156.809s">How</a>  many kids do we have currently in the program?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=158.53s">Probably,</a>  what, three or four? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=160.011s">Seven</a>  right now, maybe?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=163.453s">Six</a>  or seven at minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=164.474s">Nine.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=165.195s">Nine</a>  at minimum, that's including Essex, no?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=168.117s">No,</a>  Essex is separate.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=169.317s">Okay,</a>  all right.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=170.978s">Could</a>  you just give me a breakdown of the program when you have time? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=173.06s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=173.72s">Can</a>  you give me a breakdown of what programs are enrolled in? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=175.381s">Absolutely,</a>  ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=176.422s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=401.925s">Thank</a>  you so much for taking this on and moving it back home. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=404.687s">We'll</a>  call it home. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=405.467s">More</a>  or less home. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=408.008s">And</a>  thanks for bringing it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=409.569s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=409.829s">We</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=411.99s">It</a>  is a great community event, and you guys are wonderful for doing this and continuing to do it.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=416.832s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=420.111s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you also. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=421.932s">It</a>  was a great event. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=422.833s">I</a>  attended last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=423.634s">It</a>  was so much fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=424.514s">And</a>  I'm happy to also read that the students at the vocational school created the t-shirts and the high school, the video department made a great video. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=432.82s">So</a>  that's fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=434.341s">And</a>  I think I saw it already posted on like Facebook with the blog and I continue to share it once it gets closer.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=441.986s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=442.726s">There's</a>  been a lot of the schools have been promoting it on their parent teacher group pages and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=448.282s">You</a>  know, we're anticipating a lot of people and we're pretty excited about, you know, what the turnout will look like.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=453.184s">I</a>  know you want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=454.344s">I</a>  just want to let people know they can still join the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=459.626s">You</a>  can sign up that day, make a donation, get your head shaved that day, or you can join the team online at buzzforkids.org, actually join the team, and then you can solicit donations through the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=473.692s">If</a>  there is anybody watching that wants to donate, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=477.913s">online</a>  that can't go is buzzforkids.org and just search team emo and you can donate directly to the team and we do you can still sign up you can join that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=490.768s">We</a>  have teachers, board and commission members, we have cops, firemen, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=498.513s">I</a>  think we have a DPW guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=499.454s">We</a>  don't have any elected officials yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=505.757s">We</a>  have women on the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=506.758s">I</a>  think we have three women on the team this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=508.779s">We</a>  have three women who are buzzing their heads so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=513.341s">Just</a>  saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=515.002s">So</a>  it's going to be periodic. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=519.525s">It's</a>  going to be periodic. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=526.565s">Between</a>  8, 830, I know the firefighters, I think, have said they're going to be coming in throughout the night, getting their head shaved, some of the cops as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=535.313s">Can</a>  I shave one of their heads, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=539.097s">Periodically</a>  throughout the night, I think you'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=541.058s">We're</a>  going to try to spread it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=543.26s">It's</a>  going to be a really fun event. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=545.122s">We</a>  had a really great time last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=549.96s">You</a>  know, Anthony's been doing this for a couple of years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=552.362s">It</a>  was his goal to us to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=555.144s">You</a>  know, our goal is to make it bigger and bigger and bigger and, you know, eventually just, you know, an all-day affair one day, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=560.628s">And</a>  you guys in the City Council have been excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=565.972s">John</a>  Brewer's Tavern has been awesome in helping us with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=570.155s">So</a>  we're really looking forward to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=572.537s">We're</a>  looking to, you know, we set a goal of 10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=575.68s">Hopefully</a>  we beat that.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=590.134s">I</a>  was just wondering how many people buzzed their heads last year and what's your goal for this year?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=596.137s">So</a>  last year I think we had about seven or eight people on our team buzz. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=599.799s">Our</a>  team was over like <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=601.246s">Yeah,</a>  maybe 10, somewhere around there, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=617.902s">I</a>  don't think you have a set amount of money you have to raise as an individual when you do a community buzz off. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=624.711s">So</a>  it's just all the money that's raised through the community goes to the actual charity. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=629.017s">So</a>  we can be a little looser on what people actually have to raise to participate.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=633.703s">Yeah,</a>  last year we raised, as a team, when it was all said and done, about $35,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=638.288s">So</a>  we're hoping to kind of get within the same ballpark, you know, hosting our own event this year, as opposed to just going to Gillette that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=645.016s">So,</a>  kind of new ground for us.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=646.597s">So</a>  will you guys get buzzed at John Brewer's, or wait and get buzzed at Gillette?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=650.582s">Yeah,</a>  we're all gonna just do it at John Brewer's that night, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=654.237s">So</a>  the actual buzz off is the next day at Gillette Stadium, but we're going to do it the day before, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=659.439s">So</a>  one mission's been great in sending us all the stuff that we need, t-shirts and banners and everything else that we're going to be decorating that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=665.662s">So</a>  we're excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=667.163s">We're</a>  really excited to try something new and see how it goes.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=670.804s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=671.885s">Go</a>  team BMO.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=673.125s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=673.785s">Thank</a>  you for taking the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=675.026s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=675.306s">We'll</a>  see you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=682.455s">Also,</a>  while we're into suspension, community participation, we were supposed to have Sean Driscoll Gomez from CCSR, but I believe he is receiving an award tonight up at the high school, so we have three individuals that will be presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=699.95s">It's</a>  the Orkton Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=703.112s">Your</a>  name and address, please, for our record. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=705.494s">My</a>  name is Kaylee Boulay.</p>

    <p>[Kaylee Boulay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=708.957s">My</a>  name is Emily Gatti.</p>

    <p>[Parviti Rana]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=711.004s">My</a>  name is Parviti Rana.</p>

    <p>[Kaylee Boulay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=713.085s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=714.927s">Hello</a>  Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=718.989s">My</a>  name is Kaylee Boulay and I'm here with Parviti Rana and Emily Gotti. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=723.312s">We</a>  are students in the ninth grade at Medford High School and we would like to present our CCSR project to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=729.737s">CCSR,</a>  also known as Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=735.132s">is</a>  a group that creates projects that work toward helping others and the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=739.893s">Our</a>  project is known as One Sapling at a Time, and we are here today to ask for your permission to create a fruit orchard on the Medford High Campus.</p>

    <p>[Parviti Rana]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=752.997s">Good</a>  afternoon once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=756.158s">As</a>  determined ninth grade students, we strive to achieve our goals to make a community a better place, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=764.14s">Our</a>  project, as you heard, is titled One Sapling at a Time, and we would essentially like to place an orchard in the back of the Medford High campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=773.062s">We</a>  would specifically like the trees to be placed on the hill outside of the community school's entrance, which if you see in the packet you have received, it's on the second page. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=786.244s">For</a>  our project, we are working with the CCSR, our advisor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=789.724s">Smith,</a>  Ben Barkin, Michael Ruggiero, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=795.373s">kindly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=796.994s">We</a>  would like to proceed on our project in the fall of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=800.016s">We</a>  would like to accomplish this by using generous donations of Mr. Ruggiero, which include blueberry bushes, labor, and soil preparations, and Mr. Barkin, which include the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=811.883s">We</a>  also will receive a small amount of funding through the Cummings Foundation, which is a CCSR mini-grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=817.967s">Currently,</a>  we are seeking additional grant funding as well to support our project. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=822.666s">Now</a>  you may have questions about maintenance, in which I will guide your attention to my colleague, Emily.</p>

    <p>[Emily Getty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=828.85s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=829.491s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=831.692s">Again,</a>  my name is Emily Gatti, and I'm a freshman at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=835.454s">So</a>  harvesting and caring for the plants is obviously not going to be an easy feat, and it's definitely not one that can be done alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=842.739s">So</a>  our solution to find help would be to reach out and recruit school clubs, such as the CCSR, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=849.003s">or</a>  other clubs to help sometime after school or on another planned date to help harvest and plant the trees during peak times, which, as Praviti said, would be later in the fall of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=863.006s">And</a>  we would also like to reach out to any other Medford High students willing to sign up, and we would, in turn, provide community service hours to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=870.827s">We</a>  could also ask community volunteers, such as the Redemption Hill Church and the Medford Family Network garden play groups.</p>

    <p>[Kaylee Boulay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=883.652s">We</a>  feel that planting fruit trees on the grounds of Medford High will have numerous benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=888.033s">The</a>  fruit trees will provide fresh fruit that will be handed out for no charge to students at the Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=895.775s">The</a>  fruit trees will provide an educational opportunity for students to learn about the planting and harvesting of the fruit trees as well as the life cycle of the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=906.562s">Having</a>  fruit trees on the grounds of Medford High will beautify the grounds on the outside area of the school by adding color and making it a more positive environment for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=915.005s">We</a>  feel that this project is very important for many reasons, including it will make Medford a nicer and happier place. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=921.467s">Helping</a>  the environment makes me feel happy and feel like a better person. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=926.349s">I</a>  want to make not just the environment a better place, but the people living in it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=931.904s">I</a>  want, we want to plant this orchard for it to benefit students at the Medford High School and people that live throughout Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=939.568s">This</a>  one change to Medford High will make the grounds in Medford High a more positive environment and a more positive school.</p>

    <p>[Parviti Rana]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=948.853s">You</a>  may be wondering why this project is so important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=952.215s">As</a>  ninth graders, we want to beautify the school and improve the general lifestyle of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=959.583s">Currently,</a>  the Medford High School has a basic connotation of a cement building, but with a unique orchard, it's a whole boost. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=968.227s">And,</a>  I mean, I haven't heard of any other school with an orchard right in their backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=974.11s">And</a>  it's a really unique aspect that I think would be a great add to Medford High.</p>

    <p>[Emily Getty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=981.215s">And</a>  for me, this project is important because as of now, I've been at Medford High for almost a year, and I consider it to be a home away from home, just as it is to many other kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=993.079s">And</a>  recently, I attended the Day on the Hill event in Boston, and one of the issues that we talked about with Medford High is trying to increase the enthusiasm <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1004.277s">of</a>  Medford High and in creating an orchard we could boost school spirit in the students because it sets Medford High apart from other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1013.461s">And</a>  it creates a beautiful place to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1017.522s">Having</a>  an orchard in the fells and adding new plant life will hopefully recharge the likeliness of the student body as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1026.106s">Do</a>  any of you have any questions for us?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1028.507s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1028.607s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1029.707s">So</a>  first I want to say I think this is an absolutely wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1034.252s">When</a>  that entranceway was refurbished some years ago, the idea always was that there should be plantings on that hill adjacent to the steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1046.875s">And</a>  it's always made me very sad that that, you know, it's just kind of a dull space rather than an exciting space. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1056.207s">I'm</a>  very enthusiastic about this project, and I really appreciate the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1061.091s">I</a>  have only one concern, which, you know, maybe you've thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1065.654s">I</a>  could see that a fallen apple could make a great missile, ball, substitute ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1077.203s">So,</a>  projectile is probably the word that I really want. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1082.667s">So</a>  I just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1084.629s">ask</a>  if you've considered that, and how would you make sure that students are respectful of the fallen fruit and that we wouldn't find it being used for target practice against the side of the school?</p>

    <p>[Parviti Rana]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1098.176s">Yes,</a>  we have considered that, and along with the maintenance, with the people volunteering, we would like to create a sort of schedule to maintain the fallen apples, so we could keep as many apples from off the field as possible.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1115.056s">maybe</a>  some signage, too, about this project and what it is might help so that the students really are respectful of it.</p>

    <p>[Parviti Rana]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1123.298s">Of</a>  course, there will be rules and regulations to the orchard for no harmfulness being done.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1130.92s">Also,</a>  in terms of the slope of the area that is to be planted, is that slope okay for the trees that you've suggested? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1141.003s">Does</a>  it matter that there's a slope?</p>

    <p>[Parviti Rana]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1143.578s">Actually,</a>  we've met with a landscaper who has laid out for us the position of the trees, which Ms.</p>

    <p>[ACxsV5H4ehA_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1150.583s">Smith</a>  will address. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1152.845s">Yeah,</a>  the slope actually is beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1155.027s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1155.447s">Yeah,</a>  so it gets all of the sun, so they'll get, you know, all the way up the orchard, they'll get sun kind of evenly distributed that way.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1162.011s">Okay,</a>  and how about watering the trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1164.333s">making</a>  sure they've got enough water.</p>

    <p>[ACxsV5H4ehA_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1165.754s">Yeah,</a>  there is water access on the side of the building, so we'll have to figure some way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1172.577s">But</a>  I know I think our buddy Mr. Ruggiero over there has experience with drip irrigation and can help us set something up.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1181.24s">And</a>  I'd like to also thank my colleague for donating the blueberries and being a help in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1188.343s">I</a>  think it's great, girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1189.644s">Thank</a>  you so much for your presentation tonight.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1193.558s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1193.778s">Benedetto?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1194.839s">First</a>  of all, I just wanted to express how impressed I am with your presentation and how comfortable you seem coming up to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1207.063s">The</a>  colored pictures, really knowing all your facts, and also giving your own personal reasons why it would matter to you really brings that emotional peace home. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1219.668s">I</a>  just wanted this time to motion to approve <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1223.471s">the</a>  apple orchard and all the other fruit at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1231.095s">I</a>  think it's a great hands-on learning opportunity for not only our high school students, but also all students educated there, especially our early childhood students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1241.159s">So,</a>  at this time, I make that motion.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1244.44s">Motion</a>  on the floor for approval, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1246.301s">Vander</a>  Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1247.042s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1248.295s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1248.855s">This</a>  is lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1250.236s">I</a>  think it's an exciting project and certainly I'd be happy to not look at that current field. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1260.343s">The</a>  soil is, I mean, I realize these are not just fruits where you have to care a lot about a regular vegetable garden where soil matters a lot, but is the soil acceptable as it's been tested and is perfectly fine?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1273.592s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1274.552s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1275.133s">That's</a>  all I wanted to know.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1276.574s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1278.386s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero, you have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1279.987s">So</a>  we had the reddismith and the landscaper and I, we walked the area and sort of viewed and we also did some soil tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1289.192s">For</a>  the high bush blueberries, the soil isn't quite acidic enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1292.915s">If</a>  possible, I'm happy to donate the plastic mulch, the thyme, and also the sulfur. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1297.758s">But</a>  if possible, I'd like to start preparing the soil so we can get the pH. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1302.46s">Right</a>  now the pH is around six, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1305.685s">It's</a>  way too high for blueberries, so we have to drop that around to about 4.5 or 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1310.007s">So</a>  I'm happy to donate all the preparations for blueberries, but these other plants that were chosen, I looked them up and I talked to some horticultural friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1317.931s">These</a>  are all really great plants that they've chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1320.653s">We</a>  just have to touch up a little bit with the blueberries.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1323.194s">What</a>  work is involved in doing that?</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1325.836s">Well,</a>  it depends if the club would like to plant this September. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1331.039s">There's</a>  a couple of options that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1332.639s">It</a>  would be best to rototill the area for the blueberries. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1335.9s">I</a>  already have about 30 plants and containers, and I have all the plastic mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1340.541s">So</a>  what I would recommend would be to rototill the area, spread some sulfur, and then give it a couple of months, and then we can apply some, I have prepared some acidic wood chips, so that'll help as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1357.056s">And</a>  I would prefer to get that done as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1359.657s">It'll</a>  take me probably about a couple of days, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1362.238s">I</a>  just need to rototill it, lay down the plastic mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1365.82s">We</a>  have to measure it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1366.66s">I</a>  also can, I'll send down all the drip irrigation.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1371.542s">Very</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1371.983s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1373.083s">I</a>  just have a question also. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1375.704s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1375.904s">If</a>  we're curious to see.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1381.567s">Yes,</a>  of course, happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1383.327s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1383.548s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1385.302s">I</a>  just wanted to thank you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1386.904s">It</a>  was excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1387.965s">And</a>  the brochure with the pictures, I can see the vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1390.908s">It</a>  looks so beautiful with the plants and the trees and the blueberries. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1395.773s">Thank</a>  you, Michael, for your donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1397.975s">And</a>  I just had a question about the deer population that is in the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1403.961s">Do</a>  you think that we're going to attract <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1405.978s">deers</a>  and maybe coming close to the school.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1409.183s">This</a>  would be up to the school committee, how we handle this problem.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1415.674s">The</a>  way I handle this on my farm is we have an electric fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1420.022s">I'm</a>  happy to, once again, I'll donate the T-poles and the wiring, and I'll set it up for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1426.725s">My</a>  fence has 7,000 volts that run through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1428.966s">Obviously</a>  it won't hurt anyone, but it could be a great prank for kids to mess around with, so we'll have to talk with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1435.209s">If</a>  you want me to install it, we definitely need to shut it down during school hours, and we'll have to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1441.532s">But</a>  it's possible we could turn it on once school is not in session, and then I could put it on a timer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1447.495s">and</a>  then we can shut it off once it's on eight o'clock and deer won't bother you.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1452.456s">So</a>  if a person was to walk towards the electric fence, would they get shocked? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1456.437s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1457.537s">Because</a>  I'm just one of the people with that night.</p>
