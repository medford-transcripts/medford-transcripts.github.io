1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:07,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for joining us recording in progress.

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,938
[SPEAKER_17]: This meeting is being recorded so you just have to hit the got it.

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,580
[SPEAKER_17]: So, again, good evening everybody.

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Brianna here.

6
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:20,425
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to first start just by introducing some city staff.

7
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:28,311
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Steve our communications director labeled Jackie right now but we also have chief jack Buckley.

8
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,913
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Todd Blake our director of

9
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:32,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Traffic and Transportation.

10
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:37,326
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have Tim McGivern, our Department of Public Works Commissioner.

11
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,508
[SPEAKER_17]: And we thank you for being here.

12
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:53,638
[SPEAKER_17]: We are recording so that we can put it on our website and put it on Medford Community Media, considering that Medford is so largely made up of private ways, less than half, but we have a good close to 40% that are private ways.

13
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:59,362
[SPEAKER_17]: And we wanna just give a little explanation of private ways.

14
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:01,163
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is mainly for the enforcement

15
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,440
[SPEAKER_17]: on private ways.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:10,424
[SPEAKER_17]: We get a lot of calls asking questions, especially since we have the fells and we have the Mystic Lakes.

17
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:14,767
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a lot of parking concerns that are always brought to our attention.

18
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:22,132
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we wanted to have this meeting several months before the Green Line actually opens, which we are excited about.

19
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:24,933
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to open in August, September timeframe.

20
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:27,755
[SPEAKER_17]: And we want to make sure that

21
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:35,069
[SPEAKER_17]: you have the proper information so that you're able to enforce on your private ways, which we know is gonna be important.

22
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:39,231
[SPEAKER_17]: And this was also a recommendation of the parking task force.

23
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:52,618
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I see Fred Roach, who was on that committee, as well as Jim Silva, who helped guide the city in bringing parking enforcement in-house and obviously gave us a number of recommendations for private ways and enforcement.

24
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:54,679
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that, I'm going to,

25
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,081
[SPEAKER_17]: turn it over to Todd Blake our director of traffic and transportation to start us off.

26
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:02,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

27
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:10,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone for coming in, attending this q amp a session.

28
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:12,365
[SPEAKER_04]: As the mayor mentioned.

29
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:22,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Many times throughout the course of the, you know, our, our business, and throughout traffic commission meetings, and the commission park policy enforcement meetings.

30
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:36,702
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a consistent question that comes up regarding private ways, particularly if the city's traffic commission is not able to post resident parking on a private way, then what

31
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:50,988
[SPEAKER_04]: What is left for private way residents to do about that so this is to try to help guide and explain and inform the public of what their options may be based on our interpretation of master in a lot.

32
00:02:51,328 --> 00:03:00,112
[SPEAKER_04]: We do want to specify with a big asterisk that none of this is any to be construed as any official legal advice regarding.

33
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,772
[SPEAKER_04]: park on private ways.

34
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:12,537
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just our understanding and we're trying to guide and inform people since we've been informed by others that there was a lack of information on the subject.

35
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:19,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to improve upon that and have this dialogue and discussion with all of you.

36
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:28,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of enforcement,

37
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:43,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have had requests in the past resident parking on private ways but but based upon the law, the master log, our interpretation of it is that the owners of that.

38
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:46,882
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing is very clear the city does not own.

39
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:50,523
[SPEAKER_04]: private ways unless we're a butter to the private way, or.

40
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:59,547
[SPEAKER_04]: So, one thing that's very clear the city doesn't own it in the master law refers to the owners of the private way may do this and may do that.

41
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:13,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so we know that the city is not the owner that others are the owner and so the, whoever the owners may be of a private way certain rights to restrict parking.

42
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:38,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're hoping to, you know, there's a process that the police may refer to in the documents that we added to the city's website regarding if owners of a highway do take that route and post signs for residents only, there's a certain process that has to be followed before they tow someone.

43
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:44,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And the document that's online explains that and the chief could touch upon that as well.

44
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:56,102
[SPEAKER_11]: In a sense, private ways, private property, we can look at that.

45
00:04:56,122 --> 00:05:04,323
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get into discussion of what the city will provide for services on this sort of way, because we have to provide certain services for public safety reasons.

46
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:13,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And under that guise, the city ordinance has passed regulations of what the police department can enforce, right?

47
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:17,486
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm gonna run those down, the seven aspects of,

48
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:21,510
[SPEAKER_11]: When an individual parks in a private way that is a non resident right.

49
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:29,519
[SPEAKER_11]: In some cases, even the residents, for example, you can't park and unregister uninsured more vehicle in a private way, the police can enforce and take action on that.

50
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,704
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't park a vehicle within 10 feet of a fire hydrant for obvious public safety reasons.

51
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:42,627
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot block or obstruct a driveway on the areas, and you can't park within 20 feet of an intersection.

52
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:50,468
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also not park your vehicle in such a manner that it would block an emergency vehicle from having access to the street.

53
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:59,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Ambulances, fire trucks, police vehicles need access to every residence, even on private ways, and if you block or obstruct that, we can do enforcement.

54
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:07,234
[SPEAKER_11]: The same goes for blocking or obstructing a snowplow during a snowstorm, right?

55
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:12,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have to provide a clear path for those emergency vehicles.

56
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,144
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the snowplows need access to move the snow so that emergency vehicles can get there.

57
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,967
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last one is a 48-hour restriction, right?

58
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:34,579
[SPEAKER_11]: It follows, in some sense, the abandoned motor vehicle law in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, but if somebody parked on your private way and left that vehicle for more than 40 hours, who's a non-resident, we could enforce and tag and remove that vehicle.

59
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,081
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a city ordinance, that's statutorily what we can do.

60
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:47,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Outside of that though, and unfortunately, because it is a private way, we have no authority in the police.

61
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:52,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we could commonly ask questions, why can't the police just come up and enforce this vehicle?

62
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:58,809
[SPEAKER_11]: But there exists no legal premise or statute for us to be able to do that.

63
00:06:59,169 --> 00:06:59,309
[SPEAKER_11]: And,

64
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:08,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Having said that many times over the last three years, we still get the questions about, you know, why can't you?

65
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:11,378
[SPEAKER_11]: And just think of it as this like...

66
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:18,096
[SPEAKER_11]: If the loss is private property, I couldn't come in your driveway and tow your vehicle for no reasons.

67
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,558
[SPEAKER_11]: It's similar.

68
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:26,485
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't send my police department to enforce laws that are not public way laws.

69
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:31,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And it puts the city liable for enforcement on that.

70
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:43,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a quick and, you know, sort of straightforward assessment of what we can do in limited enforcement, but it's not generally what we're called for.

71
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:51,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I know that when we get into the question and answer section, there'll be a lot of other questions related to that, and I'll be prepared to answer them as best we can.

72
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Todd, I think in the chat there was a question how do we know.

73
00:07:58,942 --> 00:07:59,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

74
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:12,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I just responded to that saying, we, the city has a list of public and private streets, I believe it's already posted on city website but maybe we could post in the chat link to it.

75
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:29,645
[SPEAKER_04]: That list is is somewhat generic in the sense that it listed by entire street there are some streets that are portions of them a public and portions of private so if anyone has any question about that, we could help answer that as well.

76
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:35,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

77
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,011
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're just going to get into answering a lot of questions as they start to pop up.

78
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you can move back and forth.

79
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:47,754
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did see like one of the first questions was, how do we document and demonstrate that a vehicle's been parked on a private way for more than 48 hours.

80
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,895
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's two sort of aspects of that.

81
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:53,445
[SPEAKER_11]: You first have to notify the police department.

82
00:08:53,505 --> 00:09:02,795
[SPEAKER_11]: We would go out and just mark and notify and make notice that the vehicle is there and return 48 hours and if the vehicle is still there, we would move the vehicle under that statute.

83
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:04,857
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't forget, this is a private way.

84
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:09,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you comply with the statute that we're talking about today,

85
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,418
[SPEAKER_11]: 48 hours only a legal standard for the police to remove the vehicle.

86
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:22,905
[SPEAKER_11]: If you post it that it is a private way and you give fair notice, owners on a private way could remove that vehicle, you know, immediately.

87
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:29,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So that the 48 hour notice is really only for purposes of the police actually doing the removal of the vehicle.

88
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:37,424
[SPEAKER_04]: So another question appears to be specifically about Parkway Road and Equavia.

89
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:52,891
[SPEAKER_04]: We do list those as private ways on our city website so if a street like that may have had resident permit posted in the past, it may have been a mistake to do so.

90
00:09:53,011 --> 00:10:01,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to go forward with adhering to what we believe the rules to be regarding private ways.

91
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:16,312
[SPEAKER_04]: With the exception of the safety violations on a private way, we believe the onus is on the owners of the private way to restrict parking to residents only not city because the city is not an owner of that way.

92
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:27,242
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another question about, can we opt out of being a private way.

93
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:29,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting way to say it.

94
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:38,330
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a process to request to be accepted as a public street but that's, we're not.

95
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,573
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't envisioning getting into that process at this meeting but there is a process to do so.

96
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:59,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important that we do get into that if possible, because I mean, I hear the word private and I mean, usually there's like some benefit to that, but I just don't see any benefit.

97
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like there's just a lot of cost involved.

98
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:11,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know private ways proceed probably almost everybody who's here, but it just seems like, you know, people use our road all the time.

99
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,800
[SPEAKER_02]: The wear and tear is not just done by the people who

100
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,283
[SPEAKER_02]: live on this road.

101
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:24,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm one of those people who lives on Pond Circle slash Equavia slash Parkway.

102
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:32,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, people park there for the pond, people fly through there off of Elm Street.

103
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:39,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if it's a private way, do we have the right to block it off as long as we're not blocking emergency vehicles or snowplows?

104
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:45,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief, I don't know if you want to dive in, but I'll attempt to answer that.

105
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So no, you cannot block it.

106
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:52,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a way that's available to others.

107
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:59,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So it shouldn't be treated as a gated community or something like that.

108
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,808
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be available to the public.

109
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:09,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the way a lot of these streets originate, I'm not going to say exactly for each and every street, but generally think about way back when,

110
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:20,675
[SPEAKER_04]: There was land, it was probably wooded land, and then at some point someone purchased the land and developed it and separated it into parcels and created a street.

111
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:29,056
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, whoever did that didn't apply or didn't go through the process to be accepted as a public street.

112
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:32,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And that may leave you in the position you're in now.

113
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:41,699
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of, I didn't track all the questions in that, but that's the general gist of that.

114
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:43,595
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey Todd.

115
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:44,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

116
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:57,321
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll chime in here to say that if there are private way owners on furniture private ways and you'd like to discuss the process of going from a private way to a public way.

117
00:12:57,982 --> 00:13:01,003
[SPEAKER_22]: You can talk to me personally and I will go through that with you.

118
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:09,207
[SPEAKER_22]: But I believe that this forum is specifically related to parking so I want to try to keep it, keep it, keep it there.

119
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,887
[SPEAKER_22]: I know a lot of the concerns out there having to do with, you know, why isn't this public?

120
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,169
[SPEAKER_22]: where private really kind of screws things up.

121
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:21,271
[SPEAKER_22]: The public does have a whole series of rights within a private way.

122
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:30,215
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't pay taxes on it, but it really, the question of title and rights is murky at best when it comes to legal things, but parking is pretty clear.

123
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:38,199
[SPEAKER_22]: The city does provide a range of services on private ways here in Medford that a lot of other towns don't provide.

124
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:40,220
[SPEAKER_22]: So snow clearing, for example, just an example.

125
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,481
[SPEAKER_22]: So anyway,

126
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:52,271
[SPEAKER_22]: With that, if you want to know specifics about the process going from private to public, we can save that for a forum or specific conversations with me with the city engineer.

127
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:52,872
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

128
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Tim.

129
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,937
[SPEAKER_17]: So thanks, Madam Mayor, for having this meeting.

130
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:58,738
[SPEAKER_17]: One second.

131
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Lisa, if you don't mind, we just want to present first and then we're going to take questions.

132
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Todd, will you screen share the

133
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:10,297
[SPEAKER_17]: enforcement piece and what would need to be, can you present on that first?

134
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,181
[SPEAKER_17]: So that people will watch the recording and then questions will come after.

135
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:14,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

136
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:16,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

137
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:30,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the documents that have been shared on the city website is this document explaining, oh, this is the tow form, sorry.

138
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:50,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this, this is the first of three documents that are shared on the website, explaining private way restrictions what the police have the right to enforce on it.

139
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:56,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it touches upon references the mass general law.

140
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are open to read it interpret it as they see fit.

141
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:12,818
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just trying to guide and inform as best we can to help, because, again, we have heard that there was a lack of guidance or help or information on this so that's what we're trying to do here.

142
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,502
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is all available on the city website.

143
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:28,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, to reiterate what I said earlier, it's basically saying the owners have the right to restrict parking, but they have to do it in such a way that's outlined based on that law.

144
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:33,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the police are trying to facilitate that by providing these documents.

145
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:44,002
[SPEAKER_04]: The next document is the petition itself.

146
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:53,755
[SPEAKER_04]: which basically the owners of the private way would submit this saying we the owners, you know, we contract with this tow company.

147
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:55,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are our signatures.

148
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:59,481
[SPEAKER_04]: We're saying that, you know, we're going to go through this process.

149
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:04,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a form that needs to be submitted.

150
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief, please interrupt me if I'm explaining it wrong.

151
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:20,731
[SPEAKER_04]: before a car is towed off your private way, assuming it was posted properly according to this master law, then you would inform the police department using this next slip here.

152
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:31,674
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the tow form.

153
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:38,228
[SPEAKER_04]: that a private entity would submit to the police before towing a vehicle.

154
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:42,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically an FYI.

155
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not call the police to tow the vehicle for you.

156
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:53,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the owners of the private way have read the law and posted it per the law in contract with the tow company.

157
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in order they're FYI in the police that they are towing per this provision.

158
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:06,998
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a requirement under the law that you notify the police department so that we know where the vehicle is.

159
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:14,324
[SPEAKER_11]: We know what is going on in the street and it prevents, you know, report, you know, someone from reporting that the vehicle was stolen when it really wasn't.

160
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:22,031
[SPEAKER_11]: It prevents, you know, any of the arguments that could have, but not if you're doing an act private way towing, you have to notify the police prior to doors.

161
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:24,433
[SPEAKER_11]: We won't tell you no as long, you know what I mean?

162
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:34,054
[SPEAKER_11]: you operate under the existence of the statute in the private property that you're on, but we just have to be notified.

163
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:37,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you taking questions?

164
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:40,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

165
00:17:40,915 --> 00:18:00,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, it seems very futile to go through this process by the time you do it the car could be gone and putting the onus on a resident of Medford to privately tow a car can start a whole cascade of problems.

166
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,722
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's why we have our elected officials and police department to do that for us.

167
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:11,984
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's a very poor idea to do that personally.

168
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:23,249
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to just add to that point and because I think we're going to get that sentiment all night long, but it's not an idea of the city of medfeds it's not a new plan.

169
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:28,592
[SPEAKER_11]: This is mass general law, we are bound to abide by the statute.

170
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:32,414
[SPEAKER_11]: and this isn't, it's not something that is new.

171
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:37,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Most cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts abide by this same statute.

172
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:48,141
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying, you know, I feel, I know you're going to feel as residents that it's a burden put upon you, but it is the statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that put upon us.

173
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:49,342
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the City of Met.

174
00:18:49,962 --> 00:19:02,775
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the law, and this is the only way I can't violate the law, because, you know, because it is more convenient, but this process works in most cities and towns in Massachusetts.

175
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:04,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.

176
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

177
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it and Mayor Thank you for holding this meeting and, and chief.

178
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:19,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you specifically to one of your offices on Sunday night who came out and at 1030 at night to take up a car that was blocking my driveway and my neighbor's driveway.

179
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:26,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on Fulton Spring Road and I know that some of my other neighbors are here and I'm on Fulton Spring from Fellsway to Fulton Street.

180
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:34,400
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the renters on Fulton Street come and park on Fulton Spring Road.

181
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,480
[SPEAKER_09]: It is ridiculous.

182
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,481
[SPEAKER_09]: They stay here for days on end.

183
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:39,622
[SPEAKER_09]: They are parked right up to the corner.

184
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:44,345
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got no respect for driveways, fire hydrants, anything.

185
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:46,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It is absolutely incredible.

186
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:48,307
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a two-way street.

187
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:52,189
[SPEAKER_09]: We have eight drop-off and pickups.

188
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,610
[SPEAKER_09]: four in the morning, four in the afternoon, all the schools.

189
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:02,491
[SPEAKER_09]: This street is overwhelmed, not to mention the fact that people fly down the street at about 100 miles an hour.

190
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:03,371
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that.

191
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.

192
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:07,772
[SPEAKER_09]: It is this street.

193
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:12,293
[SPEAKER_09]: When I have to back out of my driveway, I make a sign of the cross.

194
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:17,014
[SPEAKER_09]: The first thing I do, because I don't know whether or not I'm going to live, pulling into my own street.

195
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:19,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't pull into my driveway.

196
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:21,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't back out of my driveway.

197
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:21,715
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so

198
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:24,076
[SPEAKER_09]: insane up here.

199
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:31,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with resident parking only.

200
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we at least get.

201
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:35,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean we can do that as a street.

202
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so yes, that's a great question.

203
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, the way we understand it is the owners of the private way whoever they may be.

204
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:52,857
[SPEAKER_04]: could contract with the tow company to post those that will come to post signs on your street.

205
00:20:53,698 --> 00:21:01,181
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if it's posted properly, you know clearly that's always own it's for that street residents only.

206
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:07,444
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some pieces of information that would be helpful to have on the sign to make sure that you don't ask the right questions.

207
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:15,099
[SPEAKER_13]: And just for one second, so just so we can go through this really and get to everyone who wants to ask questions and everything.

208
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:21,421
[SPEAKER_13]: I know some of you have been doing this, but if you can just raise your hand through the reaction and then we'll try to get everybody.

209
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:24,062
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also I know there's some questions in the chat.

210
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:31,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to meet everybody so we can, everyone can ask their questions and we can hear kind of better what everyone is trying to say.

211
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:34,546
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think Lisa, I think you already asked your question.

212
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,986
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we'll go to Fran next.

213
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:37,007
[SPEAKER_13]: So hold on, let me just.

214
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:43,585
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you sign up for the queue to ask a question?

215
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Go to the reaction on the bottom.

216
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:48,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

217
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:52,908
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I think you see the little hand, raise hand right there.

218
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:57,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it's also helpful if you write stack in the comments and then we could go that way.

219
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:59,070
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be useful.

220
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,391
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see a raised hand.

221
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:02,931
[SPEAKER_18]: I see a thumbs up.

222
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, here's a raised hand.

223
00:22:05,372 --> 00:22:05,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

224
00:22:16,745 --> 00:22:17,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I hold on, hold on.

225
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Todd.

226
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was just going to finish my response to Lisa.

227
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:41,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so the owners of private way could contract the toll company to post signs the science to say certain pieces of information make it clear to everyone that that is a total offense and they're going to get told.

228
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:57,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do have an example of a sign in Somerville, as I just wanted to go backwards a little bit and say that yeah Medford is a little unusual in the number of streets that are private as compared to some of our neighbors, but, but as the chief said, this does exist elsewhere.

229
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:03,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And one example is from Somerville assigned from some of that I could show you that, you know, it gives.

230
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:14,121
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not saying this is a sign you have to use or anything like that we're just trying to provide information to the public of what you know the options may be for you.

231
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:18,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's an example of Woodbine Street in Somerville.

232
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:21,864
[SPEAKER_04]: They contracted with, in this case Pat's towing.

233
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:34,799
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the tow company's name, the phone number, clearly states that unauthorized would be towed, and it specifies the street that it pertains to in the residence.

234
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a, you know, these are just two examples, one color, one black and white.

235
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,790
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the, and then in terms of the city.

236
00:23:45,891 --> 00:24:05,307
[SPEAKER_04]: The city may assist in the form of putting a sign at the entrance to a private way that indicates that, you know, whether it's on the street name sign itself and it says, excuse me says private way or assign like this under a street name sign that says private way, this should read parking maybe for residents only.

237
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:11,332
[SPEAKER_04]: But it kind of warns the public that, you know, you're entering a street that's not public anymore.

238
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So look for these signs.

239
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,280
[SPEAKER_09]: See that thank you very much for the clarification.

240
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

241
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:25,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Herb is next.

242
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:25,804
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get to him.

243
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:27,125
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was I was.

244
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:27,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry.

245
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:28,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

246
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:41,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So I live in the old high school, and my unit faces Hall Ave, I look down on Hall Ave, and Hall Ave is a nightmare.

247
00:24:45,431 --> 00:25:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's probably used it, but between the fire trucks and so forth that use it to get up to the senior housing behind us and the commuters who use it to cut through so they don't have to wait at the light, it's just bedlam, absolute bedlam.

248
00:25:08,968 --> 00:25:11,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And they,

249
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:18,129
[SPEAKER_06]: The potholes that appeared during the winter are ridiculous.

250
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:23,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can't pave the street unless we pay for it ourselves.

251
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not like we have a cozy little neighborhood here.

252
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:32,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like our building and then scattered other houses.

253
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,643
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know anybody else who lives on Hall Ave.

254
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:38,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, Trent.

255
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:42,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to ask, do you have a parking-related question?

256
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:46,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because there's a lot of folks waiting in line to ask questions.

257
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:56,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Tim mentioned earlier, we could potentially have some other forum, some future data about other things other than parking.

258
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:57,956
[SPEAKER_06]: But in a way, I do.

259
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:04,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Because with the Chevalier Theater here, people park wherever they want.

260
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know they're not supposed to park within four feet or whatever it is of a curb.

261
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:15,586
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not supposed to block driveways, and it happens all the time.

262
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:25,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I don't see the reality that people are going to respond to all the complaints that we can have.

263
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:31,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So this process that we're trying to help inform folks with, you know, could help.

264
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,211
[SPEAKER_04]: the parking situation that you just described on Hall Ave.

265
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:51,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the owners of Hall Ave went about this process and got these signs and posted them, then the tow zone signs may have an impact to people, whether they're coming to a theater event or otherwise from parking on your street.

266
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:54,615
[SPEAKER_06]: But it has to be we who are the activists.

267
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:58,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, whoever the owners of the private way may be.

268
00:26:59,578 --> 00:26:59,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

269
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:05,100
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know, since we don't know any of the other owners on the street.

270
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:08,822
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd have to go knocking on doors or something right.

271
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:16,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, one of the forms, well however way you go about doing it, one of the forms that I'll share it again.

272
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:23,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a petition form that shows the owners of the private way signed it and say we hereby are contracting with this tow company.

273
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back to that one.

274
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:33,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I think in case he is next.

275
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:45,916
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the owners of the private way would all sign this and say that they're, they've contracted with the tow company, and they're forming the city that this is what they're doing.

276
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:50,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And to anticipate future requests or not request future.

277
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:57,183
[SPEAKER_04]: FYI, so please departments and the other form that they're telling someone, I can get this at City Hall.

278
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:01,817
[SPEAKER_04]: This is that form is online at the city website.

279
00:28:02,357 --> 00:28:06,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we can make it available hard copy at the city as well.

280
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:09,645
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to use that form, I don't believe for the petition.

281
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:16,972
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just one mechanism for the owners to use to help inform the city that that's what the owners are going about.

282
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

283
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:20,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct, Chief.

284
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:22,127
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

285
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:26,709
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just going to add real quick, because I see a number of the questions in the chat, and it might help eliminate some of them.

286
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:29,950
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're blocking your driveway on a private way, call the police.

287
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,971
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do something about blocking the driveway.

288
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:37,093
[SPEAKER_11]: That is one of the ordinances that we can enforce.

289
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:39,894
[SPEAKER_11]: So a number of people put that in the chat.

290
00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:42,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought I'll hopefully resolve some of your issues.

291
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:46,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was next.

292
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:48,589
[SPEAKER_12]: No, wait, they called my name.

293
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:49,789
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Casey's next.

294
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:50,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

295
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Along those lines, we just had this happen last weekend.

296
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:57,492
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did call the police.

297
00:28:57,532 --> 00:28:59,813
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a motorcycle parked in our driveway.

298
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:03,554
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't blocking the car so they couldn't get out.

299
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:06,075
[SPEAKER_12]: So it wasn't blocked, but it was in our driveway.

300
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:10,837
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want some clarification on because the police did not

301
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:18,078
[SPEAKER_12]: want to come and tell it, they said it was our responsibility, even though it was technically in our driveway.

302
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:26,424
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is question number one and then question number two did I hear correctly, that the city can post resident parking signs.

303
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:30,846
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'll address the second question first.

304
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:36,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in one of the recommendations from the Commission on parking policy and enforcement.

305
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:52,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It was recommended that one thing the city could potentially do to help would be to post a sign at the entryway near the street name sign that says this a private way parking may be restricted to residents only like as a warning or notice.

306
00:29:52,988 --> 00:29:59,772
[SPEAKER_04]: but that wouldn't negate the need for the owners to have the signs on the street themselves with the tow company and all that.

307
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:02,354
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would purely be informational only.

308
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:04,235
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't say this is the restriction.

309
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:09,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just be a warning to other residents that are leaving a public way into a private way.

310
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:11,420
[SPEAKER_12]: That would still be helpful.

311
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,222
[SPEAKER_12]: So I live on Lakeview and it's a short street.

312
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:22,627
[SPEAKER_12]: If you put a sign on either end of that, that would be helpful because on the street sign,

313
00:30:23,063 --> 00:30:27,705
[SPEAKER_12]: You need major magnifying glasses to see the word private way.

314
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:29,966
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nobody that's ever going to see that.

315
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:35,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're evaluating that and we're working towards something to help address that.

316
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:36,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

317
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:44,514
[SPEAKER_12]: And what about the situation that just happened with me with the motorcycle in my driveway that didn't want to deal with it.

318
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:49,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so not to complicate or confuse the matter but in private way now is a way where

319
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:56,161
[SPEAKER_11]: While it's deemed private, there's access to the public to use as a way, right?

320
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:56,961
[SPEAKER_11]: So they'll go through.

321
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:03,264
[SPEAKER_11]: And for public safety reasons, we have the authority and right to enforce certain violations on the way.

322
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:10,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you transition onto your property, whether it's your front lawn or a driveway, that's strictly private property.

323
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:11,409
[SPEAKER_11]: And again,

324
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:16,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not telling you this is my opinion or because I don't want the police officers to do it.

325
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:23,172
[SPEAKER_11]: By statute, by law, we cannot send it and remove something from your private property, even if it doesn't belong to you.

326
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:25,009
[SPEAKER_11]: such as a motor vehicle.

327
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:27,310
[SPEAKER_11]: It's odd that it happens, right?

328
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,093
[SPEAKER_11]: I think some people in the public are shocked that somebody would just park in your driveway.

329
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:42,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It does happen throughout the year and we have no authority and we have to act under legal authority or, you know, as the police department, we cross certain lines and we get ourselves in trouble, but we are not allowed to do that by statute.

330
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:47,405
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it gets difficult for us to sometimes explain that to people.

331
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:54,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if this is a perfect comparison, but if you think of, say, Wegmans, they own a big parking lot in a private property.

332
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,953
[SPEAKER_11]: If they say, hey, we don't want you parking in this area, well, they can tow you, right?

333
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:04,336
[SPEAKER_11]: We wouldn't go down there and tow them unless it was for certain specific public safety type areas.

334
00:32:04,597 --> 00:32:07,979
[SPEAKER_11]: So a private property owner can just say, you can't park on my property.

335
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:08,839
[SPEAKER_11]: I own the property.

336
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:11,601
[SPEAKER_11]: I have direct control of the property, and you have to remove it.

337
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:16,565
[SPEAKER_11]: But we can't, as a public entity, go onto your private property and enforce those things.

338
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:24,770
[SPEAKER_11]: So, is this there I get it we're talking about private way but there is a difference and once they're on your private property, we have no authority to act.

339
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:30,674
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the answer you're looking for but I think it's two points.

340
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:39,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim, not to put you too much on the spot but if you had a sentence that explains the difference between private way and private property or parcel, that would maybe be helpful.

341
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:45,234
[SPEAKER_22]: private ways, the public has rights associated with the way, and you don't pay taxes on it.

342
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:51,997
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a parcel of land that's designated for access to the buildings that are on it.

343
00:32:52,677 --> 00:33:00,682
[SPEAKER_22]: So, the only difference that it really has not been accepted formally by the city and there's a process for that that was referred to earlier.

344
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:03,303
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, that's how streets begin.

345
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:07,826
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw some questions about, you know, converting it or removing the private way aspect of it.

346
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:17,953
[SPEAKER_22]: What begins as private property all begins as private property, and it is a either a donation or taking by the municipality to make it a public way that can be an easement or title.

347
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:20,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I think Rachel's next.

348
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:27,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, sorry, I was just unmuting.

349
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:41,073
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of my questions was in the chat, which is that I am on a private way, but part of my driveway is part of my yard is paved and people keep parking in that even though I have a sign that says private property, no parking.

350
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:46,417
[SPEAKER_19]: So obviously, I understand now that the police cannot come and remove people from my yard.

351
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:51,000
[SPEAKER_19]: So do I have to personally contact a towing company and put a sign in

352
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,395
[SPEAKER_19]: of my yard that says this towing company will tow you if you park here.

353
00:33:55,415 --> 00:34:01,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that like separate from the private way signs we would need to get?

354
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:02,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Because this actually happens daily.

355
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:05,987
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm right by the fells and there's somebody parked on my lawn daily.

356
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:06,228
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

357
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:22,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So I here's the best and quickest answer I can give you so that I recommend all the time that anybody was private property post something at least to the minimum of this is no trespassing right to your private property they can as soon as it's posted fair notices given.

358
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:22,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

359
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:23,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

360
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:27,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, that's not a way right where we want to post it slightly

361
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:34,458
[SPEAKER_11]: private and they pull up onto that property, you have the authority to have that vehicle removed by law.

362
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:39,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I still say according to statute, you have to notify the police department that you're doing it so that we know what's going on.

363
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:48,154
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can, when the owner calls and says, Hey, Mike, I was told, we can explain to them that it was properly notified and properly acted under the law.

364
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:49,775
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I mean,

365
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:58,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I don't want to just, we have to be careful about jumping into the rights of private owners, private landowners.

366
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:03,501
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can post anything you want there and give them fair notice, but enforcing it, it would be on you.

367
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:09,667
[SPEAKER_11]: But a simple no trespassing sign, because you can trespass by motor vehicle, et cetera, onto your vehicle.

368
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:11,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So just put that up there and you would benefit.

369
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:14,031
[SPEAKER_11]: I suggest everybody does that to the property anyway.

370
00:35:14,717 --> 00:35:14,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

371
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:25,110
[SPEAKER_19]: And my other question, which is related and also somebody else asked it in the chat is, I'm on a corner, and my address is on Governor's Ave, which is a public way.

372
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:30,096
[SPEAKER_19]: But my side yard, as well as my driveway is on a private way.

373
00:35:30,637 --> 00:35:33,521
[SPEAKER_19]: So am I an owner of that private way?

374
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:45,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll answer this and then Sam if I botch it you could jump in but basically, if you're a corner lot, you still have you but the private ways so you likely very likely still have rights to it.

375
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:48,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And you may be an owner that.

376
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:50,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

377
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:52,175
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes and no.

378
00:35:54,449 --> 00:36:05,495
[SPEAKER_22]: This gray area here, so I would tread carefully on giving any advice in this area, but you look at things called frontage and look at how the way is laid out.

379
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:21,783
[SPEAKER_22]: So if your private way has boundary lines and is attached to Governor's Ave and Governor's Ave is public and you have frontage on both, then zoning is gonna define what that frontage means on the public way, but not necessarily on the private way.

380
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:27,634
[SPEAKER_22]: So frontage is related to rights of a parcel owner, a building parcel.

381
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:29,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for saving me on that one, Tim.

382
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:34,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a good opportunity to reiterate that none of this should be considered official legal advice.

383
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:38,480
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just general information guidance to try to help folks.

384
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:50,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that regard, I guess I could restate that the Mass General Law refers to the owners of the private way, and I would say whoever those owners may be, and we don't necessarily know

385
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:56,629
[SPEAKER_04]: The city doesn't necessarily know beyond the owners of their butters to determine that.

386
00:36:57,991 --> 00:36:59,032
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Herb is next.

387
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:06,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'd like to pick up for a second.

388
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:12,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this forum is packing, but I'd just like to pick up on what Fran said before.

389
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I live on Whittier Road, which is a private way.

390
00:37:16,642 --> 00:37:20,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And the road is like a minefield of potholes.

391
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:24,947
[SPEAKER_03]: They fill them in, but we all know filling in a pothole lasts about a week.

392
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:32,091
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of city, you know, Eversource, I think is doing some work on Winthrop streets.

393
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:34,112
[SPEAKER_03]: We got trucks back and forth.

394
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:38,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So the real question is, well, I'll give you one thing.

395
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,156
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years ago, we all chipped in.

396
00:37:41,196 --> 00:37:45,018
[SPEAKER_03]: The town put in half and the residents, we all put in about

397
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:51,990
[SPEAKER_03]: seven or $800 the town did, and we had the street repaved about 30, 35 years ago.

398
00:37:52,911 --> 00:38:03,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, without going through the process of becoming a public way, how can we get our street, our private way repaved?

399
00:38:06,822 --> 00:38:09,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do we have to go through the process of becoming a public way?

400
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,104
[SPEAKER_03]: You got this one Tim.

401
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:17,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim do you want to.

402
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:20,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it isn't parking related.

403
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:37,400
[SPEAKER_22]: But I will, I will say that there have been programs in the past city has had where private way owners can get together and partner with the city on payment jobs restoration, I would say that right now, our primary focus is to try to

404
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:43,169
[SPEAKER_22]: manage the roadways that we are obligated to manage, which are the public ways.

405
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:49,496
[SPEAKER_22]: That's where our state aid comes from, and we try to use every single penny of it in the public way.

406
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:56,365
[SPEAKER_22]: That doesn't mean that the city hasn't in the past and can't in the future partner with public, sorry, private way owners.

407
00:38:56,405 --> 00:38:57,626
[SPEAKER_22]: It is, I believe, allowed by ordinance.

408
00:38:58,832 --> 00:38:59,953
[SPEAKER_22]: to do things like that.

409
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:08,381
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know private way owners recently have partnered with National Grid, because National Grid will come in, replace the gas line and only pave half the street.

410
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:11,503
[SPEAKER_22]: So, there's efficiencies there I know that has happened.

411
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:14,806
[SPEAKER_22]: And besides that, you know the city does.

412
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:24,859
[SPEAKER_22]: kind of take a look at private ways because the DPW also looks at the public safety aspect as well and keeping things clear.

413
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:35,847
[SPEAKER_22]: So we, you know, have a very relatively long history of doing things like plowing private ways and filling craters that are dangerous on private ways.

414
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:43,952
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that any of that is really going away anytime soon because we do need to maintain public safety and passage, right, through the ways.

415
00:39:45,223 --> 00:39:56,012
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't own and don't have the at the moment don't have really the capacity to be paving private ways, but the title owners of those way parcels certainly have the right to do that.

416
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:56,752
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely.

417
00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:06,971
[SPEAKER_04]: The one of the main reasons for this meeting and we would love to continue the conversation on other topics but for parking.

418
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:14,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be a more pressing issue, particularly in this hillside and South Medford areas because the Green Line extension is going to open.

419
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:26,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So streets in those neighborhoods, maybe concerned with how to manage the overflow of parking that people may want to park there all day long to hop on the T, and then we know that other streets that live near the recreational facilities may may.

420
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:30,983
[SPEAKER_04]: may experience that as well, so.

421
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:35,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's gonna be like a parking lot, a tea parking lot.

422
00:40:36,046 --> 00:40:36,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Herb.

423
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, just one last question.

424
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:55,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand that's a big problem with the Green Line Tea, but could we, to start the process of conversion to a public, from a private to a public, who should we talk to?

425
00:40:58,283 --> 00:40:58,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

426
00:40:58,603 --> 00:40:58,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

427
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:00,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

428
00:41:00,284 --> 00:41:06,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know it, it'll be a process, but if we want to get it started, Tim's the one to go to.

429
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:06,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

430
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:07,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll walk you through it.

431
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:08,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

432
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:09,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

433
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:09,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

434
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:10,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

435
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,928
[SPEAKER_03]: L L Rocco is next.

436
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:17,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

437
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?

438
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

439
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:20,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

440
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:21,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

441
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:24,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I live on university out across the street from perhaps university.

442
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:28,599
[SPEAKER_08]: and Tufts University owns the house to the right of me.

443
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:32,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, students are not allowed to park on the street.

444
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:40,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I've approached Tufts numerous times about informing their students not to park on the street.

445
00:41:41,907 --> 00:41:50,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, they keep on informing the students, but obviously they have no respect for the law and they continue to park there.

446
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:54,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I call the city of Medford and have them ticketed?

447
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:58,123
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if it's a private way, no.

448
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:03,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't I have them ticketed?

449
00:42:03,026 --> 00:42:05,287
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not supposed to be parking on the street.

450
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:10,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask two questions while I kind of think this through?

451
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:14,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Who owns, the Tufts students live in the property, who owns the property?

452
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:16,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Tufts University or is it a private owner?

453
00:42:16,313 --> 00:42:18,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Tufts University owns the property.

454
00:42:18,897 --> 00:42:28,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and who restricts them, who has restricted them from parking on the- The university informs the students that they are not allowed to park on the street.

455
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:37,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's probably anywhere from 10 to 15 students that live in the house.

456
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:46,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of times they have friends coming over or they park and they're literally blocking my driveway halfway.

457
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:48,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I can barely get out.

458
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:54,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been to Tufts University numerous times about the situation.

459
00:42:54,907 --> 00:43:00,351
[SPEAKER_08]: They told me I have to go to the city of Medford, tell the police, and that they will come and ticket them.

460
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:02,572
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was told by Tufts University.

461
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:09,477
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you say Tufts University, was it the Tufts University police or was it another administration there?

462
00:43:09,597 --> 00:43:12,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And the only reason is I'm gonna try to follow up on them tomorrow.

463
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:14,220
[SPEAKER_08]: It was somebody from management.

464
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:16,953
[SPEAKER_08]: His name is Rocco.

465
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:19,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't pronounce his last name.

466
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:20,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

467
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:22,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Rocco.

468
00:43:23,135 --> 00:43:25,476
[SPEAKER_11]: So the answer is still the same, right?

469
00:43:25,496 --> 00:43:26,396
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a private way.

470
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:27,356
[SPEAKER_11]: We cannot enforce.

471
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:38,119
[SPEAKER_11]: If Tufts University tells, you know, their renters or their residents that they can't do something on a private piece of property, I still cannot send my police department.

472
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:43,200
[SPEAKER_11]: So the advice that is being provided to you that the Medford police will come up is not accurate.

473
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,881
[SPEAKER_11]: We cannot do anything on a private way.

474
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:50,383
[SPEAKER_11]: That being said, I mean, I know Rocco, I'll reach out to him tomorrow and express your concerns to him.

475
00:43:50,443 --> 00:44:04,530
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you want to follow up in a couple of days with him, perhaps at least he'll know that I have talked to him and told him that it is not accurate that the police will come up there and that maybe Tufts University has to do something more for them.

476
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,151
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's the best I can offer you for there because it is still private way.

477
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:09,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll see what happens as a result of that.

478
00:44:10,172 --> 00:44:10,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Chief.

479
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:20,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's anyone else on the call that lives on a private way that also has Tufts University as a landowner, then they got this answer.

480
00:44:20,183 --> 00:44:25,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully, if they're experiencing similar issues, they don't necessarily have to repeat the question.

481
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:28,272
[SPEAKER_04]: The Chief's going to make a reach out to Tufts University.

482
00:44:28,889 --> 00:44:37,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we want to get to every question I mean, we'll probably be taking questions till 715 ish but there's a few questions in the chat, that's all we could get to that would have some quick answers.

483
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:40,936
[SPEAKER_13]: What percentage of roads are private ways in Medford.

484
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:42,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's roughly 38%.

485
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:46,744
[SPEAKER_04]: 30% but in terms of, in terms of miles.

486
00:44:47,505 --> 00:44:51,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's much less in terms of your feet, but in terms of the number of streets at 38%.

487
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:58,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, can this can the city can city ordinance be passed to allow the city to post signage and ticket in tow.

488
00:45:01,013 --> 00:45:04,856
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've had that reviewed by legal counsel and to no avail.

489
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:13,262
[SPEAKER_11]: We have not paid the authority because state law and private properties have sort of restricted the city from sort of assuming that authority.

490
00:45:14,283 --> 00:45:21,449
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's a public safety, clear public safety issue or impact, you know, like blocking the roadway or something along those lines, we can enact an ordinance.

491
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:25,612
[SPEAKER_11]: But if it's simply someone who's parking on your roadway on a Sunday, because they want to access

492
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,512
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, the trails or the beach.

493
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:31,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, uh, mystics, something along those lines.

494
00:45:31,534 --> 00:45:31,955
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't.

495
00:45:32,695 --> 00:45:32,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

496
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:34,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Faye Reich is next.

497
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:46,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I'm concerned because I live right near Tufts and the Green Line and there is going to be nothing that we can do.

498
00:45:46,645 --> 00:45:50,087
[SPEAKER_18]: There are six two-family houses on the small street.

499
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:58,932
[SPEAKER_18]: Once the T opens, we will have no power for people to just be commuters and park their cars there.

500
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:03,535
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't fill out the forms because they're going to be gone by the time you process it.

501
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:07,832
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, our street is going to become a parking lot for the T.

502
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:23,046
[SPEAKER_04]: So this process or this mechanism may help folks that have issues with people parked on the street, because it puts the control in your hands in terms of contracts with the tow company and posting it.

503
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:32,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Until you do it, the sign itself may be a very good deterrent, maybe even more so than ticketing by Medford on a public street.

504
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but you're hiring a tow company.

505
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:38,473
[SPEAKER_18]: We're opening ourselves up for litigation.

506
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:40,535
[SPEAKER_18]: by doing it privately.

507
00:46:41,517 --> 00:46:52,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, can't you at least issue Medford resident stickers and have that be that if a car is to park on a private way they need a Medford sticker.

508
00:46:52,830 --> 00:47:11,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately no that's, that's one of the reasons to have this meeting to help inform folks in that people that live on private ways have come to the city to request just that, that the city post signs and resident stickers, but we're saying that, you know, we do not own those streets so based on master law.

509
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:13,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is not official legal advice.

510
00:47:13,687 --> 00:47:19,752
[SPEAKER_04]: The interpretation is that the owners may go about doing that in the city is not an owner of that private place.

511
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:23,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the problem is on our street, I live on Edison Ave.

512
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:30,467
[SPEAKER_18]: There are six houses, four of them are rented out to tough students.

513
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:35,290
[SPEAKER_18]: The landlords don't care at all about who parks there.

514
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:45,015
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I had trouble getting into my driveway when a neighbor called and there was a car parked on Tesla, which is not a private way.

515
00:47:46,095 --> 00:47:49,058
[SPEAKER_18]: She was told that the police couldn't tow their car.

516
00:47:49,478 --> 00:47:50,399
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that about?

517
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:55,703
[SPEAKER_18]: It happened a couple of weeks ago.

518
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:56,984
[SPEAKER_18]: She called the police.

519
00:47:57,184 --> 00:47:58,666
[SPEAKER_18]: The car was parked on Tesla.

520
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:00,527
[SPEAKER_18]: It had a Somerville sticker.

521
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:04,611
[SPEAKER_18]: The police came out and they said, no, we can't tow the car.

522
00:48:05,191 --> 00:48:07,513
[SPEAKER_18]: I know the person's on this call or was.

523
00:48:08,074 --> 00:48:09,054
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that about?

524
00:48:09,995 --> 00:48:12,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let me take a look real quickly here for a second.

525
00:48:14,285 --> 00:48:16,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because other people are waiting.

526
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:29,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, just real quick Tesla's a public road and you can park a vehicle road and I'm not if it's resident, I mean I can take a look and I don't want to drag this meeting out and see if this resident apartment parking but it's a public road you can park in a public road.

527
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:35,786
[SPEAKER_18]: But it was not a Medford that don't you need a Medford sticker to park on Tesla.

528
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:39,288
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a Somerville sticker this purpose.

529
00:48:39,448 --> 00:48:46,169
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to take that as a resident private parking road but in general in a public road you can live anywhere in a public road.

530
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:51,351
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have restrictions on some roads related to a resident price.

531
00:48:51,831 --> 00:49:03,093
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd have to take a look at that and see what it is but if my office didn't tell it because some people have gotten tickets on Tesla and other people have not.

532
00:49:04,214 --> 00:49:05,414
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's, you know,

533
00:49:07,087 --> 00:49:13,688
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know we can well you can look into that thing and give you a contact you back if you want to drop your email in the chat or direct message me.

534
00:49:14,448 --> 00:49:16,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, but I'm just saying when the tea comes.

535
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:32,472
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to be a nightmare people are going to come home from work, and not have a place to park their car, because there's nothing we can do to remove the car by the time you fill out a form, take it down to the police station, send it in they're going to be gone.

536
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:35,648
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just not a solution.

537
00:49:35,928 --> 00:49:42,690
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not hearing any viable solutions to the problem of the tea coming in, none.

538
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:54,034
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to move along, we will reiterate once that, as the chief mentioned, this is not a rule change or change this law already existed with trying to help inform folks.

539
00:49:54,454 --> 00:49:57,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford is not taking it upon himself to change anything in that regard.

540
00:49:58,536 --> 00:50:02,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, but things are changing you know the tea is coming.

541
00:50:03,365 --> 00:50:10,669
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I mean, other towns, you can't park your car anywhere near a T in Cambridge if you don't have a Cambridge sticker.

542
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:16,171
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone, that's a good segue to answering one of the chat questions, Steve.

543
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:19,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone had mentioned in the city of Cambridge, they do have this system.

544
00:50:20,493 --> 00:50:24,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And so on private ways in Cambridge, they post signs like this.

545
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:29,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a question about how do the tow companies know who's who?

546
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:52,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, in that example in the chat, I'm not aware of this but I'm just repeating what was in the chat, that particular street may have developed their own sticker for that street, but basically it's my understanding that between the owners of the private way and that's who company they figure out a system to either track it by license plate, or what have you, it's between those two parties the city's not involved in it.

547
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:53,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a way.

548
00:50:53,918 --> 00:51:07,917
[SPEAKER_04]: that other tow companies in other cities have figured this out so it's not something brand new that didn't exist that folks don't know how to go about yeah but what you could do for like tesla avenue is it's a public road is put up two hour parking only

549
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:09,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

550
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:18,277
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's going to stop any commuter who wants to take the T and the town can do that Tesla is not a private road.

551
00:51:18,777 --> 00:51:25,062
[SPEAKER_18]: If you put up, you know, it's public hours you're not going to get people leaving their car there all day.

552
00:51:25,654 --> 00:51:27,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Each public street has the ability.

553
00:51:27,775 --> 00:51:28,596
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no.

554
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:31,558
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to move on to the next question.

555
00:51:31,618 --> 00:51:36,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand just answer the question.

556
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:36,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

557
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:45,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So each public street has the ability to go to the traffic commission and request the change in parking regulations on the public street.

558
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:46,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So people on that street.

559
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:58,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people want to our park and they could go to the traffic commission request that, but it's usually driven by whoever lives on that street.

560
00:51:59,715 --> 00:52:09,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, so when you know we on Tesla all these houses are rented by students, the landlords don't care at all who parks there.

561
00:52:10,238 --> 00:52:12,639
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, they're not going to sign off on a petition.

562
00:52:13,418 --> 00:52:23,303
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, and it's, it's, you know, you have a chance now to avoid a nightmare situation with the tea coming and I don't see any solutions.

563
00:52:23,543 --> 00:52:26,165
[SPEAKER_18]: All you're telling us are what the laws are.

564
00:52:26,425 --> 00:52:27,606
[SPEAKER_18]: How about some solutions.

565
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:30,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this will, this will be one last response.

566
00:52:43,554 --> 00:52:50,300
[SPEAKER_04]: The solution is on a public street to apply for resident parking is a great way to go apply for resident parking.

567
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,002
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great way to go through this process.

568
00:52:53,623 --> 00:52:58,687
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Heather heard is next.

569
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:02,190
[SPEAKER_16]: Heather is next.

570
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:07,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm hearing an echo I don't know if anybody else is hearing an echo.

571
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:13,253
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I live on a private way in West Medford, I'll make it quick.

572
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:18,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Can Mr. Blake or Chief Buckley address.

573
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:28,391
[SPEAKER_16]: In our city ordinances, there's a rule that anyone can park on a private way for up to 48 hours before you can have them towed.

574
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:41,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know this because I live on a very small private way, and there was someone who used to visit, someone who lived on Brook Street, actually, and park all the time with New Hampshire plates on my street.

575
00:53:42,275 --> 00:53:46,796
[SPEAKER_16]: And I actually went to the city and said, are they allowed to do that?

576
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,357
[SPEAKER_16]: And, okay.

577
00:53:49,265 --> 00:53:50,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for sharing that.

578
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:59,210
[SPEAKER_16]: So a non-resident on a private way shall not be permitted to park more than 48 hours.

579
00:53:59,751 --> 00:54:12,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so what I'm hearing, I was a few minutes late, so I don't know if I missed something, but what I'm hearing is that residents of a private way can fill out a form, a petition, contact a towing company,

580
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:16,883
[SPEAKER_16]: and contract with them directly and have people towed.

581
00:54:17,283 --> 00:54:24,006
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but what happens if the resident has somebody towed before 48 hours has gone by?

582
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:27,847
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they can also be fined and then have to pay the towing fee.

583
00:54:27,927 --> 00:54:29,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct or incorrect?

584
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:33,369
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, let me see if I can explain it this way.

585
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:42,297
[SPEAKER_11]: The ordinance is what allows the police department to remove a vehicle from a private way.

586
00:54:42,797 --> 00:54:49,583
[SPEAKER_11]: And so in order for us to, the police department to remove a vehicle, it needs to have been at least there, parked there for 48 hours.

587
00:54:50,184 --> 00:54:55,188
[SPEAKER_11]: A private owner or a private way, the owners of a private way can

588
00:54:56,133 --> 00:55:07,616
[SPEAKER_11]: post and give fair notice and remove someone who is not a resident or invited guest and have that move anytime they want in violation of their posted notices.

589
00:55:08,156 --> 00:55:09,297
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's two separate things, right?

590
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:13,718
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're saying that we have limited authority as a police department on a private way.

591
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:21,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of those limited authorities is if somebody say abandons a vehicle for at least 48 hours, we can then go in and remove that vehicle.

592
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,003
[SPEAKER_11]: But as the owners of the property, you can remove it in less time.

593
00:55:25,424 --> 00:55:30,508
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're not bound by that that that's the restrictions on the police department.

594
00:55:30,669 --> 00:55:32,330
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope that correctly.

595
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:42,380
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're saying that if there's a vehicle on a private way that's been there more than 48 hours the police can tow it.

596
00:55:44,009 --> 00:55:44,509
[SPEAKER_11]: correct.

597
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:54,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm saying that you would have seen it notice so we can take notice show up and view the vehicle and take notice of the vehicle is location and 48 hours we would return.

598
00:55:55,752 --> 00:56:02,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, but in order for a private resident, they have to have posted parking for residents only contracted with a towing company, given them fair notice, and then

599
00:56:12,897 --> 00:56:13,757
[SPEAKER_16]: have them removed.

600
00:56:14,478 --> 00:56:20,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct have that vehicle removed, and it can be within 48 hours can be 24 hours.

601
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

602
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,361
[SPEAKER_11]: You have different rights than I have this.

603
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:24,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

604
00:56:24,621 --> 00:56:26,582
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

605
00:56:26,622 --> 00:56:27,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

606
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:30,344
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Richard Schultz is next.

607
00:56:32,804 --> 00:56:34,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Todd, I'm going to direct this to you.

608
00:56:35,265 --> 00:56:42,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you have said that in this man, this is a parking related question that

609
00:56:43,016 --> 00:56:46,599
[SPEAKER_05]: the city does not own the private ways.

610
00:56:47,019 --> 00:56:49,701
[SPEAKER_05]: That I live on a private way and I own it.

611
00:56:50,482 --> 00:56:55,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, a few years ago, I had a survey done of my property.

612
00:56:55,126 --> 00:56:56,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid $1,000 for it.

613
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:01,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know exactly where the boundaries of my property are.

614
00:57:02,272 --> 00:57:05,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do not carry into that private way.

615
00:57:05,674 --> 00:57:10,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So where is my legal ownership of that private way?

616
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:12,580
[SPEAKER_05]: The city doesn't own it.

617
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:17,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't own it according to the lead, the survey I had done.

618
00:57:18,392 --> 00:57:24,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So where does the ownership fall?

619
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:27,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll briefly answer this and then maybe Tim might have to step in.

620
00:57:27,418 --> 00:57:33,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, earlier on, we made a distinction between a private parcel of property versus a private way.

621
00:57:33,823 --> 00:57:39,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So your survey, it seems like that you conducted was looking at the limits of your private property or parcel.

622
00:57:40,228 --> 00:57:41,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I speak to somebody?

623
00:57:43,257 --> 00:57:44,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, I need to speak to somebody.

624
00:57:48,003 --> 00:57:48,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

625
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:53,229
[SPEAKER_11]: This one question and then we'll get to.

626
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Richard.

627
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:56,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically a private way.

628
00:57:57,094 --> 00:57:59,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the city doesn't own it so one of my.

629
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:10,031
[SPEAKER_04]: possible explanations for that early on was, at some point, the area where you live was developed, and it was segregated into parcels to be sold by somebody, right?

630
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:11,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a street that was left over.

631
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:15,573
[SPEAKER_04]: That street wasn't submitted to be accepted as a public street.

632
00:58:16,073 --> 00:58:17,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, it's still private.

633
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:28,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody, as far as I know, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, Tim, a private way, you as a property owner, abiding that private way to pay taxes on your parcel or property,

634
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:34,614
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our understanding that nobody pays taxes on the way itself, but the city still does not own it.

635
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:35,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that... I don't own it.

636
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:44,341
[SPEAKER_05]: See, so if I don't own it and you don't own it, this is a legal conundrum.

637
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:53,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is the related question of, I live on Lakeview in West Medford.

638
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:58,471
[SPEAKER_05]: When was this declared by the city a private way?

639
00:58:59,614 --> 00:59:02,756
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 years ago, 75 years ago.

640
00:59:02,776 --> 00:59:06,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Tim mentioned that they all started out as private ways.

641
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:07,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct, Tim?

642
00:59:08,399 --> 00:59:09,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I can address your question, sir.

643
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

644
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:11,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim?

645
00:59:12,201 --> 00:59:12,361
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

646
00:59:13,643 --> 00:59:17,746
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have a building parcel or a building lot that your house is on.

647
00:59:18,146 --> 00:59:22,489
[SPEAKER_22]: So the city is interested in knowing the square footage of that parcel for tax purposes.

648
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,612
[SPEAKER_22]: And you're interested in that as well.

649
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:29,094
[SPEAKER_22]: So typically when you hire a land surveyor, you're hiring it for your interests.

650
00:59:29,674 --> 00:59:31,095
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not gonna really pay them more money.

651
00:59:31,215 --> 00:59:40,522
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not really useful to you to know what the square footage is of the title you own in the way parcel portion of your land.

652
00:59:40,882 --> 00:59:41,162
[SPEAKER_22]: However,

653
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:47,488
[SPEAKER_22]: The city is interested in whether or not knowing if it's a publicly accepted way or not.

654
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:55,936
[SPEAKER_22]: So if it's or not, we're not really interested or really care to tell you the truth who necessarily owns the land who owns fee into it.

655
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:58,037
[SPEAKER_22]: You can look that up if you wanted to.

656
00:59:58,758 --> 01:00:04,881
[SPEAKER_22]: So you could do a title search on the way parcel that you have frontage on and see who owns it.

657
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:13,925
[SPEAKER_22]: Now that title search may very well turn up under this statute called derelict fee statute, which is a little bit of a catch-all.

658
01:00:14,985 --> 01:00:21,848
[SPEAKER_22]: And it says basically on a private way, like maybe yours, and I'm not, it's not, it's very specific to each individual way parcel.

659
01:00:21,888 --> 01:00:25,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Each parcel of land has a specific set of criteria around it, but just, you know,

660
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:32,474
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, saying it for the purposes of explanation, it could very well be that you own it in derelict fee.

661
01:00:33,655 --> 01:00:38,378
[SPEAKER_22]: And you don't pay taxes on it, but you own, you have fee interest in the land as an owner.

662
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:47,466
[SPEAKER_22]: And then it's a way parcel, so the public has a whole bunch of rights in that way parcel to pass through it, you know, as the chief has described.

663
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:48,847
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, I could go on and on and on.

664
01:00:48,987 --> 01:00:51,629
[SPEAKER_22]: It's this, it's a topic.

665
01:00:52,169 --> 01:00:53,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I see what you're saying.

666
01:00:53,671 --> 01:00:54,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, good.

667
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:55,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll stop.

668
01:00:55,863 --> 01:00:56,764
[SPEAKER_05]: with this statement.

669
01:00:57,924 --> 01:01:02,487
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the law, and in this case, it's rather convoluted.

670
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:13,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's the time when public ways were established, and in Lakeview, that could be 100 years ago.

671
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:23,578
[SPEAKER_05]: The reality is that today, Lakeview is a thruway to Mystic Valley Parkway.

672
01:01:25,053 --> 01:01:30,156
[SPEAKER_05]: off of Mystic Valley Parkway, it is the only way you can get to Pitcher Avenue.

673
01:01:31,256 --> 01:01:41,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So now, this had created, another gentleman said his road looked like it had been shelled with potholes.

674
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:42,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Ours did too.

675
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:49,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only because National Grid made it worse that they came through and paved it.

676
01:01:50,466 --> 01:01:53,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But before that, it was a disaster.

677
01:01:54,028 --> 01:01:54,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, Rick.

678
01:01:55,529 --> 01:01:56,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll stop with that.

679
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in the interest of getting to the other.

680
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:58,851
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm going to stop.

681
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Tim did offer some information earlier as well.

682
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:07,555
[SPEAKER_04]: If it seems like you're leaning towards how do you become a public way or.

683
01:02:08,036 --> 01:02:08,576
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

684
01:02:08,956 --> 01:02:10,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim had mentioned the process for that.

685
01:02:10,677 --> 01:02:13,859
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I'm not leaning towards that way.

686
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,300
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what I said.

687
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually believe Lakeview is a public road.

688
01:02:19,842 --> 01:02:21,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not.

689
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:22,844
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not because

690
01:02:23,883 --> 01:02:33,448
[SPEAKER_05]: at least when I went to City Hall a few years ago to try to inquire about how to get this road repaved, I was told it was a private way.

691
01:02:33,928 --> 01:02:37,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says on the sign, Lakeview Private Way.

692
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:43,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this may be one of those streets that's partially private, partially public, depending on the block.

693
01:02:43,353 --> 01:02:44,494
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take a look at the bridge.

694
01:02:44,714 --> 01:02:48,916
[SPEAKER_04]: The block between Pitcher and Mystic Valley is

695
01:02:49,473 --> 01:02:52,436
[SPEAKER_04]: public I believe in between Pitcher and Sagamore is private.

696
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:53,337
[SPEAKER_04]: It's split.

697
01:02:53,477 --> 01:02:54,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

698
01:02:54,158 --> 01:02:57,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's move on to the next person.

699
01:02:57,281 --> 01:02:58,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Roy Gardner is next.

700
01:03:00,164 --> 01:03:09,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I'm here with my neighbor sorry but, um, a, you know, I really appreciate what you guys are doing here and this is complicated stuff and I appreciate you saying what I really do.

701
01:03:12,531 --> 01:03:38,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question, and then we'll go to Thorey, since we're a private way, do we have the right to issue our own parking stickers, essentially, and then have our neighbors pay for the right to park, and then we can use that money to pave the road, and then... So however way the owners of the private way determine how to manage it with the tow company.

702
01:03:38,138 --> 01:03:41,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So that may include stickers, it may not.

703
01:03:41,964 --> 01:03:46,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tell the tow company, here's what the sticker looks like if they don't have it.

704
01:03:46,658 --> 01:03:48,779
[SPEAKER_04]: you tow them or?

705
01:03:49,419 --> 01:03:56,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say definitively because that would be agreement between the owners and the tow company, but I'm just, we're just trying to inform what it may look like.

706
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:59,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone posted in the chat that some street in Cambridge does that.

707
01:04:00,123 --> 01:04:04,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an example, but we can't tell you that you should do that or not do that.

708
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:07,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, that's an agreement between the owners and the tow company.

709
01:04:08,626 --> 01:04:14,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there, is there a penalty for towing somebody accidentally or can they, do they have,

710
01:04:15,938 --> 01:04:22,461
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, can I see what what what happens if they don't fyi you properly with that form that's on the website?

711
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:28,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, it would be opened up to they would open themselves up to some sort of civil liability.

712
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:36,808
[SPEAKER_11]: So the owner of the vehicle could, you know, push you to pay for the toll fees and, you know, potentially any damages on the side.

713
01:04:36,828 --> 01:04:41,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why we always say not offer perfectly good by saying we want you to contract with a lawyer.

714
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:45,092
[SPEAKER_02]: But a posted sign could theoretically be

715
01:04:46,093 --> 01:04:48,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you notice or what?

716
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:50,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Posted notice.

717
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:50,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

718
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:58,210
[SPEAKER_02]: The parking department should be enforcing parking department can't do that.

719
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:58,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

720
01:04:59,151 --> 01:05:01,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, and I know Jay put, put a comment in the.

721
01:05:03,082 --> 01:05:08,524
[SPEAKER_11]: the chat room, and he's referencing Aquavio Parkway, Pawn Circle.

722
01:05:08,564 --> 01:05:14,447
[SPEAKER_11]: In 1987, the traffic commission did grant permit parking privileges there.

723
01:05:15,067 --> 01:05:21,910
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just telling you that in 2022, we're not sure that that was appropriate and or legal at the time.

724
01:05:22,412 --> 01:05:28,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we're trying to take a fresh look at things and move forward with this way of handling it.

725
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so even though there may be some cases like that.

726
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:37,944
[SPEAKER_04]: We're evaluating those to see, you know, this is the correct process at this point.

727
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:43,328
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was a mistake at some point in the past, we're trying to correct that now so it's not miss.

728
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:45,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not confusing to everyone.

729
01:05:45,549 --> 01:05:48,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That may have caused confusion, trying to help folks.

730
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:57,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's likely that that was done with good intentions, right, to help residents, but it may have contributed to confusion about the subject.

731
01:05:58,973 --> 01:06:02,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I want to make sure my neighbor, Thori, gets a chance to ask one question.

732
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:03,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.

733
01:06:04,054 --> 01:06:08,016
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I've got a lot of senior brain cells that have left me.

734
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:11,417
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and I came into the conversation late,

735
01:06:12,592 --> 01:06:18,322
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm now hearing though about this 1987 permit packing on Equalia Parkway.

736
01:06:19,805 --> 01:06:22,329
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're saying that it's no longer being enforced.

737
01:06:23,391 --> 01:06:25,755
[SPEAKER_14]: And if that's the case, why did I have to pay for it for this year?

738
01:06:28,272 --> 01:06:30,654
[SPEAKER_11]: two legitimate questions and we are looking into it.

739
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:37,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, we don't have all the answers to it, but we felt that we were obligated to get this message out right away.

740
01:06:37,658 --> 01:06:51,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're gonna push and look into the, we're trying to gather the information on the private ways that the city has granted resident permit parking and look at the 1987 language that they adopted and make some interpretations and some decisions.

741
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:55,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, because, and I think you know that if,

742
01:06:56,364 --> 01:07:04,287
[SPEAKER_14]: our two streets don't get back our permit parking, we're going to have all of the T and the rights upon parking.

743
01:07:04,827 --> 01:07:07,628
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll never be able to park on our street until after six o'clock.

744
01:07:11,049 --> 01:07:13,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, again, I think we're trying to supply you with some solutions here.

745
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:15,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

746
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:20,832
[SPEAKER_11]: It's simple, but we want to try to give you guidance so that that doesn't happen.

747
01:07:22,002 --> 01:07:22,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

748
01:07:23,383 --> 01:07:23,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, lady.

749
01:07:24,744 --> 01:07:33,412
[SPEAKER_04]: So, to reiterate, whether it's a query road or some other road, if for some reason the traffic commission in the past approved resident parking.

750
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:38,576
[SPEAKER_04]: We're saying that that may have been in mistake so this is the process that we're.

751
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:43,639
[SPEAKER_04]: we're valuing right now that we believe to be the correct process for a private.

752
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:44,899
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't a mistake.

753
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:46,160
[SPEAKER_21]: It was done because of rights.

754
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:54,843
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was the residents of the streets of the roads that specifically went before the parking commission in order to have it enforced.

755
01:07:55,963 --> 01:07:57,924
[SPEAKER_21]: Whether it's legal or not, it's debatable.

756
01:07:57,964 --> 01:08:04,747
[SPEAKER_21]: But I also, like Tory, paid for a parking permit after munching back and forth with the parking department.

757
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:08,008
[SPEAKER_21]: And at the end of the day, they ruled we needed to have permanent parking.

758
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:16,629
[SPEAKER_21]: So yes, I'd like my money back if I don't, you know, I also like, you know, refund for the last 20 plus years or more.

759
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,511
[SPEAKER_04]: If your street is that case we'll look into all that for you.

760
01:08:20,551 --> 01:08:20,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

761
01:08:22,312 --> 01:08:23,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Ben Nixon is next.

762
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:25,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi everyone.

763
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:33,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also an equator resident, and I also would like to reiterate you know that we have been forced to pay for for permit parking.

764
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:35,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Up until this point.

765
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:43,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess my question kind of relays around why all of a sudden, you know, in the last couple of weeks have we gone from.

766
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:52,414
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, having these cities enforced signs and these do not enter signs and all of this support from the city for our private way.

767
01:08:52,434 --> 01:09:04,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all of a sudden, it feels like, you know, within the last week, all of that has been taken, I guess, what what changed to to cause this change in enforcement, or update in enforcement?

768
01:09:05,424 --> 01:09:19,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't believe there's a change where we're reevaluating things to try to correctly state to everyone consistently versus providing confusing information that may be incorrect.

769
01:09:19,867 --> 01:09:32,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I would say that, again, we'll look into all the streets that may have had it already, but I wouldn't necessarily say it was a waste because all the previous time you were likely getting enforcement for whatever you paid for, right?

770
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:50,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's, again, that's what my reference to earlier was, it was likely very good intentions on the city in the past to try to help folks out that are near Wrights Pond, near the reservation or near the lakes, but it may not have been the proper thing to do.

771
01:09:50,742 --> 01:09:53,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, sorry, I guess what

772
01:09:54,693 --> 01:10:01,155
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the timeline for for this evaluation because as my neighbors have already brought up you know rights pond is coming.

773
01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:17,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are very nervous about the ability of the residents to park, given that most you know families and people will be able to park on our street and easily walk into rights pond so we would love to get this resolved as soon as possible being that the pond opens this weekend.

774
01:10:19,847 --> 01:10:27,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're looking into that I will say that there may be a number of these cases so it may take some time so in the meantime, those signs are up.

775
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:28,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

776
01:10:28,259 --> 01:10:35,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so we'll look into that and get back to you will definitely work with the streets that have that situation.

777
01:10:36,141 --> 01:10:57,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I also just offer the site, you know, the signs maybe the signs are going to remain up at least for now, and probably act as a deterrent right where we may not have the legal authority to enforce those signs, at least the presence of the science act as a deterrent in the meantime, but that does not restrict you from acting on the information we're providing to that you still are a private way and you can.

778
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:08,335
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, take advantage of the information we've given you and sort of move quickly and try to get that in place to help on also just just want to put that in, so you understand where we stand.

779
01:11:08,976 --> 01:11:13,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and just one further comment on this reference to the 1987.

780
01:11:14,118 --> 01:11:16,800
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think the chief mentioned earlier that

781
01:11:17,678 --> 01:11:30,671
[SPEAKER_04]: When we did look into this and I believe that she may have referenced that the lawyers looked into whether, you know, the city could do an ordinance to regulate parking and probably and I believe he said they couldn't.

782
01:11:30,771 --> 01:11:36,436
[SPEAKER_04]: So, again, even though they might have been something in the past it doesn't necessarily mean it was the proper thing to do.

783
01:11:37,637 --> 01:11:40,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we have two questions left, Fred Roche.

784
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:45,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Fred's unmuting.

785
01:11:46,728 --> 01:11:52,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve, I just want to remind you that Frances is waiting also, and she may have trouble having her hand up, but if we can keep her in the queue.

786
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:54,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sure.

787
01:11:56,932 --> 01:11:59,673
[SPEAKER_20]: First, I want to comment that

788
01:12:01,544 --> 01:12:04,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Sandberg's comment about paving Whittier Road.

789
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:12,153
[SPEAKER_20]: I would caution any paving of Whittier Road due to the volume and the speed of the cars.

790
01:12:13,114 --> 01:12:17,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Chief Buckley has been aware of some of the cut through problems.

791
01:12:17,057 --> 01:12:18,799
[SPEAKER_20]: The traffic commission has done a great job.

792
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:23,282
[SPEAKER_20]: They've put up signage, but unfortunately the police department can't be here all the time.

793
01:12:24,103 --> 01:12:38,929
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would caution about turning Whittier Road into a nice smooth paved road for cars to want to traverse, because they came down this street the DPW came down the street today, and I'm one of the people opposed to fill in the potholes.

794
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:46,462
[SPEAKER_20]: I know they're doing their job, but the cars go too fast and there's too many of them.

795
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:58,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Second of all, I don't know why the city's getting involved in consulting with Mr. Sandberg with regarding going from a private way to a public way.

796
01:12:59,006 --> 01:13:07,329
[SPEAKER_20]: So if he can consult on that, I'd like to consult Tim about how to stay a private way, because I'm one of the people that would be opposed to it.

797
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:08,630
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that said,

798
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:21,813
[SPEAKER_20]: With that said, my question stands at, as far as posting goes, is there a percentage of the occupants of the street that have to vote for that particular private way to post?

799
01:13:22,353 --> 01:13:27,815
[SPEAKER_20]: Or is it, as it stands right now, up to the individual owners to post?

800
01:13:28,335 --> 01:13:30,736
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't need consensus from the street as a 51% whole.

801
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:36,408
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question Fred and thank you for all your hard work and the commission.

802
01:13:36,488 --> 01:13:38,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

803
01:13:39,650 --> 01:14:00,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, we offer that petition as a guide for the owners to sign to say that the contract with the tow company, but unlike the resident parking situation with the traffic commission on public streets, the city could potentially designated percentage for that process but for this private way process.

804
01:14:01,878 --> 01:14:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: the general law that we're referencing just mentions the owners of the private way, it doesn't get into specifics like that.

805
01:14:07,101 --> 01:14:10,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that would be something handled amongst the owners.

806
01:14:12,945 --> 01:14:14,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Patty is next.

807
01:14:15,807 --> 01:14:25,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, I was wondering why the city has posted on those orange barriers and no parking signs on streets that are listed as public ways when the signs say that they're resident ways.

808
01:14:25,854 --> 01:14:31,017
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, I live near Pitcher and Kilgore, neither of which appear on your list as private.

809
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:33,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have barriers and signs.

810
01:14:35,998 --> 01:14:37,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your question.

811
01:14:38,162 --> 01:14:42,630
[SPEAKER_04]: As, as folks may know there during the pandemic there was an overwhelming.

812
01:14:46,156 --> 01:14:50,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Demands for the lakes area and there were parking issues associated with that.

813
01:14:51,318 --> 01:15:03,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city met with residents to try to attempt to deter folks away from that area that because there were issues that were stemming from that overwhelming demand.

814
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:06,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that sign was.

815
01:15:06,923 --> 01:15:16,273
[SPEAKER_04]: generated just as a deterrent because the state police was actively removing people from parking on mystic Valley Parkway and then everyone was flooding the neighborhoods.

816
01:15:17,214 --> 01:15:28,125
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the sign saying privately in a public that sign was a generic sign made up for that specific purpose, and it may have been posted incorrectly at the ends of public streets as well.

817
01:15:28,706 --> 01:15:29,106
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um,

818
01:15:29,907 --> 01:15:38,452
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it was just a deterrent and those public streets may get a, you know, benefit, but we could remove that sign if those streets do not want that sign.

819
01:15:39,032 --> 01:15:43,654
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't in any ill intent, it was trying to help a situation that we were being pressed to help with.

820
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:51,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I think Keefe, you said Fran had a question?

821
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:53,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, where is she now?

822
01:15:59,892 --> 01:16:01,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw her earlier, now I don't see.

823
01:16:01,594 --> 01:16:02,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm here.

824
01:16:02,134 --> 01:16:03,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

825
01:16:04,636 --> 01:16:15,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So in our situation, we're in a condo and there are 211 units.

826
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:25,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Would the entire building be subject to the private way or just the ones who abut Hall Ave?

827
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:39,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So this gets back to determining who the owners of the private way are in the city is not necessarily going to say who the owners are or aren't, that's up to the owners to determine the private way.

828
01:16:41,748 --> 01:16:43,849
[SPEAKER_04]: The city just knows that we are not an owner.

829
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:56,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if, if the other residents didn't mind that, that those of us on call have.

830
01:16:58,855 --> 01:17:06,121
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of are the keepers of the flame, then maybe it would simplify things for us.

831
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:12,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this might refer back to Fred's question about what percentage.

832
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:17,349
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not in a position to say what percentage of the owners need to agree or not agree.

833
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:20,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

834
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:25,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and I think Roy Gardner, the last question.

835
01:17:28,537 --> 01:17:28,797
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

836
01:17:30,177 --> 01:17:33,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, this is actually Flory again, and I've got to ask one more question.

837
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:38,239
[SPEAKER_14]: So who do we call for reinforcement?

838
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:54,722
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Elm Street people that park on our street have not been much of a problem, except that now they're parking, when I say backwards, they come into Equavia from Elm Street and park on the left side of the street.

839
01:17:54,782 --> 01:17:56,222
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're going in the wrong direction.

840
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:05,606
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they're parking so that they're actually almost blocking this whole sidewalk area of, not the sidewalk, the crosswalk.

841
01:18:06,286 --> 01:18:09,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're actually backing up to Elm Street.

842
01:18:09,908 --> 01:18:20,635
[SPEAKER_14]: So that when you're trying to pull in, you have no way you're gonna hit a car when you're trying to drive into a quiver and you're trying to go out of the quiver, you don't know if there's a car coming down from Elm Street.

843
01:18:21,056 --> 01:18:22,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So who do we call for reinforcement?

844
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:53,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think at this time, if you're concerned about immediate enforcement upon a quake, I would follow the recommendations, at least of the city of Medford right now, and speak with your neighbors, contract with the tow company, have the roadway posted, giving fair notice, and then the neighbors yourself can call that tow company and inform them that there's someone who is parking improperly on your road.

845
01:18:53,602 --> 01:18:56,824
[SPEAKER_11]: But being in a private way, the police cannot just come out there and do that.

846
01:18:57,185 --> 01:19:16,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the exception, and I'm going to add this to a lot of the other comments I see in the chat where when the Chevalier has an event, if there are cars parked on a private way and they are blocking an ambulance, they are the free flow of traffic or, you know, public safety type issues, we will go out and we will enforce it.

847
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,660
[SPEAKER_11]: But simply saying that the Chevalier

848
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:31,094
[SPEAKER_11]: attendees are parking on my private way, we cannot, that you yourselves would have to post that and have a system in place for enforcing it.

849
01:19:31,154 --> 01:19:41,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, but this, this, this is more of an emergency, why do I have to wait 48 hours or call a tow truck, that is more of a police situation.

850
01:19:44,339 --> 01:19:49,922
[SPEAKER_11]: So I might've missed the point, and you could probably go over it, but just somebody parking on the roadway, or are they parked?

851
01:19:50,363 --> 01:19:51,183
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it's how they parked.

852
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was within 20 feet of an intersection.

853
01:19:54,025 --> 01:20:03,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, okay, so if they're violating one of those seven enumerated items, and they'll be on the website also, you can call us and we will enforce it, yes, 100%.

854
01:20:03,371 --> 01:20:04,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

855
01:20:04,831 --> 01:20:06,032
[SPEAKER_11]: You have that authority.

856
01:20:06,713 --> 01:20:07,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

857
01:20:07,253 --> 01:20:12,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the restrictions, but yes, I'm sorry if I missed that point, but that is clearly something we will come out and enforce.

858
01:20:12,596 --> 01:20:13,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you very much.

859
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:20,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I'm posting that again what the police are allowed to, and that's, that would be this one.

860
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:25,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so I think that kind of wraps up our meeting here.

861
01:20:25,139 --> 01:20:36,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I know everyone had a lot of kind of specific questions so if we didn't get to exactly what you wanted to know either in the chat or, or on the zoom you can email me I dropped my email in the chat.

862
01:20:37,184 --> 01:20:42,592
[SPEAKER_13]: It's S-S-M-I-R-T-I at Medford-MA.gov.

863
01:20:43,554 --> 01:20:44,876
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll get those answered for you.

864
01:20:45,016 --> 01:20:48,802
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to thank everybody for coming and for talking about this important issue.

865
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:49,543
[SPEAKER_13]: So thanks.
