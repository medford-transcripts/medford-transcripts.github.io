15
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:48,910
Is there a second?

Seconded by Ms.

17
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:51,271
Kretz.

18
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,071
All those in favor?

19
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:53,752

Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

22
00:06:59,614 --> 00:06:59,834
Ms.

23
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:00,594
DiBenedetto.

24
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,095
I just had a couple questions.

25
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:07,336
Okay.

26
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:08,677
On page 5 of 18,

27
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:17,395
A little bit more than halfway down, it says, lost books, iPads, and deductibles in the amount of $464.71.

28
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:18,796
I don't know if you know what that was for.

29
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:19,456
Page 5 of 18.

30
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:22,898
A little bit, teeny bit more than halfway down.

31
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:25,339
Anthony Penta.

32
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:28,020
So that would be, if you found the page, why is it still on?

33
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,360
Yeah.

34
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,960
I didn't ask about that.

35
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:40,952
It was asked to be thrown away.

36
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:57,575
They take all the kids' phones in elementary school, and they have a system where they take them out, and they check them off, and check them in, and one inadvertently got thrown in the trash, and the parents had all the proof, and the staff of the Roberts agreed with what had happened.

37
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,895
So the parents were reimbursed for the lost iPhone.

38
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:01,236
Thank you, Ms.

39
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:01,816
Mastone.

40
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,356
Thank you.

41
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:04,936
And my second question is on page 7 of 18.

42
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:05,936
It just says, Timothy,

43
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:13,581
Bonner tuition and usually it describes what type of tuition.

44
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:37,837
I don't know if that it's in the amount of looks like it says 53,000 Sorry Okay, usually it says that Special education next to it, so I was just confirming that those are my only questions a motion to approve I just want to ask you a couple of quick questions to you

45
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:45,752
On page seven as well, so the Roberts miscellaneous charges, is there a particular set of charges that fall under this or?

46
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:50,093
Again, this is 890, that's your student activity account.

47
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,693
That's student activity, yes, thank you.

48
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:52,813
It's just reimbursing it.

49
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,794
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure, thank you.

50
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,254
That's all I have.

51
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:57,595
Motion for approval by Ms.

52
00:08:57,615 --> 00:08:59,135
DiVenedetta, was there a second by Ms.

53
00:08:59,155 --> 00:08:59,755
Leanderclude?

54
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:00,635
Roll call vote, please.

55
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:02,676
Ms.

56
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:03,396
DiVenedetta.

57
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:09,805
Yes.

58
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:15,027
Yes.

59
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:15,687
7 in the affirmative.

60
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:16,547
None in the negative.

61
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:17,347
Motion passes.

62
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,468
Approval of payrolls.

63
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:23,029
Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

64
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:23,609
Vanden Heuvel.

65
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:24,590
Roll call vote, please.

66
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:31,132
Yes.

67
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:36,173
Yes.

68
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:36,794
7 in the affirmative.

69
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:37,434
0 in the negative.

70
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,114
Motion passes.

71
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,104
Is there a report of the secretary?

72
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:43,145
I just have a report.

73
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:56,667
I want to thank the finance department, and I want to thank Christine Patterson, and I also want to thank City Hall, the finance department, for, you know, all their cooperation all year.

74
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:05,929
What they do is they put together the packets and they, you know, they actually put them together and they have every single invoice in the correct order.

75
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:13,115
And so it makes it really easy for me to go through and verify those numbers and the addresses and the names all match up.

76
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:15,676
And they've just been extremely helpful.

77
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:25,979
And I actually go into the City Hall office, the finance department, and I sit in one of the vacant desks or in another office with somebody at one of the tables.

78
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,860
And they've just been so accommodating with my schedule.

79
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
And everybody's just been fantastic.

80
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:34,521
If I have questions, I send an email.

81
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,922
I get answers right away.

82
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:38,606
Everybody involved has been fantastic.

83
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:42,611
So I just wanted to say thank you for a great first year doing the bills.

84
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:44,192
Thank you, Ms.

85
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:44,593
Kratz.

86
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:45,554
We see you walk in.

87
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:46,114
Yes.

88
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:47,936
Wednesday or Thursday afternoon.

89
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:49,618
Yeah, Tuesday or Thursday afternoon.

90
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:50,098
So thank you.

91
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:53,113
report of committees a little later on.

92
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,953
You'll be hearing on the budget committee report.

93
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:56,374
And now, Ms.

94
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,455
Vanden Heuvel, if you would like to make a motion.

95
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:07,499
Yes, I'd like to suspend the rules, order of business, so that we can take up the new business, the CASA.

96
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,160
There's a motion on the floor for suspension of the rules.

97
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,140
All those in favor?

98
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,761
Aye.

99
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:12,981
All those opposed?

100
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:16,003
Motion is granted.

101
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:17,263
I'm looking for the paper.

102
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:18,224
Sorry.

103
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:19,464
I don't have the paper either.

104
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:20,805
I think there was one on our list.

105
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:24,738
Thank you.

106
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:32,761
There's a motion for suspension to take a paper in the hands of the, I was going to say the president, the mayor.

107
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:40,003
Presentation of $50,000 grant by Giancarlo Mata, President Amaretis, and President Cassett.

108
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:47,378
Good evening, everyone.

109
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:48,159
Good evening.

110
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:49,041
Name and address, please.

111
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:52,325
Anne-Marie Cuneo, 871 Felsway, Medford, Mass.

112
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,170
It is my pleasure again to, hello, everyone.

113
00:11:55,797 --> 00:12:17,791
and Madam Chair, and to Mr. Superintendent, that I present Jagan Lamanta, who is the president of, well, she was the founder of CASET, and they have been very generous over the years to give us the money that have allowed our students to learn the language, the Italian language, over the years, and it really,

114
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:25,734
networked with our high school students, especially, and done a lot with our students over the years.

115
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:28,455
So I just want to pass it over to Dr. Mata.

116
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:30,556
Thank you, Ana Maria.

117
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:37,618
Mayor, Superintendent, members of the school community, I'm here for two reasons.

118
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:41,399
To present to Dr. Belson and the Mayor a check for $50,000.

119
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:55,762
but also to bring regards from the Consul General, from the Italian government to the superintendent.

120
00:12:56,482 --> 00:13:03,087
We have enjoyed many years of a strict collaboration, professionalism, and we were very lucky.

121
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:16,557
We hope to continue in the next years with this collaboration, which will bring us forward to the development of your world language department, with emphasis to the Italian department,

122
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:19,305
for its culture and its language.

123
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,106
Therefore, thank you.

124
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,907
Farewell, Dr. Belson.

125
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:29,690
And we hope to be able to check upon you once in a while for your consultations with KASIT.

126
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,430
We need you.

127
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:32,691
Mayor Burke, thank you.

128
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,612
Members of the school committee, thank you.

129
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:35,813
Community, thank you.

130
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:22,228
language instruction of the elementary grades.

131
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:31,456
It's a tremendous program, and they've involved the Italian Consulate, and as you know, there's been many more activities besides just the language instruction that they brought.

132
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:36,480
The only thing I'm disappointed in tonight, Chikandra, is the fact that I thought you were gonna give me a Ferrari tonight.

133
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:39,082
I thought that was part of the deal.

134
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,205
But, having not received that, it's okay.

135
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,227
Sorry, but you know they did bring...

136
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:46,406
But they did.

137
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,029
We have the actual check.

138
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:56,354
You notice how quickly I get dismissed around here.

139
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:02,359
So now watch what happens with this one.

140
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,722
Christine, come on up and get it before I spend it.

141
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:09,204
Come on up, let's get a photo.

142
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,501
Really?

143
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,644
Maybe you'll get the test right.

144
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:23,347
Oh, I think they're coming up.

145
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,000
We'll all come up here, it's easier.

146
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,580
Come on, Aaron.

147
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:03,967
She does it a lot.

148
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,441
Yeah, she makes sure it develops.

149
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,899
Can you see Aaron yet?

150
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:40,694
One, two, three.

151
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:41,515
Chow.

152
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:45,179
I would have said wine.

153
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,880
Spaghetti.

154
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,622
One, two, three.

155
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:47,903
Spaghetti.

156
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,751
Thank you very, very much.

157
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:17,998
We're very proud.

158
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:19,199
Have you heard of some of the children?

159
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:20,060
Have you heard of some of the children?

160
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,240
Have you heard of some of the children?

161
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,321
Have you heard of some of the children?

162
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:23,302
Have you heard of some of the children?

163
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:24,422
Have you heard of some of the children?

164
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:25,343
Have you heard of some of the children?

165
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:26,304
Have you heard of some of the children?

166
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:27,324
Have you heard of some of the children?

167
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:28,365
Have you heard of some of the children?

168
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:29,406
Have you heard of some of the children?

169
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,386
Have you heard of some of the children?

170
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:31,487
Have you heard of some of the children?

171
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:32,948
Have you heard of some of the children?

172
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:33,989
Have you heard of some of the children?

173
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:37,010
Have you heard of some of the children?

174
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,911
Have you heard of some of the children?

175
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,912
Have you heard of some of the children?

176
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:40,373
Have you heard of some of the children?

177
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:41,333
Have you heard of some of the children?

178
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,414
Have you heard of some of the children?

179
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:43,715
Have you heard of some of the children?

180
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:44,916
Have you heard of some of the children?

181
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:46,537
Have you heard of some of the children?

182
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:46,877
Have you heard

183
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:57,142
Nice, thanks.

184
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:30,679
On the motion that a letter of thanks be sent to Cassett and... Mr. Benedetto.

185
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:35,943
A letter of thank you to Cassett and to the embassy, all involved.

186
00:18:37,544 --> 00:18:39,046
It's a great program for our children.

187
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,948
A lot of people donate generous things.

188
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,655
come year after year.

189
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:44,618
Thank you very much.

190
00:18:56,567 --> 00:19:01,550
While we're into suspension, we had a posted budget hearing meeting that was continuing on to tonight.

191
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,813
It was posted last, actually early last week.

192
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:09,496
It was Medford Public Schools, Medford School Committee, Public Hearing, Fiscal Year 19 Budget.

193
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:16,621
It was Monday, June 18th, 2018 at 7 PM, Medford City Hall, Council Chambers 85, George B. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass.

194
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:18,769
And then there's a note to us.

195
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:28,054
And as everyone realizes, Thursday evening, we had a budget hearing that started, I believe, at 5.30 and went till maybe 6.30, till 11.30.

196
00:19:29,054 --> 00:19:33,697
And we went through the budget book and had many presenters and people answer questions.

197
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:36,919
And there were some items that were asked to be reviewed.

198
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,241
And we do have a sheet of proposed changes.

199
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:43,583
Mr. Superintendent, do you want me to read them, or do you want to?

200
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:45,284
Let me go over them real quick.

201
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:46,004
Mr. Superintendent.

202
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,643
Thank you, Mayor and members of the committee.

203
00:19:50,044 --> 00:20:13,361
Pursuant to our budget hearings that we had last Thursday, we reviewed some of the items that you brought up and tried to make some adjustments based on available funding that occurred during the few days that came after that meeting, and also based on what we perceived to be errors in the budget, at least in the first cut.

204
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,923
So in front of you, you have

205
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:18,479
a budget document follow-up.

206
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,401
I'm just going to go through it for a minute.

207
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:29,467
Two resignations from the vocational school, faculty yielded $17,116 in savings.

208
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:34,330
One was in the auto shop and the other was part of the engineering program.

209
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:41,755
Salaries would allow some gapping between what they would have made if they had stayed and what we will replace them at.

210
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:43,196
So that gives us back $17,000.

211
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:52,654
There was a few resignations from the special ed faculty, and that will yield another $3,339.

212
00:20:52,694 --> 00:21:02,316
And these total areas, the two of them, give us $20,455 in available funding to be reapplied.

213
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:07,898
So one area that you actually voted the other evening was the banned travel account.

214
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:19,123
Is that applause or is that just a... The band travel account got $3,000 that you actually voted.

215
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:34,956
Now, just so we understand, we have not changed the lines in your budget because until we make all the agreements tonight, we're not going to change things internally because once we change one page, we have to change five or six pages at least, minimum, because they all play off each other.

216
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:37,438
So, we're putting $3,000 into the band account.

217
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:45,215
The elementary textbook account is going to be increased by $1,500 per school for a total of $6,000.

218
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:47,256
Now, we put it in textbooks.

219
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:48,797
It can be used for educational materials.

220
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:49,857
It can be used for supplies.

221
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:58,062
Whatever the principal feels is important, but that gives them a little bit more back based on some of the discussion that was had the other evening.

222
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:04,465
The crew athletic program is expanding rapidly.

223
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:06,867
We've had several meetings outside of that.

224
00:22:06,907 --> 00:22:09,308
The mayor has hosted several meetings, and there's several things going on.

225
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,316
They have two seasons.

226
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:17,839
In order to supply the coaches, we are $8,400 short, so we added that to the athletic budget.

227
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,722
So we would cover that situation going forward this year.

228
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:31,607
And then there were two corrections to the principalships of the Andrews and the McGlynn Elementary that needed to be brought up to date.

229
00:22:31,687 --> 00:22:32,988
They were using older numbers.

230
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:42,674
That required $1,463 to go to the Andrews and $1,692 to the McGlynn Elementary Principalship.

231
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:48,478
So the total additions of recaptured funds evens out at $20,455.

232
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:54,143
The above adjustments and corrections will be made tonight if they're approved by the school committee.

233
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:59,868
And as we progress toward the school budget, the end of the school budget.

234
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:07,349
There will be multiple changes based on personnel matters and non-salary costs.

235
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:10,813
So there will be people that come and go, just like there are all year.

236
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:25,807
And we will bring you up to date periodically in order to free up some funds, either to fill an account that might need a boost because of cost, or maybe to add something back that we couldn't add back in the first cut.

237
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:31,579
So as I said, we're not changing budget lines because it would affect too many page changes.

238
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:38,100
We'll make the line adjustments once all decisions are made regarding the budget and provide copies to the school committee.

239
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,601
Additionally, the second page of what you've been handed has a report on union settlements.

240
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:51,443
And as I reported the other evening, the only union settlement at this point in time is a union settlement with the administrators.

241
00:23:53,815 --> 00:24:01,638
We're going to recommend later on this evening to look at the unit building principles and other units are still being negotiated.

242
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:07,941
We have some discussion tonight about the teacher's contract and we're meeting with the teachers tomorrow as well as the paraprofessionals.

243
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:13,183
So we'll give you information in that executive session as part of negotiations.

244
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:18,385
In addition, today we met extensively with Safe Havens,

245
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:24,371
That's the group that is doing the comprehensive study of our security procedures.

246
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:26,632
We went over a number of things with them.

247
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,814
Another visit will be coming back.

248
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,115
They've already had two visits now.

249
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:39,380
And when that is ready, we will come back with them with some recommendations regarding security.

250
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,382
In the interim, we have kept the security line in the budget.

251
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,492
But that doesn't mean that that will be the way we expend it.

252
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:53,094
It will be tied to the recommendations of Safe Havens and the wishes of the committee.

253
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:56,316
So let's see what that report tells us.

254
00:24:56,896 --> 00:25:02,779
There are a number of things we talked about today that are non-cost items that we think could be very helpful.

255
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:07,321
There's some repositioning things that could also be helpful, no-cost items.

256
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:11,182
And there are some things that are low-cost items that they think would be very helpful.

257
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:14,406
Let's let that report come out.

258
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:17,628
In the interim, we have the line item in place.

259
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:32,076
We're not going to spend against it until that report comes out, but we'll prepare ourselves to go in several directions and provide information to the committee so that we're ready to move once we see that report and once we reach some agreement.

260
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:34,077
So that is that piece there.

261
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:45,894
Again, one other item that came up the other evening that I think deserves some sort of mention tonight, and that's the Buildings and Grounds budget.

262
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:55,438
We believe that the projects that will be most consistent with what the community is asking for and what we've seen must come from capital funding.

263
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,260
What we have taken from that budget will not meet those needs.

264
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:18,181
What we have taken from that budget reflects our savings in telephone, reflects our savings in various forms of energy, reflects our savings in other areas, in cleaning, that we believe we can absorb at this point in time.

265
00:26:19,282 --> 00:26:20,943
And that allows the city

266
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:29,437
to consider our capital requests, which I've given you some suggestions, but certainly others may be in order.

267
00:26:29,977 --> 00:26:39,246
And as a committee and the mayor, you can sit and decide what you think is most appropriate as opposed to anything that I might think is appropriate.

268
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:42,770
And certainly Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent will weigh in as well.

269
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:51,718
I should tell you this evening that she would be here except the fact that her son Elijah had his wisdom teeth pulled and she's home giving him some comfort.

270
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:58,067
But I spoke to her and I've gone over the materials and I know that she's in support of what I'm giving him.

271
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,396
So I feel comfortable with that.

272
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:03,258
But that's what we've done so far since Thursday evening.

273
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,101
And I would hope that the committee would support the budget as we've presented it.

274
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:09,603
A lot of work has been done.

275
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:11,705
Staff has worked very hard to make things fit.

276
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:15,167
Budgets have contingencies in them, as we've talked about the other day.

277
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:19,230
You never know when something new is going to pop up, and you never know when we're going to save something.

278
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,552
But that's the process of managing a budget.

279
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:23,253
And that's what we do every year.

280
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:25,823
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

281
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:26,584
Mr. Benedetto.

282
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:27,224
Thank you.

283
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:32,128
I'd first like to start off talking about the security in our schools.

284
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:43,036
I received a text today from a new parent who works throughout the Commonwealth in and out of schools all the time, and this is the text that I received.

285
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:48,980
I'm really impressed by the security measures at Medford schools.

286
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:54,388
I've been to four schools and each one has been excellent, much better than other districts I've visited.

287
00:27:54,968 --> 00:27:59,052
I'm really critical about security and you are doing very well.

288
00:27:59,732 --> 00:28:11,342
So I thought I'd start off on a positive note and just tell you that the changes that we're making, parents are seeing them and they appreciate it.

289
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:16,726
Because they need to know that their child are entering a building in a safe environment and

290
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:27,554
Having those monitors at the doors, really, this new parent, she's been to the high school for the Parent Information Center, to the Columbus School, to many, many schools already.

291
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:35,256
And she has nothing but good things to say about the Method Public Schools so far in her experiences.

292
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:42,359
So I just thought I'd share that and say, you know, with everything going on, there are a lot of positive things happening.

293
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,100
So that's the positive.

294
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:58,951
First of all, thank you for financing the band travel, because if we're financing all the travel for the athletics, we should be financing all the travel for our music students as well.

295
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:00,893
So that's greatly appreciated.

296
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:02,655
Thank you for taking care of that line item.

297
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:11,843
And I'm sure as more people retire and people are replaced, more finances will be found to add different things in.

298
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:13,938
throughout up until September.

299
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:17,300
I know you usually say that to us, Mr. Belson.

300
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:23,464
I'm very happy to see additional textbooks added back to the elementary schools of $1,500.

301
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:25,525
They were cut $2,500.

302
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,426
It's a good step.

303
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:37,353
I really want to watch closely and make sure that the students and the books are in good shape for children to take home.

304
00:29:37,913 --> 00:29:39,634
And hopefully that $1,000 cut

305
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:45,346
Her elementary school won't affect them too drastically.

306
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:49,107
The crew program, I can't complain there.

307
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:56,310
My son was one of the first members to row for Method Crew, and he won the first medal for Method Crew.

308
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,852
And I think at some point, he'd like to donate it to the case up at the high school.

309
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:03,373
So we did find that recently, and we saved it.

310
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:05,434
So I'll give that to you, Mayberg.

311
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:08,935
Maybe you can help me with making that happen.

312
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:24,015
When we saw the amount of money spent on our athletics, some sports cost more than others, and maybe that's something down the road we'll look at.

313
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:28,257
But I'm really grateful that we have over 600 children involved.

314
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:34,280
And a lot of those children also are involved in band and orchestra, and they do everything.

315
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,623
So it affects a lot of children throughout the district.

316
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:45,000
Fourth grade on, they get to play musical instruments, even recorders before that.

317
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,302
But we have great programming both in the athletics and the arts.

318
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:57,767
I'm glad to see you adjusted the principal salaries so that they seem fair and equitable.

319
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:06,772
So everybody's on the same line item because we made great measures years ago to make sure that stayed that way.

320
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:13,466
And then I really, my problem with the budget is a few things.

321
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:17,487
The first is the lack of kindergarten aids, especially as a committee.

322
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:23,809
We have for years voiced our concern, and I don't feel like it's been heard or listened to.

323
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:27,690
Or maybe it was heard and just not the same priority as the administration.

324
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,992
I can respect disagreeing on certain things, but

325
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:38,293
Consistently, this committee has voiced concerns of that issue.

326
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,214
I would have liked to have seen that fixed in this budget.

327
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:51,919
The maintenance and repairs decrease of 6% seems really crazy to me when I see needs in our buildings.

328
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:56,340
And I talked about it at our committee of the whole meeting, just shades alone.

329
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:59,862
You could do a little bit every year with that.

330
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:11,907
And they're necessary not only to stop the glare so teachers can teach and people can see the boards, it's also for security reasons when you're in lockdown and shutdown.

331
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:21,652
That's a major issue too, because if you can't pull the outside shade and you're in the first floor, someone on the outside of the building can see into the room.

332
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:28,535
So I do have concerns with cutting maintenance and repairs at all.

333
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:32,887
If anything, I would like to see more maintenance and more repairs as our buildings age.

334
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:40,192
And those are my biggest issues, and I'm going to yield to other members.

335
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:42,073
I don't want to go on and on for a long time.

336
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:51,679
I do think that there was an error this year in the transfer of funds from the budget book.

337
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:55,161
I think that somehow, at the beginning of last year,

338
00:32:56,555 --> 00:33:03,038
The line item was $10,000 difference for the vocational school in one area and $5,000 in a different area.

339
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:07,881
And I noticed it at our budget meeting because I had both the previous years and this year's book open.

340
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:14,264
So it might have been lost through the 17-18 school year and then not carried over.

341
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:19,887
But it was in the 17-18 book that they should have carried over $70,000 and $60,000 was carried over.

342
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:27,857
I spoke with the superintendent and he said it was never allocated to them for 17-18.

343
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:30,777
So that's why it said 60 this year.

344
00:33:31,197 --> 00:33:32,538
I think it was a loss of them.

345
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:42,839
17-18 and another loss this year because not only did they go from the 70 to the 60, they're going down again from the 60.

346
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,301
And I just want to pull up the page so I make sure I get the correct information.

347
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:50,321
They were cut from 60 to 55.

348
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:59,190
So in the last, they're losing 15,000 in that line item, and the same thing happened with their textbooks.

349
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,991
It was supposed to be 15,000 carried over.

350
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:19,614
So I just feel like we need to look at that, and if adjustments need to be made throughout the school year, that they don't have enough money for their instructional supplies, especially out of vocation, because you need lab supplies for biotech.

351
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,543
You need shop supplies.

352
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:27,166
You need iron for the tin lockers.

353
00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:32,170
You need carpentry supplies and some of the equipment as well.

354
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,713
There's a big cut in vocational budget.

355
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:49,703
My husband's a union carpenter, and he's been up at the vocational school, and he sees that a lot of the shops are still using old machinery and need to be upgraded to see cuts in these areas.

356
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:58,147
is really very difficult for, it's not in the best interest of the education of our students.

357
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:02,969
So those are my main issues with this budget and it's very concerning.

358
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:10,611
So based on some of the things I see, I don't see me voting for this budget in the way that it's presented.

359
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,970
Ms.

360
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,390
Critz.

361
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:18,452
Yes, I was gonna mention kind of similar things that Erin mentioned, so I'm not gonna repeat that.

362
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:27,335
So I think, I just wanna make sure, I realize that we're gonna recapture some money due to some resignations at the vocational faculty.

363
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:40,839
I really wanna make sure that I know that we're gonna be looking for new teachers, so we need to keep, I just wanna make sure that the money that is put on the budget book, it might change because the person will be entering

364
00:35:41,342 --> 00:36:09,072
the salary would be a little bit different, but I don't want the money that's here listed for these teachers given to another area because the teachers are required to have so many students per ratio, teacher to student ratio, and then with the new freshmen coming in, they're gonna be rotating through the classes, so it's important that we're not gonna cut a teacher because each of the programs here need two teachers in each of those programs.

365
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:09,972
I know we're struggling.

366
00:36:10,465 --> 00:36:18,269
And I know Mr. Fallon is trying to find people to fill these positions, but I don't want that money to be used somewhere else.

367
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:25,032
I guess that's what I'm trying to say, because we need that money there, so when we get those teachers, they're gonna be there.

368
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:39,159
And while they're not there, we need somebody in there teaching with the students, because that is a major concern, because that's gonna be, I mean, it could be up to 40 children in one classroom, rotating through.

369
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,859
It's making me a little nervous with that many teachers gone.

370
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:51,947
And I also wanted to know if there's like an exit interview just to ask these teachers maybe, you know, why they left.

371
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:55,569
You know, with the human resources, you don't have to tell us, but I'm just curious.

372
00:36:55,609 --> 00:37:00,213
That's a lot of teachers in less than six months and, you know, I'm just concerned.

373
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:06,558
Is it something that's going on with the scheduling and, you know, because I've heard rumors that, you know,

374
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:10,021
We need to have a meeting and sit down and talk about the scheduling.

375
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:12,224
I'm not trying to break up the merger.

376
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:23,457
I'm not trying to do that, but I think that the scheduling is getting a little tricky with the vocational programs and what they have to take to learn their skills.

377
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:29,974
And I hope it's not some of the reasons why some of these teachers are leaving, or I don't know.

378
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:30,994
I mean, I really don't know.

379
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:32,615
I've heard a lot of rumors.

380
00:37:33,055 --> 00:37:33,875
I want to have a meeting.

381
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,156
You might be able to.

382
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:36,536
I think the superintendent wants to.

383
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:38,097
Let me try and answer some of these things.

384
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:44,239
First of all, there's only one reduction in the vocational faculty, and that's for a program that only had one student in it.

385
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:50,441
I mean, you can't sustain a program with one student, and the demand statewide has gone down.

386
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,882
We just have to be realistic when a program is not

387
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:54,818
going to attract students.

388
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:59,419
We can't fund it just simply because we've always had it or had it for a number of years.

389
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,600
Programs will come and go a little bit.

390
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,700
New programs will emerge.

391
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,601
And there may be that coming forward a year from now, there might be a plumbing program.

392
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:11,482
There might be some other program that is more likely to attract students.

393
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:13,703
You talked about landscaping the other night.

394
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:18,764
It might be something that's more attractive than the program that has one student in it.

395
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:23,485
So the only reduction is the one teacher from the program that had one student in it.

396
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:33,657
As far as the dollars and cents go, I don't want to get into individuals right now, but I know that some of them moved closer to home and also got more money.

397
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:34,798
You know what I mean?

398
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:38,281
And that's usually an attraction for people in the trades when they can do that.

399
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:42,304
We just simply need to pay attention to that.

400
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,546
The money we have, we're not moving any money away from it.

401
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:48,009
We're just simply saying that at this point in time, in order to cover the

402
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:52,836
variances or the different adjustments that you want, this is a good way to go.

403
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:57,617
But if a person costs more money, we'd go to undistributed to take that money from that account.

404
00:38:57,637 --> 00:38:58,738
You know what I mean?

405
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:03,439
So there's ways to make that up, but we have to begin someplace.

406
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:07,220
You take it where it exists initially, and then you move to cover it.

407
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:14,223
Do you know what the plan is for September if we don't have these teacher positions filled?

408
00:39:14,243 --> 00:39:17,184
Because we have a teacher missing in cosmetology,

409
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:30,133
construction, there's a CCL teacher, well he's there, I'm sorry, he's there, I'm sorry, HVAC, there's a teacher, they're down, and then I know robotics and engineering will be down one teacher.

410
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:35,398
And I know just from experience with my son in that classroom, it's very busy and I know

411
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:43,643
the teacher that left was the teacher who did most of the machinery and CNC and like that is in a different room.

412
00:39:43,743 --> 00:39:45,284
So it's very dangerous.

413
00:39:45,304 --> 00:39:48,266
Like you can't have kids in that room operating on their own.

414
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:51,048
Um, and then they're not going to learn the trade.

415
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,929
Um, so, so recruitment is underway.

416
00:39:54,209 --> 00:39:55,790
I mean, we're certainly going to recruit people.

417
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,771
We're going to make every effort to bring people in.

418
00:39:58,372 --> 00:40:03,355
Can I absolutely give you a, you know, a guarantee that we'll have the person we want by September?

419
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:03,415
No.

420
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:07,249
But it's highly likely we'll be aggressive out there to get people.

421
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,070
And there are people out there who want to.

422
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:22,057
And if a person has got good skills and ability, it may require getting a waiver from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in order to help them bridge the gap between their trade and also their teaching.

423
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:26,540
But we certainly have no intention of diminishing the faculty.

424
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:28,161
These things happen.

425
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:28,962
English teachers go.

426
00:40:29,102 --> 00:40:30,262
Social studies teachers go.

427
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,623
People come and go.

428
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:32,724
So we'll be at it.

429
00:40:34,437 --> 00:40:35,438
We'll be on it.

430
00:40:35,938 --> 00:41:00,853
So that was for the vocational, and so I wanted to bring up, there's been a lot of confusion, and I've been getting tagged on Facebook because I went out to the Brooks School, and when I went out to the Brooks School, I was invited, or we all were invited by the Brooks BTO, so I happened to have that day off, so I went to the Brooks School to just walk around, and we kind of put a list together

431
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:02,560
and I just wrote it up on paper.

432
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:10,082
It was just a to-do list, a wish list, almost like what the teachers submitted, the principals submitted for their school improvement plan.

433
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:12,543
It is a wish list.

434
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:22,167
Some of the items on the list can be done, things like cutting the bushes, cleaning up the trash, cutting the grass.

435
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:26,628
Those things can be done, and John McLaughlin has confirmed that things like that can be done.

436
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:30,590
So the rumors on Facebook are that I've promised

437
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:33,910
that the dirt field is going to be replaced with a turf field.

438
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,694
And I never made that promise to anybody.

439
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,338
So there's some confusion and there's some rumors flying around out there.

440
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:54,423
people are upset with me and they're calling me and emailing me and I don't know what, I really honestly was just going out to put the to-do list together and we as a committee haven't approved anything.

441
00:41:54,843 --> 00:42:08,748
It was we can all go out and meet with the PTOs and that is one of my plans to do, but I just did that last week and then a lot of things have developed since then, so my plan is over the summer and a couple of us maybe can

442
00:42:09,383 --> 00:42:13,345
go out and make a to-do list at each school and meet with the PTOs.

443
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:24,711
I still want to do that, but the timing of my visit to the Brooks and today's meeting, there hasn't been a lot of days in between that it gave me time to go out to the other schools.

444
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:28,092
And that's a lot of schools to go out and visit and do a to-do list.

445
00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:31,274
But I'm definitely going to go out to all of the schools.

446
00:42:31,694 --> 00:42:33,715
And I just want to clear up that confusion.

447
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:38,938
And I'm not going to go back and forth with people on Facebook, so I'm just addressing it right now.

448
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:47,345
And as I think the Mayor said, and Superintendent Baleson said, is that most of this is going to be coming from the capital funding.

449
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:56,228
So it's a good idea that we put a list together, so we know, okay, so we have this big list, and it's broken down by different schools.

450
00:42:56,633 --> 00:43:00,974
And then we have to look at it and say, well, who's going to get funding and what and where?

451
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,615
But everybody will get funding, I'm sure.

452
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:07,457
And I wasn't picking one school and only going to help that school.

453
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:08,717
I'm going to help all schools.

454
00:43:09,097 --> 00:43:16,780
I just want to make that clear, because I've really been getting a lot of messages and just not so nice.

455
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,521
So I just want to please, that was a misunderstanding.

456
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:22,802
I don't know where some of that information came from.

457
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:23,662
Yeah.

458
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:26,313
Mm-hmm, yeah.

459
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,293
Point of information, Ms.

460
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,194
Vanderbilt?

461
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:29,075
Point of information.

462
00:43:29,115 --> 00:43:31,997
Point of information, that no good deed goes unpunished.

463
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:33,739
Don't take it.

464
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:36,581
Yeah, so I know, and I plan to go out to the others.

465
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:37,662
You know, it takes time.

466
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:38,062
Yes.

467
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:38,903
Yeah, it takes time.

468
00:43:38,923 --> 00:43:40,624
Thank you, Ms.

469
00:43:40,724 --> 00:43:40,964
Krutz.

470
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:54,996
Yep, and I just had one more, and I just have an update for another parent that was concerned about some folding chairs at the Roberts, and I will get in touch with that parent, but they do have chairs for all the students,

471
00:43:55,395 --> 00:43:58,137
and there's only like one student that requires a folding chair.

472
00:43:58,517 --> 00:44:02,580
So everybody is all set and all the rugs have been replaced.

473
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:09,644
So I think that some of the information might just be a little outdated with some of the supplies that are at the school.

474
00:44:10,445 --> 00:44:17,249
One thing that she did want me to mention is that the Roberts is actually short and they haven't been able to get

475
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:25,576
money for easel paper over the past two years, and the PTO has been buying the easel paper.

476
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:34,703
So if there's any extra funding, you know, just a wish list, I wanted to just add that special note for them on behalf of the parent.

477
00:44:35,044 --> 00:44:39,808
So I just wanted to add that, and that's it for me.

478
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:41,949
Mr. Ruggiero.

479
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,830
Thank you, Mayor Burke.

480
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:50,240
Superintendent Nelson, do you have a sense of what the size of the capital budget request would be just ballpark figure?

481
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,501
I think, you know, the mayor has got many projects in front of her, you know, and I'll let her answer it.

482
00:44:55,541 --> 00:45:04,004
But I mean, obviously the schools were important, and I think she recognizes that has been generous over a period of time as as a predecessor has been.

483
00:45:04,944 --> 00:45:08,025
And I just think we need to put a list together and see where we can go.

484
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:11,346
But I think we, you know, need to give ourselves a multi year plan.

485
00:45:12,186 --> 00:45:14,147
You can't promise everybody everything all at once.

486
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:17,551
But if people see progress, I think they'll be encouraged.

487
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:19,071
And I think we can work from there.

488
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:23,614
Would the mayor be able to speak to the size of the capital budget?

489
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,115
Can you just give me a rough ballpark estimate?

490
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:29,097
As I mentioned the other night, once we have free cash certified, then we'll be able to look at it deeper.

491
00:45:29,798 --> 00:45:33,320
But until we have that number, we can't really look.

492
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,582
After the last budget meeting, I was deeply disturbed.

493
00:45:38,347 --> 00:45:43,471
Not by so much the presentation of the budget or anything that was contained in, but a fact I learned that I wasn't aware of.

494
00:45:43,931 --> 00:45:49,955
And this would be the pupil transportation of homeless students and the amount of money that's spent to this program.

495
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:57,261
Obviously, I have no troubles helping students that are homeless, making sure that they're a part of our community.

496
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:02,645
But when we spend so much on these students, that money could be better used

497
00:46:03,485 --> 00:46:05,126
to house them.

498
00:46:06,006 --> 00:46:18,051
The fact that we're spending over $13,000 a year to move a child here from Medford to whatever community they come from where their parents might be living in a shelter is insane.

499
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:27,575
It is the exact kind of bureaucratic insanity which prompted me to run for elected office.

500
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:33,373
So that said, I would like to ask my colleagues that we refer this issue to City Solicitor Mark Brumley.

501
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:40,096
Now, I understand that the state is supposed to reimburse us for this money, and they haven't.

502
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:48,659
But we have a platform to advocate for these children, and by pressing this case as hard as possible,

503
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,932
with either our own attorney, Howard Greenspan, or City Solicitor Mark Rumley.

504
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,653
I think would shed light on this problem.

505
00:46:57,554 --> 00:47:09,419
Like I said, it's absolutely absurd that we spend this money to truck a child back and forth, rather than helping them house, helping them find housing.

506
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:17,043
And I seriously would like to make a motion that we refer this issue to City Solicitor Mark Rumley.

507
00:47:17,757 --> 00:47:21,639
I'm just going to suggest to you, you might be more productive to refer it to the legislature.

508
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:23,020
Well, we've been doing that.

509
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,721
Because it's clearly not a legal issue.

510
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:32,184
It's clearly a way that the legislature funds these things statewide.

511
00:47:32,744 --> 00:47:35,206
And there are reasons why they place people in different homes.

512
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:39,388
Sometimes there may be housing available in some communities, sometimes not in others.

513
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:43,069
But maybe there could be an option that the legislature could put together.

514
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,211
But I don't think that the solicitor can tell you

515
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,364
that the legislature must do that.

516
00:47:48,964 --> 00:47:53,808
I think the solicitor can tell you that, you know, the possibility exists if they choose to do that.

517
00:47:53,908 --> 00:47:58,050
It's my understanding that the Supreme Court ruled that they have to reimburse us for this money.

518
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,491
Is that correct or incorrect?

519
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,854
They technically are, but it's always subject to appropriation.

520
00:48:03,874 --> 00:48:09,698
The famous last words of subject to appropriation, which means if they don't appropriate the money, they don't have to reimburse us.

521
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:16,785
Well, I think that we need to pursue this issue beyond simply just putting pressure on legislators.

522
00:48:17,485 --> 00:48:18,106
I really do.

523
00:48:19,526 --> 00:48:20,706
Make it in the form of a motion.

524
00:48:20,726 --> 00:48:21,966
I'm sure someone will second it.

525
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:27,808
And we can send it to Solicitor Romney, Howard Greenspan, and also to our Attorney General.

526
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:28,348
All right.

527
00:48:28,888 --> 00:48:31,208
So the resolution I'd like to put forward.

528
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:35,789
I think Mr. Russo, point of information on this?

529
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:37,810
Mr. Russo.

530
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:48,925
the Mass Association of School Committee, the Poverty Summit that I attended, every single community is up in arms in this.

531
00:48:50,546 --> 00:48:53,647
So I mean, we're certainly not special in that regard.

532
00:48:53,687 --> 00:48:57,168
In fact, we probably have a lower number than a lot of communities.

533
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:03,750
But as I believe somebody else, maybe it was you who pointed out, the Supreme Court's already been cleared.

534
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:04,950
No one funded mandates.

535
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:06,691
The Supreme Court doesn't have an army.

536
00:49:08,005 --> 00:49:14,433
So they can say that, and the legislature can just ignore the Supreme Court, and that's what they're doing.

537
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:21,683
And the judge isn't going to pass this up to the Supreme Court.

538
00:49:21,703 --> 00:49:23,445
It's something that's already decided.

539
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:28,448
Well, they can put a ruling for... There is a ruling from the Supreme Court.

540
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:32,754
Can I leave that to the lawyers to decide if there's a way to proceed?

541
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:39,665
Yeah, I would like to make a formal motion to have City Solicitor Mark Rumley and Howard Greenspan look at this issue.

542
00:49:40,348 --> 00:49:42,609
to advise us how we should move forward.

543
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,832
My frustration is not in helping homeless children.

544
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:48,372
That absolutely needs to be done.

545
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:52,174
My frustration is wasting money that could be better used housing these children.

546
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:54,656
And I find it deeply frustrating.

547
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:57,277
Point of information, Mr. Benedetto?

548
00:49:57,757 --> 00:49:58,078
Thank you.

549
00:49:58,258 --> 00:49:59,198
A little bit of history.

550
00:49:59,418 --> 00:50:04,641
I'm the homeless coordinator for another district.

551
00:50:05,162 --> 00:50:09,564
So this issue I brought up over the last few years

552
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:19,364
And when I was running for state representative, this was an issue that I was going to work on at the House of Representatives.

553
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:29,606
When I didn't get elected, I sat down with Christine Barber, who is our state representative, and she brought the issue before the House.

554
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:37,108
And it was unanimously approved for a commission to study this issue.

555
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:41,956
And that was approved maybe close to three years ago now.

556
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:48,500
So I've been recently talking to Pat Jalen and Christine Barber.

557
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,804
Actually, Christine texted me yesterday to discuss this commission.

558
00:50:54,204 --> 00:51:07,013
And I also spoke with someone who has the ear of the governor and asked him to bring the commission forward instead of appointing it, and how I really want a seat on that commission.

559
00:51:08,783 --> 00:51:24,254
And my goal and my dedication to this is to sit on that commission and make changes not only in homeless transportation, but to have a directory of homeless families so that homeless children are placed closer to the communities that they lived in.

560
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:33,960
So yes, we talked about this a little bit at our last meeting, and I talked about my colleagues working with me on this issue.

561
00:51:35,577 --> 00:51:38,858
really believe that that commission is our next step.

562
00:51:39,818 --> 00:51:45,180
I'm totally for your motion to try things that way as well.

563
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,920
And I want to know who's making the money.

564
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,081
I want to follow the money and see who's getting rich.

565
00:51:51,101 --> 00:51:54,722
Because we pay, I'm not sure how much Meffitt pays, but.

566
00:51:54,742 --> 00:51:54,722
$160,000.

567
00:51:54,762 --> 00:51:55,102
$260 a day.

568
00:51:55,122 --> 00:51:58,223
I like to break it down a day per child to drive them to and from a shelter.

569
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:13,666
Sometimes less if there's two kids in a car or a family of children, then it could be like 160 per child per day.

570
00:52:14,226 --> 00:52:23,389
With that amount of money, you could rent them an apartment, buy their clothes and their food, and really take care of them in a lot of different ways.

571
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,790
But that's not legislated yet.

572
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:31,913
And the only way we're going to change this is through legislation and through active participation.

573
00:52:31,993 --> 00:52:35,614
And I really believe that that's the method that I choose to work in.

574
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:40,352
But I'll support you in your motion to move forward in this way as well.

575
00:52:40,732 --> 00:52:45,015
On the motion as seconded by Mr. Russo, roll call vote, please.

576
00:52:45,035 --> 00:52:45,335
Mrs. DeBette.

577
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:45,536
Yes.

578
00:52:45,856 --> 00:52:46,256
Mrs. Ratchett.

579
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:46,396
Yes.

580
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:46,636
Mr. Hughes.

581
00:52:47,057 --> 00:52:47,297
Yes.

582
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:48,317
Mr. O'Toole.

583
00:52:50,759 --> 00:52:50,939
Yes.

584
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,760
Mr. Russo.

585
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:52,400
Yes.

586
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,202
Mrs. Vandeclute.

587
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:55,622
Yes.

588
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:55,782
Ms.

589
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:56,103
Vandeclute.

590
00:52:56,123 --> 00:52:56,203
Yes.

591
00:52:56,223 --> 00:52:57,964
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, motion passes.

592
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:01,046
On the budget, Ms.

593
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:01,506
Vandeclute.

594
00:53:05,192 --> 00:53:11,077
First, I think that it's great that Erin, you've done the work on the homeless issue.

595
00:53:11,197 --> 00:53:12,177
And Michael, you're interested.

596
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:18,302
It's certainly one that the MASC, Massachusetts Associated School Committees, has been interested.

597
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:24,547
Unfunded mandates altogether has been a constant theme of their trying to, of advocacy.

598
00:53:25,648 --> 00:53:32,213
And it's very, very frustrating that the number of unfunded mandates that school systems have to deal with.

599
00:53:33,027 --> 00:53:46,597
On the budget overall, I think it's a, I was very pleased to see that the bottom line had risen and that we were able to accommodate so many things that we did want to put forth.

600
00:53:50,280 --> 00:54:01,828
I think that, Mayor, we're putting a great deal of trust in you because the other night you did, in response to one of my questions, mention that once you understand the level of free cash the city has,

601
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:07,076
that we would be looking at a capital budget, which is just so essential now.

602
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:09,197
We've actually been putting it off a little bit.

603
00:54:09,438 --> 00:54:18,905
When we came in, I think maybe two and a half years ago, we actually have done, we have the list of things that needs to be done, although they need to be updated.

604
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:23,869
But some of those very same things, for example, playgrounds and whatever, they're on the list.

605
00:54:24,149 --> 00:54:26,190
And there's much smaller items and much bigger items.

606
00:54:26,771 --> 00:54:30,674
I think that is the one place in the budget which is just a little tough because, for instance, when I see

607
00:54:31,506 --> 00:54:39,292
The $100,000 in telephone savings, that would have been nice to be able to keep in the budget, but I have to be realistic about the demands of money on the city.

608
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:46,057
And so I'm putting my trust in you, Mayor Burke, to make sure that we are going to move forward on a capital budget.

609
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:56,094
I think that there's, we always have to understand, I said several times last week, that we are essentially in the bottom line, approving the bottom line of the budget.

610
00:54:56,414 --> 00:54:57,034
That's what we do.

611
00:54:57,534 --> 00:55:01,635
And that there always has to be understood that there will be some changes and some flexibility.

612
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:14,797
So when we talk about areas that are of concern, that we might be seeing changes, hopefully, in the ways that the committee would like to direct over the next couple of weeks and months.

613
00:55:15,778 --> 00:55:18,539
So I'd like to put a motion forward to approve the budget.

614
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,140
Yes.

615
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,241
To approve the budget.

616
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:36,323
Because my daughter is employed in the vocational program, I'd like to sever the vocational salary budget for $2,416,682 and vote on that separately.

617
00:55:36,343 --> 00:55:37,724
And then put forward a, so with

618
00:55:43,794 --> 00:55:46,516
someone else could put forward that motion to approve that piece of it.

619
00:55:47,056 --> 00:55:53,561
And then I would put forward a motion to approve the rest of the budget, 58,608,631, which will give us a grand total of 66,629,011.

620
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:58,004
Is there a motion on the floor for approval of the vocational salary budget for fiscal 19 of $2,416,682?

621
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:58,244
Yes.

622
00:55:58,364 --> 00:55:58,945
It's a motion by Ms.

623
00:55:58,985 --> 00:55:59,185
Kretz.

624
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:00,646
Is there a second?

625
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:12,574
I'm Mr. Russo.

626
00:56:12,774 --> 00:56:13,774
Roll call vote, please, Ms.

627
00:56:13,814 --> 00:56:14,155
Kretz.

628
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:19,418
Just the vocational salary.

629
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:19,978
Ms.

630
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:37,309
Van Kloot needs to abstain due to a family member being employed there.

631
00:56:39,351 --> 00:56:39,651
Abstain.

632
00:56:42,452 --> 00:56:47,453
Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one abstain, motion passes on that.

633
00:56:48,134 --> 00:56:50,374
On the total appropriated fiscal 19, Mr. Russo.

634
00:56:50,394 --> 00:56:56,216
Oh my gosh, sorry, I just had to switch my thought.

635
00:56:57,936 --> 00:56:58,556
Again, yes.

636
00:56:58,576 --> 00:57:05,378
Sorry, give me a moment.

637
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:07,359
Would anybody else please?

638
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:07,579
Ms.

639
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,499
Van de Kloot, did you?

640
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:18,815
make a motion for approval of the total appropriated fiscal 19 you did make that yes I know mr. zero I just wanted there are a couple of issues that I found

641
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:30,589
beyond the other points, the kindergarten aides and the capital budget.

642
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:34,290
I am going to end up abstaining on this budget.

643
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:35,391
I have difficulty.

644
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:36,531
You cannot abstain.

645
00:57:36,571 --> 00:57:37,271
You can vote no.

646
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,412
It's a yes or no.

647
00:57:38,492 --> 00:57:40,613
You need a conflict of interest reason to abstain.

648
00:57:40,853 --> 00:57:41,133
I see.

649
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:47,395
Well, I- And this is not a capital budget.

650
00:57:47,475 --> 00:57:48,355
Just keep that in mind.

651
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:48,536
I can't.

652
00:57:48,556 --> 00:57:49,656
This is the operating budget.

653
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:51,497
Just for information.

654
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,038
I understand it's not the capital budget, ma'am, but could you please

655
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:57,806
I'm asking just for a rough estimate.

656
00:57:58,326 --> 00:57:59,527
I can't give that to you tonight.

657
00:58:01,988 --> 00:58:02,869
On the capital budget?

658
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:04,710
On the capital, so you have no idea.

659
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:10,072
No, we haven't closed our books yet.

660
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:12,334
Mr. Superintendent, would you?

661
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:16,536
I've been around a long time, as most of you know.

662
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:18,557
And some people think too long.

663
00:58:18,657 --> 00:58:20,398
But nevertheless, I've seen a lot of budgets.

664
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:25,080
If you get hung up on any one item,

665
00:58:26,352 --> 00:58:29,094
You're not helping because the budget is much bigger.

666
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:32,556
We've got to be able to look at the budget in its totality.

667
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:50,048
You can express your displeasure or your concern about an item or a particular thing, but you don't want to not vote for the things that you do care about, supplies for the kids, teachers, materials, all the kinds of things, services that kids need.

668
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:55,432
I think, you know, if you have an objection to a particular item, express it.

669
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:01,894
But don't not vote for the whole budget, because the budget probably has many things in it that you do want to support.

670
00:59:02,655 --> 00:59:04,916
And I think that's really something to say.

671
00:59:04,936 --> 00:59:17,566
You can come out and say what you don't like, but you certainly want to support all the resources, $60 million worth of resources going to young people and families in this community.

672
00:59:18,366 --> 00:59:19,327
That's the way you've got to look at it.

673
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:24,931
I mean, that's the way I have to look at it every year, because there are many things that I would like to put in the budget that I can't.

674
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:29,574
I mean, if I had, you know, an unlimited checkbook, you'd be a lot more things in this budget.

675
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:31,335
But no one ever does.

676
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:37,797
In fact, today, you should know that the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ruled against the Fair Share Amendment.

677
00:59:38,317 --> 00:59:40,278
That's the million dollars tax.

678
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:53,463
That's 1.9 to 2 billion dollars worth of lost revenue that the Commonwealth will not... And the legislature is going to have to struggle, and the governor is going to have to struggle with how they are going to fund things.

679
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:56,602
The discussion of the foundation budget is rife.

680
00:59:57,422 --> 00:59:59,463
Some of the offsets are rife, circuit breaker.

681
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:00,683
We've talked about these things.

682
01:00:01,623 --> 01:00:03,224
Where are the resources going to come from?

683
01:00:03,284 --> 01:00:11,487
So no one, whether it's the state level or our level, gets to fund everything they believe should be in a budget.

684
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:20,110
So I would just suggest that if there's a particular item that you feel needs more attention going forward, you express it.

685
01:00:22,115 --> 01:00:28,297
But don't withhold your support for a whole budget, because you're basically saying the other things aren't worth it.

686
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:29,637
Of course they're worth it.

687
01:00:30,217 --> 01:00:31,297
A lot of things are worth it.

688
01:00:31,317 --> 01:00:32,238
Mr. Ruggiero.

689
01:00:32,558 --> 01:00:45,141
I mean, with all due respect to the superintendent, whose opinion I do value, my frustration is parents are very concerned and very frustrated about the state of some of our grounds.

690
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:48,922
And I mean, so I guess it boils down to a question of trust.

691
01:00:49,502 --> 01:00:51,443
And I'm ultimately out.

692
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:53,885
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, Mayor Burke.

693
01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:56,987
I mean, I think that's the best move forward.

694
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:59,228
I've mentioned all my reservations to you.

695
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:01,310
I appreciate some of the items that were brought up.

696
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:07,834
I still can't understand why we can't hire a couple more part-time kindergarten aides.

697
01:01:08,294 --> 01:01:11,296
I don't understand the logic of that, but.

698
01:01:12,977 --> 01:01:18,220
And the other night, we did ask that they look very closely, the new superintendent over the summer, and Ms.

699
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:18,801
Patterson.

700
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:20,462
Right, and, you know.

701
01:01:20,482 --> 01:01:22,103
If they need to free up, that's the priority.

702
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:24,888
This is my first year serving.

703
01:01:25,509 --> 01:01:30,952
I've noticed other members have maybe more frustrations than I, but I'll cut you some slack, I guess.

704
01:01:33,914 --> 01:01:52,105
So I just want to mention that after our budget meeting on Thursday, by chance I found myself walking out to our cars with the new superintendent-elect, and she and I had a very interesting discussion about the kindergarten aides and what her

705
01:01:54,053 --> 01:01:59,557
what she would like to see for kindergarten age, what she would want expectations.

706
01:02:00,118 --> 01:02:17,631
She obviously would very much like to see support in kindergartens, but she also had some very clear ideas which were, I don't think it's for me to share, but I can guarantee you from that discussion that I've had with her, I don't think that this is just something that's going to go by the wayside.

707
01:02:17,952 --> 01:02:19,773
I do think we want her to be able to weigh in.

708
01:02:20,273 --> 01:02:22,215
I think we've talked about that there is some

709
01:02:22,843 --> 01:02:29,208
levels of flexibility in the budget that we need to hear the report from the security company to determine which way we're going forth.

710
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:38,974
And so without, I mean, again, it's a little, I don't want to speak for her, but yet I do want to share with my colleagues that I had a most interesting conversation about that.

711
01:02:39,154 --> 01:02:42,777
And I feel comfortable from that, that she has a direction.

712
01:02:44,818 --> 01:02:45,139
Thank you.

713
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:46,119
Mr. Russo.

714
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:46,640
Yes.

715
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,282
Thank you for saying the words capital budget.

716
01:02:50,923 --> 01:02:51,083
So

717
01:02:51,882 --> 01:03:02,146
For the capital budget, unlike this budget, or maybe like this budget, will we develop a budget for the capital budget, or will you in your office?

718
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:03,126
No, we would prioritize.

719
01:03:03,767 --> 01:03:05,267
So you give us a number.

720
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:10,149
We decide how it's spent, not here's the list of the things that we're going to do.

721
01:03:10,509 --> 01:03:10,749
OK.

722
01:03:11,149 --> 01:03:12,910
I just want to be clear on that.

723
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,110
And then one other issue.

724
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,671
And then the city council has to approve it.

725
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:16,011
Yeah.

726
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:16,691
Yes.

727
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,312
All right.

728
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:29,649
I don't want to spend all night rehashing the issue of the security spending and the budget, which I probably spent too much time on Thursday on.

729
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:38,293
But I do want to be crystal clear that the report from Safe Havens will not decide what we do.

730
01:03:38,393 --> 01:03:39,654
We will decide what we do.

731
01:03:40,594 --> 01:03:41,595
Sort of, kind of.

732
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:59,504
the statements around that report sort of were a little vague, and that we will not, the school system will hire zero new security personnel prior to the school committee deciding based on that report that we want to hire security personnel.

733
01:03:59,584 --> 01:04:00,264
Is that correct?

734
01:04:02,124 --> 01:04:04,565
We'll have to have a meeting over the summer once we get the reporting.

735
01:04:06,145 --> 01:04:07,326
I'm just trying to decide like,

736
01:04:09,377 --> 01:04:15,621
Well, I thought we actually decided that on Thursday, that there'd be no hiring of security personnel prior to us deciding.

737
01:04:15,761 --> 01:04:25,006
I mean, the report coming in to the superintendent's office and the mayor's office isn't the same as us getting together, having read the report, and deciding what action to take.

738
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:32,331
So when I approve, you know, vote for the budget, I mean, there's five security personnel in there.

739
01:04:32,711 --> 01:04:38,795
And Dr. Edward Vincent, you know, she is legally free to go off and hire those people on July 1.

740
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:43,059
And I just want to be crystal clear, that won't happen.

741
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:45,260
I guarantee you that will not happen.

742
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:45,700
Thank you.

743
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,140
Sorry.

744
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:50,602
Mr. Benedetto.

745
01:04:51,443 --> 01:04:59,147
So the superintendent's idea that we do vote for the bottom line of the budget, yes, we vote for the bottom line of the budget.

746
01:04:59,307 --> 01:05:03,729
But we also have been asking and giving our priorities over the years.

747
01:05:04,129 --> 01:05:07,971
And I don't think that this budget reflects the priorities.

748
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:13,973
The maintenance, we walked every building a couple years ago and made a list that we still have.

749
01:05:14,354 --> 01:05:20,637
We've talked repeatedly about the importance of the foundation of education in kindergarten age.

750
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:28,102
So the list, like the capital budget list, who's giving, is it coming to us or created by us?

751
01:05:28,282 --> 01:05:31,264
Because this budget came to us, it wasn't created by us.

752
01:05:31,564 --> 01:05:35,066
Because I feel like our priorities aren't in here.

753
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:38,932
This has been drafted and given to us.

754
01:05:39,012 --> 01:05:42,155
And we can just verbally say, well, we wish we had this.

755
01:05:43,337 --> 01:05:45,579
Well, I'm voting on what I want.

756
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:53,327
And I'm voting on kindergarten aides and maintenance cuts and vocational cuts.

757
01:05:53,928 --> 01:05:58,573
And because those priorities are my priorities and the priorities of the people I represent.

758
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,298
And they wouldn't want me to vote on a bottom line.

759
01:06:01,538 --> 01:06:05,639
They wanted me to make sure that the things that are important to them are in this budget.

760
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:09,120
And if they're not, they want me to vote not, not on a number.

761
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,580
So that's how I vote.

762
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,861
I don't interpret it the same way as the superintendent has presented it.

763
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:18,103
So that, that, I just wanted to clarify that.

764
01:06:18,623 --> 01:06:22,604
I just, you know, I guess it's a different, different way of approach because for me,

765
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:26,261
I am voting for all the teachers who are in this budget.

766
01:06:26,421 --> 01:06:28,624
I'm voting for all the administrators who are in this budget.

767
01:06:28,704 --> 01:06:33,209
I'm voting for all of the supplies that are in this budget.

768
01:06:33,249 --> 01:06:35,572
I'm voting for all of the coaches who are in this budget.

769
01:06:35,612 --> 01:06:41,179
I'm voting for all of the different, every level of different things and

770
01:06:41,989 --> 01:06:54,431
While I certainly understand the importance of some of the smaller other issues that people are bringing up and are concerned about, and I share that concern too, there are so many things.

771
01:06:55,232 --> 01:07:03,233
I think a vote no for the budget says that we are not providing adequate monies to educate our children.

772
01:07:03,273 --> 01:07:04,453
And I believe that we are.

773
01:07:05,014 --> 01:07:07,234
I think that we always would like to have more.

774
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:08,890
Everybody would like to have more.

775
01:07:09,471 --> 01:07:11,911
But this is a sound budget.

776
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:14,912
There's a motion on the floor by Ms.

777
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:20,494
Van de Kloot for approval of the appropriated fiscal 19 budget of 58,608,631.

778
01:07:20,674 --> 01:07:24,976
Is there a second?

779
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:27,437
Before I call the roll, sure.

780
01:07:28,097 --> 01:07:32,378
So in mid-August, you mentioned that you would roughly have a timeline.

781
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:36,440
There'll be a committee of the whole meeting where we discuss the capital improvement plan.

782
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:37,881
Thank you very much.

783
01:07:38,202 --> 01:07:38,944
I just wanted to make sure.

784
01:07:39,385 --> 01:07:40,567
Is there a second on the floor?

785
01:07:41,068 --> 01:07:42,291
Seconded by Mr. Russo.

786
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:42,491
Ms.

787
01:07:42,511 --> 01:07:43,634
Kretz, roll call vote, please.

788
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:50,953
Yes.

789
01:07:51,093 --> 01:07:52,895
Yes.

790
01:07:55,737 --> 01:07:56,077
Yes.

791
01:07:56,318 --> 01:07:56,558
Yes.

792
01:07:56,858 --> 01:07:57,078
Yes.

793
01:07:57,138 --> 01:08:03,083
Six in the affirmative one in the negative motion passes the total appropriate fiscal 19 budget 58 6 0 8 6 3 1.

794
01:08:04,184 --> 01:08:13,932
Also there's a total superintendents fiscal 19 budget of 60 million 6 29 0 11 which includes revenue offsets which are grants and various other revenue sources.

795
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:15,268
that of $2,020,381.

796
01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:18,993
Need a vote for that too?

797
01:08:20,214 --> 01:08:22,477
Let's have a motion for approval, Ms.

798
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:25,541
Van de Kloot, on the total superintendent's budget.

799
01:08:25,762 --> 01:08:27,324
So moved, Mr. Russo seconded.

800
01:08:27,764 --> 01:08:28,605
Roll call, please, Ms.

801
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:28,866
Cripps.

802
01:08:35,253 --> 01:08:43,519
Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

803
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:44,780
Thank you very much.

804
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,543
I know that there are lots of things that we all would love to have and see.

805
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:55,388
We really have to put it all together and do what's best for the whole community and there are a lot of resources being spread across it.

806
01:08:55,968 --> 01:08:57,870
And we only have so much of a pie.

807
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,671
So people have to understand that.

808
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:02,354
It's not a tree that produces cash.

809
01:09:02,674 --> 01:09:06,237
We have a limitation on how much revenues we can take in through taxes.

810
01:09:06,697 --> 01:09:12,562
And unfortunately, the cherry sheets, the money we get from the state, it's pretty much been level every year while costs continue to go up.

811
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:17,687
So we're absorbing all the increases, and the state's certainly not helping us with any of that.

812
01:09:18,427 --> 01:09:19,508
So thank you very much.

813
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:22,371
Ms.

814
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:22,751
Vindekloot.

815
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:39,409
appropriate to thank all of the people who worked on the budget, particularly our superintendent of finance, Christine Patterson, and everybody else who just helped put this together, who did number crunching, who did paper collating.

816
01:09:40,349 --> 01:09:42,710
It's a huge job, and we're most appreciative.

817
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:44,411
Thank you.

818
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:50,915
Thank you, finance department, and superintendent's office, and our new superintendent for all participating.

819
01:09:52,096 --> 01:09:52,716
Mr. Ruggiero?

820
01:09:53,263 --> 01:09:55,425
I just also want to thank the members of the school committee.

821
01:09:56,927 --> 01:10:04,934
I really appreciated not only everyone's heart, but also the opportunity to explore the issues with you, because we all have disagreements.

822
01:10:04,954 --> 01:10:06,456
We all have programs that we really love.

823
01:10:08,233 --> 01:10:12,976
But it was a really wonderful experience for me, and I really appreciated working with you.

824
01:10:12,996 --> 01:10:26,783
So I just want to, beyond all of the work that our finance department did, and all the work our superintendent, and I'm sure all the work that Dr. Edward Vincent put in as well, I just wanted everyone to know, I mean, we worked very long on this.

825
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:29,584
And it really means a lot to me how hard people work.

826
01:10:29,724 --> 01:10:30,185
So thank you.

827
01:10:30,465 --> 01:10:30,825
Very good.

828
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:37,364
The next item on the agenda, recommendation to approve the school committee meeting schedule for school year 18-19.

829
01:10:40,007 --> 01:10:41,308
Motion to approve by Ms.

830
01:10:41,348 --> 01:10:43,169
Mastone, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

831
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:44,891
Roll call on this too?

832
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:45,191
Yeah?

833
01:10:45,311 --> 01:10:47,533
Mr. Benedetto.

834
01:10:49,115 --> 01:10:49,395
Yes.

835
01:10:50,075 --> 01:10:50,236
Oh.

836
01:10:50,276 --> 01:10:51,577
Mr. Stokes.

837
01:10:51,637 --> 01:10:51,897
Yes.

838
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,001
Mr. Jones.

839
01:10:56,181 --> 01:10:56,341
Yes.

840
01:11:01,161 --> 01:11:03,882
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

841
01:11:04,362 --> 01:11:05,663
Item two, Mr. Russo.

842
01:11:08,004 --> 01:11:10,345
Sorry, a question about procedure.

843
01:11:11,466 --> 01:11:15,227
So when... He's having trouble hearing.

844
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:16,708
Sorry.

845
01:11:16,788 --> 01:11:17,949
Just a question about procedure.

846
01:11:18,049 --> 01:11:25,412
So for the next budget cycle, I'm just trying to figure out when the right time is to ask for some changes such as

847
01:11:26,618 --> 01:11:31,880
Like sports, I'd like to know the per pupil, how many pupils are participating in each sport.

848
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:38,062
And that's just one of many changes to the way the budget's presented to us.

849
01:11:38,543 --> 01:11:38,823
So.

850
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:43,384
The pre-budget meetings that preceded start in February.

851
01:11:43,624 --> 01:11:43,905
Okay.

852
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:46,806
If you want to see certain things, I would make a request to that.

853
01:11:46,826 --> 01:11:46,926
Okay.

854
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:47,926
Thank you.

855
01:11:47,966 --> 01:11:53,248
Mayor Burke, I also have another point that's not a part of the process, but something I'd like to see in the future.

856
01:11:54,273 --> 01:11:57,538
A number of communities have worked with participatory budgeting.

857
01:11:57,914 --> 01:12:01,456
where a certain amount of money is set aside for the community to decide how it's used.

858
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:07,078
I was thinking that .1% would work out to be about $60,000.

859
01:12:07,238 --> 01:12:12,040
I would like in the future to explore this idea.

860
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,062
I don't know exactly when the right time is.

861
01:12:15,182 --> 01:12:23,125
We could put this as an agenda item so we could debate it or I'll make a motion right now to explore the idea or put it on the next time we have an agenda.

862
01:12:23,145 --> 01:12:27,047
Generally it's on the city side, so it'd be in the municipal budget.

863
01:12:27,837 --> 01:12:32,299
No, I would like to see community budget and the school budget.

864
01:12:32,619 --> 01:12:34,399
So parents have a little bit more feedback.

865
01:12:34,519 --> 01:12:36,800
I mean, yeah, I think that would help community participation.

866
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,861
And in addition, parents sometimes have the best ideas.

867
01:12:40,462 --> 01:12:42,562
I've learned a whole lot from the people that have called me.

868
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:47,424
So you probably want to make a motion as we get into December time frame.

869
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:47,584
OK.

870
01:12:48,205 --> 01:12:49,665
I just want to get a sense of when we'll do that.

871
01:12:49,685 --> 01:12:51,966
I'll ask to put that on the agenda when we have the time.

872
01:12:52,146 --> 01:12:52,366
Thank you.

873
01:12:52,386 --> 01:12:52,766
Very good.

874
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:54,167
Item two.

875
01:12:54,827 --> 01:12:55,547
Mr. Benedetto.

876
01:12:56,027 --> 01:12:56,368
Thank you.

877
01:12:58,153 --> 01:13:01,195
It reminded me of a question.

878
01:13:01,596 --> 01:13:12,924
We spoke a little bit at our last meeting about the Roberts School ground cover for the playground, and I was just wondering if it was sent out for it.

879
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:14,566
That was Thursday evening.

880
01:13:14,606 --> 01:13:17,008
I don't believe it happened Friday morning.

881
01:13:17,028 --> 01:13:17,588
I don't know.

882
01:13:17,688 --> 01:13:17,868
Ms.

883
01:13:17,908 --> 01:13:19,269
Patterson, the Roberts PRFB?

884
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:20,891
I think they said this morning.

885
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:23,452
It was what they said Thursday night.

886
01:13:23,493 --> 01:13:24,333
You knew the answer to that.

887
01:13:24,393 --> 01:13:25,194
No, no, no, no, no.

888
01:13:25,714 --> 01:13:26,515
They sent it today.

889
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:29,960
Oh, okay, you wouldn't know.

890
01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:31,481
City Hall was closed today.

891
01:13:31,781 --> 01:13:32,902
Oh, that's fine.

892
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:36,444
Item two, report on university partnership.

893
01:13:36,464 --> 01:13:37,484
Mr. Superintendent.

894
01:13:38,444 --> 01:13:42,927
So I'm gonna share this with our assistant superintendent for finance.

895
01:13:42,967 --> 01:13:43,867
Come on up, Christine.

896
01:13:44,627 --> 01:13:51,090
She did all the work in getting it together and out to, with Schaub and working together to get the stuff in.

897
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:56,213
And we got back exactly what we expected to get back.

898
01:13:57,193 --> 01:13:58,674
because that's what we expected.

899
01:13:59,294 --> 01:14:10,020
But I think what's really significant beyond the work in here is the kinds of things that Lesley College is willing to do with us, and this is only the beginning.

900
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:18,605
We've had some really productive discussions, they'll continue, and you know, Maurice has been involved and will continue to get more people involved.
