[SPEAKER_10]: We had a lot of community input.

29
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, it was a discussion of the, uh,

30
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:59,525
[SPEAKER_10]: paper which was offered last week by Councilor Marks.

[SPEAKER_10]: uh, suggestions were or, uh, amendments were, uh, that, uh, the election of a seven member municipal charter commission be changed to a nine member municipal charter commission that, um, in the process of, uh, this review that, um, the, uh, commission

33
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:47,634
[SPEAKER_10]: be restricted to coming up with five changes or areas for recommendation of change in the charter, and that number five was stricken, if I'm correct, and we asked that

[SPEAKER_10]: There was a periodic review, periodic review, be removed and left up to the committee and that there be a request that in this process that the charter review committee, um, be aided by outside experts and these affairs.

00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:31,023
[SPEAKER_10]: and the recommendation that it be sent to the city solicitor for a compiling of those, uh, aspects in a redraft of this piece that we have before us to be sent back to us.

00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,354
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank the council for putting bookends on this.

44
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:54,775

45
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and that's very helpful.

46
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also say that I was talking to Jean Martin while you were deliberating at the committee of the whole.

47
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:04,726
[SPEAKER_15]: And she said, there's a miracle happening behind the rail.

48
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,967
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think that, I think there's some truth to that.

49
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:16,350
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that, uh, um, I was with, uh, mayor Burke when she met, uh, with council of marks and talked about this resolution.

50
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,792
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that she'll be happy to see that, uh, this has moved along to the next level.

51
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:25,713
[SPEAKER_15]: And I look forward to drafting this up for the council and let's see where it goes from here.

52
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:27,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

53
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:29,093
[SPEAKER_10]: A motion for approval.

54
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:37,238
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and I think it was Mr. Miller in actually, who was the miracle in the room because he brought us back on course.

55
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:38,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm representing National Grid.

97
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:40,904

105
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:06,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the meeting

106
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:13,584
[SPEAKER_10]: us for a description of this project, Mr. Grid.

107
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:19,918
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is John Jankowski.

108
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:26,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the petition that you have in front of you, 28 governors, they have, they requested to upgrade their electrical service.

109
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:28,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a manhole duct system in that area.

110
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:34,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the existing conduit is too small and the age is, uh, many years ago.

111
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:45,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to petition, um, we have to install a conduit from a manhole in the sidewalk to the property line to a, uh, handle on the property line.

112
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any questions or concerns?

113
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:48,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I could answer them if you'd like.

114
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:50,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

115
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:52,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

116
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Jankowski, thank you for being here this evening.

117
00:09:54,696 --> 00:10:05,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if you've been looking at this petition for the public hearing, it says that, um, the contractor should utilize city of Metro regulations and standards for the restoration, as well as the removal of all the breeze related to this work.

118
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I'm hoping you can explain to me a little bit more about the process and how this works because, um,

119
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:16,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have some construction that we've approved being performed by the grid that goes out two years or a year.

120
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:23,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes the road isn't repaired in a condition that was exactly suitable to the neighbors in the neighborhood.

121
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:33,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And the process that I've been working with a gentleman named Mr. Carmody would be that they do the best they can, let it set, and then come back the next season.

122
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:37,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm by no means an engineer and not much of a construction worker either.

123
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:41,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was hoping that you'd be willing to explain the process a little bit so that people can understand how it works.

124
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have a number of requests from residents here in the community that aren't too happy with the product that's left out in front of the house.

125
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:48,672
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an end result.

126
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:54,354
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still having to live with it now for an extended period of time, 8 to 13 months in some situations.

127
00:10:54,852 --> 00:11:02,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in this situation right here, we're just going to dig up just the sidewalk, not the asphalt on the road itself at all.

128
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be five feet of the sidewalk itself.

129
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:06,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a cement sidewalk.

130
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:11,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll just repair it as we put it back on as possible.

131
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you're going to repair it with the same color cement, not asphalt cement?

132
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're seeing a lot of the sidewalk panels in the city get replaced.

133
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:21,406
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see cement, cement, then there'll be a black asphalt panel.

134
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:28,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I'd like to, um, actually I won't attach it to this paper.

135
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:34,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll file a separate separate matter at our next meeting asking for the grid to report back to us as to the status of their inspections in the community.

136
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but at this point, um, I'd move for approval of the paper.

137
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:39,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

138
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:40,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Jankowski.

139
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:44,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for being in this evening through, uh, you, Mr. President.

140
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:50,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just, just to, for clarification that this is only going to affect one home, correct?

141
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:51,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

142
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:52,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

143
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:52,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um,

144
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,091
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no need for notice anywhere else.

145
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious.

146
00:11:58,032 --> 00:11:58,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

147
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:02,314
[SPEAKER_02]: No, when we do the petition, we have to get the abutters, you know, but that's all.

148
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that one house.

149
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:03,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

150
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:04,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

151
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:09,558
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Naita, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Caraviello.

152
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:10,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

153
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:19,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Governor's Avenue is a very heavily traveled road in the city, and usually when you guys fill the holes up, they tend to sink.

154
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:20,183
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

155
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:22,124
[SPEAKER_17]: I request that

156
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:28,306
[SPEAKER_17]: within 30 days, you come back and reevaluate and make sure the whole doesn't have to be refilled again.

157
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:34,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, that's a, that's a very heavily traveled road in the city of Medford and it gets more wear and tear than some of the other streets do.

158
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:40,271
[SPEAKER_17]: So if in 30 days you can come back and reassess if it has to be refilled again or repaved, I'd appreciate that.

159
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:41,392
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

160
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, just it's a sidewalk.

161
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:43,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's fine.

162
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:43,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

163
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:44,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

164
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:46,274
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the best amendments I've heard in years.

165
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:50,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of approval by councilor Knight, seconded by councilor Scarpelli,

166
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:53,064
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended by Councilor Caraviello.

167
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:53,905
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

168
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:55,326
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

169
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:56,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Carries.

170
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:57,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations, sir.

171
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:59,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your patience tonight.

172
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

173
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:06,174
[SPEAKER_10]: 1516-085 offered by President Dello Russo.

174
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:18,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that paper 16-072 regarding the creation of a charter commission through home rule petition for the November ballot be taken out of unfinished business for public forum discussion and input.

175
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, we've disposed of this.

176
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:25,285
[SPEAKER_10]: I had discussion and public input in Committee of the Whole.

177
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:30,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Though there are many citizens, I don't want to obstruct anything.

178
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:42,452
[SPEAKER_10]: But the paper was taken out in Committee of the Whole, sent, and we just ratified it to send it off to the city solicitors.

179
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:46,994
[SPEAKER_10]: So in a sense, I don't know if procedurally we should discuss it.

180
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,057
[SPEAKER_10]: on the motion of Council Knight to receive and place on file.

181
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:51,837
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

182
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:56,759
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

183
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:04,401
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-086, offered by Vice President Alongo Curran, be it resolved that the City of Medford replace the roof to the Medford Public Library as soon as possible.

184
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:06,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

185
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

186
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,404
[SPEAKER_03]: We discussed this last week.

187
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:11,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

188
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:17,846
[SPEAKER_03]: As of Monday of last week, there was buckets around the Medford Public Library with

189
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:19,663
[SPEAKER_03]: constant dripping.

190
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:30,672
[SPEAKER_03]: A number of the tiles are removed, so you have all the ventilation being exposed, and that's just in the couple sections that I went into.

191
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:35,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I've since got emails that there are leaks in other sections of the library.

192
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:39,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little frustrated, as I'm sure the rest of my colleagues are.

193
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:44,925
[SPEAKER_03]: The major leaks were reported in December.

194
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:54,886
[SPEAKER_03]: We asked the administration to do whatever it took, as soon as possible, to remedy those leaks in the Medford Public Library and to look into the future.

195
00:14:54,906 --> 00:15:03,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We're either replacing the roof or getting a plan together so that it won't happen again.

196
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,374
[SPEAKER_03]: This is December.

197
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:05,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now into February.

198
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:12,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about at least eight, if not nine, ten weeks ago, the Medford Public Library's roof was leaking.

199
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:15,888
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have major leaks in the roof.

200
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I question now if there is mold.

201
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:24,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I question now if we have a rot issue in one or multiple places in that roof.

202
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We did receive an update from the mayor, and I appreciate that.

203
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:34,933
[SPEAKER_03]: But $5,000, I guess, was put into the library roof to repair it.

204
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:41,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, that didn't work, and I don't think what's going on is good enough.

205
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:47,454
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like they're submitting a proposal to perform an evaluation.

206
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:50,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that that should have been done already.

207
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:56,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like an evaluation and proposal should have already been submitted to the city two months ago.

208
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:58,777
[SPEAKER_03]: We have families.

209
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:00,717
[SPEAKER_03]: We have residents.

210
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:02,778
[SPEAKER_03]: We have senior citizens.

211
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:07,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw business owners in the library today when I went in.

212
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:15,785
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely unfortunate that we're not taking it more seriously.

213
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:21,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate, you know, we got an update and I appreciate that, you know, something's being done.

214
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,530
[SPEAKER_03]: But in my opinion, it's just not good enough.

215
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:26,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I would ask that we do this immediately.

216
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:28,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we asked that in December.

217
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:31,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I think each one of us spoke about this.

218
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,419
[SPEAKER_03]: This is obviously one of our priorities.

219
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,540
[SPEAKER_03]: We discussed that when we discuss our goals.

220
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,922
[SPEAKER_03]: This will come up tomorrow night when we meet with the mayor.

221
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:43,153
[SPEAKER_03]: But what has been done has not been good enough.

222
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:53,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just highly disappointed in the lack of change that has gone on, especially since I've expected so much more.

223
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said, now we're working on two mayors with the same leaks in the same roof, and it's just not being fixed.

224
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm disappointed.

225
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:06,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would respectfully ask

226
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:10,361
[SPEAKER_03]: that we get a new roof on that entire library as soon as possible.

227
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:13,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that's what our residents deserve.

228
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:24,114
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the children who visit the children's section deserve, because that's obviously where I saw the major leaks last week after speaking about it nine weeks ago.

229
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,837
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a priority of the Medford City Council.

230
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:30,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be a priority of the entire city.

231
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:40,232
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 plus emails, maybe 30 to 50 people come to the council meeting last June 2015 when the library was underfunded.

232
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:46,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we saying now that we need to have an uproar from the citizenry?

233
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:54,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's needed when you have a leaky roof that's ruining our, I mean, it's ruining the rugs.

234
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:55,965
[SPEAKER_03]: The rug was a mess.

235
00:17:57,486 --> 00:17:58,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking, is there mold?

236
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:00,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do we need to have a mold evaluation now?

237
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:19,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know my council colleagues will support this, but I just want to send a strong message that we can't continue to let our infrastructure fall apart while we create jobs and do a number of other things that we shouldn't be, you know, other ways that we're spending money and shouldn't be, which we put in the money towards a roof.

238
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

239
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,814
[SPEAKER_10]: So that the roof be replaced in its entirety offered by Councilor

240
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:28,829
[SPEAKER_10]: of motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

241
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello will share some good news regarding the library with us.

242
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:33,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

243
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

244
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:37,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I was in the library last week myself.

245
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:43,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I think also you were coming out as I was going in that day and it was, it was a shame to see what it looked like.

246
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:47,380
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, I think it'd be, uh, the roof should be fixed immediately.

247
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:54,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, on the good news is, um, with the help of the mayor and I spoke with Mayor Burke, uh, on March 21st,

248
00:18:55,333 --> 00:19:16,247
[SPEAKER_17]: The Library Building Commission will make its first meeting to Medford to hopefully get the process going to discuss either renovations or some type of funding for the library to get it up and running to where it should be and up to the standard that the other 100 libraries in the city and this whole area have gotten over the last five years.

249
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:24,553
[SPEAKER_17]: So hopefully when they come, they'll make some recommendations on how to get this process started and how to get some funding

250
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:26,022
[SPEAKER_17]: for the slappery.

251
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:28,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

252
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:29,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

253
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:31,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

254
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:41,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as we behind this rail are all aware, a certain dollar figure, $10,000, would require that the public bid process be kicked off.

255
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the first question that we need to ask the administration is whether or not

256
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:48,485
[SPEAKER_06]: A bid has actually been put out for the roof to see if, in fact, the ball is rolling.

257
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,507
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if we've all banged the table, we've all asked for the roof to be repaired.

258
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:55,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're all on board that we want to see a new roof on the library.

259
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,309
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to see the library leaking.

260
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,910
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to see the library to be a sanctuary in the community.

261
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,152
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I love quoting Solicitor Rumley.

262
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:09,133
[SPEAKER_06]: when he speaks of Dick Lee that says that the library is really the only city-owned building that people voluntarily go to.

263
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:17,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, people voluntarily go there because they want to utilize the resources that are in place and they want to do so in a fashion that's comfortable to them, Mr. President.

264
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:25,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, you know, we put a resolution forward, um, sometime in December, um, the roof was fixed, $5,000 was spent to do that.

265
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:31,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, in February, Councilor Caraviello put a resolution forward, um, asking for some updates.

266
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:39,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the update said that the, you know, the building commissioner has actually met with an engineer and performed an evaluation and a cost proposal for repairs and roof replacement is forthcoming.

267
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:43,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so Mr. President, I think it's important that we find out exactly where in the process this is.

268
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:56,202
[SPEAKER_06]: because I know that the public bid process is somewhat cumbersome, and I know that the Baker administration has put forward some proposals to streamline the way that municipalities can purchase, which Ms.

269
00:20:56,242 --> 00:21:01,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Miller is in support of after speaking with her, and she's actually wrote some testimony and spoken at the public hearings on that.

270
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:12,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the administration report back to us as to the status of the repairs, as to whether or not an RFP has been issued to actually go in there and put a new roof on this building.

271
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:15,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

272
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:31,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I read the letter update from February 12th a little differently because I would state that no bid has been requested because it said the on-site inspection with an engineer was done this past week.

273
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:37,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And that engineer will be submitting a proposal to perform an evaluation.

274
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:42,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So we haven't even had an engineer to the library to perform an evaluation.

275
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:46,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel that that's something that should have been done eight weeks ago.

276
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:53,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously $5,000 did not repair it as the leaks are all over the place.

277
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:56,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

278
00:21:57,117 --> 00:22:01,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion for approval by vice president, uncle Kern is amended by Councilor Knight.

279
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:04,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Councilor Falco.

280
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:05,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

281
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:08,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to thank my colleague for bringing up this resolution tonight.

282
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,899
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very important.

283
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,140
[SPEAKER_11]: The library is one of our most important buildings in our city.

284
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:18,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I said, I went to a fundraiser there a few weeks ago, and it was rather depressing.

285
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, here we are.

286
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:27,064
[SPEAKER_11]: There's, I think, over 100 people there, and there were buckets and ceiling tiles missing, and it was really just a sad state of affairs.

287
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:42,509
[SPEAKER_11]: But back when the library director came back, I think it was the first or second meeting of the year, she came before us, and they had offered an amendment to the resolution to give us a report on the overall health of the Method Public Library.

288
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,928
[SPEAKER_11]: the building in total, so more than just the roof, but the whole building.

289
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:47,649
[SPEAKER_11]: And we still haven't received that.

290
00:22:47,709 --> 00:23:02,500
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to, if we could check with the administration to see when we're going to receive that report, because I think we need to look at the roof, that's important, but we really need to look at the whole entire structure to see, you know, what kind of physical health it's in.

291
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,681
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could get that report, I'd greatly appreciate it.

292
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:12,467
[SPEAKER_10]: And further amended by Councilor Falco that the administration report back to the council

293
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:19,580
[SPEAKER_10]: regarding the aforementioned report requested on the overall physical health of the library.

294
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

295
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:23,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

296
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:42,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I echo my colleagues' sentiments, but again, I also talk about what Councilor Falco mentioned in understanding that what has been going on for years, as Councilor Longo-Corin said, is that the building

297
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:45,474
[SPEAKER_04]: It's frightening to understand what else is wrong with it.

298
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:57,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I made the suggestion that we look at other avenues and thinking of 21st century libraries and thinking of something like Springstep and doing that.

299
00:23:57,323 --> 00:24:11,013
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, as we look into growth in our community and thinking outside the box, I understand the frustration that, you know, I saw the pictures of the

300
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:16,426
[SPEAKER_04]: the kids on Facebook with an umbrella.

301
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:17,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was cute.

302
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:20,569
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's dangerous.

303
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:23,211
[SPEAKER_04]: What now is underneath that is what I feel.

304
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:25,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It's scarier than just the drip.

305
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:36,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we need to get a more in-depth report back to us, because the air quality is now questioned, I think.

306
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

307
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:38,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

308
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:40,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, my neighbor.

309
00:24:40,284 --> 00:24:42,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

310
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:46,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Louise D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, Medford, Mass.

311
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:50,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe it's going to be a two-step process.

312
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:53,553
[SPEAKER_12]: The staff at the library to be commended.

313
00:24:54,133 --> 00:25:01,358
[SPEAKER_12]: They've worked under very difficult conditions and the health and the safety of both the staff and the people who go to the library is important.

314
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:10,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Long range, I envision a second floor on top of the roof.

315
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:16,458
[SPEAKER_12]: that can be used as a resource for senior citizens, for meetings and so forth.

316
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:18,939
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an expenditure and I realize that.

317
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:34,868
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just tossing around ideas and I'm wondering if our, quote, very good neighbor, Tufts University, end of quote, could not contribute something to the Medford City Library.

318
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:38,330
[SPEAKER_12]: They use a lot of space in Medford,

319
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:45,171
[SPEAKER_12]: They have resources that are available in Medford to the people of Medford Hillside.

320
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:47,612
[SPEAKER_12]: They're obeying to their existence.

321
00:25:48,012 --> 00:25:58,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And it would be nice if they came forward and offered some of the money that they have sitting in their accounts to improve a vital facility in Medford.

322
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:06,881
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing I was thinking about, and I don't know the legality of it, Comcast, we have a fund with Comcast.

323
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,162
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have a cable station right now.

324
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:18,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Could some of that money be used towards the library and have perhaps the cable station in a portion of the library that was rebuilt?

325
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,871
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we need to do something about the library.

326
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:37,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though we're in a very computer-oriented society, it's nice to go someplace, especially for people who are older like myself, to sit down, to read a magazine that I might not want to subscribe to.

327
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:40,566
[SPEAKER_12]: to look at the books, just for socialization.

328
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:43,948
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know in Watertown and other places, they serve coffee.

329
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:57,553
[SPEAKER_12]: So people that want to be in communication with others and don't have the opportunity because they live alone have an opportunity to go someplace that's safe and that's comfortable.

330
00:26:57,653 --> 00:27:00,775
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we need something done to the library.

331
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:02,075
[SPEAKER_12]: An immediate fix, yes.

332
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:05,297
[SPEAKER_12]: But long range, something should be done to that facility.

333
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:06,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

334
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

335
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome.

336
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,411
[SPEAKER_18]: Please take your name and address for the record.

337
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Frank O'Leary, 85 Rollington Street, West Medford.

338
00:27:15,713 --> 00:27:19,195
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to say thank you to Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up again.

339
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:20,836
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was it.

340
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:25,478
[SPEAKER_18]: That was here for the meeting when everybody agreed that the library was a priority, is a priority.

341
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:33,503
[SPEAKER_18]: On top of the, your roof issue, isn't the city liable if somebody trips and falls over a bucket?

342
00:27:34,603 --> 00:27:40,184
[SPEAKER_18]: or somebody who's handicapped can't access something because there's a leak and too much water dripping down.

343
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,806
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not a meteorologist or anything, but this is New England.

344
00:27:45,786 --> 00:27:47,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait a minute, the weather will change.

345
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:48,667
[SPEAKER_18]: We will get more rain.

346
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:50,607
[SPEAKER_18]: We will get more snow.

347
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:52,908
[SPEAKER_18]: It will pile up on that roof.

348
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:54,488
[SPEAKER_18]: There will be more damage.

349
00:27:55,628 --> 00:28:02,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, just from walking in the back door, you see that the library does a lot more things than just

350
00:28:03,177 --> 00:28:06,180
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, rent out, have books go out and DVDs and CDs.

351
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,121
[SPEAKER_18]: There are small children doing Legos.

352
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:10,924
[SPEAKER_18]: There are small children doing Mindstorm.

353
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:13,286
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, there's other crafts going on.

354
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:21,473
[SPEAKER_18]: If anything says that this is a priority that needs to be dealt with, then the children are the priority.

355
00:28:22,654 --> 00:28:28,879
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, God forbid something happens or some child goes in there who's severely allergic to mold.

356
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, you've got

357
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:34,176
[SPEAKER_18]: even more issues because you have sick children on your hands.

358
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:39,459
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it was said that this was a priority and the roof would be taken care of.

359
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:48,943
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a shame that the reports haven't come through that need to be, need to happen, but maybe there is some pressure that can be exerted to make this move along.

360
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:53,405
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's great that we have the meeting March 21st coming up.

361
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:58,527
[SPEAKER_18]: But as the council said, it's already been two months, another month.

362
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:00,048
[SPEAKER_18]: We could, March could be,

363
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,194
[SPEAKER_18]: This year is February from last year.

364
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,515
[SPEAKER_18]: That roof won't last.

365
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:06,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

366
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:07,438
[SPEAKER_18]: And everything else.

367
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:08,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

368
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:12,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

369
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:18,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything Mrs. D'Antonio brought up, you've been to all the other libraries in the area.

370
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:22,688
[SPEAKER_17]: All those other libraries have gotten funds from this library building commission.

371
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:29,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Winchester, Everett, Malden, we're the only library in the whole area that hasn't gotten any funds.

372
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:31,585
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully this will be our chance.

373
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:35,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe they may even suggest that we get a whole brand new library.

374
00:29:35,928 --> 00:29:41,731
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, they'll come down with the commission, and hopefully they'll make some recommendations that'll be very beneficial to us.

375
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:48,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

376
00:29:49,236 --> 00:29:49,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Vice President.

377
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:51,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

378
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:53,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

379
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've discussed it with the commission.

380
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great that they're coming down March 21.

381
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:08,240
[SPEAKER_03]: My only reservation to that is, if they're going to be helping us get a grant, will they have reservations with the fact that we don't maintain our structures?

382
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they may decide that the building may need a whole new building.

383
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,461
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't know what the criteria is.

384
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:20,843
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to come down, discuss the criteria to get money, and what it takes.

385
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:26,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I was one issuing a grant, and I knew there was leaks in the roof,

386
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,598
[SPEAKER_03]: For at that point, it will be three months.

387
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:37,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be hesitant to give a grant to a city that isn't going to maintain their structures.

388
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:38,362
[SPEAKER_17]: You're 100% right.

389
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Our history of maintaining municipal buildings is not the best.

390
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:54,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And my last point would be, I hope we don't wait for what happened with the Department of Public Works building, where we waited for the roof to cave in before we

391
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:56,665
[SPEAKER_03]: did something about it.

392
00:30:57,045 --> 00:31:03,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the gentleman said, we have people of all ages all the time traversing that library.

393
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:10,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really hope that we do something to make a permanent fix for a little bit more than $5,000 on that roof.

394
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:11,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

395
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:12,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

396
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:14,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

397
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:19,440
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think year after year, we meet with each individual department head.

398
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,443
[SPEAKER_16]: So that means the director of the public library came before us year after year after year.

399
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,791
[SPEAKER_16]: with his budget recommendations.

400
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:37,454
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, as one member of the council, never heard the director mention anything about leaks in the roof or need to look at the roof that was done 25 years ago.

401
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:46,838
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's part of the problem that, you know, department heads, when they come before this council under the old administration, were told not to say anything.

402
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:50,319
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's a problem, don't vent your dirty laundry.

403
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,829
[SPEAKER_16]: just let it go by the wayside.

404
00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:09,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And for years there's been a lack of maintenance budget, so that coupled with the fact that department heads wouldn't speak frankly when they came before us for budget, the one time you'd want to sit down and say, you know what, we need X, Y, and Z, that's the time to do it.

405
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And there was a gag order for many years in this community

406
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,034
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope that changes, Mr. President.

407
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:21,438
[SPEAKER_16]: The other issue is that we don't have a long-term capital improvement plan.

408
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:26,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Although we had one some years back, one currently doesn't exist.

409
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:34,867
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you look at all of our structures, go up to high school, there's more barrels up to high school catching rain than in the library.

410
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:46,329
[SPEAKER_16]: and they have a much larger roof in the high school, but this is systematic throughout all of our buildings in the community, and it's just a lack of maintenance.

411
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:57,077
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a lack of oversight, and I'm not quite sure what it's gonna take in order for this city to wake up, and maybe it's gonna be this budget with a new council.

412
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:01,601
[SPEAKER_16]: When we go through the line items, and you see a maintenance budget of $750, think about your home.

413
00:33:04,888 --> 00:33:06,970
[SPEAKER_16]: What is your maintenance budget in the course of the year?

414
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:13,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Then think about a public building like the library that has 40,000 people that go through it in the course of the year.

415
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:15,939
[SPEAKER_16]: And see if the $750 is adequate enough for a maintenance budget.

416
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:24,415
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are the type of questions I think we have to ask, Mr. President, when we're sitting in budget.

417
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:27,518
[SPEAKER_16]: And, yeah, that's the first account to get cut, I understand.

418
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,480
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the easiest account to cut.

419
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:36,286
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's the most important, because what you're seeing now is everything that's been neglected in years all coming up.

420
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:39,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Our fire stations are all in deplorable condition.

421
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,831
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, look at the DPW yard.

422
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,905
[SPEAKER_16]: It had to get condemned.

423
00:33:44,465 --> 00:33:46,386
[SPEAKER_16]: They had to condemn it in order to build another building.

424
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:48,607
[SPEAKER_16]: The police department, same condition.

425
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:51,149
[SPEAKER_16]: City Hall, the roof is leaking in here, too.

426
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,430
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's all over.

427
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,232
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a shame, Mr. President.

428
00:33:57,612 --> 00:33:58,253
[SPEAKER_16]: And I agree.

429
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:11,000
[SPEAKER_16]: The only problem is, if we spend $350,000 on a brand new roof, and then in six months from now, we decide that we want to add, expand the second layer on the second floor of the library,

430
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,432
[SPEAKER_16]: then that money went to waste.

431
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,393
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we have to have more of a vision.

432
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:20,514
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would like to see the footprint of the library expanded.

433
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:22,895
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it could be used for so many other things.

434
00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:34,898
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the fact that there's been talk about possibly having more of a gathering place, maybe have an area where you can buy a coffee and a scone and sit down there and read the paper like they do at many bookstores.

435
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:41,220
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, it could be used for so many more things than, you know,

436
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:58,383
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope, Mr. President, I know we're meeting with the mayor tomorrow night, that this be put on the priority list, because the building served us well for many, many years, and now it's asking for some repair or a total renovation.

437
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:09,593
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we were able to get the public bathrooms done through this council, and it wasn't until this council spoke up and said, you know what, those bathrooms in the library are deplorable.

438
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:15,961
[SPEAKER_16]: that finally the last administration put $10,000 in the budget, and they're still in tough shape.

439
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:20,344
[SPEAKER_16]: The bathrooms, they're really still in really bad shape there.

440
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:29,770
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that at least at tomorrow night's meeting that this subject be brought up again for a long-term capital improvement plan.

441
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:30,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

442
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:36,955
[SPEAKER_10]: And if there was one thing we were all in agreement with at our committee of the whole meeting where we discussed these matters was the library.

443
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:38,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's good.

444
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:40,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

445
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:49,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks brings up a number of great points, and it got me thinking about, you know, the state of the library and what exactly it looks like.

446
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:59,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all received an email, I believe, over the last week regarding the Henry Putnam Memorial that sits out in front of the library where the old play structure used to be closest to City Hall.

447
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:06,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And a gentleman came up from Pennsylvania, and he came up with his wife, and his wife's seventh great-grandfather, I believe,

448
00:36:08,352 --> 00:36:09,673
[SPEAKER_06]: fought in the Revolutionary War.

449
00:36:10,213 --> 00:36:11,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And his name is on that monument.

450
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:17,538
[SPEAKER_06]: So every time they come to Medford, they feel an obligation to, every time they come to Massachusetts, they feel an obligation to come to Medford and to see the memorial.

451
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:22,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were very disappointed at the status and state of disrepair of the memorial, as well as the library, Mr. President.

452
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:30,265
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd ask that the administration also take a look at maybe a power wash of the Henry Putnam Memorial over there.

453
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:34,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when reading the history, it's a pretty interesting story.

454
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,630
[SPEAKER_06]: The gentleman fought at the Battle of Monotony over in Arlington, and he also was a,

455
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:42,386
[SPEAKER_06]: revolutionary war soldier and war hero, Mr. President.

456
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:45,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's very important that we preserve that tradition and that culture here in our community.

457
00:36:46,789 --> 00:37:05,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, in the research that I've done, it's my understanding that in order for the library to remain eligible for library funding and grant funding and to retain its accreditation and to not require an accreditation waiver, funding needs to be increased by about two and a half percent over the previous year's appropriation, Mr. President.

458
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:07,980
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means that the funding in the library budget

459
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,562
[SPEAKER_06]: for next year would have to be 2.5% higher than it was this year.

460
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:22,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it might make sense for this council, since we are seriously concerned about the status of the library and the future of the library, that we would make a request to the mayor that she include this figure in the next budget.

461
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:32,498
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilors Knight, Falco, and again by Councilor Knight.

462
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Ma'am, you wish to speak on this matter?

463
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

464
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:41,453
[SPEAKER_14]: This is really exciting to hear this discussion about the library.

465
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:48,217
[SPEAKER_14]: I was there a few weeks ago with Cason Ruggiero, who's, I think, almost three years old.

466
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:53,240
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was very difficult running between the buckets.

467
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And the longer we stayed there, more children came.

468
00:37:56,102 --> 00:38:06,449
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was really, it really felt really embarrassing to me to see the mothers there with their young children and, you know, having to watch where they walked instead of being comfortable in the library.

469
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:12,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And I love Louise's idea that, um, I've been to the senior center in Malden.

470
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:13,892
[SPEAKER_14]: It's absolutely beautiful.

471
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:16,895
[SPEAKER_14]: They have an atrium and plants and you can look up to the sky.

472
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:28,845
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that would be a wonderful idea to, um, perhaps ask Tufts university if they're interested in, um, contributing to the city of Medford and they could even perhaps even run courses there.

473
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:34,689
[SPEAKER_14]: There's just so many different things we could do to collaborate with a wonderful college that we have in our town.

474
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,471
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um,

475
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:39,869
[SPEAKER_14]: I just forgot what else I was going to say.

476
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:42,310
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

477
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot.

478
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:43,631
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

479
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:45,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, ma'am.

480
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:49,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't say my name, Valerie Geiselman.

481
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:52,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Well said.

482
00:38:53,016 --> 00:38:56,677
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion for approval, all those in favor as amended, all those opposed.

483
00:38:57,078 --> 00:38:58,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call has been requested.

484
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

485
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello?

486
00:39:06,162 --> 00:39:06,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

487
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:07,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco?

488
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

489
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:09,691
Yes.

490
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:11,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Lungel-Kern?

491
00:39:11,212 --> 00:39:11,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

492
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:12,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

493
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:13,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

494
00:39:13,274 --> 00:39:13,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

495
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:14,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

496
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:15,857
[SPEAKER_05]: President Dello Russo?

497
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:16,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

498
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:18,900
[SPEAKER_10]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

499
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,464
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

500
00:39:23,484 --> 00:39:26,367
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-087, offered by Vice President Lungel-Kern.

501
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:31,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that parking on sidewalks be better enforced,

502
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:41,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I care to point out to you, Madam Vice President, that we've spoken about this matter twice over the past couple of weeks.

503
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

504
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:56,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to bring this up again because I feel that the – I'm bringing it up again because obviously I don't live on the

505
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:59,426
[SPEAKER_03]: the three or four roads where I'm getting the complaints.

506
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:12,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a number of people that have contacted me through email and phone calls with regards to no resolve from any type of enforcement that I believe should be taking place.

507
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Winthrop and George, I've been getting complaints on.

508
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:18,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, we all get the complaints on Harvard and Maine.

509
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:24,941
[SPEAKER_03]: We get pictures almost on a daily basis with regards to people trying to walk on the sidewalk.

510
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:26,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have Mack trucks.

511
00:40:27,627 --> 00:40:32,749
[SPEAKER_03]: to do in their business and pulling up onto the sidewalk, which I feel is very dangerous.

512
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:36,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like we do need to bring it up repeatedly.

513
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:42,573
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a number of things that I don't agree with, but with regards to, you know, how businesses run.

514
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:52,716
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the council floor, I think if something needs to be brought up once or twice or three times, that's how we are able to get our constituents' voices heard and their concerns heard.

515
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:56,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's going to get hurt, and it needs to be brought up again.

516
00:40:57,529 --> 00:40:58,650
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do something.

517
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:06,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm now getting emails where people are so frustrated that they're saying, this city doesn't care, the council doesn't care.

518
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to explain over and over again, we do.

519
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,040
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to talk about it.

520
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to make requests.

521
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:15,104
[SPEAKER_03]: A number of us have gone to the traffic commission.

522
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:21,249
[SPEAKER_03]: We've begged, no more than, no less than begged the chief of police to create enforcement.

523
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:22,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I've emailed the mayor.

524
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,052
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor mentioned that she was gonna meet with the chief.

525
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:53,517
[SPEAKER_03]: to discuss it, since then, you know, I'm not sure what was decided on, but if we could get an update on that, you know, what was decided on, and if we could get some enforcement to create a level of safety for our residents, for people who, for all people, never mind the people that have, are in wheelchairs or using strollers that just can't even fit on the sidewalk when there's a Mack truck with four or eight wheels on a public sidewalk.

526
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,612
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've been asked to bring it up again.

527
00:41:57,652 --> 00:42:01,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I waited a few weeks in hopes that we would get some enforcement.

528
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:09,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm getting emails from two residents on Harvard Street that can't even get out of their driveway.

529
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:18,929
[SPEAKER_03]: One woman, I believe, is with child, and she's scared to back out of her driveway because trucks are blocking her exit.

530
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,932
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what more is it going to take to just get some enforcement?

531
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:31,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the council has to have a meeting with regards to the bus stop and a loading zone, and we definitely need to do that, but enforcement has to come first.

532
00:42:32,281 --> 00:42:33,761
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how many times I can say it.

533
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:37,043
[SPEAKER_03]: We lack enforcement, and we need to have it done.

534
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:44,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there's people that would like to speak, so I'm going to yield to the residents who have the concerns.

535
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:49,148
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's just such an important issue, and it's a public safety issue.

536
00:42:49,168 --> 00:42:53,630
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can't talk about it week after week, then I don't know what we're here for.

537
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:55,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

538
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

539
00:42:58,481 --> 00:43:04,926
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a topic that I think we've all looked at, heard about, and discussed at one point or another since this term started.

540
00:43:05,907 --> 00:43:14,554
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had resolutions that have gone to the administration requesting that we take the Donald Trump approach to Oasis and build a wall around it so that people can't park on the sidewalk.

541
00:43:15,355 --> 00:43:17,777
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about increasing directed patrols down there.

542
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:23,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And the more I look into this, Mr. President, the more I examine what they do in other communities, one thing I've seen is that

543
00:43:24,555 --> 00:43:30,416
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the majority of these 18-wheeler trucks, they're not going to a pocket of residence to go in there and, you know, catch the baseball game.

544
00:43:30,436 --> 00:43:31,397
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making deliveries.

545
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:32,337
[SPEAKER_06]: These are delivery trucks.

546
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:38,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we might be in a good position to restrict the hours the delivery truck can actually make deliveries.

547
00:43:39,218 --> 00:43:45,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we restrict those hours, then we can get these trucks off the sidewalks during periods of time when people are more frequently diverting them.

548
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:55,252
[SPEAKER_06]: It's certainly not going to resolve the situation at this point in time, because without enforcement, restricted loading zones and restricting time to loading zones isn't going to work.

549
00:43:55,953 --> 00:44:09,956
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we can create a structure in place, Mr. President, that has a fine structure, so that if someone is delivering outside the hours of the loading zones, that loading is delineated or restricted, then we can hit them in the pocket where it hurts.

550
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:12,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's the only thing that's going to make any of these businesses realize that

551
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beneficial for them to get a $20 ticket for parking on the sidewalk and drop off a $1,000 order.

552
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:20,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cost benefit.

553
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:22,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to park seven streets down.

554
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:32,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if we just put up a wall around Oasis or a wall around these areas where these problems with sidewalk parking is going on, it's only going to move this problem down the street further.

555
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,254
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not going to actually address the problem.

556
00:44:34,274 --> 00:44:39,394
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only going to take a small sample size in that area and just move it down the street, Mr. President.

557
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:42,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it might make a good idea, and I would like to amend the paper,

558
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:50,210
[SPEAKER_06]: to have the Community Development Office and the Traffic Commission take a look at some recommendations into restricting the delivery hours in our business districts.

559
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:56,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that this will ease the burden on our frequently parked sidewalks.

560
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:57,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And increasing fines.

561
00:44:58,313 --> 00:44:59,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And increasing fines.

562
00:44:59,153 --> 00:45:00,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And increasing fines, Mr. Clerk.

563
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:02,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

564
00:45:03,515 --> 00:45:04,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

565
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:08,576
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I get the same phone calls and emails that the Vice President gets.

566
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:11,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And, again, you know, I don't know what to tell these people anymore.

567
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:19,102
[SPEAKER_17]: a resolution, a resolution, and change, and we go to traffic commission meetings, and nothing seems to get done.

568
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:21,403
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know where to turn.

569
00:45:21,423 --> 00:45:22,383
[SPEAKER_17]: We've called the mayor's office.

570
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:24,244
[SPEAKER_17]: We've gone to the chief.

571
00:45:25,104 --> 00:45:27,025
[SPEAKER_17]: And I say, there's not even like spot enforcement.

572
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:29,906
[SPEAKER_17]: There's like zero enforcement of these issues.

573
00:45:30,586 --> 00:45:33,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I don't know what the answer is anymore.

574
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:39,489
[SPEAKER_17]: And I say, when I get these calls and I get these things, I'm embarrassed.

575
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:41,770
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what to say anymore to these people.

576
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,493
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel helpless.

577
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:51,298
[SPEAKER_17]: I've gone to every area that I think we can go, and nothing happens.

578
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:56,863
[SPEAKER_17]: No matter what we've done, nothing has happened there, whether it be the police, zoning, or anything.

579
00:45:57,985 --> 00:46:03,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I know we're going to be down there this week again, and we'll see where that goes.

580
00:46:05,151 --> 00:46:05,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilman Max.

581
00:46:06,653 --> 00:46:07,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

582
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:21,678
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, maybe in these certain business districts, we have to go back to the old days where we had a cop on the beat and someone that would be in that area and actually see what's going on rather than just drive through the business district.

583
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:27,983
[SPEAKER_16]: But a couple of weeks ago, we voted to put temporary signs at the corner of Harvard and Maine.

584
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:34,847
[SPEAKER_16]: And while the bullets were being still reviewed going down Harvard and Maine because of the 18 wheelers,

585
00:46:35,438 --> 00:46:44,824
[SPEAKER_16]: And I talked to Chief Sacco today, and he said it's up on the next Traffic Commission agenda, and he sees no problem with the temporary signs right now.

586
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:55,170
[SPEAKER_16]: He also said that during the roll call every morning that the officers are told to pay special attention to not just Harvard and Maine, but many of the hot spots around the community that

587
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,781
[SPEAKER_16]: we as a council and neighbors have been talking about.

588
00:46:58,221 --> 00:47:00,961
[SPEAKER_16]: So he said they have stepped up the enforcement.

589
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:07,803
[SPEAKER_16]: But I really do believe that we have to get back to the old ways sometimes to address some of these concerns.

590
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:17,226
[SPEAKER_16]: And having a cop on the beat in some of the business districts, or having an officer on a bicycle getting around like they do in Cambridge and Boston,

591
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:28,870
[SPEAKER_16]: is a much quicker way of traversing the area, and I think it's a better approach to neighborhood policing, and it would go a long way in our community in solving some of these issues.

592
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,490
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the thing.

593
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:31,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Community policing, Councilor.

594
00:47:31,652 --> 00:47:32,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly right.

595
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:37,836
[SPEAKER_16]: But the temporary signs are before the Traffic Commission at their next meeting.

596
00:47:37,996 --> 00:47:43,940
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Chief reported to me that he personally exercised enforcement there in this past week.

597
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:45,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

598
00:47:45,802 --> 00:47:46,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

599
00:47:46,638 --> 00:47:47,719
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we keep talking about signs.

600
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,060
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that area's got more signs than anywhere in the city.

601
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,061
[SPEAKER_17]: There's signs everywhere there.

602
00:47:53,882 --> 00:47:55,563
[SPEAKER_17]: No parking, no stopping, no nothing.

603
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:57,524
[SPEAKER_17]: And everyone ignores the signs.

604
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,505
[SPEAKER_17]: What good is putting up more signs?

605
00:48:01,286 --> 00:48:02,346
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we asked for some temporary...

606
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:05,602
[SPEAKER_17]: temporary barriers up there or something.

607
00:48:05,722 --> 00:48:08,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I have so many signs around my house.

608
00:48:08,664 --> 00:48:10,205
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.

609
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:13,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Those streets have more signs than anywhere else in the whole city.

610
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:17,970
[SPEAKER_17]: What good is putting up another sign if no one's going to go there and enforce the rule?

611
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:26,375
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can put up 100 signs, and like Councilman Locke says, if there's no policeman in the area, the sign is just a waste of everyone's time.

612
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:27,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Community policing works.

613
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:28,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Community policing.

614
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:31,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

615
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

616
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:36,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

617
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:39,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street, which is not in a business district.

618
00:48:40,286 --> 00:48:45,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if it's in a business district, Republic should be raking it in and giving every truck that stops there a ticket.

619
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:53,556
[SPEAKER_01]: But I live on Park Street, which is the street that the Roberts Elementary School is on, which is the street where they let out the middle school kids off the bus.

620
00:48:54,117 --> 00:49:00,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And they walk up Park Street and around the car that's been on the sidewalk since the first meeting that I came to about sidewalk parking.

621
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:02,623
[SPEAKER_01]: If that car has moved, I missed it.

622
00:49:02,823 --> 00:49:06,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk my dog every day, twice a day, down that street.

623
00:49:06,124 --> 00:49:08,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk my daughter to the park almost every day.

624
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:13,808
[SPEAKER_01]: That car is on the sidewalk, not on the park side, on the other side, and it hasn't moved.

625
00:49:14,248 --> 00:49:16,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine and a half years I've been living on the street.

626
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:18,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine and a half years that car has been on the sidewalk.

627
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine and a half years he's never gotten a ticket.

628
00:49:22,152 --> 00:49:23,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure he drives.

629
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,133
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a handicap placard up there and he hasn't moved.

630
00:49:26,454 --> 00:49:28,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I met with the mayor about it three times.

631
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,735
[SPEAKER_01]: I met with Chief Sacco about it.

632
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:34,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I've called the police department, and the police department at this point doesn't want to hear from me.

633
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:38,037
[SPEAKER_01]: When I call, they say, just walk on a different sidewalk.

634
00:49:38,097 --> 00:49:41,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, well, I can't because the other sidewalk is a parking platform.

635
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:44,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the car off the sidewalk.

636
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:45,559
[SPEAKER_01]: This is basic.

637
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:50,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Write tickets, tow cars away, get them off the sidewalk.

638
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:55,222
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to witness a student walking to the elementary school getting hit by a car.

639
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,903
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a parent who does walking Wednesdays,

640
00:49:58,323 --> 00:50:04,688
[SPEAKER_01]: And they walk to school in little trains every Wednesday, and one of them's going to get hit by a car.

641
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:07,130
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important, and someone needs to address this.

642
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:08,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

643
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:11,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, neighbor.

644
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:13,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

645
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:16,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

646
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:18,439
[SPEAKER_13]: This is deja vu all over again.

647
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:25,104
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there are great ideas coming from the city council somewhere from here

648
00:50:26,383 --> 00:50:28,224
[SPEAKER_13]: to what happens on the street.

649
00:50:28,304 --> 00:50:30,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Something gets lost and there's nothing done.

650
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:33,225
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no enforcement.

651
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:34,586
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the key.

652
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:45,109
[SPEAKER_13]: The business owner just feels free to allow the vendors to park wherever they want to park, which is on the sidewalk.

653
00:50:45,149 --> 00:50:46,389
[SPEAKER_13]: These are big trailer trucks.

654
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:51,471
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not small cube trucks, although we have vans, we have trailer trucks.

655
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:59,448
[SPEAKER_13]: And what instigated me was watching a father and son trying to negotiate around a trailer truck on Harvard Street.

656
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:03,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Their alternative was to go into Harvard Street.

657
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,670
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, this is unacceptable.

658
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:15,873
[SPEAKER_13]: And the suggestion was made that the business owner should inform the vendors of what time these deliveries should be made.

659
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:17,774
[SPEAKER_13]: They can do that.

660
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:20,655
[SPEAKER_13]: They can say they need to be made before

661
00:51:22,423 --> 00:51:26,806
[SPEAKER_13]: 9 o'clock in the morning, and perhaps then the truck can park.

662
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:28,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I've got this.

663
00:51:28,988 --> 00:51:33,532
[SPEAKER_13]: The truck can park where the cars would usually park.

664
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:35,993
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going off and on, it must be me.

665
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:38,816
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't want me to speak anymore, I understand.

666
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:49,164
[SPEAKER_13]: But to have the trucks park before the business patrons come on the scene and park their cars.

667
00:51:49,504 --> 00:51:50,865
[SPEAKER_13]: There's got to be something done.

668
00:51:51,605 --> 00:51:53,266
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't just leave it the way it is.

669
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:58,430
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to keep getting calls and emails and photographs.

670
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we have so much, we have volumes.

671
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:05,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, there are a lot of signs, and they really and truly just ignore the signs.

672
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,878
[SPEAKER_13]: The signs are ignored.

673
00:52:08,298 --> 00:52:11,221
[SPEAKER_13]: We have resident parking, signs on Yale.

674
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:14,323
[SPEAKER_13]: they're regularly ignored.

675
00:52:15,723 --> 00:52:21,367
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's up to the business owner and the vendors, is communication with them.

676
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:30,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I also think the police need to step up and it would be a great idea to have community policing and have the officer walk the beat.

677
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,794
[SPEAKER_13]: But they need to be reminded that they've got to share the sidewalk.

678
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:38,357
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not for trucks, it's for pedestrians.

679
00:52:38,877 --> 00:52:45,924
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got to be a decent participant in the neighborhood in which they're doing business, and that's been lacking.

680
00:52:46,585 --> 00:52:49,968
[SPEAKER_13]: So whatever can happen in terms of enforcement, I think,

681
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:55,451
[SPEAKER_13]: first order of business, and making them understand, speak to your vendors.

682
00:52:57,511 --> 00:53:01,893
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not going to arrive all at once, but they should arrive before a certain amount of time.

683
00:53:01,953 --> 00:53:05,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's got to be some onus put on the business owner here.

684
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:12,836
[SPEAKER_13]: He's really created a very uncomfortable situation in the neighborhood.

685
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:13,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

686
00:53:16,098 --> 00:53:16,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

687
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:20,059
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn as amended by

688
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:23,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilors Knight and Marks, all those in favor?

689
00:53:26,523 --> 00:53:27,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the amendments, please.

690
00:53:27,864 --> 00:53:31,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure we have them all.

691
00:53:31,685 --> 00:53:33,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please read the amendments.

692
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:40,549
[SPEAKER_05]: From the mayor, an update on the meeting with the mayor.

693
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The meeting and the chief of police, OK, yep.

694
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:49,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the community policing by Councilor Marks, that we do some community policing in the area.

695
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a you want that as amendment?

696
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And then restrict delivery trucks.

697
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain times that the Traffic Commission look at that.

698
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:05,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I could ask a question while I have the microphone.

699
00:54:07,052 --> 00:54:09,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Increase fines and restrict delivery trucks.

700
00:54:09,152 --> 00:54:11,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that idea, especially in the problem areas.

701
00:54:12,013 --> 00:54:14,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I just ask, you think just in the problem areas?

702
00:54:15,014 --> 00:54:16,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking about the whole city?

703
00:54:18,897 --> 00:54:20,698
[SPEAKER_03]: because we don't want to create problems where there are none.

704
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:29,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if, Mr. President, we want to protect the integrity and quality of life of our communities, we need to have a consistent policy that's applied even-handedly across our business districts.

705
00:54:30,422 --> 00:54:37,865
[SPEAKER_06]: The problems that we see in South Medford Square, as it likes to be called, are significantly different from those that we see in West Medford Square.

706
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:47,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I think that it's something that needs to be deliberated and discussed, and that's why I suggested that we get recommendations back from Community Development and the Traffic Commission.

707
00:54:48,169 --> 00:54:50,531
[SPEAKER_06]: because what works for one might not work for another.

708
00:54:50,631 --> 00:54:54,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And we heard that same situation when the parking enforcement plan was rolled out.

709
00:54:54,475 --> 00:54:57,157
[SPEAKER_06]: What works in Haines Square doesn't necessarily work in West Medford Square.

710
00:54:57,557 --> 00:55:03,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that we would be in a better position to rely on the recommendations of the Traffic Commission and the Community Development Office.

711
00:55:04,543 --> 00:55:14,992
[SPEAKER_07]: As Anita pointed out to us, there is no reason why the shopkeeper can't place a restriction on their vendors to say, you want my business?

712
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:18,195
[SPEAKER_07]: You deliver between X and X these days of the week.

713
00:55:18,555 --> 00:55:18,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

714
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,457
[SPEAKER_07]: It works everywhere else.

715
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:32,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that point, I just want to make sure that's clarified in the minutes that we asked the OCD and the Traffic Commission to restrict the delivery trucks and up the fines as they decide.

716
00:55:35,738 --> 00:55:36,738
[SPEAKER_03]: from area to area.

717
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:39,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think escalating fines, Mr. President, might be the way to do it.

718
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:44,161
[SPEAKER_06]: First offense, second offense, third offense, fourth offense, and they increase, you know.

719
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:45,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Escalating fines, Mr. Clerk.

720
00:55:46,462 --> 00:55:47,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk had that.

721
00:55:48,703 --> 00:55:50,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Vice President, are you satisfied?

722
00:55:50,383 --> 00:55:50,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

723
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:51,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

724
00:55:52,164 --> 00:55:52,904
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

725
00:55:52,924 --> 00:55:53,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

726
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:54,285
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

727
00:55:57,486 --> 00:56:00,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

728
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:03,908
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-088, offered by Councilor Falco, whereas,

729
00:56:05,013 --> 00:56:10,558
[SPEAKER_10]: The City of Medford is experiencing various traffic and development issues throughout our city.

730
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:23,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford hire a traffic engineer slash consultant to review the various traffic patterns throughout our city and design a traffic plan for the City of Medford.

731
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

732
00:56:26,172 --> 00:56:26,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

733
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:30,456
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only been on the council now for a short term, but I find that

734
00:56:31,132 --> 00:56:39,496
[SPEAKER_11]: A majority of the phone calls that I receive and constituent emails all revolve around traffic problems and issues throughout our city.

735
00:56:40,576 --> 00:56:51,181
[SPEAKER_11]: If you take a look around our city, you see a number of developments both in our city and in surrounding cities that have had a significant impact on the traffic patterns throughout our city.

736
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:59,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel that we need someone that will review and make recommendations on our neighborhood traffic issues and coordinate traffic signals citywide to provide

737
00:56:59,742 --> 00:57:05,065
[SPEAKER_11]: technical recommendations on major proposals in our city.

738
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:08,246
[SPEAKER_11]: If you take a look throughout our city, we have issues in South Medford.

739
00:57:08,787 --> 00:57:13,169
[SPEAKER_11]: We have potential issues in North Medford with a possible redevelopment of the Mullen Hospital.

740
00:57:14,049 --> 00:57:19,092
[SPEAKER_11]: If you take a look at the Everett Casino coming to town, there's going to be issues with traffic congestion with regard to that.

741
00:57:19,112 --> 00:57:25,075
[SPEAKER_11]: There's potential issues with the Wegmans development, I'm sure, because there's going to be a lot of cars down in that area.

742
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:28,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you look throughout our city,

743
00:57:29,161 --> 00:57:33,163
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're hearing about condominiums and apartment buildings being built.

744
00:57:33,903 --> 00:57:38,145
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, these are all going to have an effect on the traffic pattern throughout our city.

745
00:57:39,265 --> 00:57:47,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe this is a crucial time as our city continues to see an increase in the number of proposals from developers that want to build apartment buildings and condominium buildings.

746
00:57:48,389 --> 00:57:53,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that these projects will dramatically alter traffic flow throughout our city, and we must act now.

747
00:57:55,373 --> 00:57:56,273
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a good resolution.

748
00:57:56,293 --> 00:58:02,056
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need to get ahead of this with regards to planning and as planning and development grows throughout our city.

749
00:58:02,096 --> 00:58:04,017
[SPEAKER_11]: So I move approval.

750
00:58:07,098 --> 00:58:09,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

751
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you Mr. President.

752
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:17,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, for those who don't know, I am the, uh, I'm our city's representative to the casino mitigation committee and um,

753
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:21,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe at the next meeting, that'll be something I can suggest.

754
00:58:22,574 --> 00:58:29,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe some funding can come from that group to help out with the engineer consultants.

755
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:33,999
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will bring that up at the next mitigation committee meeting.

756
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:35,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

757
00:58:35,919 --> 00:58:38,220
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, Councilor Knight.

758
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Mr. President.

759
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:42,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly would be in support of the resolution.

760
00:58:42,842 --> 00:58:45,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good resolution for the city to hire a traffic engineer.

761
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:47,984
[SPEAKER_06]: This was something that came up through our budget deliberations last year.

762
00:58:48,605 --> 00:58:52,307
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have a debate about it on the council floor at some point in time last year also.

763
00:58:52,787 --> 00:58:57,549
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that occurred after the budget process, so it would have been very difficult for us to have this new position to the budget.

764
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:04,313
[SPEAKER_06]: With that being said, Mr. President, I think it's very important for us to take a look at where we want to put this traffic engineer, where we want them to work.

765
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:05,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want them to work on the DPW?

766
00:59:05,874 --> 00:59:07,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want them to work on their engineering?

767
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,295
[SPEAKER_06]: What office do we want to have them in?

768
00:59:09,335 --> 00:59:13,537
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, whether or not we know what the cost of traffic engineer would be.

769
00:59:13,577 --> 00:59:14,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they run anywhere from

770
00:59:16,128 --> 00:59:16,709
[SPEAKER_06]: $76,000 to $106,000.

771
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:20,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with my understanding of doing some research, Mr. President.

772
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:22,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I certainly support the resolution.

773
00:59:22,612 --> 00:59:23,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know what I mean?

774
00:59:23,452 --> 00:59:30,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if we want to make this really become a reality, uh, we might be able to get a little bit more information to the administration in order to, uh, put it through.

775
00:59:30,756 --> 00:59:39,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd be happy to work with the Councilor, uh, through the subcommittee process or through a committee, the whole process, or just, um, through the legislative process to be sure that we get this done.

776
00:59:39,881 --> 00:59:40,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

777
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:41,982
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion approved by council, Falco,

778
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,360
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

779
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,081
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

780
00:59:46,221 --> 00:59:48,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

781
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,102
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-089 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

782
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:58,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the DPW report back to the City Council if they have a plan in place for pothole repairs for this upcoming season.

783
00:59:59,425 --> 01:00:00,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

784
01:00:01,525 --> 01:00:02,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

785
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:10,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that as we're coming along and the weather starts to shift, we hope that we start looking ahead and figuring out

786
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:33,983
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, and asking our director, acting director of DPW to report back to us on a report and what, what is in place for, um, the multiple potholes that will be throughout our community and, um, get ahead of it before we are paying for, um, new rims and tires through Mr. Rumbley's office.

787
01:00:34,024 --> 01:00:39,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hoping that we can be proactive and make sure that we have a plan in place.

788
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:40,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

789
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor.

790
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:42,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello.

791
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:43,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

792
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:53,777
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, as I've been to the MMA show, one of the things I found out is that I met a company called Street Scan.

793
01:00:54,798 --> 01:01:00,941
[SPEAKER_17]: And what they do is they go around and they assess your potholes for you in the streets, and they do what they said to report to your city.

794
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:07,084
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, on March 10th, they'll be doing a demonstration and a meeting up at Northeastern University in Burlington.

795
01:01:07,844 --> 01:01:10,826
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe if we could pass that information on to our

796
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:16,461
[SPEAKER_17]: DPW director or someone like the mayor.

797
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:25,243
[SPEAKER_17]: They do a lot of cities in this area and they said they contacted our city but they had no response.

798
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:31,405
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Scarapelli as amended by Councilor Kavliotis

799
01:01:32,562 --> 01:01:38,505
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, DPW office, uh, for, uh, review, uh, Councilor Scappelli.

800
01:01:38,645 --> 01:01:39,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I hit the button by accident.

801
01:01:40,046 --> 01:01:40,586
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

802
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:41,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So all those in favor.

803
01:01:41,626 --> 01:01:42,147
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

804
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,107
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

805
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:46,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

806
01:01:46,289 --> 01:02:02,096
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-090 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council receive an update with regard to what has been done within the last two months to help expedite the permit process for those who want to open a new business in Medford

807
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

808
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

809
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:17,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to get an update with regards to making it easier to open a business, whether it be a restaurant or non-restaurant type business in the city of Medford.

810
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:28,956
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been, I don't know if we've ever updated the process or reviewed the process, and I believe it was something that was on the mayor's agenda, so I really hope that comes to fruition.

811
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:31,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It sparked my attention online.

812
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:42,507
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a video of, I believe it was the Chicken and Rice Guys, who just opened recently, when I hear the food's great, but a video span of all the permits that the Chicken and Rice Guys had to get.

813
01:02:42,547 --> 01:02:47,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was about 17 permits, which took about six months.

814
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:51,072
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have quite, you know, what was it?

815
01:02:51,892 --> 01:02:52,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Thirteen months.

816
01:02:53,313 --> 01:02:56,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Thirteen months to open a restaurant in Medford.

817
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:00,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that would be discouraging to a number of businesses.

818
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:12,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would request maybe make an amendment that a pamphlet be made to make it easier, to make the process more understandable and that something be done to expedite that.

819
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:17,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what can be done, but I know a number of inspections need to be had.

820
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:26,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we just need to make it easier to open a business and be more welcoming to people who want to establish in Medford.

821
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:36,689
[SPEAKER_03]: That was shocking to see a video that long of permits, and I know people I'm actually close with that had a hard time opening businesses in Medford.

822
01:03:36,989 --> 01:03:44,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just would like to be, figure out a way, and hopefully that that is on the agenda, and hopefully this has already taken place.

823
01:03:44,213 --> 01:03:54,057
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we can get an update with regards to how we're going to help expedite the permit process, make it more business friendly, make our departments more business friendly so that it can be

824
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:57,102
[SPEAKER_03]: quite simpler and less time consuming.

825
01:03:58,163 --> 01:04:01,725
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the primaries of discussion we've had in the transition team meetings.

826
01:04:01,745 --> 01:04:01,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

827
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:05,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there's a draft already under review.

828
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:14,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So a draft pamphlet where somebody can say, OK, I need to A, B, and C. I need to apply for F now so it doesn't take longer.

829
01:04:14,212 --> 01:04:14,612
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

830
01:04:14,632 --> 01:04:16,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So a draft is being reviewed and tweaked.

831
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:17,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

832
01:04:17,513 --> 01:04:18,974
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could get a copy of the draft.

833
01:04:19,054 --> 01:04:21,015
[SPEAKER_03]: We could, through the chair, get a copy of the draft.

834
01:04:21,576 --> 01:04:22,056
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

835
01:04:29,022 --> 01:04:34,605
[SPEAKER_07]: The clerk is meeting with the business liaison in the mayor's office during the week.

836
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:35,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello.

837
01:04:35,506 --> 01:04:36,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

838
01:04:36,847 --> 01:04:50,756
[SPEAKER_17]: And I went to the opening of Chicken and Rice Guys last week and talked with the owner, myself, and he explained to me and told me that they had an easier time getting a license in the city of Boston and in the city of Medford.

839
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:56,291
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said that, you know, much easier, much more streamlined in Boston.

840
01:04:56,691 --> 01:04:58,572
[SPEAKER_17]: They were also going over to Everett.

841
01:04:59,952 --> 01:05:04,593
[SPEAKER_17]: And the Everett Town Hall is working with them, and you get much easier.

842
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:09,234
[SPEAKER_17]: I came back, well, after I left there, I came over to City Hall, and I went to the mayor's office.

843
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:16,576
[SPEAKER_17]: And I reached out to Annie Scro, I think that's the person, and to have her call me back.

844
01:05:16,656 --> 01:05:19,957
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wanted to go, and I said to him that I would bring her over there.

845
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:28,567
[SPEAKER_17]: But as of since Thursday, she's not reached back to me to go over there with him to discuss the issues that he had.

846
01:05:28,988 --> 01:05:34,130
[SPEAKER_17]: So a new business coming into town wouldn't have to face the same hurdles that he went through.

847
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,431
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Mr. President, I ask that Ms.

848
01:05:36,451 --> 01:05:49,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Grove get back to me on the message from when I left there last week to go over and meet with the chicken and rice guy so we can discuss the issues that he had so businesses in the future won't have to go through the same thing.

849
01:05:51,065 --> 01:05:57,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn as amended by Vice President Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight.

850
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:00,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, Mr. President, it all came out in the discussion.

851
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:06,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to know what recommendations the transition team was receiving from the business community in terms of this process.

852
01:06:06,173 --> 01:06:10,535
[SPEAKER_06]: However, through you to Councilor Caraviello, did the gentleman at the chicken and rice

853
01:06:11,127 --> 01:06:19,795
[SPEAKER_06]: that the chicken and rice guy, I guess we can refer to him as, share with you where the breakdown was, what department it came from.

854
01:06:19,815 --> 01:06:22,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it come from the traffic plan?

855
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:24,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it come from licensing?

856
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:29,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any idea, Councilor, where exactly the delay was most significant?

857
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:32,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry?

858
01:06:33,246 --> 01:06:35,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any idea where the delay was most significant?

859
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:37,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It was less significant.

860
01:06:38,464 --> 01:06:40,785
[SPEAKER_17]: It was less, he said the process was much easier.

861
01:06:40,805 --> 01:06:44,245
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, but I'm saying, you know, it took 14 months.

862
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:46,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was the delay in the process?

863
01:06:46,146 --> 01:06:48,446
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a number of different departments that are involved in the process.

864
01:06:48,466 --> 01:06:56,788
[SPEAKER_17]: It was in the, he said, he explained to me that every time he had got something, he met a criteria, a new one would come up.

865
01:06:58,188 --> 01:07:02,749
[SPEAKER_17]: He went and got a license, a proof of something where he should have been over here first.

866
01:07:03,329 --> 01:07:05,470
[SPEAKER_17]: He said it was just a process that was,

867
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:12,006
[SPEAKER_17]: It was one hurdle after another, and nobody was on the same page to help the guy out.

868
01:07:12,647 --> 01:07:19,793
[SPEAKER_17]: So I hope that when new business comes down, this is where you go, and they can walk the person through that.

869
01:07:20,073 --> 01:07:28,540
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, I offered to bring her over there, sit down with the gentleman and talk, and see what the issues were that he went through, so we could streamline it for the next person.

870
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:31,342
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, I haven't heard back from the office yet.

871
01:07:33,865 --> 01:07:34,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Move approval, Mr. President.

872
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:38,570
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.

873
01:07:39,571 --> 01:07:40,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

874
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:54,465
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, in my opinion, anyone doing or wanting to open up a business in this community, they should be assigned someone from the Office of Community Development that walks them through the process, that helps them get the licenses that they need.

875
01:07:55,164 --> 01:07:59,506
[SPEAKER_16]: They should be assigned a person, not having them scrambling around this city.

876
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:05,049
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been on the council 14 years, and I still don't know what half these offices in this building do, Mr. President.

877
01:08:05,529 --> 01:08:16,115
[SPEAKER_16]: You come down into the main foyer of City Hall, the directory on the wall says you can go get your milk license in room 204, whatever it is.

878
01:08:16,735 --> 01:08:19,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Milk licenses were done away with 65 years ago.

879
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,685
[SPEAKER_16]: So you have a directory downstairs that makes no sense at all on the wall.

880
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:27,967
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the type of things, the hurdles.

881
01:08:28,228 --> 01:08:33,955
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to know what hurdles people are bumping into, just come into the building and try to figure out where to go in this building.

882
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:37,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Try to figure out who to contact, who to call.

883
01:08:38,668 --> 01:08:44,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not have someone, why not promote the city and have someone that's gonna get out there and say, hi, I'm from the city of Medford.

884
01:08:44,611 --> 01:08:46,032
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna walk you through the process.

885
01:08:46,312 --> 01:08:48,033
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually gonna file your licenses.

886
01:08:48,313 --> 01:08:49,834
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna do all the legwork for you.

887
01:08:50,495 --> 01:08:54,357
[SPEAKER_16]: That way you won't see half the businesses in the square that have their lights out.

888
01:08:56,278 --> 01:08:56,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Look at the square.

889
01:08:56,978 --> 01:09:00,380
[SPEAKER_16]: I used to debate this with Councilor Caraviello.

890
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,022
[SPEAKER_16]: He said there were no vacancies in the square.

891
01:09:03,742 --> 01:09:07,364
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if he'll still debate that anymore, but the whole square's vacant.

892
01:09:08,952 --> 01:09:12,694
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole square's vacant, and it's because word gets out after a while, Mr. President.

893
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:13,435
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

894
01:09:13,675 --> 01:09:14,716
[SPEAKER_16]: Business owners talk.

895
01:09:15,356 --> 01:09:17,197
[SPEAKER_16]: The chicken and rice guy talks to his friends.

896
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:18,979
[SPEAKER_16]: And they talk to their friends.

897
01:09:19,419 --> 01:09:20,159
[SPEAKER_16]: And they say, you know what?

898
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Do business anywhere but the city of Medford.

899
01:09:23,021 --> 01:09:24,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Avoid the city of Medford.

900
01:09:24,282 --> 01:09:27,224
[SPEAKER_16]: They'll put you through 13 months of torture to open up.

901
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:29,325
[SPEAKER_16]: 13 months of torture.

902
01:09:29,646 --> 01:09:32,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I give the chicken and rice guy a lot of credit for his stamina.

903
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:35,433
[SPEAKER_16]: and wanting to stay with this community.

904
01:09:35,954 --> 01:09:42,258
[SPEAKER_16]: But there are a lot of other businesses that would have just threw the towel in and said, the heck with them, I'll take my business somewhere else.

905
01:09:42,938 --> 01:09:45,760
[SPEAKER_16]: The city of Medford doesn't wanna pursue us, I'll take it somewhere else.

906
01:09:47,161 --> 01:09:48,622
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we have to sell this community.

907
01:09:50,383 --> 01:09:51,944
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to sell, we gotta get out there.

908
01:09:52,164 --> 01:09:55,587
[SPEAKER_16]: The Office of Community Development gotta get out and sell this community.

909
01:09:57,288 --> 01:10:00,790
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't happen, there's one person and there's a part-time person up there.

910
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:08,934
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we don't want to get into this story over and over again, but that's what, you know, you want to point where the problem is, that's the problem.

911
01:10:08,974 --> 01:10:10,434
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no one selling this community.

912
01:10:12,595 --> 01:10:13,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

913
01:10:13,635 --> 01:10:14,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

914
01:10:14,075 --> 01:10:22,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Caraviello.

915
01:10:22,778 --> 01:10:23,598
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

916
01:10:24,378 --> 01:10:25,199
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

917
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:26,019

[SPEAKER_10]: 16-091 offered by Councilor Knight.

919
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:35,694
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to suspend the rules for the purpose of councilor.

920
01:10:35,974 --> 01:10:38,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the clerk has a several papers in hand as well.

921
01:10:38,336 --> 01:10:43,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And in looking at the paper before me, we have some petitions and presentations for a couple of taxi operator licenses.

922
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:50,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think based on what I can see over your shoulder there, it might be in these gentlemen's best interest to get out of here and try to get home and battle that weather.

923
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:51,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It is now snowing.

924
01:10:52,306 --> 01:10:58,948
[SPEAKER_06]: With that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to take papers 16092 and 16093 up so that the individuals in the audience have the opportunity to vote.

925
01:10:59,148 --> 01:11:07,871
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take petitions, petitions, presentations, and similar matters, and papers in the hand of the clerk and onto suspension.

[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

927
01:11:09,572 --> 01:11:11,672
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_10]: 16-092, petition of taxi operator license by Hickam Humdy.

929
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:19,694
[SPEAKER_10]: of 158 Pearl Avenue, Revere.

930
01:11:20,154 --> 01:11:21,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Sir, are you present?

931
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:22,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the petitioner present?

932
01:11:24,995 --> 01:11:28,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello to table this, all those in favor?

933
01:11:29,355 --> 01:11:30,036
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

934
01:11:30,116 --> 01:11:32,336

936
01:11:40,438 --> 01:11:41,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Tovar, are you present?

937
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:43,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, motion to the table?

938
01:11:43,972 --> 01:11:45,733
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to the table by Councilor Caraviello.

939
01:11:45,793 --> 01:11:46,373
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

940
01:11:46,433 --> 01:11:47,073
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

941
01:11:48,114 --> 01:11:50,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Two more things were coming to you, Madam Vice President.

942
01:11:51,494 --> 01:12:05,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Under suspension 16-094 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved that the Metro City Council request for public parking repair or replace the meter head at 451 High Street that has been broken down several times.

943
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:07,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Councilor Caraviello.

944
01:12:07,779 --> 01:12:08,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

945
01:12:08,519 --> 01:12:11,360
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, um, public parking,

946
01:12:13,637 --> 01:12:18,898
[SPEAKER_17]: Having enough of a problem with the kiosk, now this is just playing single head meters.

947
01:12:19,258 --> 01:12:25,780
[SPEAKER_17]: With a few dozen that we have in the city, the one up front of the store has been broken for about a week and a half now.

948
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,720
[SPEAKER_17]: They had a cover over it at 451 High Street.

949
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:31,241
[SPEAKER_17]: It was covered for about a week and a half.

950
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:34,902
[SPEAKER_17]: It took the cover off, and it was broken the next day.

951
01:12:35,382 --> 01:12:40,163
[SPEAKER_17]: So I went in the other day to go to a Macy's Pizza.

952
01:12:40,183 --> 01:12:41,563
[SPEAKER_17]: I bring a couple of quarters, I go in there.

953
01:12:42,998 --> 01:12:45,959
[SPEAKER_17]: does not take orders, does not take change, must use a credit card.

954
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:50,040
[SPEAKER_17]: So I try to call on the public.

955
01:12:51,381 --> 01:12:51,821
[SPEAKER_17]: No answer.

956
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:54,102
[SPEAKER_17]: No trying to work through the thing there.

957
01:12:54,442 --> 01:12:58,683
[SPEAKER_17]: If we could have them get down there, either change their head or fix it again.

958
01:12:59,864 --> 01:13:01,124
[SPEAKER_17]: On that motion, all those in favor?

959
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:01,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President?

960
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:02,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

961
01:13:03,497 --> 01:13:15,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to amend the paper and ask for a report back from Republic as to what their policy is regarding parking at a disabled meter, whether or not it's a ticketable offense, whether or not you're not supposed to park there, whether or not you're allowed to park there for free, but for the two hour limit.

962
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:18,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the policy for parking at a broken meter?

963
01:13:20,489 --> 01:13:24,392
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the policy for Republic parking at a broken meter?

964
01:13:24,892 --> 01:13:26,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a ticketable offense?

965
01:13:27,895 --> 01:13:30,296
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Caraviello?

966
01:13:32,546 --> 01:13:38,788
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I've asked for this report multiple times before, but I never received a report that we asked for from the parking.

967
01:13:38,888 --> 01:13:40,468
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the newspaper got it.

968
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:43,129
[SPEAKER_17]: I never saw it in my package.

969
01:13:43,149 --> 01:13:46,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if maybe, I don't know if the other councilors got it in their package.

970
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:49,891
[SPEAKER_17]: We asked this paper a long time ago.

971
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:54,432
[SPEAKER_10]: The year to date, analysis of public, Republic parking intake.

972
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:57,513
[SPEAKER_17]: The newspaper managed to have it.

973
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,631
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's not even an elected official.

974
01:14:01,352 --> 01:14:04,374
[SPEAKER_17]: And we as elected officials don't have it.

975
01:14:04,394 --> 01:14:06,575
[SPEAKER_17]: As amended by Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Falco.

976
01:14:06,795 --> 01:14:12,699
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could have 2015 year end as opposed to year to date this year.

977
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see the total.

978
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:15,621
[SPEAKER_10]: So 2015.

979
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:17,363
[SPEAKER_10]: January to December.

980
01:14:17,863 --> 01:14:18,763
[SPEAKER_10]: January to December.

981
01:14:18,784 --> 01:14:22,626
[SPEAKER_10]: To the end of January to December and year to date 2016.

982
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,207
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be perfect.

983
01:14:25,008 --> 01:14:25,588
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended.

984
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:26,389
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

985
01:14:26,409 --> 01:14:26,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

986
01:14:27,249 --> 01:14:28,010
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed.

987
01:14:28,928 --> 01:14:29,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

988
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:39,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Knight, the result of the Fire Chief update the Council regarding the status of the EMS service zone plan.

989
01:14:40,132 --> 01:14:40,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Councilor.

990
01:14:41,533 --> 01:14:42,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Mr. President.

991
01:14:42,633 --> 01:14:49,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, recently it's been brought to my attention that the Fire Chief has, uh, submitted a service zone plan to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

992
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:55,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the service zone plan would delineate the proper operations for the deployment of emergency medical personnel in our community.

993
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to ask that the chief give us a report back as to the status of said report.

994
01:15:01,082 --> 01:15:01,903
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

995
01:15:02,383 --> 01:15:03,083
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

996
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:04,063
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion carries.

997
01:15:05,124 --> 01:15:06,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Madam Vice President.

998
01:15:06,945 --> 01:15:08,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President De La Rousseau.

999
01:15:08,205 --> 01:15:15,168
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a resident who would like to say a few words, so just if we could allow her to speak, give us a little update.

1000
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:18,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1001
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:19,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Valerie Geiselman, Medford Mass.

1002
01:15:20,952 --> 01:15:21,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1003
01:15:23,133 --> 01:15:24,775
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a wonderful night at City Hall.

1004
01:15:25,635 --> 01:15:30,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Attending the meeting of the Committee of the Whole was so exciting to see so much participation.

1005
01:15:34,383 --> 01:15:34,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1006
01:15:36,344 --> 01:15:37,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I like what Gene said.

1007
01:15:38,226 --> 01:15:40,868
[SPEAKER_14]: A miracle is happening in Medford.

1008
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:45,269
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, I like, thank you.

1009
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:55,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Councilor Marks, um, famous phrase that, um, and we'll be seeing the creation of Medford, the miracle city on the mystic.

1010
01:15:56,735 --> 01:15:57,435
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that phrase.

1011
01:15:57,475 --> 01:16:00,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that your can't hear me.

1012
01:16:01,097 --> 01:16:02,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1013
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:03,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1014
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:03,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that better?

1015
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:04,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1016
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:09,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, uh, G Martin said, um,

1017
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,528
[SPEAKER_14]: she thinks a miracle is happening here in Medford.

1018
01:16:13,508 --> 01:16:21,592
[SPEAKER_14]: And I like Councilor Mark's phrase that we may be seeing the creation of Medford, the miracle city on the Mystic.

1019
01:16:22,012 --> 01:16:22,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that your phrase?

1020
01:16:23,993 --> 01:16:25,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that phrase a lot.

1021
01:16:27,235 --> 01:16:27,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1022
01:16:32,617 --> 01:16:34,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'd like to say a few words about

1023
01:16:35,393 --> 01:16:36,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Oak Grove Cemetery.

1024
01:16:37,655 --> 01:16:45,761
[SPEAKER_14]: I wondered what's happening with the suggestion that we have an advisory committee discussed here by the city council.

1025
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:57,250
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm interested in the advisory committee addressing the issues of natural space.

1026
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:14,210
[SPEAKER_14]: for green burials, natural burials, and also creating an appeal process for decisions that are made where there are sometimes a request is made and exceptions perhaps should be allowed.

1027
01:17:16,872 --> 01:17:26,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was going over some of the rules and the bylaws, and they're not all that easy for an ordinary citizen to understand.

1028
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:40,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks did ask me if Mount Auburn Cemetery, that's a private cemetery in Cambridge and also part of it's in Watertown, if they have a separate section.

1029
01:17:40,157 --> 01:17:42,479
[SPEAKER_14]: And I spoke with a separate section for green burials.

1030
01:17:43,179 --> 01:17:47,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke with Candace Curry, who is a head of development there.

1031
01:17:47,862 --> 01:17:50,603
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, yes, they have many separate sections.

1032
01:17:51,324 --> 01:17:56,787
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have graves where there could be six or more, 10 separate graves that are

1033
01:17:58,283 --> 01:18:01,545
[SPEAKER_14]: somehow mixed in with the other graves.

1034
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:10,472
[SPEAKER_14]: And they do it a special way, but they are what is called natural or green burials.

1035
01:18:11,252 --> 01:18:13,354
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's how they do it.

1036
01:18:13,374 --> 01:18:14,935
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't have one big section.

1037
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,536
[SPEAKER_14]: They have many sections.

1038
01:18:18,258 --> 01:18:20,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to give that answer to you.

1039
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:22,621
[SPEAKER_14]: You asked that, I think it was two weeks ago.

1040
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:31,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Just recently, I read a quote by President Jimmy Carter.

1041
01:18:32,427 --> 01:18:37,311
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, I'm sorry, my notes are a little bit mixed up.

1042
01:18:40,433 --> 01:18:51,820
[SPEAKER_14]: President Carter said, it was quoted in a German newspaper, that we don't have a functioning democracy in America right now, in our wonderful republic.

1043
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:57,883
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that was a pretty frightening statement by an ex-president.

1044
01:19:01,744 --> 01:19:15,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe, you know, this new process that we're developing here with the city council will be a good example for other communities that may feel some intimidation.

1045
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:21,628
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to thank Michael Ruggiero for creating the movement of our child review in Medford.

1046
01:19:22,077 --> 01:19:25,978
[SPEAKER_14]: and after so many years of waiting for this to happen.

1047
01:19:28,539 --> 01:19:31,120
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see.

1048
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:31,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1049
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,101
[SPEAKER_14]: My notes are a little bit mixed up.

1050
01:19:36,082 --> 01:19:38,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Some other comments that I wanted to make.

1051
01:19:38,063 --> 01:19:50,807
[SPEAKER_14]: A few years ago, our past mayor, Michael McGlynn, honored the Dalai Lama with a key to the city of Medford

1052
01:19:51,468 --> 01:19:55,031
[SPEAKER_14]: for his compassion and efforts to help humanity.

1053
01:19:57,253 --> 01:20:18,472
[SPEAKER_14]: And along, I was just thinking along those lines that the cemetery, Oak Grove Cemetery mission, in their own words, the mission statement says, the mission of the cemetery division is to serve the citizens of Medford by meeting their needs with compassion and dignity.

1054
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:22,980
[SPEAKER_14]: we will deliver services in a fair and impartial manner.

1055
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:30,001
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the mission statement that these people would be following.

1056
01:20:31,321 --> 01:20:33,662
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Stephen Brogan.

1057
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,282
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the manager and superintendent.

1058
01:20:36,002 --> 01:20:43,503
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the board of trustees, James McDevitt is the chair, Stacey Clayton is the vice chair, and then Susan Dee is the third trustee.

1059
01:20:44,443 --> 01:20:47,224
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's the mission statement of the cemetery.

1060
01:20:48,156 --> 01:21:04,427
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think if we follow through with an advisory committee, we could support the cemetery to follow this mission statement and fulfill obligations to the citizens of Medford.

1061
01:21:06,108 --> 01:21:08,229
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's about all in my notes.

1062
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:09,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1063
01:21:14,614 --> 01:21:16,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair to Valerie, I believe we haven't

1064
01:21:17,233 --> 01:21:33,287
[SPEAKER_03]: got a report back or anything from the mayor's office on the commission, but we did get an approval to ask the board of trustees and the superintendent of cemetery to report back on the number of requests they get per year on green burials.

1065
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:35,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just haven't seen anything.

1066
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:38,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anybody else has with regards to the commission we requested.

1067
01:21:38,331 --> 01:21:39,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we can follow up on that.

1068
01:21:40,593 --> 01:21:45,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then also the clergy from Medford interfaith clergy,

1069
01:21:46,146 --> 01:21:47,607
[SPEAKER_03]: is in support of the green burial.

1070
01:21:47,647 --> 01:21:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure if you've been in touch with them, too, to maybe help your cause.

1071
01:21:50,749 --> 01:21:56,994
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, because it sounds like they all sent us a letter into the Cemetery Board of Trustees.

1072
01:21:57,054 --> 01:22:02,118
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are other groups that you can maybe work with to help your cause.

1073
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:04,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're on a time frame issue.

1074
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:10,404
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully, you can get some help through this committee as well.

1075
01:22:10,777 --> 01:22:24,208
[SPEAKER_14]: My understanding, the clergy is interested in green burials and having an advisory council and having other situations that would be related to cemetery matters dealt with with the clergy.

1076
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:36,038
[SPEAKER_14]: They also want to include other groups so that you don't have to be attending a church and also funeral directors for their participation and advice.

1077
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:38,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, but I wondered,

1078
01:22:38,843 --> 01:22:45,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Can the city council also be involved in that, so that it's a citywide endeavor?

1079
01:22:45,388 --> 01:22:51,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can pass resolves, we can make recommendations, but I'm not sure.

1080
01:22:51,052 --> 01:22:55,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Councilor Knight's right.

1081
01:22:55,195 --> 01:22:59,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the commission is, if you want to explain that further, that was perfect.

1082
01:23:00,398 --> 01:23:03,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Boards and commissions fall under the purview of the mayor, the appointment power.

1083
01:23:03,601 --> 01:23:06,282
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have to be approved by the council or any of that.

1084
01:23:07,342 --> 01:23:28,233
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, in terms of what the council can do, we can take legislative action or advisory action, but in terms of establishing, we can establish a board of commission, I'm sure, whether or not we'd have the statutory authority from the state to do it regarding the cemetery or cemetery advisory committee is a different question that I'm not qualified to answer.

1085
01:23:29,234 --> 01:23:34,597
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the short answer to the question is no, at this point in time that was posed.

1086
01:23:35,513 --> 01:24:02,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a number of us that are concerned about green burials and conservation in the city, and there is a growing number of people now that we've been talking about it, are interested in seeing that the whole community of Medford could be involved in expressing their needs and their concerns, and to be able to have those needs addressed in a timely manner, and also if there's

1087
01:24:02,757 --> 01:24:19,681
[SPEAKER_14]: things in the bylaws that need to be changed, such as maybe things are going to be changed with the charter review, that that would also be a consideration so that everyone's needs could be understood and met in a timely manner.

1088
01:24:22,222 --> 01:24:22,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1089
01:24:22,522 --> 01:24:23,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1090
01:24:23,382 --> 01:24:23,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

1091
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:25,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1092
01:24:27,094 --> 01:24:28,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1093
01:24:28,295 --> 01:24:48,046
[SPEAKER_16]: And unlike the Veterans Advisory Board, which Councilor Caraviello pushed for and was finally implemented by Mayor Burke recently, there is no state statute that governs, like Councilor Knight mentioned, governs the same process for cemetery boards to have an oversight body.

1094
01:24:48,446 --> 01:24:54,369
[SPEAKER_16]: However, we could, that does not preclude us as a legislative body to create that.

1095
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:57,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we're at about that point right now.

1096
01:24:57,965 --> 01:25:18,341
[SPEAKER_16]: And I see the interest from the clergy and other interested parties in the group, as well as in the city, as well as Valerie, that over the next couple of weeks, I'm going to be offering a paper for the creation of an advisory board that will be the purview of this body through legislative action.

1097
01:25:19,122 --> 01:25:23,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's only appropriate that the matter be discussed

1098
01:25:23,712 --> 01:25:31,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And whatever the decision is, whether this body feels that we can create a city ordinance or not, that'll come out in the vetting process.

1099
01:25:32,356 --> 01:25:35,517
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think at this point, there's enough interest out in this community.

1100
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:47,562
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't see why, personally, the cemetery board wouldn't amend their rules and regulations to allow a certain portion of the cemetery, a small portion, to be used for green burials.

1101
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:50,043
[SPEAKER_16]: At this particular point, it's done in other

1102
01:25:50,836 --> 01:25:56,059
[SPEAKER_16]: surrounding cemeteries, and there doesn't seem to be a public health threat or risk.

1103
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:03,384
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, as Valerie mentioned, that's a public cemetery, and we should be able to accommodate everyone in this community.

1104
01:26:03,704 --> 01:26:11,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I may choose not to be buried that way, but someone else should have the right to do so after the process is thoroughly examined.

1105
01:26:12,349 --> 01:26:16,572
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think, at the very least, Mr. President, I'm going to make sure that process happens.

1106
01:26:19,366 --> 01:26:26,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke with Mark Rumbley, our city solicitor, and he said under Mass General Laws, there's nothing that prohibits this type of natural burial.

1107
01:26:28,991 --> 01:26:29,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1108
01:26:31,593 --> 01:26:35,635
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Council Knight that the paper be received and placed on file, all those in favor?

1109
01:26:36,075 --> 01:26:36,756
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1110
01:26:41,038 --> 01:26:42,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Councilor Scott.

1111
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:43,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, just a feel-good story.

1112
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,120
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem at all.

1113
01:26:47,763 --> 01:26:53,729
[SPEAKER_04]: public information this Friday night, probably one of the most selfless acts I've ever heard in my life.

1114
01:26:54,691 --> 01:26:57,574
[SPEAKER_04]: John Howard, a teacher at the St.

1115
01:26:57,594 --> 01:27:04,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Joseph School, will be donating his kidney to a student that needs it.

1116
01:27:05,342 --> 01:27:08,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, I think that is the most amazing

1117
01:27:09,511 --> 01:27:10,112
[SPEAKER_04]: situation.

1118
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:11,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That gentleman is a hero.

1119
01:27:12,614 --> 01:27:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: He stepped up on his own, from what I hear, went out, made sure he was compatible for what's needed for that fourth grade child.

1120
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:24,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank God it was.

1121
01:27:24,363 --> 01:27:31,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And on Friday night, they're having a big meet and greet at the Irish American at 7 to 11.

1122
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:36,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anybody can make it, I think we should all go down there and give that gentleman a

1123
01:27:37,353 --> 01:27:40,034
[SPEAKER_04]: a pat on the back and a recognition.

1124
01:27:40,975 --> 01:27:45,037
[SPEAKER_04]: This Friday night at the Irish American, kidney donor meet and greet.

1125
01:27:45,697 --> 01:27:46,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for John and Justin.

1126
01:27:47,678 --> 01:27:48,979
[SPEAKER_04]: To raise money.

1127
01:27:50,960 --> 01:28:00,184
[SPEAKER_04]: The surgery's okay, I guess it's for other reasons, but I appreciate what John's doing, and he's a great person.

1128
01:28:00,204 --> 01:28:05,867
[SPEAKER_04]: He runs the drama spotlight productions, and my daughter Gianna.

1129
01:28:06,637 --> 01:28:08,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank John for giving her a solo.

1130
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I've listened to a song for the last three months.

1131
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:14,923
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you.

1132
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:15,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1133
01:28:18,525 --> 01:28:19,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

1134
01:28:20,547 --> 01:28:29,673
[SPEAKER_10]: By way of information, while we're on the announcement portion, the economic development transition meeting schedule has been announced.

01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:32,275

1142
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:28,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, offered by Councilor Knight, 16 dash, one more announcement, Councilor Knight.

1143
01:29:29,618 --> 01:29:36,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Included in our packets this week, Mr. President, was a letter from Lauren DiLorenzo, our Director of Community Development.

1144
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:44,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And inside that letter is an advertisement for the request for proposals for public service funding through the Community Development Block Grant Program.

1145
01:29:44,862 --> 01:29:47,163
[SPEAKER_06]: The City of Medford is in their 42nd program year.

1146
01:29:47,443 --> 01:29:50,684
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to run from July 1st, 2016 to June 30th, 2017.

1147
01:29:51,164 --> 01:29:58,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And residents can pick up an application and submit their proposals by March 4th to the Community Development Office.

1148
01:29:59,546 --> 01:30:03,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be a big year, I think, this year, Mr. President, and I'm hoping that

1149
01:30:04,047 --> 01:30:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a number of organizations out there that are helping work, curb the opiate crisis for low and moderate income residents here in Medford that are going to hear this and are going to apply so that we can continue to get some help here in the community in combating the addiction crisis that we're facing.

1150
01:30:17,137 --> 01:30:23,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Committee of the whole April 5th at 530 in the council chamber for the council room office for that and May 3rd.

1151
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,521
[SPEAKER_07]: will be before us in the public hearing.

1152
01:30:29,103 --> 01:30:37,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Mr. President, the OCD director is reaching out to the two new Councilors, two of you on the process.

1153
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:38,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor.

1154
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:52,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the Community Preservation Committee will be meeting to discuss the structure of the Community Preservation Commission on the heels of the Voter Approved Community Preservation Act, and we will be meeting on the 2nd in room 207 at 6 p.m.

1155
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:58,704
[SPEAKER_07]: while the economic and business event is happening here.

1156
01:30:59,045 --> 01:30:59,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1157
01:30:59,625 --> 01:30:59,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1158
01:31:01,627 --> 01:31:02,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor.

1159
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:04,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I was left off that.

1160
01:31:05,029 --> 01:31:05,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, George.

1161
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:06,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1162
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:08,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Solicitor Rumley became a non-voting member.

1163
01:31:09,373 --> 01:31:09,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1164
01:31:09,733 --> 01:31:10,414
[SPEAKER_06]: George is on.

1165
01:31:10,554 --> 01:31:12,695
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to review that, I guess.

1166
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:13,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1167
01:31:14,557 --> 01:31:22,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, 16-091 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences

1168
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:27,193
[SPEAKER_10]: to the family of Amabile Billy Rizzo on his recent passing.

1169
01:31:28,054 --> 01:31:36,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Rizzo, a distinguished member of the Carabinieri when he was a young man in Italy, and both of his sons are distinguished public servants.

1170
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:37,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they are.

1171
01:31:37,861 --> 01:31:38,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they are.

1172
01:31:38,481 --> 01:31:44,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Mr. President, the Rizzos have been good friends of mine for a number of years, dating back to the early 90s.

1173
01:31:46,106 --> 01:31:47,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony and Gino were great kids.

1174
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:51,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. and Mrs. Rizzo were always very hospitable and welcoming.

1175
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:56,074
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they had that type of home where you could walk down the street and the front door would open and somebody would yell at you, get in here.

1176
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:56,695
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to eat?

1177
01:31:57,475 --> 01:31:58,356
[SPEAKER_06]: They were great people.

1178
01:31:58,456 --> 01:32:00,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Billy was a wonderful guy.

1179
01:32:00,157 --> 01:32:04,120
[SPEAKER_06]: He immigrated here from Sicily after serving as a member of Interpol, actually.

1180
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:08,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, he had thousands of pictures to show you every time you saw him.

1181
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:11,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And he loved to kiss me and everything else, Mr. President.

1182
01:32:11,946 --> 01:32:13,027
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to be sadly missed.

1183
01:32:13,534 --> 01:32:21,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I'd like to extend my condolences and that at the council in the city of Medford to a longtime resident who was very civically engaged, um, who's going to be greatly missed.

1184
01:32:21,316 --> 01:32:23,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Please join us in a moment of silence.

1185
01:32:36,019 --> 01:32:39,820
[SPEAKER_10]: The records meeting of February 16th, 2016 will pass a consulate.

1186
01:32:40,704 --> 01:32:42,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Caraviello, Mr. Councilor, how'd you find those?

1187
01:32:43,106 --> 01:32:45,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I found a small error here.

1188
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:56,899
[SPEAKER_17]: On 16072, at the bottom of the paper, it says, upon motion by Councilor Marks to be tabled, it should have been referred to Committee of the Whole.

1189
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:01,684
[SPEAKER_17]: So if the clerk could make that change, it would be appreciated.

1190
01:33:02,185 --> 01:33:02,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1191
01:33:03,185 --> 01:33:04,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, you move for the approval?

1192
01:33:04,587 --> 01:33:05,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise, the papers are in order.

1193
01:33:06,172 --> 01:33:06,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1194
01:33:06,813 --> 01:33:08,474
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval, all those in favour?

1195
01:33:09,074 --> 01:33:09,715
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1196
01:33:09,735 --> 01:33:10,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1197
01:33:10,716 --> 01:33:12,817
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for adjournment by Councilor Falco.

1198
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:14,359
[SPEAKER_16]: No meeting next Tuesday?

1199
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:17,901
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is no meeting because everybody must get out and vote.

1200
01:33:18,202 --> 01:33:19,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Committee to hold until tomorrow.

1201
01:33:19,322 --> 01:33:20,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Committee to hold until tomorrow.

1202
01:33:22,385 --> 01:33:23,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to adjourn.

1203
01:33:24,046 --> 01:33:24,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Vote and vote on it.

1204
01:33:24,867 --> 01:33:26,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Approved.
