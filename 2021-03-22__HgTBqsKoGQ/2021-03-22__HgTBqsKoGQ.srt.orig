1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:01,151
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Justin Tsang.

2
00:00:01,391 --> 00:00:06,073
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a student, a first-generation Taiwanese-American, and a proud member of the Medford community.

3
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:11,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running for City Council to energize Medford with a bold, progressive vision and a commitment to justice.

4
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:13,075
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I grew up.

5
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:18,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so many in Medford, my family moved here to settle down, build their careers, and raise their kid.

6
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:20,117
[SPEAKER_00]: This will always be home to me.

7
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:22,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Wellington embraced my family and it watched me grow up.

8
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,300
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was five years old, my parents sent me off to the McGlynn.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I still remember Ms.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Keynes standing there with her welcoming smile.

11
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:34,164
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the McGlynn actually taught me what it meant to give back to my community.

12
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:39,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember coming back as a middle schooler to volunteer at the after school program or to help kids with cello.

13
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:43,188
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also where I learned about Medford's challenges.

14
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,710
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember realizing that my family's financial challenges weren't unique.

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember realizing that our teachers struggled to afford basic school supplies.

16
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:58,835
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember realizing that as much as we talked about diversity, students like me would struggle to fit in.

17
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:04,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at Medford High, I made a commitment to ask the tough questions, to shine a light on injustice, and to think change.

18
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:12,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember sitting in the library to draft our school's improvement plans and to help choose our first school superintendent of color.

19
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:18,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And on Monday nights, I take the 134 down High Street, down to City Hall, where I work to uplift youth voices.

20
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since high school, I've kept the fight up.

21
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:24,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked on policy commissions and advocated for young Americans on the national stage.

22
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:29,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Medford, I fought for families and against cuts to schools.

23
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:33,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never forgotten my roots and I've never forgotten my love for Medford.

24
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:36,126
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this love that brings me back to City Hall.

25
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:43,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running for Medford City Council because it's time we had a dignified city government that pursues progress and not the status quo.

26
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:47,755
[SPEAKER_00]: A diverse and representative city government that leads and listens.

27
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:59,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Faced with a pandemic, a warming climate, significant cuts to schools, and our centuries-long fight against racism, we need leaders that realize that meaningful structural change starts right here at home.
