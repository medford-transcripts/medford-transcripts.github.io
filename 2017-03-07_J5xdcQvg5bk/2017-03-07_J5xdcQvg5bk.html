    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=261.873s">the</a>  conference room. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=262.917s">Professor</a>  Carter, Ann Marie O'Neill, or individuals at SFS, me and the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=271.114s">President</a>  Superintendent Roy Belson, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Vocational Principal Director Heidi Riccio, Director of Finance and Administration Christine Patterson, and Director of Buildings and Grounds John McLaughlin, parents Sarah O'Grady, Melissa McGinnis, Carolyn Montello, and Michelle Ciccolo, all rose to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=294.71s">Vice</a>  Chair Cunha stated the purpose of the meeting was to continue our discussions on capital planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=299.96s">projects</a>  for the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=302.402s">Vice</a>  Chair Cugno called upon the superintendent to begin the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=306.685s">The</a>  superintendent reiterated the importance of understanding the difference between capital planning projects and general repair and maintenance issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=314.551s">Capital</a>  planning is usually a multi-year group of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=317.837s">Such</a>  projects generally require a mix of bonding, grants, and revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=322.084s">The</a>  superintendent listed the capital projects that have been completed since FY 2000, which are attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=328.173s">Secretary</a>  Van der Kloot pointed out that the pool and the boiler project should be added to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=332.812s">The</a>  superintendent stressed the importance of getting started. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=335.314s">Capital</a>  projects often take multiple years to get approval from the funding agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=340.039s">Additionally,</a>  there are many non-school projects that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=343.342s">There</a>  must be a balance between city and school priorities as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=347.026s">Mayor</a>  Burke joined the meeting and assumed the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=348.988s">The</a>  mayor was attending a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=353.986s">Each</a>  committee member was provided with a packet of materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=356.669s">The</a>  superintendent identified capital plan proposed on August 5th, 2016 for the committee's reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=363.877s">This</a>  discussion then reviewed the statement of interest, which was approved by the school committee at their last regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=369.951s">This</a>  is only the first step toward acquiring MSBA funding assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=374.754s">Dr.</a>  Heidi Riccio then detailed three grant awards that are moving forward to enable major improvements in program development. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=381.278s">They</a>  are attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=382.239s">The</a>  three grants are the Massachusetts Life Sciences Grant for $98,516, which will support the development of our robotics and engineering programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=391.993s">Number</a>  two was the capital skills grant for $500,000 to support the development of our culinary and hospitality program. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=399.118s">We</a>  will match this funding with both in-kind assistance from our partners in industry and labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=404.222s">Also,</a>  we will use funding that is in the reserve contingency from the science labs project. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=409.005s">This</a>  will require council approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=410.987s">Third</a>  is regional services grant for $200,000 to expand our shops to accommodate enrollment increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=418.312s">The</a>  focus of this grant will be <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=420.493s">on</a>  our electrical program and related areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=422.894s">It</a>  will facilitate the inclusion with students from Everett who will pay a tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=428.076s">Currently,</a>  we have 25 Everett students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=430.397s">We</a>  expect to increase the number of tuition students to 100 over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=434.379s">We</a>  are also recapturing tuitions from Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=437.66s">The</a>  grants will be supplemented by in-kind work by the laborers and Wynn, as well as the other industry partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=443.242s">The</a>  development of our shop spaces will also enable us to serve adult learners and to maximize the use of our facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=450.11s">The</a>  laborers will also help increase handicap accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=453.794s">The</a>  discussion moved to the high school roof, see infrared roof survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=457.998s">The</a>  high school roof needs some small repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=460.333s">that</a>  could be accomplished for about $25,000 to $30,000 this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=464.277s">We</a>  would expect to consider roof replacement beginning with 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=467.019s">This</a>  would be done in sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=469.862s">The</a>  outside schools are still in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=472.084s">They</a>  have another 10 years before possible replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=474.807s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin was present to ask your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=477.629s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin then discussed the emergency repairs to the heating system pipes in A building. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=483.355s">which</a>  is attached, a financial account was provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=486.478s">Member</a>  Mia Mastone asked how we could find funding for this type of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=491.302s">Also</a>  why we are not finding money for building appearance projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=494.926s">The</a>  superintendent explained that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=496.635s">he</a>  would have had to shut down a building if the repairs were not made. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=500.316s">It</a>  is not uncommon to divert funding for emergency repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=504.957s">He</a>  also reiterated his plan to add additional funds to the operational budget next year for general repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=511.779s">Member</a>  Erinda Benedetto asked that the hanging wires in the conference room be removed from sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=516.7s">Mr.</a>  Scurry urged more cosmetic work be done, and members Cugno and Van der Kloot recognized the need to do more with appearance, but supported the priority of emergency repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=527.08s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=527.28s">Van</a>  der Kloot asked for a report on the bleachers at our K-8 schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=531.242s">The</a>  superintendent referenced the report from Mr. McLaughlin regarding the need to repair air conditioning compressors. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=536.685s">While</a>  the schools are functional, there could be better efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=540.667s">There's</a>  also an attached listing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=542.849s">Curb</a>  replacement and parking lot resurfing was discussed with emphasis on the high school McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=548.291s">A</a>  report is attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=549.875s">Playground</a>  replacement at the elementary schools was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=553.216s">Pricing</a>  is now being sought. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=554.776s">There</a>  is some possible mitigation linkage from a developer to assist with the Roberts playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=560.437s">The</a>  committee received the draft executive summary for our school technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=564.698s">As</a>  we move forward, technology is central to our educational and operational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=569.278s">Testing,</a>  state, federal funding, reporting, and instruction are more and more dependent on a robust and reliable technology, sorry, infrastructure and tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=580.318s">We</a>  are eligible for substantial funding from the e-rate program under Tier 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=584.9s">This</a>  will require a 40% match. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=587.101s">Technology</a>  capital investment must be an essential part of our capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=593.024s">Almost</a>  made it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=593.965s">On</a>  the motion of Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. <a

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=696.817s">And</a>  I had done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=697.497s">The</a>  playground equipment? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=698.197s">The</a>  intercom in the playground?</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=868.97s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=870.45s">We've</a>  had the Ethics Bowl team here in Medford since 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=874.551s">It</a>  originated as a partnership between Tufts University's Department of Philosophy and Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=881.553s">And</a>  since that time, Mr. Esner has been the advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=884.673s">We</a>  have reported some major successes this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=888.614s">They</a>  competed at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=891.358s">and</a>  did very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=893.418s">They</a>  had multiple rounds of competition to face. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=896.899s">They</a>  beat out different schools, including Phillips Exeter, Rosemary Choate Hall, and Newton South. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=903.6s">So</a>  we were very, very proud of that accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=906.821s">That</a>  was the regional competition held at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=910.581s">That</a>  made these students eligible to participate in the playoff competition, which was actually done virtually through, I believe, Google Hangouts, which was kind of exciting in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=921.262s">And</a>  once again, the team was successful in winning that playoff round. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=925.745s">So</a>  we are just so thrilled and pleased with all of their hard work and energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=931.549s">It's</a>  an after-school club. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=932.889s">They</a>  volunteer their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=934.17s">Mr.</a>  Esner does as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=935.951s">And</a>  I want to personally thank Mr. Esner for all of his hard work with everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=940.254s">And</a>  we'd like to recognize the students as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=941.955s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[WSQLRgnxB8U_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1311.407s">Macklemore,</a>  a popular entertainer, especially in the early 2010s. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1316.009s">Is</a>  it morally permissible for a white person to lead or be the face of an organization called Black Lives Matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1323.054s">Another</a>  question we had, currently we're working on the heroin epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1327.437s">Who</a>  should have access to Narcan? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1329.838s">Who</a>  should be able to administrate it? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1331.639s">And</a>  is there a big moral difference if you're taking away one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1336.217s">greatest</a>  consequences of drug abuse, which would be an overdose. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1339.059s">We</a>  have things of that nature.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1340.641s">Okay,</a>  and so when you answer these questions, like, is it, I mean, is it like in an essay form? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1345.345s">I</a>  mean, how long do they give you to answer the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1351.87s">You've</a>  won it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1352.451s">You</a>  might as well explain it.</p>

    <p>[WSQLRgnxB8U_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1359.257s">So</a>  the way we answer the questions is in a debate format. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1362.54s">So</a>  it starts by there's two teams, Team A and Team B. And Team A is presented with a case and a question about the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1371.466s">And</a>  then we have five minutes to present our main argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1374.769s">Then</a>  Team B has three minutes, I believe, to either add on to our argument or present their personal view. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1381.674s">And</a>  then Team A has another two or three minutes to respond to Team B's commentary.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1387.218s">And</a>  how long do the rounds usually last? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1392.659s">45</a>  minutes a round? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1394.28s">And</a>  how many rounds do you do?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1477.787s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1482.449s">I</a>  just want to say some food for thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1485.15s">This</a>  particular year it seems like we've been really blessed with more and more students coming to us and achieving so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1493.874s">It</a>  seems like we're having more and more students going out of state for these competitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1498.596s">As</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1499.096s">Van</a>  der Kloot had motioned for us to pass and make sure that we pay for this trip <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1504.038s">I</a>  think it's just food for thought that we might start thinking about this when the budget comes around and really put a budget line for these types of trips because you don't want to be in a situation where we're approving one particular team and not approving the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1517.67s">And</a>  we don't want to make anyone feel that what they're doing for us is any less worth what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1524.035s">So</a>  just as a matter of fact, just to make it as food for thought, that was it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1528.499s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1528.959s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1531.361s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1535.518s">Next</a>  up, community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1537.099s">I</a>  don't believe we have anything on the agenda for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1538.999s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1541.26s">Report</a>  number one, recommendation to accept gift from Thomas Sutherland in memory of Jean Barry Sutherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1547.283s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, there's a motion on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1549.624s">Members</a>  of the committee, Thomas Sutherland, the husband of Jean Barry Sutherland, would like to make a major donation to <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1560.448s">Columbus</a>  school area site, uh, in memory and in honor of, uh, former principal, Jean Barry Sutherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1567.23s">Uh,</a>  the gift would be a bench and a plaque to be installed on the Columbus ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1572.292s">So</a>  we recommend that you accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1573.972s">Mr.</a>  Sutherland is here, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1576.073s">No,</a>  no, I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1577.214s">I</a>  don't see him.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1577.914s">There's</a>  a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1582.115s">Roll</a>  call vote, please.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1587.361s">We</a>  all know that Jean Barry Sutherland meant an awful lot to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1592.165s">She</a>  was a remarkable woman, both in her life and also as she was approaching the end of her life, and was really an inspiration in so many ways for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1601.113s">This</a>  is very fitting, and I'm thankful to her husband, Thomas, for making this a lasting tribute to her on our school grounds, which she loves so dearly.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1611.445s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1612.165s">I</a>  had the privilege of meeting with Mrs. Sutherland, and he's just so thrilled to be able to recognize her years of service to the city of Medbridge and Medford Public Schools, and especially the Columbus School, which was her home school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1623.547s">And</a>  she was there when the new schools were opened, and she was a staple in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1627.428s">So</a>  she's dearly missed, but this will provide a reflective area for the students, the parents, and teachers, I would imagine, and administrators to pay homage to her deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1638.871s">So</a>  we're very proud to be able to do this for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1641.34s">And</a>  as soon as we have a date, we believe it's early April, but we'll let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1644.962s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1645.462s">Call</a>  the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1645.923s">Roll</a>  call vote, please.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1647.123s">Mrs.</a>  Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1648.364s">Mrs.</a>  DiBenedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1649.885s">Mrs.</a>  Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1651.186s">Mrs.</a>  Mastone. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1653.227s">Mr.</a>  Scurry. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1653.947s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1654.547s">Mrs.</a>  Vanderklift. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1655.208s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1655.548s">Mayor</a>  Burke.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1656.248s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1656.969s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero on the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1658.73s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1660.611s">Item</a>  two, recommendation to approve school calendar, a school year 2017-18.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1663.752s">So</a>  as we get into this time of year, people ask the question frequently, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1670.415s">When</a>  will school start? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1671.576s">What</a>  will be the vacation periods and the like? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1673.977s">And</a>  this is a draft that requires your approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1677.76s">I'm</a>  gonna call on our deputy superintendent to go over the particulars and to tell you why we picked certain dates the way we did.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1686.085s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1686.646s">We're</a>  asking tonight that we approve our calendar moving forward to the following school year so families can plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1693.871s">Everybody</a>  has an idea of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1697.353s">As</a>  you can see, this year we've <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1699.74s">adopted</a>  a new format. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1702.201s">My</a>  thanks to my assistant Jeannie Gliona for working very diligently, making everything fit nicely, and we feel that it's very readable and concise for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1713.567s">The</a>  current teacher's contract calls for the school to start every year now before Labor Day, the Monday before Labor Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1721.891s">Again,</a>  this is not a decision that administration makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1724.932s">This</a>  is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1726.545s">is</a>  set in the teacher's contract by negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1730.307s">And</a>  therefore, the start of the school year for teachers this year will be Monday, August 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1737.111s">The</a>  contract was also very specific for how that first week would be organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1743.474s">The</a>  Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of that week prior to Labor Day, students will be in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1750.058s">And</a>  then Friday, the Friday before Labor Day, everyone will have a holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1754.784s">So</a>  again, that was something that is in the teacher's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1758.227s">This</a>  is the second year that we've adopted this schedule and we want to make sure that parents get that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1765.895s">We</a>  know we've been asking principals to reinforce it so that parents understand that vacation really kind of has to stop at the end of August. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1779.268s">Students,</a>  again, would return to school after Labor Day on September 5th, with kindergarten students beginning on the 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1786.989s">The</a>  calendar has the required number of days with five snow days built in. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1792.11s">And</a>  if we were to use those snow days, the end of school would be June 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1796.031s">If</a>  we don't use it, we back it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1798.611s">And</a>  again, the calendar has the standard school vacations, legal holidays, the mandated, or actually the early release days that are mandated by <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1809.307s">the</a>  contract for middle and high school and again we have two full days of professional development and we've set those for Tuesday, November 7th and Monday, March 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1824.48s">We</a>  strongly recommend that the calendar be approved as early as possible and if you have any questions or comments.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1836.138s">Beverly,</a>  I thought that the last year that we've been setting in more like seven snow days, not five. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1842.944s">So</a>  I was surprised to see that this was, in my eyes, rolled back to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1847.548s">I</a>  would have thought that we would have called the end of school the 22nd, for instance, so to set expectations that it could go that late. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1859.079s">So</a>  I'd like the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1861.261s">So</a>  let me just answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1862.787s">By</a>  rule, with the Department of Ed, we have to make allowance for five days, but we actually have another seven days if we needed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1869.63s">So</a>  we really have 12 days available to us, not counting if we were to reclaim a professional day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1874.852s">So</a>  remember, if the last day with five days is the 20th of June, you still got to the 30th of June if we actually needed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1881.415s">So</a>  we've really built in quite a bit of protection.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1884.656s">Yes,</a>  I guess I'm looking at it a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1886.497s">If</a>  I'm a parent thinking about making plans, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1890.282s">If</a>  you say the end of the school is the 22nd, well, then I'm going to be thinking I'm going to make my plans starting the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1896.385s">If</a>  you say it's the 20th, then I'm going to start making them the 21st.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1898.986s">We</a>  can put a one-liner in the notice out there.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1901.768s">We</a>  can make that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1902.668s">We</a>  can put seven snow days built in. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1904.789s">This</a>  is just the drought, so.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1906.49s">I'd</a>  like some other feedback, but I'm thinking that it's better to set people's expectations that there could be the possibility, because if we go back <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1913.814s">to</a>  two years ago in 2015 when we had so many snowstorms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1918.835s">I</a>  think it's an expectation thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1921.676s">What</a>  do others think?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1922.436s">We</a>  have built in this year, five?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1924.417s">Yeah,</a>  we should do five. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1925.637s">We</a>  built in probably 11 days.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1927.478s">Well,</a>  and the calendar itself says five. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1929.458s">The</a>  calendar has five. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1930.339s">But</a>  we know that we can go by teacher's contract to the 30th of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1933.92s">So</a>  in effect, it's built in. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1936.52s">But</a>  it's not a bad suggestion that we can make that adjustment if the committee wants to go that route.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1943.376s">We</a>  can put a statement and should, you know, we require more days because of snow or other inclement weather or other reasons.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1949.097s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1949.517s">If</a>  we just did some further clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1951.798s">Okay,</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1953.298s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1955.719s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1956.519s">You</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1958.36s">And</a>  I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1959.3s">I</a>  think the comment at the bottom is an important piece that, um, parents can, but most, most parents know this from being for a while, but it's the younger parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1970.783s">I</a>  mean, parents of younger students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1973.194s">that</a>  might need that to be listed on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1976.817s">My</a>  comment is just November 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1979.379s">It</a>  says professional development day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1981.401s">It</a>  seems weird to have a day off on a Tuesday and then on a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1984.704s">I</a>  just want people, I understand that, but I'm not sure everybody reading this quickly is going to say, oh, why is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1991.469s">That</a>  seems like a strange week to have a Tuesday and a Friday off the same week. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1995.953s">So,</a>  you know, maybe next to it, professional development day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2001.477s">put</a>  also election day or something so parents know that it can't be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2005.639s">It</a>  wasn't like a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2006.94s">It's</a>  like we do that for the safety of the schools and the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2010.542s">So</a>  that way people aren't roaming the buildings on election day.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2014.444s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2016.346s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2016.546s">Kritz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2017.626s">Oh,</a>  I wanted to thank Beverly. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2019.667s">I</a>  ran into her at the school and we started to get inquiries already asking when we were going back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2026.851s">And</a>  some parents <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2028.776s">really</a>  didn't know that, in fact, I didn't really know that it was part of the contract that the teachers had to start school early. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2035.538s">I</a>  misunderstood, I thought it was administration also, so I'm glad you explained that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2039.538s">Would</a>  there be any way to maybe just put something under the bottom explaining that as per collective bargaining agreement, the start of school would be before Labor Day? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2051.881s">There</a>  was a lot of communication about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2055.322s">A</a>  lot of people weren't happy about <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2057.522s">going</a>  back to school before Labor Day, you know, I was getting inquiries myself, you know, why are we going back before Labor Day? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2064.005s">I</a>  don't like that, you know, but yeah.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2068.727s">So</a>  we used to go back in Medford after Labor Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2072.249s">And</a>  in fact, many families preferred it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2074.27s">Um,</a>  and certainly the teachers did. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2076.031s">The</a>  fact of the matter was with them, we were running into a problem because we were going too late <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2080.748s">too</a>  far into June because we were getting more snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2083.23s">We</a>  went through a period of years where we're getting a lot of snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2086.473s">And</a>  so with the cooperation of the teachers union, we then moved it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2091.937s">Is</a>  it preferable? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2092.918s">Well,</a>  not necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2094.259s">It</a>  depends on who you talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2095.34s">But</a>  it's because of, I mean, if we could predict snow days, we wouldn't be doing this, but we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2101.105s">And</a>  if teachers were unhappy, they were really, really, really unhappy if, you know, school went to June 30th or, you know, when it went that late. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2108.811s">So</a>  that's why.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2111.153s">And</a>  this is quite typical of most school systems now. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2113.735s">Most</a>  school systems are back before. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2116.916s">We</a>  used to, there were a few times we started before Labor Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2119.618s">The</a>  previous contract said school could not start before September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2124.28s">But</a>  there were the occasions that September 1st was before Labor Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2128.782s">So</a>  we did, a few years here and there, depending upon the fall of Labor Day, we did start before. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2135.646s">But</a>  again, now it's pretty much cast in stone in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2139.868s">Quite</a>  honestly, this was something that the teacher's union kind of promoted more than we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2145.491s">I</a>  think teachers feel it's much more advantageous for children to be out of school earlier in June, because it gets hot, they get tired, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2154.316s">And</a>  so it's something that they promoted, and we thought it was a good idea too, but it was promoted by the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2161.22s">In</a>  terms of adding anything, pretty much everything in the contract, like the early release days, is contractual. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2166.863s">And</a>  there's only so much language we can add. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2169.875s">I</a>  know Jeannie was trying to squeeze things in to get everything in. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2172.977s">We</a>  can try if you feel that that's important to her contract to put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2177.6s">But</a>  just getting the word out that this is in the teacher's contract and principals have been promoting that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2184.103s">So</a>  hopefully people, and this is the second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2187.325s">Okay,</a>  we did it last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2189.387s">The</a>  teachers were very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2190.867s">They</a>  did not want a professional development day that first week. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2193.929s">They</a>  wanted students in school for three consecutive days. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2196.611s">So</a>  that was pretty much set by them.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2200.025s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2200.945s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2201.785s">Motion</a>  of approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2202.826s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2204.286s">Also,</a>  another point is a lot of school systems around the United States start earlier than we do in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2211.127s">And</a>  all students take the AP exams and the SATs at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2216.869s">So</a>  if we're not in school as many days as others, we don't cover as much material as others. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2223.93s">And</a>  they're judged throughout the United States on their performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2228.995s">So</a>  we need to be in school a certain amount of days to get the education in for them to be prepared for these exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2238.598s">Some</a>  schools start early August. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2242.659s">And</a>  with our snow days, we could even have weeks less time to prepare for these exams than people in other parts of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2251.582s">And</a>  it's really important to get these days in and the education started for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2257.295s">So</a>  that's another reason why I totally agreed with starting this before Labor Day.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2262.877s">That's</a>  an excellent point. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2263.977s">And</a>  also, we have our regular state testing that takes place in April and May. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2269.819s">Communities</a>  that start before Labor Day, the students have a whole week of more prep. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2274.581s">And</a>  what you said with snow days, it's very hard to predict already. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2277.762s">We're</a>  saying we lost a few days here and there, how are we going to make it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2280.923s">So</a>  it's for the AP exams and plus just the regular state exams, having that instructional time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2287.365s">I</a>  think most students are ready to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2290.046s">I</a>  think it's kind of gearing up that last week in August, so hopefully they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2294.728s">In</a>  their parents.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2303.151s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for approval by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2304.992s">Van</a>  der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2306.953s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2317.671s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2317.971s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2319.512s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2321.093s">Report</a>  on March 13th, 2017 professional development day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2325.036s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2326.156s">So</a>  our deputy superintendent, our assistant superintendent have led the charge in putting this program together. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2332.44s">It's</a>  done with a great deal of input from the teachers and others, and it's a lot of work involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2338.544s">So,</a>  uh, congratulations to both of them putting together a very interesting day and let them tell you about it.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2344.143s">Diane</a>  and I have been emailing all weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2346.805s">She's</a>  tired of seeing my emails on Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2349.366s">But</a>  again, Monday, March 13th, a week from today, will be our second full day of professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2357.972s">There</a>  is no school for students that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2360.373s">Again,</a>  there are lots of different activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2363.395s">When</a>  we did this report last week, we hadn't ironed out as much as now we have together, and we'll give you a full report on the 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2371.326s">But</a>  part of the day, as all of you know, we had a very exciting professional development program this year for the first time, where teachers on November 8th, our first full day of professional development, they engaged in a round robin exploring three very important themes that were identified as themes that we wanted to pursue, teachers wanted to pursue further. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2392.796s">And</a>  this was based on their own surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2395.528s">And</a>  one of those themes was at-risk students, a second one was special education, and a third was social-emotional learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2403.171s">After</a>  November 8th, every teacher in the school district said, I want to go with one theme. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2409.194s">And</a>  so they continue with that theme throughout the school year on our mandated PD days. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2414.936s">That's</a>  the elementary and the middle and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2418.078s">Again,</a>  who facilitated those workshops? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2420.779s">Our</a>  own staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2421.699s">They</a>  were magnificent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2423.408s">wonderful</a>  teachers stepped up, they organized workshops, and they were very well received. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2429.729s">So</a>  we were very excited about this because teachers were telling us that sometimes PD they felt was like one day and it was done, and they wanted to have it more ongoing and sustainable, and I think that we accomplished that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2442.812s">So</a>  on the 13th, we're going to use half of the day to bring closure <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2448.589s">to</a>  whatever theme the teacher had selected for this particular school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2454.273s">So</a>  teachers will be with their groups, working on whatever they were working on throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2459.596s">And</a>  then the second half of the day, we're going to have teachers going back to buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2465.08s">And</a>  in most cases, the principals are going to lead them in test prep, because we have the English MCAS, the new test, MCAS 2.0, coming up in April, and the mathematics in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2478.536s">So</a>  this gives us an opportunity to go over those exams with the teachers more fully, not that we haven't been doing practice tests all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2487.318s">But</a>  also, as you know, we have the online requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2490.899s">So</a>  all fourth graders, eighth graders, and the entire Andrews School, sixth, seventh, and eighth, are going to be taking the test online. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2499.0s">So</a>  there's a certain amount of additional prep for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2502.741s">So</a>  that's kind of our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2503.981s">We</a>  have a lot of other little things going on that we've been <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2507.645s">working</a>  on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2508.485s">Diana,</a>  I don't know if you want to speak to anything else.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2512.066s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2512.466s">One</a>  of the things that the teachers really wanted was choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2515.906s">And</a>  so when we were going through the survey with the Professional Development Committee, there were the three topics that Beverly mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2524.568s">And</a>  at the elementary level, we had almost 100 teachers who really wanted to work the at-risk group, which is a considerable, significant amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2534.049s">But</a>  we made it work. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2535.13s">We</a>  had administrators who stepped up to the plate <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2537.835s">to</a>  work with our teacher presenters. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2541.317s">The</a>  second half of the day, our grades 3, 4, and 5 will be working on the MCAS 2.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2547.28s">But</a>  I'm very excited to talk about what the K1 and 2 will be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2550.302s">As</a>  you know, they're not the test grades, but we still wanted to have professional development for them that was worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2557.905s">So</a>  you'll be happy to know we have Rocco Sieri doing science with our K1 and 2 teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2564.289s">Dr.</a>  Bernadette Rigodelli is here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2566.897s">She's</a>  going to be working on some social studies with our K1 and 2 teachers in a round-robin format. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2573.2s">And</a>  we're also going to do a workshop on what to not to do in IEP meetings from a general education standpoint and just in general time constraints so you don't walk in with a cup of coffee and plop it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2589.506s">and</a>  chitchat with your neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2590.807s">So</a>  Mrs. Medaglio's daughter actually found this wonderful video on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2596.81s">And</a>  Cheryl Maiocco and one of our teachers, Mariana Stewart, will be facilitating that workshop. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2603.713s">So</a>  we're very excited about what we're doing in professional development on March 13th.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2609.676s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2611.317s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2611.537s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2612.938s">I</a>  wanted to just mention, I got to attend part of the session on the November <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2619.472s">professional</a>  development day and the presenters were excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2625.295s">I</a>  watched a very moving video and I sat in a group with some other teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2630.678s">We</a>  discussed strategies, techniques, and we broke up into groups and then everybody got to share their ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2638.102s">It</a>  was really educational and it was a good day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2641.624s">I</a>  had a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2642.445s">I</a>  wish you guys the best of luck on Monday.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2646.713s">The</a>  teachers have been incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2648.273s">It</a>  shows you what, you give someone some ownership of something, how they can run with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2653.056s">And</a>  they've had some administrative support, but that was just initially. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2657.518s">But</a>  once they got going, it was pretty much on their own, and they have been wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2663.0s">And</a>  I hope, our plan is to try to do a similar type of PD next year, too, because this worked very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2670.324s">We're</a>  waiting to see our evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2671.764s">We're</a>  going to have evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2673.794s">One</a>  of the questions on the evaluations, and this is really important for us, what did you learn this year in your PD that you can basically take back and implement in your classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2683.561s">Because</a>  that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2684.781s">It's</a>  about learning good things, but also about implementing what you're learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2689.585s">So</a>  we're going to get that feedback from the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2691.846s">Also,</a>  what would they like to learn more about related to the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2696.369s">And</a>  again, we'll plan accordingly for next year based on what we get from them in the evaluations.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2702.802s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2703.002s">Mustone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2703.602s">Yes,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2705.403s">For</a>  the MCAS 2.0, all students in grades four. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2708.125s">So</a>  all four elementary school kids will be doing it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2711.707s">And</a>  in grade eight, both the Andrews and the McGlynn, and everything's set to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2715.949s">All</a>  the computers are up and ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2717.23s">Oh,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2717.89s">We've</a>  been working on that.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2719.371s">We're</a>  making sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2720.211s">That's</a>  good to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2721.392s">The</a>  other thing, could you send us the video that you found about the IEP that you're showing?</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2726.215s">I</a>  can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2727.295s">Would</a>  you mind waiting until after we show it?</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2729.356s">That'd</a>  be great.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2729.897s">On</a>  March 13th?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2730.657s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2730.977s">But</a>  I'd be happy to do it.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2732.078s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2732.772s">I</a>  want to see it too.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2735.354s">There's</a>  a motion to accept the report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2739.077s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2741.619s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2743.04s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2743.901s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2746.663s">Pre-budget</a>  report guidance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2749.065s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2750.567s">So</a>  we begin the process now of looking at pre-budget reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2753.889s">Tonight</a>  starts and we'll turn it over to our deputy superintendent to introduce this first report.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2760.46s">It's</a>  that time of year, pre-budget reports are starting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2764.742s">We</a>  will be scheduling them as we move forward with our meetings from this point on. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2771.085s">And</a>  our guidance director, Amelia Jensen, has been the brave soul to come forward for the first one tonight, but she always does a spectacular job. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2779.769s">So</a>  we want to start with a star. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2781.57s">So</a>  Amelia.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2784.983s">Good</a>  evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2788.887s">Tonight</a>  you have all received the pre-budget report for the guidance department, but I'm going to give you a brief overview of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2796.897s">So</a>  I won't go through all of it, but I'll just highlight some important points. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2801.321s">An</a>  overview of our department, this year our department consists of ten guidance Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2805.303s">We</a>  have five at the high school, one at the vocational technical high school, and two at each middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2811.685s">The</a>  mission of the guidance department is to ensure that all students thrive in the three areas of academic development, college and career preparation, and social emotional wellness. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2821.669s">And</a>  that's really where our curriculum is focused. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2825.31s">To</a>  deliver this curriculum, the middle school Councilors teach guidance classes, and at the high school, Councilors meet students in guidance seminars, which is through our advisory program, as well as individual meetings and large group pull-outs from classes and small groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2841.29s">So</a>  this last year, the school year 2016-2017, we spent all of our funding on office supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2848.192s">We</a>  spent our money in our contractual services account for subscriptions and memberships. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2854.074s">In</a>  addition to professional development in regards to English language learners and vocational technical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2861.737s">Books</a>  were also purchased to support staff who are working with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2866.052s">And</a>  the PSAT subsidy was used to pay for all juniors to take the PSAT free of charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2871.598s">That</a>  was a huge success and I want to thank you all for providing that funding last year and this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2879.187s">And</a>  for major accomplishments, I wanted to highlight a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2882.41s">The</a>  first is that we have a new program through the guidance department called NPower. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2886.873s">And</a>  this is a guidance-initiated program that was established not this year but last year to really support students who are at risk for not graduating and those who had no plans for post-secondary education. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2899.902s">This</a>  program focuses on four areas of purpose, finding purpose, identity development, creating goals, and finding support and resources within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2911.229s">And</a>  what we found with this program is that students who are enrolled in this program, or I mean participating in this program, actually have increased their GPA, are twice as likely to <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2921.315s">sorry,</a>  increase their GPA at twice the rate of students not in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2925.417s">So</a>  we're finding great success with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2927.098s">This</a>  is currently being implemented with our seniors, and it has got the attention of researchers at BC and Harvard, and so they are actually working with us this year to study the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2938.284s">We're</a>  hoping to continue this program next year with our senior students and possibly looking to expand it with our freshman and sophomore students, hopefully in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2949.75s">The</a>  department was also successfully trained in using school brains and implementing it in the scheduling and registration process. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2957.637s">This</a>  was huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2958.237s">We</a>  went through hours and hours of training, and we feel that it was very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2962.481s">And</a>  we're looking forward to a successful registration season this year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2968.715s">We</a>  also increased our partnerships and programs that improve post-secondary outcomes for our at-risk students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2974.644s">And</a>  these are really programs that help bridge the transition from high school to beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2979.552s">These</a>  are programs that provide more meaning for students and are more supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2984.55s">And</a>  finally, we had a successful C3 day in college fair in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2988.412s">So</a>  this was really a two week span when all juniors were able to take the PSATs, all seniors were able to engage in college, career, or community service activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3000.0s">This</a>  is really a time when our seniors can leave campus and they can go and do college visits, they can do job shadows, and they can also get their community service requirement done. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3010.266s">And</a>  then within that two-week span, we also had over 500 students attend the college fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3014.832s">So</a>  that is a quick overview of some of our accomplishments for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3019.337s">So</a>  hopefully I didn't go over that too quickly, but I'd like to see if any of you have any questions.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3028.084s">Could</a>  you tell us what the Welcome Project is for me?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3030.946s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3031.106s">So</a>  the Welcome Project is a program through Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3035.489s">And</a>  there's actually a lot of mini programs within that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3038.931s">And</a>  one of the programs that we have used is called LIPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3042.753s">And</a>  I'm sorry, I can't remember the acronym at this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3045.175s">But</a>  it's a program that comes in and it trains our students who speak English and another language to be interpreters. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3051.859s">So</a>  a lot of our ELL students took advantage of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3054.381s">They</a>  were trained in being an interpreter. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3055.982s">And</a>  then they were set up with a job.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3057.803s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3059.624s">Also,</a>  if I can follow up, I was wondering if you're seeing students who are concerned about their family's immigration status, if that's causing any angst?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3068.367s">We</a>  are seeing a few of those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3072.482s">But</a>  for the most part, our ELL department has been working closely with the guidance department in helping to support those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3080.847s">We've</a>  been able to provide them resources and just information on their rights as students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3089.491s">But</a>  yeah, it's difficult this year.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3093.313s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3096.755s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3098.456s">Through</a>  you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3099.977s">Jensen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3100.923s">I</a>  noticed that you have asked for an increase in counseling staff for social-emotional needs in the elementary grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3107.989s">How</a>  is it working out this year?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3110.451s">Oh,</a>  you mean last year?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3113.993s">Do</a>  you have enough staff to meet the needs of the elementary children that may need help or counseling or just a shoulder to lean on? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3122.62s">Can</a>  we approve the program?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3124.742s">We</a>  currently do not have any guidance Councilors in the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3129.186s">But</a>  we do have school adjustment Councilors and school psychologists. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3132.468s">And</a>  at this current moment, I believe they are meeting the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3135.91s">But</a>  I would have to defer that to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3137.251s">Medaglio</a>  because I believe she might be talking about those services.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3141.153s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3141.473s">Could</a>  you put together a small report and send it back to us, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3144.735s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3145.356s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3145.456s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3149.098s">Mrs.</a>  DiBenedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3149.778s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3151.839s">So</a>  you talked a little bit about school brains and how everybody was trained on school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3156.756s">And</a>  my question isn't directed at you, it's really to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3161.46s">I</a>  got a note from a parent in the last few weeks about teachers not putting the grades of students into the system so that they could see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3173.069s">So</a>  I directed the parent directly to Dr. Perala, who was handling that one situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3179.23s">But</a>  overall, could you please check to make sure that throughout the district and provide us with a report as to whether everybody is up and running and posting homework and grades on School Brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3191.696s">And</a>  if not, a timeline for everybody to be up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3195.517s">I</a>  know we talked about this previously, but I'd like to know if there are any teachers in the district that are struggling that you need to help along this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3203.861s">And</a>  if so, how many there are and where they're located. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3206.81s">So</a>  I'm requesting a report, um, make it a motion for a report at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3210.692s">I</a>  need a second.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3211.752s">So</a>  we had a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3213.733s">God,</a>  I take the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3215.614s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3216.215s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3216.575s">So</a>  first, Mr. Benedetto second by Mr. Um, scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3220.477s">Uh,</a>  all in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3221.237s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3222.297s">All</a>  opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3224.078s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3224.779s">So</a>  we had a meeting today on a number of issues, including certain elements of technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3230.121s">And</a>  this came up and the feeling was, is that the teachers are making, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3233.945s">Very,</a>  very good progress in most instances using school brains to report out. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3239.149s">Nothing</a>  is 100%, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3241.21s">But</a>  I'll try to get a better, more definitive report for you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3244.893s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3245.734s">I</a>  just want to follow up with, if one parent calls and there's other parents that are feeling the same way, it just haven't made that call. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3256.84s">I</a>  just want to thank you and your department. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3264.003s">I</a>  know you run a lot of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3265.584s">I</a>  know your staff has increased in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3269.346s">It</a>  sounds like there's more and more programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3271.707s">How</a>  are you handling the merger of students with the vocational side as well as the high school side and children going back and forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3282.262s">Are</a>  we sharing some of those students or how are we looking at that?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3285.504s">Yes,</a>  so that's a very good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3287.946s">Moving</a>  forward, so starting next year, we are looking at completely integrating the students with all the Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3294.27s">Up</a>  until now, students who have identified that they are attending the vocational school <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3299.677s">have</a>  been placed with the vocational school Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3303.538s">But</a>  the vocational school Councilor and the high school Councilors meet weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3307.679s">They</a>  collaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3308.419s">The</a>  high school Councilors are very much informed and trained in vocational education. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3313.841s">And</a>  the vocational school Councilor has also been working <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3318.043s">on</a>  college applications and doing everything that a high school Councilor does. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3321.585s">So</a>  I think that they're very prepared for this merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3325.227s">And</a>  so next year, that's what we're looking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3326.928s">With</a>  the incoming ninth graders, it will be divided evenly among the Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3331.71s">It</a>  still has to get final approval, though.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3334.371s">So</a>  at a high school level, including the Curtis-Thompson, the vocational school, and the high school, how many students does each guidance Councilor counsel?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3348.175s">I'd</a>  have to get you an exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3349.596s">I</a>  don't have an exact number, but roughly about 300.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3352.718s">So</a>  each guidance Councilor is managing 300 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3356.601s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3357.942s">That's</a>  a lot.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3359.223s">I</a>  mean, obviously at the Curtis Tufts, it's a smaller caseload, but on average, 300.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3367.61s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3368.33s">That's</a>  good to know for future staffing levels, if there are increases or different needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3375.816s">What</a>  about... <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3378.391s">ESL</a>  students, do they have a specific guidance Councilor that might help them in a different way, or does the ESL teacher step in at that point? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3387.678s">How</a>  is that managed?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3389.039s">So</a>  our EL students do not have a specific guidance Councilor that would be an EL Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3395.163s">However,</a>  they have specific support courses that we try and put them in, where one is actually called college and career preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3406.748s">And</a>  so I believe it's called College and Career Preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3409.491s">I</a>  can get you the exact name of the course. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3411.152s">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3412.213s">And</a>  they also have summer programs that are available to these students as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3416.077s">So</a>  we do do extra outreach for these students, but they don't have a specific Councilor for EL. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3422.503s">They</a>  do have their Councilor, though.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3425.733s">And</a>  they help them through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3427.435s">Correct,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3428.495s">And</a>  we did some training this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3431.177s">We</a>  actually did two trainings in working with the EL population. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3435.359s">Just</a>  providing our Councilors resources to use for these students, background on different laws and legal regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3443.324s">So</a>  they are very knowledgeable in it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3445.608s">And</a>  my final question is about the PSATs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3449.832s">Now</a>  that you've taken it two years, are you seeing an increase in scores on SATs because all students have taken that prep?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3457.338s">Yes,</a>  thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3458.559s">We</a>  are seeing an increase in scores of about 100 points. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3462.242s">on</a>  average, so that's huge.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3464.224s">Significant.</a> </p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3465.085s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3465.925s">And</a>  we're also seeing students signing up for the SATs sooner than they had in previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3471.23s">So</a>  the average student would sign up for the SATs either June of their junior year or October of their senior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3479.496s">And</a>  now students are signing up in January and March of their junior year, which leads them to also end up taking an additional test and get higher scores.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3488.704s">Well</a>  worth the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3489.625s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3489.965s">It's</a>  good to hear that.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3492.673s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3492.873s">Mustone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3495.215s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3496.336s">The</a>  last bullet where it says middle school guidance assisted in the implementation of the umbrella project. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3502.123s">I've</a>  not heard anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3503.784s">What</a>  is the Umbrella Project's role at the middle school?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3507.045s">So</a>  the Umbrella Project is a program that is happening at the McGlynn Middle School, and it's being led by the guidance department and Ian Charles, the assistant principal there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3518.051s">And</a>  it's really a support program to help identify students who are at risk, whether that's social, emotional, or behavioral, and putting them on plans that help support them throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3529.536s">So</a>  kind of doing an early intervention with those students.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3532.107s">Do</a>  you know how many kids are enrolled in the Umbrella Project?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3534.79s">I</a>  don't know how many are currently, but I know that last year there were about 25 that completed the program.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3540.337s">Okay,</a>  and are there plans for it to go to the Andrews?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3543.981s">I'm</a>  not sure about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3545.002s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3546.103s">I</a>  know when Ian Charles came in, he was a driving force with this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3553.686s">And</a>  the Councilors jumped on board and really did all of the support work for it because they provided the extra space for the students to do the work, to do their homework, to be pulled from their exploratory courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3567.324s">So</a>  I'm not sure if it's going to be going to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3569.327s">I</a>  haven't heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3571.597s">We</a>  could look into that, though, because I know that there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3573.578s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3574.059s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3575.42s">The</a>  question is whether or not it could be moved to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3578.782s">To</a>  the Andrews.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3579.662s">Well,</a>  I think any program can be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3581.844s">And</a>  really, principals have to weigh in as to whether they believe it would be effective for them or whether they want to do something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3588.308s">So</a>  the Andrews uses things like Study Island and other things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3591.551s">So</a>  we want to give principals some degree of autonomy to make decisions that they believe are in the best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3598.62s">It</a>  could very well be that they adopt something from another school that they believe would work for them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3603.908s">So</a>  we'll check into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3604.709s">We'll</a>  get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3605.49s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3607.593s">I'll</a>  set me up.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3608.655s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3608.855s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3609.216s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3610.297s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3610.938s">I</a>  made it through you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3613.422s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3613.889s">included</a>  in this report was the fact that they have one computer that's not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3618.411s">I</a>  was wondering if we could get in touch with Mr. Trotter, see if we can get that replaced and also try to get a new computer for the secretary sooner rather than later to help the office run efficiently.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3630.697s">Let</a>  me check on it to make sure that I understand what really isn't working or what is slower than might be desired or <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3639.158s">you</a>  know, an upgrade or whatever the case may be, but we'll certainly give you a report back.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3642.741s">Okay,</a>  because I think we owe it to our staff to make sure that they have equipment that works every day, every time that they want to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3650.326s">And</a>  it benefits not only the guidance department, but the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3654.969s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3656.41s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3657.791s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3657.991s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3658.732s">Oh,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3659.472s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3659.873s">Jensen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3661.874s">The</a>  report was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3664.176s">I</a>  wanted to mention one of the goals for this upcoming year, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3667.818s">which</a>  is the online program to assist students' graduation rate, offering enrichment courses and the alternate programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3676.682s">I</a>  wanted to know, now, the information, I think it might be out now, is it online? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3682.425s">Like,</a>  do the students, was a message sent out so the students know and they can take advantage of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3688.988s">Or</a>  is it more of the guidance department might approach a student or parent and <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3694.346s">let</a>  them know they think they might be a good fit for something like that?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3697.688s">So</a>  currently right now the district is piloting the Ingenuity Play-Doh program. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3702.772s">And</a>  so we're using it with our juniors and seniors, not yet with our freshmen and sophomores. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3711.137s">any</a>  student who is looking to make up a course, whether that's going to be in summer school or in the past they had come to the guidance office and asked to make up a course and we had referred them to Somerville online school or we had referred them to BYU online school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3725.552s">Now</a>  we will be referring them obviously to our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3728.927s">They</a>  can be taking this course with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3731.709s">So</a>  we haven't yet, this isn't something that we have put out to the public yet, but when students come to us or when the guidance Councilors approach the students about needing a credit recovery course, this is the option that's given to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3744.419s">And</a>  we're looking to also expand this program for students to take quarterly enrichment courses, so not just credit recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3752.646s">So</a>  that's something that we're continuing to grow this year.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3755.929s">Is</a>  there a cost associated with it?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3758.066s">The</a>  cost is $125 for the course, which is cheaper than the other online options that they were given in the past.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3769.916s">And</a>  how long is the course? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3771.137s">Is</a>  it a six-week course? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3773.819s">Is</a>  it a three-week course? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3775.6s">I</a>  was just a little curious.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3776.941s">So</a>  the courses are self-paced. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3778.443s">The</a>  students can finish them as quickly as they would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3782.11s">and</a>  it is all dependent on the course. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3784.432s">I</a>  know over summer school, Mr. Ciari had used this online program, I believe, for biology. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3794.479s">I</a>  think it was biology. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3795.76s">And</a>  he had gone into the biology course. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3799.142s">And</a>  the great thing about this program is that the teachers can go in, and they can look at the standards that the course is teaching, and they can take them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3806.926s">They</a>  can put in their own standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3808.127s">So</a>  they can really modify the course for what they believe the need is for the student or for the class that's being offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3814.73s">And</a>  so this summer, that course was offered for six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3817.834s">But</a>  the benefit of it is that if students didn't finish within the six weeks, they had until the end of the summer to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3822.778s">So</a>  we're looking at that moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3825.62s">I</a>  know Dr. Pella and the central administration has been working with the directors to have them go through and look at some of these courses and modify some of these courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3834.867s">They</a>  were just trained, I believe it was in January.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3839.563s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3840.003s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3840.464s">Sounds</a>  exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3841.124s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3841.504s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3842.785s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3842.965s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3843.906s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3844.966s">And</a>  thank you Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3846.027s">Jensen</a>  for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3847.828s">It</a>  is very particular and a lot of details. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3852.752s">I'm</a>  looking at the Coffee with the Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3855.113s">How</a>  did you promote that? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3856.554s">Was</a>  it just by being online or was there a robocall made out to parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3861.697s">What</a>  time was it scheduled and is it individual?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3864.798s">The</a>  Coffee with the Councilors is something that we're doing this year based on <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3872.943s">parent</a>  requests from previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3874.544s">They</a>  said there are so many night events, there are so many games or sporting events that they had to go to, that they really would like a time to come to the school during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3881.63s">And</a>  we realized that this isn't necessarily ideal for all parents, but we wanted to provide this opportunity for some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3887.296s">So</a>  we're doing this quarterly, and each quarter there's a different topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3892.6s">The</a>  Councilors are giving a mini-presentation, about 15 minutes, going over some current information. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3898.842s">And</a>  then it's also a time for the Councilors to break out into groups with their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3902.983s">And</a>  the parents can talk to one another, they can talk to the Councilors, they can get grade-specific information. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3907.704s">So,</a>  so far it's been pretty popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3910.185s">We've</a>  had a good turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3911.505s">And</a>  the way that we've advertised it is through the blog, through Lisa Evangelista posting, the website, and then we've also done a robocall home.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3920.028s">That</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3922.21s">The</a>  other thing I was going to ask is, it says you've connected over 75% of at-risk seniors, which means it's 2.5 GPA or lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3931.916s">So</a>  I don't want people thinking that it's a 1.5 or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3938.881s">But</a>  I'm just wondering, how did you connect and what is the plan?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3944.305s">So</a>  we've really utilized our Councilor who's in charge of school and community partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3951.629s">And</a>  what he does is he really looks at programs that have a proven successful track record and ones that will meet the most needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3963.016s">And</a>  he's been able to bring in a lot of outside programs, which are some of them that I've listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3967.339s">During</a>  the day, there will be many assemblies or many meetings, whether it's during lunch or during a class, where these students can come down and learn about these programs and sign up for them.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3977.146s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3978.707s">And</a>  I see that you've had the second C3 day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3981.389s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3981.869s">And</a>  how did that go? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3982.71s">Did</a>  you have students that really took advantage of going off to different colleges or did they stay?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3988.975s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3989.215s">So</a>  the majority of our students ended up going and visiting a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3992.918s">So</a>  in order to get the excused absence, they have to bring proof back that they <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3996.54s">did</a>  one of those activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3999.082s">And</a>  the majority of them do visit a college. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4001.924s">But</a>  we did have some students who did other activities as well, like a job shadow. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4006.148s">Some</a>  of them did community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4008.61s">And</a>  then we also had an admissions officer from Tufts come to campus and give an essay writing workshop.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4017.332s">I</a>  know that my colleague asked, the councillors at the high school have about 300 students a piece, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4022.734s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4023.874s">And</a>  we are still doing it that it's not, we're doing it in alphabetical order so that way not everyone has, there's no longer a class of 300 of seniors.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4033.997s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4034.918s">Okay,</a>  and so with that being said, how many seniors does each councillor have, do you know?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4040.96s">Depending</a>  on the year, anywhere between 60 to 90.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4046.6s">60</a>  to 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4049.123s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4049.924s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor to receive and place this report on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4056.212s">So</a>  moved by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4058.355s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4059.136s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4059.917s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4060.537s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4061.479s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4064.536s">Also,</a>  I'm sorry, can I mention one more thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4066.898s">We</a>  did have our 8th grade course selection night last week, so this is something separate other than the guidance board. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4073.724s">And</a>  this was last Tuesday, it was the 8th grade course selection night. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4077.167s">All</a>  of the 8th graders came to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4079.228s">We</a>  had a huge turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4080.97s">The</a>  entire Caron Theater was filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4082.731s">Parents</a>  got to listen to Dr. Prella and Dr. Riccio give presentations on <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4091.114s">the</a>  integrating of the two schools and where are schools going in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4094.537s">They</a>  also got to hear about the registration and scheduling process of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4100.001s">And</a>  I wanted to let you know that we received very positive feedback from parents on the integration of the two schools and the additional opportunities that this is going to be affording students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4109.909s">So</a>  they really like to hear that students could graduate <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4114.072s">with</a>  a certificate program from the vocational school, that they could also graduate with dual enrollment credits, and those same students could graduate with AP credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4122.995s">So</a>  they were very, very excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4125.335s">They</a>  also liked the simplicity in the scheduling process that we're pushing for for this year, which includes a limited option of electives for freshmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4134.278s">So</a>  our freshmen are going to be offered the CTE Exploratory, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4138.499s">an</a>  art course or a music course, which will be band, orchestra, or chorus, and we're limiting that for freshmen because we really feel that in order to explore and in order to have a freshman year that is not as overwhelming, it would be better to limit those courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4155.007s">So</a>  we're hoping for a big turnout in the CTE Exploratory, which would allow students to explore 20 different careers.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4162.101s">Very</a>  good, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4163.582s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4163.762s">Cuno,</a>  follow-up? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4165.264s">Yes,</a>  please, a follow-up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4166.825s">So</a>  if we're going to limit our freshmen, then what happens with our other classes as far as the electives? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4174.391s">Are</a>  they still going to have a good amount of students in them, or are we going to have electives that we only have a couple of students in them?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4181.157s">Well,</a>  we will be having, so all the freshmen will be in some sort of elective, whether it's music, art, or a CT exploratory. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4188.503s">And</a>  then the other electives, we are assuming that a few, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4191.642s">Fewer</a>  students will be in them, but we're still offering all of our electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4196.486s">We're</a>  just going to be offering them alternating years, some of them on alternating years. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4202.171s">And</a>  then when we ran the numbers, it doesn't look like the classes will be 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4206.735s">They</a>  will be more like 20 instead of 25, 26, 27.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4210.639s">How</a>  many electives do we have in all?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4213.061s">I</a>  think almost 70.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4215.323s">And</a>  how many are we going to limit to the freshmen? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4218.065s">Is</a>  it 20?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4219.074s">So</a>  the freshmen have a choice of five different electives, but if they take the CTE Exploratory, they explore 20 different career technical programs.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4228.14s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4229.361s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4230.882s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4231.062s">Van</a>  der Klooten. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4232.403s">I'm</a>  not quite sure what you said in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4234.585s">So</a>  a freshman can't take art and band together?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4243.028s">So</a>  in past years, they've never been able to take ART and BAND together because ART is four credits and BAND is four credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4248.351s">They</a>  would have to choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4249.491s">So</a>  that's pretty much the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4251.652s">The</a>  only thing that's changing is we have a lot of mini courses, a lot of two-credit courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4257.635s">So</a>  when freshmen came in, if they took a two-credit course, they'd have to take two of the two-credit courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4262.777s">And</a>  it was just a lot of courses for them to balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4265.339s">So</a>  we've really limited the courses that we're offering to the freshmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4268.38s">And</a>  each one of them is going to be four credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4270.721s">So</a>  they won't be bouncing around from elective to elective to elective their freshman year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4274.563s">They'll</a>  have one elective. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4279.146s">But</a>  they still have all of those opportunities for them sophomore, junior and senior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4287.09s">So</a>  it didn't close off on any pathways for students.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4291.313s">So</a>  is that for the whole school year, they would just have one elective?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4295.575s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4297.016s">So</a>  if they wanted to take <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4298.747s">So</a>  if one of the electives was guitar, they would take guitar for the whole school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4303.29s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4303.69s">And</a>  that's how all of our courses right now and all of our electives do run for the full year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4307.952s">It's</a>  just they would meet two times over a six-day cycle instead of four times over a six-day cycle.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4314.896s">And</a>  the pro of this is? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4316.077s">I</a>  mean, the advantage?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4317.998s">The</a>  advantage of this is that students are not balancing eight and nine courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4321.84s">They're</a>  only balancing six to seven courses.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4326.122s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4326.482s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4328.289s">The</a>  opposite of that is I got into an elective and I don't really like that one, but I love the other one I'm taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4336.78s">So</a>  there's pros and cons.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4337.881s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4339.261s">Many</a>  of the other electives were very academic heavy, which was very overwhelming for freshmen who were getting used to the high school setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4347.366s">So</a>  we really wanted to find something that got them more hands-on experience, something that was a little bit of a break from the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4353.989s">And</a>  the CTE Exploratory class gave that to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4357.311s">And</a>  they also rotate through 20 different technical programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4360.812s">So</a>  if they don't like their current technical program, they wait a week and they get to change.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4366.562s">Um,</a>  will they get graded in that CTE exploration?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4371.883s">Yes,</a>  they're all graded. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4372.703s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4374.743s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4376.184s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4376.964s">Um,</a>  I remember when my children were picking and when they loved art and music and they couldn't do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4386.806s">And</a>  at that point they had to decide whether to do each. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4391.066s">My</a>  concern is that with the opportunity to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4395.877s">so</a>  many different shops that they could take, that it could hurt our band and our orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4405.439s">So</a>  we just wanna be careful of that and make sure, I know personally that the evening orchestra would still accept students if they were taking band during the day and vice versa, but I'm not sure <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4423.015s">how</a>  that's going to affect those groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4424.997s">So</a>  could we be careful and mindful of that when sign-ups come?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4430.401s">We're</a>  also allowing students to take CTE Exploratory their sophomore year if for some reason they missed it their freshman year and would like to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4440.208s">So</a>  that would open up the possibility for students who want to stay in music all four years.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4444.912s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4445.072s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4446.553s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4447.093s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4448.473s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4450.174s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4450.395s">Cuno.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4450.715s">How</a>  does the technical side work into this schedule as far as when you have students coming in their freshman year, they have that opportunity to go over to the technical side to explore? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4464.767s">So</a>  how do you work that into the CTE?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4466.268s">I'm</a>  sorry, I don't quite understand the question.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4469.991s">So</a>  you know how students are going to have their choice of taking an elective?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4473.594s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4474.054s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4474.855s">But</a>  we're also giving them the opportunity to go over <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4477.464s">to</a>  the technical side and maybe explore over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4480.827s">So</a>  is that incorporated into those 20 or the five that you mentioned?</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4485.89s">So</a>  the entire freshman class is not divided by vocational school, high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4490.834s">It's</a>  going to be one group of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4494.376s">And</a>  no matter which, if a student has the plan of eventually going into the vocational school, they can take the CTE exploratory. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4502.682s">If</a>  they don't have any plans to go into the vocational school or they don't have an interest in that, they can take some of the other electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4508.886s">But</a>  even if they don't take the vocational exploratory, which is the 20 rotating programs, even if they don't take that, they can still opt to apply for the vocational school the 10th grade year.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4518.621s">All</a>  right, that's what I needed the clarification on, because I think that's the confusing part of there's so many balls being juggled. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4525.084s">I</a>  didn't think we were going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4527.865s">So</a>  this is now at least a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4530.786s">And</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4533.127s">I</a>  won't do any more follow-ups. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4534.187s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4534.747s">Jensen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4535.008s">We</a>  appreciate your being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4537.168s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4538.049s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4539.429s">You</a>  voted on that, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4540.77s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4540.89s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4541.01s">Vanderbilt,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4542.991s">Report</a>  on transgender student rights, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4546.8s">Mayor,</a>  members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4549.882s">You</a>  know, on February 22nd, 2017, the federal government, using an executive order from the president, rescinded guidance and determined that Title IX's prohibition on gender identity discrimination was null and void. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4567.332s">The</a>  president took the position that the protection of transgender rights should be left to each state. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4575.649s">Massachusetts</a>  law already protects the rights of transgender students in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4581.333s">Chapter</a>  199 of the Acts of 2011 went into effect in July 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4586.316s">The</a>  Medford School Committee approved a local policy affirming the Massachusetts law on April 11, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4594.342s">We</a>  had taken a previous position on the 13th in 2013, but we updated in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4597.624s">In</a>  your packet, you have information from <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4605.957s">Mike</a>  Long, who is the legal counsel to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4610.698s">You</a>  have guidance from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4615.099s">You</a>  have your own policy, the Medford Public Schools Policy, that was adopted in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4620.8s">You</a>  have some guidance from the MTA, the Largest Teachers Union, and you have a copy of the bills that were enacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4629.522s">Clearly,</a>  in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4633.237s">And</a>  clearly, throughout Massachusetts, transgender rights are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4640.363s">Sometimes</a>  federal laws supersede, but not in this instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4645.407s">Because</a>  in this instance, the executive order said, let the states decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4652.253s">In</a>  this instance, the state has decided, and we have an active plan in place <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4657.709s">And</a>  at this point, we have really no problems with what we've done and what we're doing in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4664.335s">So</a>  I want to bring you up to date on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4667.418s">I</a>  would like to, if I can, Mayor, also comment on the immigration rules, because I believe that's also tied to equal access to education, which is part of the same vein of thinking as the transgender rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4685.188s">I've</a>  given you an advisory from Mara Healy, the Massachusetts Attorney General, on equal access to public education for all students, irrespective of immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4699.516s">In</a>  Massachusetts, the Supreme Court of the United States recognized Brown versus Board of Education, and it is true today as it was back in 1953. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4714.268s">The</a>  advisory that the Attorney General has provided you is very, very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4719.972s">There</a>  has been a case in Massachusetts, Filer v. Doe, in 1982, where the Supreme Court held that public elementary and secondary schools may not deny any child residing in the applicable jurisdiction access to public education, whether the child is present in the country legally or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4742.854s">Filer</a>  made it clear that a child's immigration or citizenship status, or that his or her parents are guarding, is not relevant to the child's right to a public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4754.622s">So,</a>  irrespective of any rulings that come down, Massachusetts law, states rights, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4763.552s">made</a>  the decision that we will accept anyone who resides in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4768.677s">We</a>  will not ask them what their status is, visa or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4772.9s">We</a>  will not pursue anything other than the fact they are not living in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4778.105s">If</a>  they're not living in the community, it's a residence issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4781.548s">But</a>  if they're living in the community, whether they're living with their parents or they're residing with some other responsible adult, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4788.51s">we</a>  will provide them free and public access to our educational system. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4793.913s">So</a>  I want to clarify that I am not allowed to ask what a person's visa status is. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4799.636s">I'm</a>  not allowed to ask what their immigrant status is. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4802.457s">I'm</a>  not allowed to ask for some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4805.919s">And</a>  in fact, in some instances, there are people that are homeless, and I might have to accept that just simply based on homelessness. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4813.476s">We</a>  just had a webinar today on homelessness that dealt with foster children. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4817.698s">More</a>  guidance is coming out on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4820.099s">So</a>  I want to make it clear that we're an equal opportunity school system, whether it's transgender or immigrant status. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4827.963s">If</a>  a youngster resides in our community, they're entitled to free access to our public education system, and that's the way we will treat them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4837.128s">Happy</a>  to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4839.189s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4843.586s">Motion</a>  to receive the report place it on file seconded by mr.. Kreatz all those in favor All those opposed both reports are placed on file Report on compliance with state defibrillation law so effective July 1 2018 all schools must have automated External defibrillators on-site the good news is we have them in every one of our schools and</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4871.175s">An</a>  automated defibrillator, or an AED, is a medical device that will analyze heart rhythms and can deliver electric shocks to help a heart reestablish an effective rhythm during a sudden cardiac arrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4885.748s">The</a>  American Red Cross recommends that AEDs be readily available and applied within four minutes of cardiac arrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4893.475s">Now,</a>  under this law, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4895.505s">We</a>  have to have trained people on staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4897.306s">We</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4897.966s">We</a>  have nurses, we've trained our coaches, and we'll train even more people to use these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4905.009s">Tonight,</a>  we will have a moment of silence from somebody who could have used one. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4912.592s">Obviously,</a>  this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4915.554s">It's</a>  good to know that we're ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4917.756s">We</a>  have them in every school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4919.498s">We'll</a>  review them to see whether or not we should be adding. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4923.301s">We</a>  have had good fortune working with our ambulance providers and others who have donated equipment to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4929.986s">They</a>  get checked every day for battery effectiveness, and we have to keep that up because you never know when the equipment's there, but the battery doesn't operate, so you have to check this on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4941.962s">And</a>  we have to continuously train people. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4944.205s">So</a>  I want to make sure you're aware that we're in compliance with this law well in advance of its implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4949.633s">But</a>  there's obviously more work that we will do to make this a more efficient and effective system for utilization should it be necessary.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4957.925s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4959.422s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto and then Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4960.603s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4961.985s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4962.865s">So</a>  I have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4965.168s">I</a>  really believe that these should be up at near our fields and somehow some way so people don't have to run back and try to get into the building to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4973.676s">I</a>  don't know how, what an appropriate trainer will bring them to the field.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4976.759s">It</a>  will be brought by coaches and trainers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4979.041s">We'll</a>  have them available on the fields.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4981.103s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4981.729s">And</a>  also a list near every defibrillator, who is trained, like a list of people trained to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4989.032s">So</a>  that way, if it's a need, they know who to immediately go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4993.353s">Because</a>  we, and I also would like a list of all school employees, of who has been trained, how many people, where they are located, where they're working. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5006.538s">This</a>  is an important thing that could save people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5009.46s">And</a>  I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5011.055s">We</a>  need more information than what's provided.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5013.796s">I</a>  think it's important to recognize that I don't want people who are afraid to use this thing to use it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5019.138s">Right,</a>  well then we need a list.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5020.019s">I</a>  want people only who are comfortable using it to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5023.22s">There</a>  are some people who... Who are certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5025.001s">Yeah,</a>  and certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5025.821s">You</a>  know, there are some people who would be very uncomfortable taking this device off the wall and using it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5030.343s">So</a>  I'm making a motion right now, Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5032.144s">Every</a>  building will have people, and we can provide you with a list of who's trying to use it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5036.466s">I'm</a>  making a motion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5040.239s">hopefully</a>  second by one of my colleagues, to have a list of all people certified and trained in using this and having it posted next to the defibrillators. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5050.302s">So</a>  when an emergency happens, they have the defibrillator and they're like, okay, who knows how to use this? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5055.604s">There's</a>  a list of people right then and there and they say, oh, he's on the other side of the field, go get Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5061.786s">And</a>  you're not going to the wrong direction to get somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5065.375s">So</a>  I think it's imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5066.976s">So</a>  I've made the motion, seconded by my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5071.498s">Roll</a>  call vote, please.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5072.339s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5073.719s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5073.899s">Van</a>  der Kloot, still speaking on this topic?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5075.82s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to make sure that we have enough people in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5079.862s">I</a>  know you're saying you're working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5082.184s">I</a>  was thinking about a meeting I attended recently down at one of the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5086.366s">And</a>  at that point, there was no school nurse present. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5088.767s">There</a>  was, in fact, maybe the only person present might have been a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5095.665s">So</a>  that if I was a parent attending, or for that matter, a school committee member attending with a history of heart disease in the family, you know, just make sure that it would be great if we could really encourage as many people as possible to learn how to do this.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5112.573s">I</a>  just want to be careful that we have sufficient numbers, but that we don't put people in situations of doing things that we're uncomfortable doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5121.177s">It's</a>  very different than an EpiPen. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5123.125s">A</a>  lot of people can use an EpiPen very effectively.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5125.826s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent didn't say anything about forcing people to do it who didn't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5130.589s">I'm</a>  thinking that there are people who, in fact, would like to learn how to do it.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5134.031s">I</a>  understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5134.691s">I</a>  just want to make it clear that this isn't one of those things like CPR that everyone is going to be trained in. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5140.194s">It's</a>  something that you really want to make sure that the four or five people in the building who are the go-to people are the people that are really comfortable using a device like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5149.319s">This</a>  is a very sophisticated device.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5153.828s">miss,</a>  miss, you all set this fan clue, miss must own the nurses.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5171.014s">I</a>  don't know that, but I will check that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5172.894s">I</a>  don't know that, but I'm told by Tony Vento that they check them every day and that's their, one of their responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5180.357s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5181.533s">Could</a>  it be that one day went by when they didn't entirely possible, but we will certainly reinforce that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5186.957s">But</a>  I want to make sure that, you know, the people that use this know what they're doing, but we'll provide that.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5196.503s">I</a>  just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5197.523s">Um,</a>  do the schools, um, conduct like practice drills to prepare for an emergency? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5204.348s">Um,</a>  so they can time themselves because it does, I guess the device has to be applied within four minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5211.094s">of</a>  the cardiac arrest, so I was just curious, like, if you're in the high school and it's in the front lobby and somebody's way down and they have to, you know, walkie-talkie that person, come down here, we have an emergency, they have to go get the defibrillator and then get to the person, you know, I was just curious, like, how that was going to work.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5231.368s">Four</a>  minutes is the guideline from the point of which the heart stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5236.952s">It's</a>  not for the person starting to feel chest pain or starting to feel dizzy or things of that type. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5243.537s">So</a>  it's tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5244.678s">I</a>  mean, obviously, you know, we have a 500,000 square foot high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5249.161s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5249.762s">And</a>  things can happen anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5251.663s">But</a>  obviously, you know, our goal is to get people to the scene as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5257.487s">Same</a>  thing with CPR. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5258.808s">Same</a>  thing with any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5260.093s">with</a>  EpiPens, anything that requires a medical intervention to get them there as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5265.536s">I'll</a>  go over it with Tony and with other people and see exactly if we can give you more specifics as to how they would respond.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5271.679s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5291.028s">Each</a>  floor.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5292.588s">I</a>  hope.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5297.049s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5297.249s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5298.049s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Benetton. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5300.17s">Well,</a>  one point of information is that on the fields, our athletic director, I'm sorry, our athletic trainer is always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5309.931s">And</a>  I know that she knows what she's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5313.892s">I</a>  know that when we have games and when she's not able to be at a particular game because she's at another game, we also have EMTs that have to be on the field to make sure that they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5324.338s">So</a>  I know that part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5326.52s">I</a>  guess the curiosity of that is we can't mandate everybody to take it, and we have to make sure that we are letting the people that want to do this <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5336.469s">learn</a>  it the correct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5338.09s">So</a>  is Tony Vento going to be providing the courses, the classes?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5342.472s">I'll</a>  sit with Tony, and let's go over a list of people who are more likely to be available and capable. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5350.856s">And</a>  then we'll approach them and try to add to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5354.337s">But</a>  it's unlikely that we're going to be able to get every person in every corner, nor should we try, because I think inappropriate application is more dangerous than none at all.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5366.357s">I'm</a>  strong is more than willing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5367.517s">I</a>  know in this building as well to train whoever wants to learn more than willing to train people Thank you, there's a motion on the floor offered by mr. Benedetto seconded by mr. Scary Roll call vote has been requested as well as Mia miss my stones question I actually forget what your question was I'm sorry <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5391.958s">The</a>  list by school and to also have a list posted next to the defibrillator. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5396.66s">If</a>  it's checked every day and if it's signed off on. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5400.843s">Maintenance.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5401.443s">On</a>  the motion, roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5403.484s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5403.544s">VanDekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5418.751s">7</a>  in the affirmative, 0 in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5420.912s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5422.513s">Update</a>  report on elementary class size, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5425.714s">You</a>  asked for a report that broke it out by actual classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5429.295s">You</a>  have that report in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5430.996s">It</a>  was appended to the previous report. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5433.377s">It</a>  shows you what each teacher has as of the same date that the previous report was provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5438.438s">I'm</a>  happy to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5442.599s">Motion</a>  to accept this report and place on file by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5444.86s">Disceri.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5445.4s">Is</a>  there a second on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5446.88s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5447.12s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5448.781s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5450.701s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5451.421s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5452.441s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5455.573s">Mister</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5456.593s">Oh,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5457.554s">First</a>  of all, I want to thank you for providing us with this report in a timely manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5462.135s">Secondly,</a>  I would like you to present it to the City Council as they requested the numbers, and I ask that they get the breakdown as well, so that they can see all the transparency and that where our schools are highly populated in certain areas, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5481.37s">Also,</a>  this report will become very handy as well when you provide us the other report on any new developments in the city and where kids are, if the new developments are in the area where our numbers are higher, that will give us some information and some planning for our budget and for our space, because we want to make sure we have enough space for all the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5505.943s">The</a>  next thing I wanted to say is, having looked at this report, I'm wondering does this include children that may be in a supported class and come into the regular classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5518.109s">Do</a>  the numbers go up during the day?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5520.39s">If</a>  a youngster comes from a substantially separated class, they come with the teachers or the staff that's with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5526.853s">So</a>  these numbers could, during the day... A number could increase mostly for gym or for some of the larger <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5532.69s">activities,</a>  but certainly not for classes that are substantially contained.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5538.452s">So</a>  not, not most, most generally not for academic classes, but more social classes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5543.534s">Although</a>  occasionally a youngster may try, they may try to put a youngster in a class.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5547.035s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5547.635s">I</a>  just want to be clear and put it out there because that, you know, that's a question that's always asked.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5551.877s">The</a>  other thing you got to keep in mind is on any given day, you know, with not to say that we encourage this, but any given day, a hundred percent of the pupils aren't always in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5562.023s">So</a>  if you have 20 youngsters in the class, you might have 18 on a given day, you know, on that day and then another day you might have all 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5568.567s">So</a>  it just depends on who's there on any given day as well.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5573.87s">So</a>  my, my other comment is that just looking at this is that the second grade class is, is pretty, it's a pretty big class. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5583.615s">So</a>  we want to keep that in mind when, um, the, as they get older. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5588.784s">You</a>  know, because that's a large grouping of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5591.726s">You</a>  have almost across the board an average of over 22, except for the Brooks School, which is a little bit smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5603.854s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5608.858s">Just</a>  this past month, we've had a bubble in our second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5612.46s">So</a>  at the McGlynn and at the Roberts in particular, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5617.117s">We</a>  had five new students just for second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5621.26s">So</a>  yes, there is a bubble that's going on in that particular classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5626.024s">We</a>  have students moving into Station Landing and students, you know, where the Malden-Metford line is, where all the apartments are. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5632.249s">We</a>  had one or two students moving in from that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5635.331s">But</a>  it's just unusual that we would have five, particularly in second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5640.815s">Those</a>  students were all designated for the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5644.822s">And</a>  I actually had to split them up because I couldn't put five new students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5648.465s">As</a>  you can see at the McGlynn Elementary, we have 23 and 24 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5653.809s">But</a>  the Roberts has always been high in second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5657.912s">So</a>  if there's a way we could transport students on a bus, we will try to do that just to make sure our numbers don't go over 24.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5666.9s">The</a>  only concern I have with that is siblings or, you know, if they've already been in a building for a while and they're comfortable there to at some point switch them because of the number of students in that particular school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5681.524s">So,</a>  I mean, that's not my hope is to have to do that to any family or any students.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5688.926s">So</a>  I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5689.186s">Well,</a>  the other thing we need to be cognizant of is that if they have siblings, then siblings we would <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5693.679s">just</a>  out of courtesy, move the siblings with the family as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5696.781s">So</a>  it could be conceivably two or three students in one school move.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5703.505s">It</a>  just seems like the numbers are somewhat higher than I anticipated for our second and maybe third grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5712.029s">Looks</a>  a little high in some schools to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5714.931s">And</a>  a little bit in fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5716.772s">Just</a>  to keep an eye on this, and if more students in that age level come into the district, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5722.336s">We</a>  just want to be very, very aware of those class sizes and keep an eye on them throughout the calendar year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5730.44s">So</a>  I'm glad that we are now getting this report twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5734.402s">I</a>  think that was a motion that was passed so that we get it in early September when kids settling in and then again in January so we can keep an eye on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5743.98s">Thank</a>  you for the report, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5746.221s">Um,</a>  when you present us with the new development report that was requested, could you also include this with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5753.545s">So</a>  that way we have both reports together at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5756.787s">I</a>  think it would be helpful too. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5758.507s">And</a>  thank you for sharing it with the city councils and being so transparent about everything.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5764.15s">So</a>  just so we have one understanding that we have to have all the time, I never send anything to the civil city council like this until you get it first. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5771.554s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5772.254s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5773.576s">It</a>  may be a little bit of a wait sometimes when they ask for something like this, but you always get it first before they get it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5779.683s">And</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5781.385s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5781.925s">And</a>  then we send it through the council just so you understand the process.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5785.329s">On</a>  the motion that this report be received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5788.133s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5789.674s">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5790.475s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5792.545s">Recommendation</a>  to approve reasonable use policy.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5795.767s">So</a>  this policy was in front of you earlier and we took it back to review it to make sure there were no situations that we were missing using current, you know, let's say legal opinions that were out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5810.215s">We</a>  vetted it at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5812.117s">We</a>  believe that this is ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5814.378s">So</a>  I recommend that you approve it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5817.88s">Mr.</a>  Skerry, just one question through you, the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5822.025s">Roy,</a>  I reviewed the document and it indicated two places that the individual that had the document, I read and understand the rules, I understand if they break any of the rules, I may lose the privilege of using the Internet and may have other consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5837.739s">Is</a>  there space for a signature line and a date?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5840.562s">There</a>  will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5841.343s">When</a>  a person gets in the States, they sign off on the</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5844.308s">Okay,</a>  and on the copy that goes out to the individuals, could you please provide us a copy of it also?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5850.274s">If</a>  you look on the cover page, all users must sign off on the reasonable use policy each year.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5854.818s">Right,</a>  but I just didn't see a sign, a line for a signature or a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5860.503s">Okay,</a>  and it's done individually, it's not done on one sheet by each student? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5866.028s">Individually.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5866.769s">Good,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5868.891s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5869.871s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5870.112s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5871.493s">I</a>  just wanted to share some helpful tips. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5873.534s">I</a>  think it's a good idea for all of us to make sure we keep our kids safe at home by monitoring their sites and limiting the time they spend on their devices, even when they're at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5885.618s">Kind</a>  of implement something similar to this in your own household. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5889.36s">I</a>  think it's a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5894.526s">with</a>  the signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5895.306s">I</a>  just want to make sure that where it says here, like this is for grade five, but I'm assuming this is for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5902.171s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5903.472s">Um,</a>  also to send it home. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5905.613s">So</a>  a parent and a guardian could sign and make sure that they are, once you're approving it, we won't</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5911.721s">then</a>  we'll work on distribution.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5913.482s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5913.802s">But</a>  I just want to, it wasn't clear here if it was just the student or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5916.783s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that we incorporate the guardian or the parent to sign off also. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5921.725s">So</a>  that way they can't come down the road and say, gee, I wasn't aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5925.566s">I</a>  didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5928.627s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5928.967s">And</a>  on that motion as amended to accept this report that Mr. Skerry, is there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5936.75s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5937.01s">Second</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5938.27s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5939.311s">Roll</a>  call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5941.401s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5944.162s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5948.763s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5949.283s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero on the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5952.484s">The</a>  policy is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5955.265s">Negotiation</a>  in legal matters? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5956.546s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5957.086s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5962.407s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5962.787s">Mr.</a>  Scari, point of information.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5964.268s">A</a>  few months back, we met in executive session regarding a couple of contracts and wondered if we'd get an update on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5969.83s">I</a>  mean, it's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5971.655s">I</a>  would rather see it sooner than later because these poor souls have been in limbo for a number of months and I think we have to get this done.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5979.119s">The</a>  unions to come in and work with us until they're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5981.781s">We</a>  can't, I can't, we should expect something very soon.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5985.883s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5987.344s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5988.285s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5988.965s">Um,</a>  under requested reports, um, the quarterly financial report, you said that we would be getting it soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5997.19s">We</a>  voted, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6000.152s">as</a>  a committee to get these, um, the community schools financial report on a quarterly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6006.015s">And</a>  we haven't had one since before last June. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6008.976s">So</a>  we're almost a year out, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6011.638s">So</a>  I'm just going to answer what I answered before until the hall straightens out the accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6016.52s">I'm</a>  not going to give you a report where commingled money is, it can't be, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6020.376s">can't</a>  be separated out so I can actually give you an accurate report. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6023.559s">They're</a>  working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6024.419s">We</a>  have major changes in the financial administration of the city and major change in the financial administration of the schools, and they're working on that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6033.566s">I</a>  would hope to have it soon, but as late as last week, I'm down there talking to the people in the city hall trying to get that broken out so we can give you an accurate report. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6043.834s">The</a>  good news is that we're not in jeopardy of anything financial. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6047.68s">The</a>  bad news is, what do you call it, I'm still trying to get this separated out so that you can see each account very cleanly as opposed to having four or five accounts somehow consolidated together which doesn't give you a real picture.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6065.033s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6065.593s">Um,</a>  I'm just asking for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6067.134s">I</a>  asked for this in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6068.595s">It's</a>  two months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6069.715s">Uh,</a>  I, you said in a few weeks because the city, the mayor said that the city was done posting what they needed to win the last time I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6079.279s">And</a>  now it's been more than a month since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6081.8s">That's</a>  the reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6082.841s">And</a>  so I am, I am asking for a timeline.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6086.902s">Soon</a>  as it, as soon as I get the numbers, the way they should be given to me, I will be happy to give you the report and I hope it's soon.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6093.721s">Okay,</a>  and I'm asking you, from now to the next meeting, just look at a few of these items and see if you can clear any of them up from the list that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6102.666s">We're</a>  working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6103.707s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6104.627s">All</a>  right, new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6105.948s">School</a>  committee resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6107.189s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Roger Wint. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6112.012s">Mr.</a>  Wint was the former Medford Public Schools Director of Building and Grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6117.38s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Margaret Yerati. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6122.544s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6122.704s">Yerati</a>  was the mother of Medford Public School's math teacher, Janet Forty. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6127.687s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford Public School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of James Coughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6132.851s">Mr.</a>  Coughlin was a retired Medford Public School physical ed teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6136.373s">He</a>  was the husband of Paula Coughlin, a Kids' Corner preschool teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6141.244s">Also</a>  the mother of Chris Coughlin, who's one of our Medford police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6144.565s">And</a>  their other son, Mark, and Carrie, daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6148.326s">Ron</a>  Corbett, a Medford High School graduate, star athlete, pitcher, baseball player in Oakland as system. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6156.809s">Is</a>  that what that is? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6157.929s">Oakland</a>  A's system, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6159.81s">He's</a>  in the Suffolk Hall of Fame and the Medford High School Hall of Fame. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6163.291s">Please</a>  all rise for a moment of silence in passing of these Medford residents and or teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6183.615s">A</a>  couple of announcements by the superintendent.</p>
