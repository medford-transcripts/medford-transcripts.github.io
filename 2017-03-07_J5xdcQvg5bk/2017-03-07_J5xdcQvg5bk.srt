64
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:17,293

65
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:21,603

71
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,485
[SPEAKER_14]: There must be a balance between city and school priorities as we go forward.

72
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Burke joined the meeting and assumed the chair.

00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:38,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two was the capital skills grant for $500,000 to support the development of our culinary and hospitality program.

82

83
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:48,645

84
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:50,726

85

[SPEAKER_14]: on our electrical program and related areas.

89
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:10,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, we have 25 Everett students.

90
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,979
[SPEAKER_14]: We expect to increase the number of tuition students to 100 over time.

91
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,820
[SPEAKER_14]: We are also recapturing tuitions from Minuteman.

92
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,802
[SPEAKER_14]: The grants will be supplemented by in-kind work by the laborers and Wynn, as well as the other industry partners.

93
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:29,585
[SPEAKER_14]: The development of our shop spaces will also enable us to serve adult learners and to maximize the use of our facility.

94
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,113
[SPEAKER_14]: The laborers will also help increase handicap accessibility.

96

[SPEAKER_14]: The high school roof needs some small repairs.

97
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,796
[SPEAKER_14]: that could be accomplished for about $25,000 to $30,000 this summer.

98
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:46,719
[SPEAKER_14]: We would expect to consider roof replacement beginning with 2020.

99
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,261
[SPEAKER_14]: This would be done in sections.

100
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:51,804
[SPEAKER_14]: The outside schools are still in good shape.

101
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:54,426

106
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:14,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Also why we are not finding money for building appearance projects.

107
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,087
[SPEAKER_14]: The superintendent explained that.

108
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:19,856
[SPEAKER_14]: he would have had to shut down a building if the repairs were not made.

109
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:24,537
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not uncommon to divert funding for emergency repairs.

110
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:31,099
[SPEAKER_14]: He also reiterated his plan to add additional funds to the operational budget next year for general repairs.

113
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

114
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,562

115
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:56,325

116
00:08:56,685 --> 00:09:00,007
[SPEAKER_14]: While the schools are functional, there could be better efficiency.

117
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,168

118
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:07,931

124
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:28,758
[SPEAKER_14]: As we move forward, technology is central to our educational and operational programs.

125
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:39,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Testing, state, federal funding, reporting, and instruction are more and more dependent on a robust and reliable technology, sorry, infrastructure and tools.

126
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:44,200
[SPEAKER_14]: We are eligible for substantial funding from the e-rate program under Tier 2.

127
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,641
[SPEAKER_14]: This will require a 40% match.

150
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:56,750
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a fence side, like a gate that's missing.

151
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,689
[SPEAKER_11]: So the children, like the ball will go outside the gate.

152
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,631
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's no, like one half, like where you can close the gate.

153

[SPEAKER_11]: One half is just gone.

154
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:07,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was in like October.

155
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:11,558
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if anybody's been out there to repair it, but that really needs to get done.

156
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:26,429
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also needed some signage, you know, because I think some, during school hours, you know, community, you know, people are just going to use the park, but during school hours that are operational,

157
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:30,955
[SPEAKER_11]: So they were just looking for some signage that they could put up.

158
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:35,877
[SPEAKER_11]: And the intercom system wasn't working properly in their walkie talkies.

159
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:37,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had done that.

160
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,137
[SPEAKER_05]: The playground equipment?

161
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,158
[SPEAKER_05]: The intercom in the playground?

162
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,719
[SPEAKER_11]: The intercom in the school wasn't working properly.

163
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:42,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Inside the school.

164
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:42,439
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

165
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:42,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

166
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:48,502
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if I, this was during my own visit when I conducted in like October.

167
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:51,223
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to mention that.

168
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,205
[SPEAKER_11]: did receive some calls from parents.

169
00:11:57,265 --> 00:12:02,008
[SPEAKER_11]: They were very curious and interested in finding out about the discussion we had.

170
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:04,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them couldn't make the committee of the whole meeting.

171
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:16,119
[SPEAKER_11]: So I sent Mr. Belson a note in asking if we could put something together on blog similar to what Lisa Evangelista posted for the grant publications.

172
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:24,686
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could put together just a brief description of the capital improvements that have been done, very similar to what we got in the breakdown

173
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:37,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, even with the timelines going back to 2002 so we can have that nice breakdown that we can share with the community, including some of the new, you know, proposed capital budget, um, plans.

174
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:46,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, and a lot of the community was very interested and, you know, happy to read all the, um, the posts that we shared this weekend about the grants.

175
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:46,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

176
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, miss.

177
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:47,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

178
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Their emotion to receive this report and place it on file.

179
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:54,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval, seconded by Ms.

180
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:54,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

181
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:55,753
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

182
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:57,474
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

183
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:58,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion is granted.

184
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:04,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Would a school committee member move suspension to take item nine out of order?

185
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:06,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for suspension by Ms.

186
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Ms.

187
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:07,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Disceri.

188
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:08,722
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

189
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:09,942
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

190
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:10,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Suspension is granted.

191
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:20,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on Medford High Ethics Bowl team achievements and recommendation to approve participation at National High School Ethics Bowl in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

192
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:23,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

193
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Burke, members of the committee.

194
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Nicole Chiesa, Dr. Nicole Chiesa is here.

195
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:38,248
[SPEAKER_10]: She's the head of the department which oversees the Ethics Bowl team and the Ethics Bowl team is here.

196
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:39,569
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been very successful.

197
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:49,871
[SPEAKER_10]: They won the Tufts, they won the regional, and now they have an opportunity to go to the nationals and compete with 23 other school systems across the country.

198
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:58,913
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanted to give this report, and then we'll make arrangements possibly to send the team to Chapel Hill to come back with a trophy for Medford

199
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:24,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to say a few words first?

200
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:25,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.

201
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:26,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

202
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

203
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,431
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had the Ethics Bowl team here in Medford since 2013.

204
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:40,953
[SPEAKER_13]: It originated as a partnership between Tufts University's Department of Philosophy and Medford High School.

205
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:44,153
[SPEAKER_13]: And since that time, Mr. Esner has been the advisor.

206
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:48,014
[SPEAKER_13]: We have reported some major successes this year.

207
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:50,595
[SPEAKER_13]: They competed at Tufts University.

208
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,238
[SPEAKER_13]: and did very well.

209
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:56,359
[SPEAKER_13]: They had multiple rounds of competition to face.

210
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:03,300
[SPEAKER_13]: They beat out different schools, including Phillips Exeter, Rosemary Choate Hall, and Newton South.

211
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,281
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were very, very proud of that accomplishment.

212
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:10,561
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the regional competition held at Tufts.

213
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:20,583
[SPEAKER_13]: That made these students eligible to participate in the playoff competition, which was actually done virtually through, I believe, Google Hangouts, which was kind of exciting in and of itself.

214
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:25,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And once again, the team was successful in winning that playoff round.

215
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:31,408
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are just so thrilled and pleased with all of their hard work and energy.

216
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:32,849
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an after-school club.

217
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,130
[SPEAKER_13]: They volunteer their time.

218
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Esner does as well.

219
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:39,734
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to personally thank Mr. Esner for all of his hard work with everything.

220
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:41,895
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'd like to recognize the students as well.

221
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:42,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

222
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:42,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

223
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:45,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Esner.

224
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:45,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my pleasure.

225
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:49,520
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could have the students line up on the side here.

226
00:15:53,492 --> 00:16:00,577
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Tamar Brandeskrug, Exemplary Participation, Medford High School Ethics Bowl Team.

227
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:01,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Tamar?

228
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:08,343
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come up here, of course.

229
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:08,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

230
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to call them by name?

231
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, by name.

232
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:12,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Tamar.

233
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:12,667
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

234
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:13,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

235
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:13,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

236
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:14,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

237
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:16,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Tamar, congratulations.

238
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

239
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria Camona.

240
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:36,646
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have an exit over here.

241
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we did.

242
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,048
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be natural.

243
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Sean Driscoll Gomez.

244
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Sean's not here tonight.

245
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:46,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Kudos to Sean.

246
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:46,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

247
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:49,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Raquel Fiorotti.

248
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:03,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary Nagos.

249
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:12,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

250
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:13,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job.

251
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:15,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

252
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:22,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Tenzin Riggson.

253
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:24,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Augusta Standeven.

254
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:57,363
[SPEAKER_14]: I've asked the students if they could just stay up here so perhaps we could do a photo.

255
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:10,076
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing that I would like to do is I would like to put forth a resolution that the Medford Public Schools pay for our students to attend the competition in North Carolina.

256
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:21,244
[SPEAKER_14]: And if Mr. Eisner is willing, we certainly would certainly appreciate his accompanying our team in doing whatever we can do, because I am so, so proud of you.

257
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:23,747
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys could come up.

258
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:27,631
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, as seconded by Mrs. Curry.

259
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:28,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

260
00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:29,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Cugno?

261
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:30,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

262
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. DiBenedetto?

263
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:31,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

264
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:33,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Kreatz?

265
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Mustone is absent, but she'd vote yes, I know that.

266
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scurry?

267
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:39,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

268
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:40,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Van der Kloot?

269
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:40,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

270
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:41,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Burke?

271
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:42,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

272
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:43,520
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to North Carolina?

273
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,022
[SPEAKER_05]: One absent, motion passes.

274
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:53,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Eisen would like to say a few words on behalf of these wonderful students.

275
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:53,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

276
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:55,983
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just like to say what a great job you guys have done.

277
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:57,323
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so proud of you.

278
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:01,026
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to see how you guys do in North Carolina.

279
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, bring back the trophy.

280
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:05,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to the school committee for your support.

281
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:12,393
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very appreciative to all the work that you've put into this as well.

282
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:13,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And kudos to you.

283
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful job.

284
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:14,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

285
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,536
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

286
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:35,653
[SPEAKER_03]: not to put any pressure on any of you.

287
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:55,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Macklemore, a popular entertainer, especially in the early 2010s.

288
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:02,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it morally permissible for a white person to lead or be the face of an organization called Black Lives Matter?

289
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:06,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Another question we had, currently we're working on the heroin epidemic.

290
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:09,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Who should have access to Narcan?

291
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:11,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Who should be able to administrate it?

292
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:15,462
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there a big moral difference if you're taking away one of the

293
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:18,979
[SPEAKER_09]: greatest consequences of drug abuse, which would be an overdose.

294
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,220
[SPEAKER_09]: We have things of that nature.

295
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:25,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and so when you answer these questions, like, is it, I mean, is it like in an essay form?

296
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how long do they give you to answer the question?

297
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You've won it.

298
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,492
[SPEAKER_03]: You might as well explain it.

299
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:42,459
[SPEAKER_08]: So the way we answer the questions is in a debate format.

300
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:50,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So it starts by there's two teams, Team A and Team B. And Team A is presented with a case and a question about the case.

301
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:54,148
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have five minutes to present our main argument.

302
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:01,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Then Team B has three minutes, I believe, to either add on to our argument or present their personal view.

303
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:06,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Team A has another two or three minutes to respond to Team B's commentary.

304
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:12,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And how long do the rounds usually last?

305
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:13,239
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 minutes a round?

306
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many rounds do you do?

307
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

308
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:20,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

309
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:22,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's incredible.

310
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:25,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And just out of curiosity, how much is the trip going to cost?

311
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:28,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're putting it in, but I'd like to know how much it does cost.

312
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:31,264
[SPEAKER_03]: For person or overall?

313
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:44,161
[SPEAKER_13]: With lodging and overall cost, we're looking at about 5,000 to 6,000 total for airfare as well as lodging.

314
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:47,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Most meals are included in there as well.

315
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And how long is the trip?

316
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:52,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, guys.

317
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,144
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to move out of the way.

318
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:53,965
[SPEAKER_13]: I just need to scoot in.

319
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:54,745
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

320
00:23:55,065 --> 00:24:02,210
[SPEAKER_13]: The trip, they're going to be leaving Friday morning, April 7th, with a return on Monday morning, April 10th.

321
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:05,172
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a nice reception there on Friday.

322
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:10,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Competition begins Saturday and Sunday, with the final round not ending until about 6.30 that night.

323
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, congratulations.

324
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:14,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

325
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:14,721
[SPEAKER_03]: We're proud of you.

326
00:24:14,741 --> 00:24:16,462
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot be any more prouder.

327
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:18,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when you bring back the other award.

328
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:21,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And let us know how you make out.

329
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:26,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should acknowledge our captains, Mary and Tamar, and then our seniors, Raquel and Gus.

330
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:27,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

331
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:27,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

332
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:27,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

333
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:32,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck and come back.

334
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:32,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

335
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:36,254
[SPEAKER_05]: We're proud of you in any way, any way, shape, or form.

336
00:24:37,787 --> 00:24:42,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

337
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:44,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say some food for thought.

338
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:53,454
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular year it seems like we've been really blessed with more and more students coming to us and achieving so much.

339
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:58,196
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like we're having more and more students going out of state for these competitions.

340
00:24:58,596 --> 00:24:59,076
[SPEAKER_03]: As Ms.

341
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:03,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot had motioned for us to pass and make sure that we pay for this trip

342
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:17,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just food for thought that we might start thinking about this when the budget comes around and really put a budget line for these types of trips because you don't want to be in a situation where we're approving one particular team and not approving the other.

343
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:23,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't want to make anyone feel that what they're doing for us is any less worth what they're doing.

344
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:28,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as a matter of fact, just to make it as food for thought, that was it.

345
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:28,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

346
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:29,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

347
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:31,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

348
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:37,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, community participation.

349
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:38,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe we have anything on the agenda for that.

350
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:39,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

351
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:47,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Report number one, recommendation to accept gift from Thomas Sutherland in memory of Jean Barry Sutherland.

352
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:49,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent, there's a motion on the floor.

353
00:25:49,624 --> 00:25:59,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Members of the committee, Thomas Sutherland, the husband of Jean Barry Sutherland, would like to make a major donation to

354
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:07,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Columbus school area site, uh, in memory and in honor of, uh, former principal, Jean Barry Sutherland.

355
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the gift would be a bench and a plaque to be installed on the Columbus ground.

356
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:13,892
[SPEAKER_10]: So we recommend that you accept it.

357
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Sutherland is here, I believe.

358
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:17,173
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I don't think so.

359
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:17,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see him.

360
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:21,915
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

361
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:24,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, please.

362
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:31,845
[SPEAKER_14]: We all know that Jean Barry Sutherland meant an awful lot to this community.

363
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:40,773
[SPEAKER_14]: She was a remarkable woman, both in her life and also as she was approaching the end of her life, and was really an inspiration in so many ways for all of us.

364
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:50,762
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very fitting, and I'm thankful to her husband, Thomas, for making this a lasting tribute to her on our school grounds, which she loves so dearly.

365
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:52,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

366
00:26:52,165 --> 00:27:02,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the privilege of meeting with Mrs. Sutherland, and he's just so thrilled to be able to recognize her years of service to the city of Medbridge and Medford Public Schools, and especially the Columbus School, which was her home school.

367
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:07,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was there when the new schools were opened, and she was a staple in that community.

368
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:18,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's dearly missed, but this will provide a reflective area for the students, the parents, and teachers, I would imagine, and administrators to pay homage to her deeds.

369
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're very proud to be able to do this for them.

370
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And as soon as we have a date, we believe it's early April, but we'll let you know.

371
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:25,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

372
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:25,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Call the roll.

373
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:26,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, please.

374
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:27,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Cugno.

375
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:29,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

376
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:30,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Kreatz.

377
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:31,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Mastone.

378
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:33,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scurry.

379
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:34,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

380
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:35,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Vanderklift.

381
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:35,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

382
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:35,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Burke.

383
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:36,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

384
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:38,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero on the negative.

385
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,550
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

386
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:43,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Item two, recommendation to approve school calendar, a school year 2017-18.

387
00:27:43,752 --> 00:27:49,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So as we get into this time of year, people ask the question frequently,

388
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:51,336
[SPEAKER_10]: When will school start?

389
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:53,937
[SPEAKER_10]: What will be the vacation periods and the like?

390
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:57,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a draft that requires your approval.

391
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna call on our deputy superintendent to go over the particulars and to tell you why we picked certain dates the way we did.

392
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:06,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

393
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:13,831
[SPEAKER_01]: We're asking tonight that we approve our calendar moving forward to the following school year so families can plan.

394
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:16,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has an idea of what's going on.

395
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:18,774
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, this year we've

396
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,361
[SPEAKER_01]: adopted a new format.

397
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:32,226
[SPEAKER_01]: My thanks to my assistant Jeannie Gliona for working very diligently, making everything fit nicely, and we feel that it's very readable and concise for everyone.

398
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:41,451
[SPEAKER_01]: The current teacher's contract calls for the school to start every year now before Labor Day, the Monday before Labor Day.

399
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:44,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is not a decision that administration makes.

400
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:45,973
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that

401
00:28:46,545 --> 00:28:49,367
[SPEAKER_01]: is set in the teacher's contract by negotiation.

402
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:55,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, the start of the school year for teachers this year will be Monday, August 28th.

403
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:02,694
[SPEAKER_01]: The contract was also very specific for how that first week would be organized.

404
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:09,237
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of that week prior to Labor Day, students will be in session.

405
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:14,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Friday, the Friday before Labor Day, everyone will have a holiday.

406
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:17,927
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that was something that is in the teacher's contract.

407
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:25,795
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the second year that we've adopted this schedule and we want to make sure that parents get that information.

408
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:34,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we've been asking principals to reinforce it so that parents understand that vacation really kind of has to stop at the end of August.

409
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:46,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Students, again, would return to school after Labor Day on September 5th, with kindergarten students beginning on the 6th.

410
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:51,590
[SPEAKER_01]: The calendar has the required number of days with five snow days built in.

411
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we were to use those snow days, the end of school would be June 20th.

412
00:29:56,031 --> 00:29:57,491
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't use it, we back it up.

413
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:08,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the calendar has the standard school vacations, legal holidays, the mandated, or actually the early release days that are mandated by

414
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:22,738
[SPEAKER_01]: the contract for middle and high school and again we have two full days of professional development and we've set those for Tuesday, November 7th and Monday, March 12th.

415
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,666
[SPEAKER_01]: We strongly recommend that the calendar be approved as early as possible and if you have any questions or comments.

416
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:42,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Beverly, I thought that the last year that we've been setting in more like seven snow days, not five.

417
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,788
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was surprised to see that this was, in my eyes, rolled back to five.

418
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:58,038
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have thought that we would have called the end of school the 22nd, for instance, so to set expectations that it could go that late.

419
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,161
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like the superintendent.

420
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:02,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me just answer that.

421
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:09,250
[SPEAKER_10]: By rule, with the Department of Ed, we have to make allowance for five days, but we actually have another seven days if we needed it.

422
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,412
[SPEAKER_10]: So we really have 12 days available to us, not counting if we were to reclaim a professional day.

423
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:20,835
[SPEAKER_10]: So remember, if the last day with five days is the 20th of June, you still got to the 30th of June if we actually needed it.

424
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:24,076
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've really built in quite a bit of protection.

425
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:26,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I guess I'm looking at it a different way.

426
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:28,898
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm a parent thinking about making plans,

427
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:35,885
[SPEAKER_14]: If you say the end of the school is the 22nd, well, then I'm going to be thinking I'm going to make my plans starting the 23rd.

428
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:38,886
[SPEAKER_14]: If you say it's the 20th, then I'm going to start making them the 21st.

429
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:41,728
[SPEAKER_10]: We can put a one-liner in the notice out there.

430
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:42,648
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make that change.

431
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,769
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put seven snow days built in.

432
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:45,970
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the drought, so.

433
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:53,413
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like some other feedback, but I'm thinking that it's better to set people's expectations that there could be the possibility, because if we go back

434
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:58,115
[SPEAKER_14]: to two years ago in 2015 when we had so many snowstorms.

435
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:01,276
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's an expectation thing.

436
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:02,416
[SPEAKER_14]: What do others think?

437
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:04,397
[SPEAKER_05]: We have built in this year, five?

438
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:05,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we should do five.

439
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:07,438
[SPEAKER_10]: We built in probably 11 days.

440
00:32:07,478 --> 00:32:09,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the calendar itself says five.

441
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:10,279
[SPEAKER_01]: The calendar has five.

442
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:13,820
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that we can go by teacher's contract to the 30th of June.

443
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,100
[SPEAKER_01]: So in effect, it's built in.

444
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,202
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a bad suggestion that we can make that adjustment if the committee wants to go that route.

445
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:28,597
[SPEAKER_10]: We can put a statement and should, you know, we require more days because of snow or other inclement weather or other reasons.

446
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:29,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

447
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:31,738
[SPEAKER_14]: If we just did some further clarification.

448
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:32,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, fine.

449
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:35,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

450
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:36,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

451
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,039
[SPEAKER_16]: You all set.

452
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:37,979
Okay.

453
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,200
[SPEAKER_16]: And I agree with you.

454
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:50,422
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the comment at the bottom is an important piece that, um, parents can, but most, most parents know this from being for a while, but it's the younger parents.

455
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:52,703
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, parents of younger students.

456
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:56,337
[SPEAKER_16]: that might need that to be listed on there.

457
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:59,099
[SPEAKER_16]: My comment is just November 7th.

458
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:01,041
[SPEAKER_16]: It says professional development day.

459
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:04,664
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems weird to have a day off on a Tuesday and then on a Friday.

460
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:11,349
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want people, I understand that, but I'm not sure everybody reading this quickly is going to say, oh, why is that?

461
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:15,113
[SPEAKER_16]: That seems like a strange week to have a Tuesday and a Friday off the same week.

462
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:19,797
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, maybe next to it, professional development day.

463
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:25,139
[SPEAKER_16]: put also election day or something so parents know that it can't be changed.

464
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:26,840
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't like a choice.

465
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,862
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like we do that for the safety of the schools and the students.

466
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,264
[SPEAKER_16]: So that way people aren't roaming the buildings on election day.

467
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:34,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

468
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:36,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

469
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:36,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Kritz.

470
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:39,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I wanted to thank Beverly.

471
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:46,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I ran into her at the school and we started to get inquiries already asking when we were going back to school.

472
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:47,692
[SPEAKER_11]: And some parents

473
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:55,137
[SPEAKER_11]: really didn't know that, in fact, I didn't really know that it was part of the contract that the teachers had to start school early.

474
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:59,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I misunderstood, I thought it was administration also, so I'm glad you explained that.

475
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:11,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Would there be any way to maybe just put something under the bottom explaining that as per collective bargaining agreement, the start of school would be before Labor Day?

476
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:15,062
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a lot of communication about that.

477
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:17,162
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people weren't happy about

478
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:23,985
[SPEAKER_11]: going back to school before Labor Day, you know, I was getting inquiries myself, you know, why are we going back before Labor Day?

479
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:28,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like that, you know, but yeah.

480
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,749
[SPEAKER_14]: So we used to go back in Medford after Labor Day.

481
00:34:32,249 --> 00:34:34,250
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, many families preferred it.

482
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and certainly the teachers did.

483
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:39,873
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact of the matter was with them, we were running into a problem because we were going too late

484
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:43,190
[SPEAKER_14]: too far into June because we were getting more snow days.

485
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,912
[SPEAKER_14]: We went through a period of years where we're getting a lot of snow days.

486
00:34:46,473 --> 00:34:51,457
[SPEAKER_14]: And so with the cooperation of the teachers union, we then moved it back.

487
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:52,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it preferable?

488
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, not necessarily.

489
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,280
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends on who you talk to.

490
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,324
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's because of, I mean, if we could predict snow days, we wouldn't be doing this, but we can't.

491
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:08,691
[SPEAKER_14]: And if teachers were unhappy, they were really, really, really unhappy if, you know, school went to June 30th or, you know, when it went that late.

492
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:09,832
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why.

493
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:13,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is quite typical of most school systems now.

494
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:15,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Most school systems are back before.

495
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,578
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to, there were a few times we started before Labor Day.

496
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:23,860
[SPEAKER_01]: The previous contract said school could not start before September 1st.

497
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,722
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were the occasions that September 1st was before Labor Day.

498
00:35:28,782 --> 00:35:34,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did, a few years here and there, depending upon the fall of Labor Day, we did start before.

499
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:39,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, now it's pretty much cast in stone in the contract.

500
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:45,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite honestly, this was something that the teacher's union kind of promoted more than we did.

501
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:54,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I think teachers feel it's much more advantageous for children to be out of school earlier in June, because it gets hot, they get tired, and so on.

502
00:35:54,316 --> 00:36:00,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's something that they promoted, and we thought it was a good idea too, but it was promoted by the union.

503
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:06,623
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of adding anything, pretty much everything in the contract, like the early release days, is contractual.

504
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:08,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only so much language we can add.

505
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:12,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Jeannie was trying to squeeze things in to get everything in.

506
00:36:12,977 --> 00:36:17,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We can try if you feel that that's important to her contract to put it in.

507
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:24,023
[SPEAKER_01]: But just getting the word out that this is in the teacher's contract and principals have been promoting that idea.

508
00:36:24,103 --> 00:36:26,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully people, and this is the second year.

509
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:28,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we did it last year.

510
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:30,847
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers were very specific.

511
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:33,509
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not want a professional development day that first week.

512
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:36,531
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted students in school for three consecutive days.

513
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty much set by them.

514
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:40,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

515
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:41,365
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

516
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:42,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion of approval.

517
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:43,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

518
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:50,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, another point is a lot of school systems around the United States start earlier than we do in New England.

519
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:56,308
[SPEAKER_16]: And all students take the AP exams and the SATs at the same time.

520
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:03,770
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we're not in school as many days as others, we don't cover as much material as others.

521
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,371
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're judged throughout the United States on their performance.

522
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:17,998
[SPEAKER_16]: So we need to be in school a certain amount of days to get the education in for them to be prepared for these exams.

523
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:21,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Some schools start early August.

524
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:31,081
[SPEAKER_16]: And with our snow days, we could even have weeks less time to prepare for these exams than people in other parts of the country.

525
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:36,543
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's really important to get these days in and the education started for us.

526
00:37:37,295 --> 00:37:42,637
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's another reason why I totally agreed with starting this before Labor Day.

527
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:43,937
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an excellent point.

528
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:49,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we have our regular state testing that takes place in April and May.

529
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:54,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Communities that start before Labor Day, the students have a whole week of more prep.

530
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:57,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you said with snow days, it's very hard to predict already.

531
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:00,503
[SPEAKER_01]: We're saying we lost a few days here and there, how are we going to make it up?

532
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:06,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's for the AP exams and plus just the regular state exams, having that instructional time.

533
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:09,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most students are ready to come back.

534
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:14,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of gearing up that last week in August, so hopefully they are.

535
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:15,388
[SPEAKER_01]: In their parents.

536
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:16,368
[SPEAKER_07]: In their parents.

537
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:17,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

538
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:18,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

539
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, everything has been asked, so I'm all set.

540
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:22,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

541
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:24,972
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

542
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

543
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:27,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, please.

544
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:37,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

545
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:39,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

546
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:40,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

547
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:45,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on March 13th, 2017 professional development day.

548
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:45,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

549
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:52,420
[SPEAKER_10]: So our deputy superintendent, our assistant superintendent have led the charge in putting this program together.

550
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,504
[SPEAKER_10]: It's done with a great deal of input from the teachers and others, and it's a lot of work involved.

551
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:03,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, congratulations to both of them putting together a very interesting day and let them tell you about it.

552
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:05,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Diane and I have been emailing all weekend.

553
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,666
[SPEAKER_01]: She's tired of seeing my emails on Sunday.

554
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:17,912
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, Monday, March 13th, a week from today, will be our second full day of professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals.

555
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:20,353
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no school for students that day.

556
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:23,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there are lots of different activities.

557
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:30,420
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did this report last week, we hadn't ironed out as much as now we have together, and we'll give you a full report on the 20th.

558
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:52,776
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of the day, as all of you know, we had a very exciting professional development program this year for the first time, where teachers on November 8th, our first full day of professional development, they engaged in a round robin exploring three very important themes that were identified as themes that we wanted to pursue, teachers wanted to pursue further.

559
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:54,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was based on their own surveys.

560
00:39:55,528 --> 00:40:02,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those themes was at-risk students, a second one was special education, and a third was social-emotional learning.

561
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:08,514
[SPEAKER_01]: After November 8th, every teacher in the school district said, I want to go with one theme.

562
00:40:09,194 --> 00:40:14,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they continue with that theme throughout the school year on our mandated PD days.

563
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:17,057
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the elementary and the middle and the high school.

564
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:20,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, who facilitated those workshops?

565
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:21,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Our own staff.

566
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:22,640
[SPEAKER_01]: They were magnificent.

567
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:29,329
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful teachers stepped up, they organized workshops, and they were very well received.

568
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:42,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were very excited about this because teachers were telling us that sometimes PD they felt was like one day and it was done, and they wanted to have it more ongoing and sustainable, and I think that we accomplished that.

569
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:48,113
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the 13th, we're going to use half of the day to bring closure

570
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:53,713
[SPEAKER_01]: to whatever theme the teacher had selected for this particular school year.

571
00:40:54,273 --> 00:40:58,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So teachers will be with their groups, working on whatever they were working on throughout the school year.

572
00:40:59,596 --> 00:41:04,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second half of the day, we're going to have teachers going back to buildings.

573
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:18,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And in most cases, the principals are going to lead them in test prep, because we have the English MCAS, the new test, MCAS 2.0, coming up in April, and the mathematics in May.

574
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:26,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So this gives us an opportunity to go over those exams with the teachers more fully, not that we haven't been doing practice tests all along.

575
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,358
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, as you know, we have the online requirement.

576
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:38,980
[SPEAKER_01]: So all fourth graders, eighth graders, and the entire Andrews School, sixth, seventh, and eighth, are going to be taking the test online.

577
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a certain amount of additional prep for that.

578
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:43,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of our plan.

579
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:47,182
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of other little things going on that we've been

580
00:41:47,645 --> 00:41:48,465
[SPEAKER_01]: working on today.

581
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:50,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Diana, I don't know if you want to speak to anything else.

582
00:41:52,066 --> 00:41:52,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

583
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:55,786
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that the teachers really wanted was choice.

584
00:41:55,906 --> 00:42:03,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when we were going through the survey with the Professional Development Committee, there were the three topics that Beverly mentioned.

585
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:13,469
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the elementary level, we had almost 100 teachers who really wanted to work the at-risk group, which is a considerable, significant amount.

586
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:15,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But we made it work.

587
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,350
[SPEAKER_06]: We had administrators who stepped up to the plate

588
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,896
[SPEAKER_06]: to work with our teacher presenters.

589
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:26,540
[SPEAKER_06]: The second half of the day, our grades 3, 4, and 5 will be working on the MCAS 2.0.

590
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,262
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm very excited to talk about what the K1 and 2 will be doing.

591
00:42:30,302 --> 00:42:37,105
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, they're not the test grades, but we still wanted to have professional development for them that was worthwhile.

592
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:43,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll be happy to know we have Rocco Sieri doing science with our K1 and 2 teachers.

593
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:46,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Bernadette Rigodelli is here this evening.

594
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:52,440
[SPEAKER_06]: She's going to be working on some social studies with our K1 and 2 teachers in a round-robin format.

595
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:09,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're also going to do a workshop on what to not to do in IEP meetings from a general education standpoint and just in general time constraints so you don't walk in with a cup of coffee and plop it down.

596
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:10,747
[SPEAKER_06]: and chitchat with your neighbor.

597
00:43:10,807 --> 00:43:16,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mrs. Medaglio's daughter actually found this wonderful video on YouTube.

598
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:23,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And Cheryl Maiocco and one of our teachers, Mariana Stewart, will be facilitating that workshop.

599
00:43:23,713 --> 00:43:27,735
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're very excited about what we're doing in professional development on March 13th.

600
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:30,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

601
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:31,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

602
00:43:31,537 --> 00:43:32,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

603
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:38,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to just mention, I got to attend part of the session on the November

604
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:43,995
[SPEAKER_11]: professional development day and the presenters were excellent.

605
00:43:45,295 --> 00:43:50,618
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched a very moving video and I sat in a group with some other teachers.

606
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:57,502
[SPEAKER_11]: We discussed strategies, techniques, and we broke up into groups and then everybody got to share their ideas.

607
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,604
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really educational and it was a good day.

608
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:02,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a great day.

609
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:05,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish you guys the best of luck on Monday.

610
00:44:06,713 --> 00:44:08,173
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers have been incredible.

611
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:12,415
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows you what, you give someone some ownership of something, how they can run with it.

612
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:17,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've had some administrative support, but that was just initially.

613
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:22,920
[SPEAKER_01]: But once they got going, it was pretty much on their own, and they have been wonderful.

614
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope, our plan is to try to do a similar type of PD next year, too, because this worked very well.

615
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:31,744
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting to see our evaluations.

616
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:32,965
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have evaluations.

617
00:44:33,794 --> 00:44:43,280
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the questions on the evaluations, and this is really important for us, what did you learn this year in your PD that you can basically take back and implement in your classroom?

618
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what it's all about.

619
00:44:44,781 --> 00:44:49,124
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about learning good things, but also about implementing what you're learning.

620
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:51,686
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get that feedback from the teachers.

621
00:44:51,846 --> 00:44:55,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, what would they like to learn more about related to the topic.

622
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:01,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we'll plan accordingly for next year based on what we get from them in the evaluations.

623
00:45:02,802 --> 00:45:02,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

624
00:45:03,002 --> 00:45:03,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Mustone.

625
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:04,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thanks.

626
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:08,045
[SPEAKER_02]: For the MCAS 2.0, all students in grades four.

627
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So all four elementary school kids will be doing it online.

628
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:15,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And in grade eight, both the Andrews and the McGlynn, and everything's set to go?

629
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:17,050
[SPEAKER_02]: All the computers are up and ready?

630
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:17,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

631
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,331
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been working on that.

632
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:20,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making sure.

633
00:45:20,211 --> 00:45:21,052
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to hear.

634
00:45:21,392 --> 00:45:26,195
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, could you send us the video that you found about the IEP that you're showing?

635
00:45:26,215 --> 00:45:27,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that.

636
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you mind waiting until after we show it?

637
00:45:29,356 --> 00:45:29,877
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.

638
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:30,437
[SPEAKER_06]: On March 13th?

639
00:45:30,657 --> 00:45:30,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

640
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:32,018
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd be happy to do it.

641
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:32,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

642
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:33,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see it too.

643
00:45:35,354 --> 00:45:39,017
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion to accept the report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto.

644
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:39,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

645
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:42,400
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

646
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,781
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

647
00:45:43,901 --> 00:45:44,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

648
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:48,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-budget report guidance department.

649
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:49,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

650
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:53,769
[SPEAKER_10]: So we begin the process now of looking at pre-budget reports.

651
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:59,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight starts and we'll turn it over to our deputy superintendent to introduce this first report.

652
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,401
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that time of year, pre-budget reports are starting.

653
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:10,084
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be scheduling them as we move forward with our meetings from this point on.

654
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:19,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guidance director, Amelia Jensen, has been the brave soul to come forward for the first one tonight, but she always does a spectacular job.

655
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:21,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to start with a star.

656
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So Amelia.

657
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:28,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee.

658
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:36,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight you have all received the pre-budget report for the guidance department, but I'm going to give you a brief overview of it.

659
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:40,140
[SPEAKER_12]: So I won't go through all of it, but I'll just highlight some important points.

660
00:46:41,321 --> 00:46:45,263
[SPEAKER_12]: An overview of our department, this year our department consists of ten guidance Councilors.

661
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:50,765
[SPEAKER_12]: We have five at the high school, one at the vocational technical high school, and two at each middle school.

662
00:46:51,685 --> 00:47:01,549
[SPEAKER_12]: The mission of the guidance department is to ensure that all students thrive in the three areas of academic development, college and career preparation, and social emotional wellness.

663
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:04,670
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really where our curriculum is focused.

664
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:20,227
[SPEAKER_12]: To deliver this curriculum, the middle school Councilors teach guidance classes, and at the high school, Councilors meet students in guidance seminars, which is through our advisory program, as well as individual meetings and large group pull-outs from classes and small groups.

665
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:27,512
[SPEAKER_12]: So this last year, the school year 2016-2017, we spent all of our funding on office supplies.

666
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:33,274
[SPEAKER_12]: We spent our money in our contractual services account for subscriptions and memberships.

667
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:40,876
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition to professional development in regards to English language learners and vocational technical education.

668
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:45,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Books were also purchased to support staff who are working with students.

669
00:47:46,052 --> 00:47:50,917
[SPEAKER_12]: And the PSAT subsidy was used to pay for all juniors to take the PSAT free of charge.

670
00:47:51,598 --> 00:47:57,044
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a huge success and I want to thank you all for providing that funding last year and this year.

671
00:47:59,187 --> 00:48:01,849
[SPEAKER_12]: And for major accomplishments, I wanted to highlight a few.

672
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:06,332
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is that we have a new program through the guidance department called NPower.

673
00:48:06,873 --> 00:48:18,481
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a guidance-initiated program that was established not this year but last year to really support students who are at risk for not graduating and those who had no plans for post-secondary education.

674
00:48:19,902 --> 00:48:30,489
[SPEAKER_12]: This program focuses on four areas of purpose, finding purpose, identity development, creating goals, and finding support and resources within the school.

675
00:48:31,229 --> 00:48:40,455
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we found with this program is that students who are enrolled in this program, or I mean participating in this program, actually have increased their GPA, are twice as likely to

676
00:48:41,315 --> 00:48:45,077
[SPEAKER_12]: sorry, increase their GPA at twice the rate of students not in this program.

677
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:47,078
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're finding great success with this.

678
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:57,764
[SPEAKER_12]: This is currently being implemented with our seniors, and it has got the attention of researchers at BC and Harvard, and so they are actually working with us this year to study the program.

679
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:07,990
[SPEAKER_12]: We're hoping to continue this program next year with our senior students and possibly looking to expand it with our freshman and sophomore students, hopefully in the future.

680
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:17,176
[SPEAKER_12]: The department was also successfully trained in using school brains and implementing it in the scheduling and registration process.

681
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:18,197
[SPEAKER_12]: This was huge.

682
00:49:18,237 --> 00:49:22,040
[SPEAKER_12]: We went through hours and hours of training, and we feel that it was very successful.

683
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:26,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're looking forward to a successful registration season this year as well.

684
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:33,702
[SPEAKER_12]: We also increased our partnerships and programs that improve post-secondary outcomes for our at-risk students.

685
00:49:34,644 --> 00:49:38,991
[SPEAKER_12]: And these are really programs that help bridge the transition from high school to beyond.

686
00:49:39,552 --> 00:49:43,117
[SPEAKER_12]: These are programs that provide more meaning for students and are more supportive.

687
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,392
[SPEAKER_12]: And finally, we had a successful C3 day in college fair in October.

688
00:49:48,412 --> 00:49:59,239
[SPEAKER_12]: So this was really a two week span when all juniors were able to take the PSATs, all seniors were able to engage in college, career, or community service activities.

689
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:08,585
[SPEAKER_12]: This is really a time when our seniors can leave campus and they can go and do college visits, they can do job shadows, and they can also get their community service requirement done.

690
00:50:10,266 --> 00:50:14,291
[SPEAKER_12]: And then within that two-week span, we also had over 500 students attend the college fair.

691
00:50:14,832 --> 00:50:18,116
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is a quick overview of some of our accomplishments for this year.

692
00:50:19,337 --> 00:50:24,444
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully I didn't go over that too quickly, but I'd like to see if any of you have any questions.

693
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:30,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you tell us what the Welcome Project is for me?

694
00:50:30,946 --> 00:50:31,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

695
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:33,788
[SPEAKER_12]: So the Welcome Project is a program through Somerville.

696
00:50:35,489 --> 00:50:38,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's actually a lot of mini programs within that program.

697
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:41,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the programs that we have used is called LIPS.

698
00:50:42,753 --> 00:50:45,135
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, I can't remember the acronym at this moment.

699
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:51,719
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's a program that comes in and it trains our students who speak English and another language to be interpreters.

700
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:54,001
[SPEAKER_12]: So a lot of our ELL students took advantage of that.

701
00:50:54,381 --> 00:50:55,922
[SPEAKER_12]: They were trained in being an interpreter.

702
00:50:55,982 --> 00:50:57,323
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they were set up with a job.

703
00:50:57,803 --> 00:50:59,504
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

704
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:07,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, if I can follow up, I was wondering if you're seeing students who are concerned about their family's immigration status, if that's causing any angst?

705
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:10,428
[SPEAKER_12]: We are seeing a few of those students.

706
00:51:12,482 --> 00:51:19,386
[SPEAKER_12]: But for the most part, our ELL department has been working closely with the guidance department in helping to support those students.

707
00:51:20,847 --> 00:51:27,310
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been able to provide them resources and just information on their rights as students.

708
00:51:29,491 --> 00:51:31,972
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it's difficult this year.

709
00:51:33,313 --> 00:51:33,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

710
00:51:36,755 --> 00:51:37,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Skerry.

711
00:51:38,456 --> 00:51:39,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Through you to Ms.

712
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:40,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Jensen.

713
00:51:40,923 --> 00:51:47,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I noticed that you have asked for an increase in counseling staff for social-emotional needs in the elementary grades.

714
00:51:47,989 --> 00:51:49,170
[SPEAKER_15]: How is it working out this year?

715
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:53,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you mean last year?

716
00:51:53,993 --> 00:52:02,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have enough staff to meet the needs of the elementary children that may need help or counseling or just a shoulder to lean on?

717
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we approve the program?

718
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:08,545
[SPEAKER_12]: We currently do not have any guidance Councilors in the elementary schools.

719
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:12,388
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do have school adjustment Councilors and school psychologists.

720
00:52:12,468 --> 00:52:15,550
[SPEAKER_12]: And at this current moment, I believe they are meeting the needs.

721
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,231
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would have to defer that to Ms.

722
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:21,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Medaglio because I believe she might be talking about those services.

723
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:21,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

724
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:24,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you put together a small report and send it back to us, please?

725
00:52:24,735 --> 00:52:25,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

726
00:52:25,356 --> 00:52:25,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

727
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:29,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

728
00:52:29,098 --> 00:52:29,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

729
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:31,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

730
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,282
[SPEAKER_16]: So you talked a little bit about school brains and how everybody was trained on school brains.

731
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:40,579
[SPEAKER_16]: And my question isn't directed at you, it's really to the superintendent.

732
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:52,608
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a note from a parent in the last few weeks about teachers not putting the grades of students into the system so that they could see them.

733
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:58,113
[SPEAKER_16]: So I directed the parent directly to Dr. Perala, who was handling that one situation.

734
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:10,655
[SPEAKER_16]: But overall, could you please check to make sure that throughout the district and provide us with a report as to whether everybody is up and running and posting homework and grades on School Brains.

735
00:53:11,696 --> 00:53:15,497
[SPEAKER_16]: And if not, a timeline for everybody to be up and running.

736
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:23,801
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we talked about this previously, but I'd like to know if there are any teachers in the district that are struggling that you need to help along this process.

737
00:53:23,861 --> 00:53:26,302
[SPEAKER_16]: And if so, how many there are and where they're located.

738
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:30,672
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm requesting a report, um, make it a motion for a report at that time.

739
00:53:30,692 --> 00:53:31,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I need a second.

740
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:32,993
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a meeting.

741
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:34,614
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I take the motion.

742
00:53:35,614 --> 00:53:35,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

743
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:36,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

744
00:53:36,575 --> 00:53:40,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, Mr. Benedetto second by Mr. Um, scary.

745
00:53:40,477 --> 00:53:41,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, all in favor.

746
00:53:41,237 --> 00:53:41,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

747
00:53:42,297 --> 00:53:42,838
[SPEAKER_03]: All opposed.

748
00:53:44,078 --> 00:53:44,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

749
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:49,441
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a meeting today on a number of issues, including certain elements of technology.

750
00:53:50,121 --> 00:53:53,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And this came up and the feeling was, is that the teachers are making,

751
00:53:53,945 --> 00:53:57,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Very, very good progress in most instances using school brains to report out.

752
00:53:59,149 --> 00:54:00,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing is 100%, I'm sure.

753
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,952
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll try to get a better, more definitive report for you.

754
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:05,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

755
00:54:05,734 --> 00:54:12,719
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to follow up with, if one parent calls and there's other parents that are feeling the same way, it just haven't made that call.

756
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,923
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to thank you and your department.

757
00:54:24,003 --> 00:54:25,504
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you run a lot of different things.

758
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:27,825
[SPEAKER_16]: I know your staff has increased in the last few years.

759
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:31,287
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like there's more and more programming.

760
00:54:31,707 --> 00:54:41,312
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you handling the merger of students with the vocational side as well as the high school side and children going back and forth?

761
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:45,424
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we sharing some of those students or how are we looking at that?

762
00:54:45,504 --> 00:54:46,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so that's a very good question.

763
00:54:47,946 --> 00:54:53,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving forward, so starting next year, we are looking at completely integrating the students with all the Councilors.

764
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:59,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Up until now, students who have identified that they are attending the vocational school

765
00:54:59,677 --> 00:55:01,678
[SPEAKER_12]: have been placed with the vocational school Councilor.

766
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:06,939
[SPEAKER_12]: But the vocational school Councilor and the high school Councilors meet weekly.

767
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,359
[SPEAKER_12]: They collaborate.

768
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:12,801
[SPEAKER_12]: The high school Councilors are very much informed and trained in vocational education.

769
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:16,902
[SPEAKER_12]: And the vocational school Councilor has also been working

770
00:55:18,043 --> 00:55:21,525
[SPEAKER_12]: on college applications and doing everything that a high school Councilor does.

771
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:23,886
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that they're very prepared for this merger.

772
00:55:25,227 --> 00:55:26,888
[SPEAKER_12]: And so next year, that's what we're looking to do.

773
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:31,030
[SPEAKER_12]: With the incoming ninth graders, it will be divided evenly among the Councilors.

774
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:33,651
[SPEAKER_12]: It still has to get final approval, though.

775
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:47,078
[SPEAKER_16]: So at a high school level, including the Curtis-Thompson, the vocational school, and the high school, how many students does each guidance Councilor counsel?

776
00:55:48,175 --> 00:55:49,576
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd have to get you an exact number.

777
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have an exact number, but roughly about 300.

778
00:55:52,718 --> 00:55:56,401
[SPEAKER_16]: So each guidance Councilor is managing 300 students.

779
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:57,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

780
00:55:57,942 --> 00:55:58,823
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a lot.

781
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:05,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously at the Curtis Tufts, it's a smaller caseload, but on average, 300.

782
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:07,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

783
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:14,615
[SPEAKER_16]: That's good to know for future staffing levels, if there are increases or different needs.

784
00:56:15,816 --> 00:56:16,276
[SPEAKER_16]: What about...

785
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:27,658
[SPEAKER_16]: ESL students, do they have a specific guidance Councilor that might help them in a different way, or does the ESL teacher step in at that point?

786
00:56:27,678 --> 00:56:28,698
[SPEAKER_16]: How is that managed?

787
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:34,162
[SPEAKER_12]: So our EL students do not have a specific guidance Councilor that would be an EL Councilor.

788
00:56:35,163 --> 00:56:44,129
[SPEAKER_12]: However, they have specific support courses that we try and put them in, where one is actually called college and career preparation.

789
00:56:46,748 --> 00:56:49,250
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I believe it's called College and Career Preparation.

790
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:51,132
[SPEAKER_12]: I can get you the exact name of the course.

791
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:51,853
[SPEAKER_12]: That's OK.

792
00:56:52,213 --> 00:56:55,737
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also have summer programs that are available to these students as well.

793
00:56:56,077 --> 00:57:02,383
[SPEAKER_12]: So we do do extra outreach for these students, but they don't have a specific Councilor for EL.

794
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:04,505
[SPEAKER_12]: They do have their Councilor, though.

795
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:07,414
[SPEAKER_16]: And they help them through the process.

796
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:07,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct, yes.

797
00:57:08,495 --> 00:57:09,976
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did some training this year.

798
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,579
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually did two trainings in working with the EL population.

799
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:22,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Just providing our Councilors resources to use for these students, background on different laws and legal regulations.

800
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:24,945
[SPEAKER_12]: So they are very knowledgeable in it.

801
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,732
[SPEAKER_16]: And my final question is about the PSATs.

802
00:57:29,832 --> 00:57:37,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Now that you've taken it two years, are you seeing an increase in scores on SATs because all students have taken that prep?

803
00:57:37,338 --> 00:57:38,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you for bringing that up.

804
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,101
[SPEAKER_12]: We are seeing an increase in scores of about 100 points.

805
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:43,904
[SPEAKER_12]: on average, so that's huge.

806
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:45,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Significant.

807
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:45,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

808
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:50,609
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're also seeing students signing up for the SATs sooner than they had in previous years.

809
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:59,256
[SPEAKER_12]: So the average student would sign up for the SATs either June of their junior year or October of their senior year.

810
00:57:59,496 --> 00:58:07,983
[SPEAKER_12]: And now students are signing up in January and March of their junior year, which leads them to also end up taking an additional test and get higher scores.

811
00:58:08,704 --> 00:58:09,525
[SPEAKER_16]: Well worth the money.

812
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:09,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

813
00:58:09,965 --> 00:58:10,766
[SPEAKER_16]: It's good to hear that.

814
00:58:12,673 --> 00:58:12,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

815
00:58:12,873 --> 00:58:13,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Mustone.

816
00:58:15,215 --> 00:58:16,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the report.

817
00:58:16,336 --> 00:58:21,120
[SPEAKER_02]: The last bullet where it says middle school guidance assisted in the implementation of the umbrella project.

818
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not heard anything about it.

819
00:58:23,784 --> 00:58:26,685
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the Umbrella Project's role at the middle school?

820
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:37,550
[SPEAKER_12]: So the Umbrella Project is a program that is happening at the McGlynn Middle School, and it's being led by the guidance department and Ian Charles, the assistant principal there.

821
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:49,416
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's really a support program to help identify students who are at risk, whether that's social, emotional, or behavioral, and putting them on plans that help support them throughout the year.

822
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:51,797
[SPEAKER_12]: So kind of doing an early intervention with those students.

823
00:58:52,107 --> 00:58:54,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many kids are enrolled in the Umbrella Project?

824
00:58:54,790 --> 00:59:00,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how many are currently, but I know that last year there were about 25 that completed the program.

825
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:02,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and are there plans for it to go to the Andrews?

826
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:04,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure about that.

827
00:59:05,002 --> 00:59:05,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

828
00:59:06,103 --> 00:59:12,351
[SPEAKER_12]: I know when Ian Charles came in, he was a driving force with this program.

829
00:59:13,686 --> 00:59:26,143
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Councilors jumped on board and really did all of the support work for it because they provided the extra space for the students to do the work, to do their homework, to be pulled from their exploratory courses.

830
00:59:27,324 --> 00:59:29,227
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sure if it's going to be going to the Andrews.

831
00:59:29,327 --> 00:59:29,868
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't heard.

832
00:59:31,597 --> 00:59:33,558
[SPEAKER_12]: We could look into that, though, because I know that there are.

833
00:59:33,578 --> 00:59:34,039
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be great.

834
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:34,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

835
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,322
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is whether or not it could be moved to the Andrews.

836
00:59:38,782 --> 00:59:39,202
[SPEAKER_05]: To the Andrews.

837
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:41,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think any program can be moved.

838
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:47,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And really, principals have to weigh in as to whether they believe it would be effective for them or whether they want to do something else.

839
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:51,511
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Andrews uses things like Study Island and other things like that.

840
00:59:51,551 --> 00:59:57,995
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to give principals some degree of autonomy to make decisions that they believe are in the best interest.

841
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:03,427
[SPEAKER_10]: It could very well be that they adopt something from another school that they believe would work for them too.

842
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:04,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll check into it.

843
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:05,210
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get back.

844
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:05,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

845
01:00:07,593 --> 01:00:08,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll set me up.

846
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:08,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

847
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:09,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

848
01:00:09,216 --> 01:00:09,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

849
01:00:10,297 --> 01:00:10,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Skerry.

850
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:13,121
[SPEAKER_15]: I made it through you to the superintendent.

851
01:00:13,422 --> 01:00:13,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh,

852
01:00:13,889 --> 01:00:18,391
[SPEAKER_15]: included in this report was the fact that they have one computer that's not working.

853
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:29,456
[SPEAKER_15]: I was wondering if we could get in touch with Mr. Trotter, see if we can get that replaced and also try to get a new computer for the secretary sooner rather than later to help the office run efficiently.

854
01:00:30,697 --> 01:00:38,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me check on it to make sure that I understand what really isn't working or what is slower than might be desired or

855
01:00:39,158 --> 01:00:42,340
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, an upgrade or whatever the case may be, but we'll certainly give you a report back.

856
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:50,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, because I think we owe it to our staff to make sure that they have equipment that works every day, every time that they want to use it.

857
01:00:50,326 --> 01:00:54,589
[SPEAKER_15]: And it benefits not only the guidance department, but the students.

858
01:00:54,969 --> 01:00:55,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

859
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:56,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

860
01:00:57,791 --> 01:00:57,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

861
01:00:57,991 --> 01:00:58,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

862
01:00:58,732 --> 01:00:59,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hi.

863
01:00:59,472 --> 01:00:59,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

864
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:01,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Jensen.

865
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:04,156
[SPEAKER_11]: The report was great.

866
01:01:04,176 --> 01:01:07,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to mention one of the goals for this upcoming year,

867
01:01:07,818 --> 01:01:16,282
[SPEAKER_11]: which is the online program to assist students' graduation rate, offering enrichment courses and the alternate programs.

868
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:22,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to know, now, the information, I think it might be out now, is it online?

869
01:01:22,425 --> 01:01:28,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, do the students, was a message sent out so the students know and they can take advantage of it?

870
01:01:28,988 --> 01:01:33,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it more of the guidance department might approach a student or parent and

871
01:01:34,346 --> 01:01:37,268
[SPEAKER_11]: let them know they think they might be a good fit for something like that?

872
01:01:37,688 --> 01:01:42,051
[SPEAKER_12]: So currently right now the district is piloting the Ingenuity Play-Doh program.

873
01:01:42,772 --> 01:01:48,455
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're using it with our juniors and seniors, not yet with our freshmen and sophomores.

874
01:01:51,137 --> 01:02:05,172
[SPEAKER_12]: any student who is looking to make up a course, whether that's going to be in summer school or in the past they had come to the guidance office and asked to make up a course and we had referred them to Somerville online school or we had referred them to BYU online school.

875
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:07,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we will be referring them obviously to our school.

876
01:02:08,927 --> 01:02:10,268
[SPEAKER_12]: They can be taking this course with us.

877
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:23,058
[SPEAKER_12]: So we haven't yet, this isn't something that we have put out to the public yet, but when students come to us or when the guidance Councilors approach the students about needing a credit recovery course, this is the option that's given to them.

878
01:02:24,419 --> 01:02:30,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're looking to also expand this program for students to take quarterly enrichment courses, so not just credit recovery.

879
01:02:32,646 --> 01:02:35,008
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's something that we're continuing to grow this year.

880
01:02:35,929 --> 01:02:37,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a cost associated with it?

881
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:48,895
[SPEAKER_12]: The cost is $125 for the course, which is cheaper than the other online options that they were given in the past.

882
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:51,057
[SPEAKER_11]: And how long is the course?

883
01:02:51,137 --> 01:02:53,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a six-week course?

884
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:55,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a three-week course?

885
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just a little curious.

886
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:58,403
[SPEAKER_12]: So the courses are self-paced.

887
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:01,325
[SPEAKER_12]: The students can finish them as quickly as they would like.

888
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,292
[SPEAKER_12]: and it is all dependent on the course.

889
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:13,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I know over summer school, Mr. Ciari had used this online program, I believe, for biology.

890
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:15,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was biology.

891
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And he had gone into the biology course.

892
01:03:19,142 --> 01:03:26,766
[SPEAKER_12]: And the great thing about this program is that the teachers can go in, and they can look at the standards that the course is teaching, and they can take them out.

893
01:03:26,926 --> 01:03:28,107
[SPEAKER_12]: They can put in their own standards.

894
01:03:28,127 --> 01:03:33,490
[SPEAKER_12]: So they can really modify the course for what they believe the need is for the student or for the class that's being offered.

895
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,392
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this summer, that course was offered for six weeks.

896
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:42,458
[SPEAKER_12]: But the benefit of it is that if students didn't finish within the six weeks, they had until the end of the summer to take it.

897
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:45,560
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're looking at that moving forward.

898
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:54,767
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Dr. Pella and the central administration has been working with the directors to have them go through and look at some of these courses and modify some of these courses.

899
01:03:54,867 --> 01:03:57,930
[SPEAKER_12]: They were just trained, I believe it was in January.

900
01:03:59,563 --> 01:03:59,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

901
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:00,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

902
01:04:00,464 --> 01:04:01,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds exciting.

903
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:01,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

904
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:01,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

905
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:02,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

906
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:03,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

907
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:04,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

908
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you Ms.

909
01:04:06,027 --> 01:04:07,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Jensen for the report.

910
01:04:07,828 --> 01:04:10,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very particular and a lot of details.

911
01:04:12,752 --> 01:04:14,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the Coffee with the Councilors.

912
01:04:15,113 --> 01:04:16,474
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you promote that?

913
01:04:16,554 --> 01:04:21,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just by being online or was there a robocall made out to parents?

914
01:04:21,697 --> 01:04:24,778
[SPEAKER_03]: What time was it scheduled and is it individual?

915
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:28,040
[SPEAKER_12]: The Coffee with the Councilors is something that we're doing this year based on

916
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:34,504
[SPEAKER_12]: parent requests from previous years.

917
01:04:34,544 --> 01:04:41,570
[SPEAKER_12]: They said there are so many night events, there are so many games or sporting events that they had to go to, that they really would like a time to come to the school during the day.

918
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:46,775
[SPEAKER_12]: And we realized that this isn't necessarily ideal for all parents, but we wanted to provide this opportunity for some of them.

919
01:04:47,296 --> 01:04:52,200
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're doing this quarterly, and each quarter there's a different topic.

920
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:57,902
[SPEAKER_12]: The Councilors are giving a mini-presentation, about 15 minutes, going over some current information.

921
01:04:58,842 --> 01:05:02,923
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it's also a time for the Councilors to break out into groups with their parents.

922
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:07,684
[SPEAKER_12]: And the parents can talk to one another, they can talk to the Councilors, they can get grade-specific information.

923
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:10,145
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so far it's been pretty popular.

924
01:05:10,185 --> 01:05:11,165
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had a good turnout.

925
01:05:11,505 --> 01:05:19,047
[SPEAKER_12]: And the way that we've advertised it is through the blog, through Lisa Evangelista posting, the website, and then we've also done a robocall home.

926
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:20,628
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds great.

927
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:31,856
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I was going to ask is, it says you've connected over 75% of at-risk seniors, which means it's 2.5 GPA or lower.

928
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:38,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want people thinking that it's a 1.5 or anything like that.

929
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:42,143
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just wondering, how did you connect and what is the plan?

930
01:05:44,305 --> 01:05:51,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've really utilized our Councilor who's in charge of school and community partnerships.

931
01:05:51,629 --> 01:06:02,956
[SPEAKER_12]: And what he does is he really looks at programs that have a proven successful track record and ones that will meet the most needs of our students.

932
01:06:03,016 --> 01:06:06,298
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's been able to bring in a lot of outside programs, which are some of them that I've listed.

933
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:16,425
[SPEAKER_12]: During the day, there will be many assemblies or many meetings, whether it's during lunch or during a class, where these students can come down and learn about these programs and sign up for them.

934
01:06:17,146 --> 01:06:18,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

935
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:21,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see that you've had the second C3 day.

936
01:06:21,389 --> 01:06:21,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

937
01:06:21,869 --> 01:06:22,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did that go?

938
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:28,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have students that really took advantage of going off to different colleges or did they stay?

939
01:06:28,975 --> 01:06:29,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

940
01:06:29,215 --> 01:06:32,858
[SPEAKER_12]: So the majority of our students ended up going and visiting a school.

941
01:06:32,918 --> 01:06:35,940
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to get the excused absence, they have to bring proof back that they

942
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,901
[SPEAKER_12]: did one of those activities.

943
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,084
[SPEAKER_12]: And the majority of them do visit a college.

944
01:06:41,924 --> 01:06:46,088
[SPEAKER_12]: But we did have some students who did other activities as well, like a job shadow.

945
01:06:46,148 --> 01:06:47,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them did community service.

946
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:54,034
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we also had an admissions officer from Tufts come to campus and give an essay writing workshop.

947
01:06:57,332 --> 01:07:02,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that my colleague asked, the councillors at the high school have about 300 students a piece, correct?

948
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:03,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

949
01:07:03,874 --> 01:07:13,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are still doing it that it's not, we're doing it in alphabetical order so that way not everyone has, there's no longer a class of 300 of seniors.

950
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:14,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

951
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:20,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and so with that being said, how many seniors does each councillor have, do you know?

952
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Depending on the year, anywhere between 60 to 90.

953
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,341
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 to 90.

954
01:07:29,123 --> 01:07:29,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

955
01:07:29,924 --> 01:07:35,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place this report on file?

956
01:07:36,212 --> 01:07:38,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

957
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:38,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

958
01:07:39,136 --> 01:07:39,897
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

959
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:40,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

960
01:07:40,537 --> 01:07:41,318
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

961
01:07:41,479 --> 01:07:42,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

962
01:07:44,536 --> 01:07:46,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I'm sorry, can I mention one more thing?

963
01:07:46,898 --> 01:07:53,103
[SPEAKER_12]: We did have our 8th grade course selection night last week, so this is something separate other than the guidance board.

964
01:07:53,724 --> 01:07:57,107
[SPEAKER_12]: And this was last Tuesday, it was the 8th grade course selection night.

965
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,948
[SPEAKER_12]: All of the 8th graders came to the high school.

966
01:07:59,228 --> 01:08:00,930
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a huge turnout.

967
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,591
[SPEAKER_12]: The entire Caron Theater was filled.

968
01:08:02,731 --> 01:08:09,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Parents got to listen to Dr. Prella and Dr. Riccio give presentations on

969
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:14,517
[SPEAKER_12]: the integrating of the two schools and where are schools going in the future.

970
01:08:14,537 --> 01:08:19,621
[SPEAKER_12]: They also got to hear about the registration and scheduling process of the high school.

971
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:29,769
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wanted to let you know that we received very positive feedback from parents on the integration of the two schools and the additional opportunities that this is going to be affording students.

972
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:32,271
[SPEAKER_12]: So they really like to hear that students could graduate

973
01:08:34,072 --> 01:08:42,535
[SPEAKER_12]: with a certificate program from the vocational school, that they could also graduate with dual enrollment credits, and those same students could graduate with AP credits.

974
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:44,575
[SPEAKER_12]: So they were very, very excited about that.

975
01:08:45,335 --> 01:08:53,638
[SPEAKER_12]: They also liked the simplicity in the scheduling process that we're pushing for for this year, which includes a limited option of electives for freshmen.

976
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:57,659
[SPEAKER_12]: So our freshmen are going to be offered the CTE Exploratory,

977
01:08:58,499 --> 01:09:14,227
[SPEAKER_12]: an art course or a music course, which will be band, orchestra, or chorus, and we're limiting that for freshmen because we really feel that in order to explore and in order to have a freshman year that is not as overwhelming, it would be better to limit those courses.

978
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:21,230
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're hoping for a big turnout in the CTE Exploratory, which would allow students to explore 20 different careers.

979
01:09:22,101 --> 01:09:23,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good, thank you.

980
01:09:23,582 --> 01:09:23,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

981
01:09:23,762 --> 01:09:24,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno, follow-up?

982
01:09:25,264 --> 01:09:26,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please, a follow-up to that.

983
01:09:26,825 --> 01:09:34,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're going to limit our freshmen, then what happens with our other classes as far as the electives?

984
01:09:34,391 --> 01:09:40,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they still going to have a good amount of students in them, or are we going to have electives that we only have a couple of students in them?

985
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:47,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we will be having, so all the freshmen will be in some sort of elective, whether it's music, art, or a CT exploratory.

986
01:09:48,503 --> 01:09:51,085
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other electives, we are assuming that a few,

987
01:09:51,642 --> 01:09:56,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Fewer students will be in them, but we're still offering all of our electives.

988
01:09:56,486 --> 01:10:00,770
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just going to be offering them alternating years, some of them on alternating years.

989
01:10:02,171 --> 01:10:05,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when we ran the numbers, it doesn't look like the classes will be 15.

990
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:08,457
[SPEAKER_12]: They will be more like 20 instead of 25, 26, 27.

991
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,060
[SPEAKER_03]: How many electives do we have in all?

992
01:10:13,061 --> 01:10:14,302
[SPEAKER_12]: I think almost 70.

993
01:10:15,323 --> 01:10:18,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many are we going to limit to the freshmen?

994
01:10:18,065 --> 01:10:18,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it 20?

995
01:10:19,074 --> 01:10:26,819
[SPEAKER_12]: So the freshmen have a choice of five different electives, but if they take the CTE Exploratory, they explore 20 different career technical programs.

996
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

997
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:29,661
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

998
01:10:30,882 --> 01:10:31,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

999
01:10:31,062 --> 01:10:31,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Klooten.

1000
01:10:32,403 --> 01:10:34,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not quite sure what you said in that.

1001
01:10:34,585 --> 01:10:41,950
[SPEAKER_14]: So a freshman can't take art and band together?

1002
01:10:43,028 --> 01:10:48,311
[SPEAKER_12]: So in past years, they've never been able to take ART and BAND together because ART is four credits and BAND is four credits.

1003
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:49,331
[SPEAKER_12]: They would have to choose.

1004
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:51,172
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty much the same.

1005
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:57,275
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing that's changing is we have a lot of mini courses, a lot of two-credit courses.

1006
01:10:57,635 --> 01:11:02,697
[SPEAKER_12]: So when freshmen came in, if they took a two-credit course, they'd have to take two of the two-credit courses.

1007
01:11:02,777 --> 01:11:04,818
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was just a lot of courses for them to balance.

1008
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:07,980
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've really limited the courses that we're offering to the freshmen.

1009
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And each one of them is going to be four credits.

1010
01:11:10,721 --> 01:11:14,203
[SPEAKER_12]: So they won't be bouncing around from elective to elective to elective their freshman year.

1011
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:15,844
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll have one elective.

1012
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:24,169
[SPEAKER_12]: But they still have all of those opportunities for them sophomore, junior and senior year.

1013
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,612
[SPEAKER_12]: So it didn't close off on any pathways for students.

1014
01:11:31,313 --> 01:11:35,415
[SPEAKER_14]: So is that for the whole school year, they would just have one elective?

1015
01:11:35,575 --> 01:11:35,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

1016
01:11:37,016 --> 01:11:38,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So if they wanted to take

1017
01:11:38,747 --> 01:11:42,909
[SPEAKER_14]: So if one of the electives was guitar, they would take guitar for the whole school year.

1018
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:43,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

1019
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:47,492
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's how all of our courses right now and all of our electives do run for the full year.

1020
01:11:47,952 --> 01:11:53,175
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just they would meet two times over a six-day cycle instead of four times over a six-day cycle.

1021
01:11:54,896 --> 01:11:56,057
[SPEAKER_14]: And the pro of this is?

1022
01:11:56,077 --> 01:11:57,317
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the advantage?

1023
01:11:57,998 --> 01:12:01,780
[SPEAKER_12]: The advantage of this is that students are not balancing eight and nine courses.

1024
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,001
[SPEAKER_12]: They're only balancing six to seven courses.

1025
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:06,382
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1026
01:12:06,482 --> 01:12:06,562
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1027
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:14,701
[SPEAKER_14]: The opposite of that is I got into an elective and I don't really like that one, but I love the other one I'm taking.

1028
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:17,861
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's pros and cons.

1029
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:18,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1030
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:26,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Many of the other electives were very academic heavy, which was very overwhelming for freshmen who were getting used to the high school setting.

1031
01:12:27,366 --> 01:12:33,149
[SPEAKER_12]: So we really wanted to find something that got them more hands-on experience, something that was a little bit of a break from the day.

1032
01:12:33,989 --> 01:12:37,211
[SPEAKER_12]: And the CTE Exploratory class gave that to them.

1033
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,172
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also rotate through 20 different technical programs.

1034
01:12:40,812 --> 01:12:45,375
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they don't like their current technical program, they wait a week and they get to change.

1035
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:51,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, will they get graded in that CTE exploration?

1036
01:12:51,883 --> 01:12:52,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, they're all graded.

1037
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:52,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1038
01:12:54,743 --> 01:12:55,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1039
01:12:56,184 --> 01:12:56,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1040
01:12:56,964 --> 01:13:06,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I remember when my children were picking and when they loved art and music and they couldn't do both.

1041
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:10,586
[SPEAKER_16]: And at that point they had to decide whether to do each.

1042
01:13:11,066 --> 01:13:15,087
[SPEAKER_16]: My concern is that with the opportunity to explore.

1043
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:23,079
[SPEAKER_16]: so many different shops that they could take, that it could hurt our band and our orchestra.

1044
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:41,943
[SPEAKER_16]: So we just wanna be careful of that and make sure, I know personally that the evening orchestra would still accept students if they were taking band during the day and vice versa, but I'm not sure

1045
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:44,977
[SPEAKER_16]: how that's going to affect those groups.

1046
01:13:44,997 --> 01:13:49,980
[SPEAKER_16]: So could we be careful and mindful of that when sign-ups come?

1047
01:13:50,401 --> 01:14:00,048
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also allowing students to take CTE Exploratory their sophomore year if for some reason they missed it their freshman year and would like to take it.

1048
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:04,011
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would open up the possibility for students who want to stay in music all four years.

1049
01:14:04,912 --> 01:14:05,012
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1050
01:14:05,072 --> 01:14:06,153
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1051
01:14:06,553 --> 01:14:06,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1052
01:14:07,093 --> 01:14:07,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1053
01:14:08,473 --> 01:14:09,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1054
01:14:10,174 --> 01:14:10,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1055
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:10,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuno.

1056
01:14:10,715 --> 01:14:24,166
[SPEAKER_03]: How does the technical side work into this schedule as far as when you have students coming in their freshman year, they have that opportunity to go over to the technical side to explore?

1057
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:26,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you work that into the CTE?

1058
01:14:26,268 --> 01:14:29,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I don't quite understand the question.

1059
01:14:29,991 --> 01:14:33,014
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know how students are going to have their choice of taking an elective?

1060
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:33,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1061
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:34,695
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1062
01:14:34,855 --> 01:14:37,037
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're also giving them the opportunity to go over

1063
01:14:37,464 --> 01:14:40,406
[SPEAKER_03]: to the technical side and maybe explore over there.

1064
01:14:40,827 --> 01:14:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that incorporated into those 20 or the five that you mentioned?

1065
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:50,814
[SPEAKER_12]: So the entire freshman class is not divided by vocational school, high school.

1066
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:53,396
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be one group of students.

1067
01:14:54,376 --> 01:15:01,742
[SPEAKER_12]: And no matter which, if a student has the plan of eventually going into the vocational school, they can take the CTE exploratory.

1068
01:15:02,682 --> 01:15:08,205
[SPEAKER_12]: If they don't have any plans to go into the vocational school or they don't have an interest in that, they can take some of the other electives.

1069
01:15:08,886 --> 01:15:17,851
[SPEAKER_12]: But even if they don't take the vocational exploratory, which is the 20 rotating programs, even if they don't take that, they can still opt to apply for the vocational school the 10th grade year.

1070
01:15:18,621 --> 01:15:25,044
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's what I needed the clarification on, because I think that's the confusing part of there's so many balls being juggled.

1071
01:15:25,084 --> 01:15:27,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think we were going to be able to do that.

1072
01:15:27,865 --> 01:15:30,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is now at least a clarification.

1073
01:15:30,786 --> 01:15:32,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.

1074
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:34,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't do any more follow-ups.

1075
01:15:34,187 --> 01:15:34,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1076
01:15:34,747 --> 01:15:34,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Jensen.

1077
01:15:35,008 --> 01:15:36,368
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate your being here.

1078
01:15:37,168 --> 01:15:37,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1079
01:15:38,049 --> 01:15:38,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1080
01:15:39,429 --> 01:15:40,350
[SPEAKER_05]: You voted on that, correct?

1081
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1082
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:40,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1083
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:41,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanderbilt, yes.

1084
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on transgender student rights, Mr. Superintendent.

1085
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, members of the school committee.

1086
01:15:49,882 --> 01:16:06,051
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, on February 22nd, 2017, the federal government, using an executive order from the president, rescinded guidance and determined that Title IX's prohibition on gender identity discrimination was null and void.

1087
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:13,956
[SPEAKER_10]: The president took the position that the protection of transgender rights should be left to each state.

1088
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:20,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Massachusetts law already protects the rights of transgender students in schools.

1089
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:26,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Chapter 199 of the Acts of 2011 went into effect in July 2012.

1090
01:16:26,316 --> 01:16:33,781
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford School Committee approved a local policy affirming the Massachusetts law on April 11, 2016.

1091
01:16:34,342 --> 01:16:37,464
[SPEAKER_10]: We had taken a previous position on the 13th in 2013, but we updated in 2016.

1092
01:16:37,624 --> 01:16:39,445
[SPEAKER_10]: In your packet, you have information from

1093
01:16:45,957 --> 01:16:49,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike Long, who is the legal counsel to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

1094
01:16:50,698 --> 01:16:53,839
[SPEAKER_10]: You have guidance from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

1095
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:59,980
[SPEAKER_10]: You have your own policy, the Medford Public Schools Policy, that was adopted in 2016.

1096
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:07,522
[SPEAKER_10]: You have some guidance from the MTA, the Largest Teachers Union, and you have a copy of the bills that were enacted.

1097
01:17:09,522 --> 01:17:12,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Clearly, in Medford,

1098
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:18,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And clearly, throughout Massachusetts, transgender rights are protected.

1099
01:17:20,363 --> 01:17:25,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes federal laws supersede, but not in this instance.

1100
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:31,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Because in this instance, the executive order said, let the states decide.

1101
01:17:32,253 --> 01:17:36,917
[SPEAKER_10]: In this instance, the state has decided, and we have an active plan in place

1102
01:17:37,709 --> 01:17:43,875
[SPEAKER_10]: And at this point, we have really no problems with what we've done and what we're doing in our schools.

1103
01:17:44,335 --> 01:17:46,017
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to bring you up to date on that.

1104
01:17:47,418 --> 01:18:02,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to, if I can, Mayor, also comment on the immigration rules, because I believe that's also tied to equal access to education, which is part of the same vein of thinking as the transgender rule.

1105
01:18:05,188 --> 01:18:15,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I've given you an advisory from Mara Healy, the Massachusetts Attorney General, on equal access to public education for all students, irrespective of immigration status.

1106
01:18:19,516 --> 01:18:31,001
[SPEAKER_10]: In Massachusetts, the Supreme Court of the United States recognized Brown versus Board of Education, and it is true today as it was back in 1953.

1107
01:18:34,268 --> 01:18:39,031
[SPEAKER_10]: The advisory that the Attorney General has provided you is very, very clear.

1108
01:18:39,972 --> 01:19:01,467
[SPEAKER_10]: There has been a case in Massachusetts, Filer v. Doe, in 1982, where the Supreme Court held that public elementary and secondary schools may not deny any child residing in the applicable jurisdiction access to public education, whether the child is present in the country legally or not.

1109
01:19:02,854 --> 01:19:13,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Filer made it clear that a child's immigration or citizenship status, or that his or her parents are guarding, is not relevant to the child's right to a public education.

1110
01:19:14,622 --> 01:19:22,428
[SPEAKER_10]: So, irrespective of any rulings that come down, Massachusetts law, states rights,

1111
01:19:23,552 --> 01:19:28,296
[SPEAKER_10]: made the decision that we will accept anyone who resides in our community.

1112
01:19:28,677 --> 01:19:32,200
[SPEAKER_10]: We will not ask them what their status is, visa or otherwise.

1113
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:38,085
[SPEAKER_10]: We will not pursue anything other than the fact they are not living in the community.

1114
01:19:38,105 --> 01:19:40,867
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're not living in the community, it's a residence issue.

1115
01:19:41,548 --> 01:19:47,754
[SPEAKER_10]: But if they're living in the community, whether they're living with their parents or they're residing with some other responsible adult,

1116
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:53,393
[SPEAKER_10]: we will provide them free and public access to our educational system.

1117
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:59,616
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to clarify that I am not allowed to ask what a person's visa status is.

1118
01:19:59,636 --> 01:20:02,437
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not allowed to ask what their immigrant status is.

1119
01:20:02,457 --> 01:20:04,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not allowed to ask for some of these things.

1120
01:20:05,919 --> 01:20:12,683
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, in some instances, there are people that are homeless, and I might have to accept that just simply based on homelessness.

1121
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:17,678
[SPEAKER_10]: We just had a webinar today on homelessness that dealt with foster children.

1122
01:20:17,698 --> 01:20:19,159
[SPEAKER_10]: More guidance is coming out on that.

1123
01:20:20,099 --> 01:20:27,423
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to make it clear that we're an equal opportunity school system, whether it's transgender or immigrant status.

1124
01:20:27,963 --> 01:20:36,488
[SPEAKER_10]: If a youngster resides in our community, they're entitled to free access to our public education system, and that's the way we will treat them.

1125
01:20:37,128 --> 01:20:38,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy to take any questions.

1126
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:40,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1127
01:20:43,586 --> 01:21:09,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to receive the report place it on file seconded by mr.. Kreatz all those in favor All those opposed both reports are placed on file Report on compliance with state defibrillation law so effective July 1 2018 all schools must have automated External defibrillators on-site the good news is we have them in every one of our schools and

1128
01:21:11,175 --> 01:21:24,767
[SPEAKER_10]: An automated defibrillator, or an AED, is a medical device that will analyze heart rhythms and can deliver electric shocks to help a heart reestablish an effective rhythm during a sudden cardiac arrest.

1129
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:31,954
[SPEAKER_10]: The American Red Cross recommends that AEDs be readily available and applied within four minutes of cardiac arrest.

1130
01:21:33,475 --> 01:21:34,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, under this law,

1131
01:21:35,505 --> 01:21:37,106
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to have trained people on staff.

1132
01:21:37,306 --> 01:21:37,646
[SPEAKER_10]: We do.

1133
01:21:37,966 --> 01:21:44,088
[SPEAKER_10]: We have nurses, we've trained our coaches, and we'll train even more people to use these items.

1134
01:21:45,009 --> 01:21:49,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight, we will have a moment of silence from somebody who could have used one.

1135
01:21:52,592 --> 01:21:55,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, this is important.

1136
01:21:55,554 --> 01:21:57,436
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good to know that we're ahead of the curve.

1137
01:21:57,756 --> 01:21:58,917
[SPEAKER_10]: We have them in every school.

1138
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:02,680
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll review them to see whether or not we should be adding.

1139
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:09,365
[SPEAKER_10]: We have had good fortune working with our ambulance providers and others who have donated equipment to us.

1140
01:22:09,986 --> 01:22:21,215
[SPEAKER_10]: They get checked every day for battery effectiveness, and we have to keep that up because you never know when the equipment's there, but the battery doesn't operate, so you have to check this on a regular basis.

1141
01:22:21,962 --> 01:22:23,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have to continuously train people.

1142
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:28,772
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to make sure you're aware that we're in compliance with this law well in advance of its implementation.

1143
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:37,525
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's obviously more work that we will do to make this a more efficient and effective system for utilization should it be necessary.

1144
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:38,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1145
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:40,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto and then Ms.

1146
01:22:40,603 --> 01:22:41,804
[SPEAKER_16]: Van der Kloot.

1147
01:22:41,985 --> 01:22:42,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1148
01:22:42,865 --> 01:22:44,247
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have a few questions.

1149
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:53,175
[SPEAKER_16]: I really believe that these should be up at near our fields and somehow some way so people don't have to run back and try to get into the building to get them.

1150
01:22:53,676 --> 01:22:56,678
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how, what an appropriate trainer will bring them to the field.

1151
01:22:56,759 --> 01:22:59,001
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be brought by coaches and trainers.

1152
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:00,582
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have them available on the fields.

1153
01:23:01,103 --> 01:23:01,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1154
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:08,552
[SPEAKER_16]: And also a list near every defibrillator, who is trained, like a list of people trained to use it.

1155
01:23:09,032 --> 01:23:12,853
[SPEAKER_16]: So that way, if it's a need, they know who to immediately go to.

1156
01:23:13,353 --> 01:23:26,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we, and I also would like a list of all school employees, of who has been trained, how many people, where they are located, where they're working.

1157
01:23:26,538 --> 01:23:28,919
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an important thing that could save people's lives.

1158
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,120
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that,

1159
01:23:31,055 --> 01:23:33,776
[SPEAKER_16]: We need more information than what's provided.

1160
01:23:33,796 --> 01:23:38,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important to recognize that I don't want people who are afraid to use this thing to use it.

1161
01:23:39,138 --> 01:23:39,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, well then we need a list.

1162
01:23:40,019 --> 01:23:42,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I want people only who are comfortable using it to use it.

1163
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,801
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some people who... Who are certified.

1164
01:23:45,001 --> 01:23:45,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and certified.

1165
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:50,323
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there are some people who would be very uncomfortable taking this device off the wall and using it.

1166
01:23:50,343 --> 01:23:52,124
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm making a motion right now, Superintendent.

1167
01:23:52,144 --> 01:23:56,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Every building will have people, and we can provide you with a list of who's trying to use it.

1168
01:23:56,466 --> 01:23:59,227
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm making a motion right now.

1169
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:10,222
[SPEAKER_16]: hopefully second by one of my colleagues, to have a list of all people certified and trained in using this and having it posted next to the defibrillators.

1170
01:24:10,302 --> 01:24:15,244
[SPEAKER_16]: So when an emergency happens, they have the defibrillator and they're like, okay, who knows how to use this?

1171
01:24:15,604 --> 01:24:21,566
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a list of people right then and there and they say, oh, he's on the other side of the field, go get Joe.

1172
01:24:21,786 --> 01:24:24,847
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're not going to the wrong direction to get somebody.

1173
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:26,896
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's imperative.

1174
01:24:26,976 --> 01:24:29,737
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've made the motion, seconded by my colleague.

1175
01:24:31,498 --> 01:24:32,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call vote, please.

1176
01:24:32,339 --> 01:24:33,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

1177
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:33,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1178
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:35,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot, still speaking on this topic?

1179
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:39,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that we have enough people in the schools.

1180
01:24:39,862 --> 01:24:41,183
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're saying you're working on it.

1181
01:24:42,184 --> 01:24:46,286
[SPEAKER_14]: I was thinking about a meeting I attended recently down at one of the middle schools.

1182
01:24:46,366 --> 01:24:48,687
[SPEAKER_14]: And at that point, there was no school nurse present.

1183
01:24:48,767 --> 01:24:53,129
[SPEAKER_14]: There was, in fact, maybe the only person present might have been a principal.

1184
01:24:55,665 --> 01:25:12,553
[SPEAKER_14]: So that if I was a parent attending, or for that matter, a school committee member attending with a history of heart disease in the family, you know, just make sure that it would be great if we could really encourage as many people as possible to learn how to do this.

1185
01:25:12,573 --> 01:25:20,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to be careful that we have sufficient numbers, but that we don't put people in situations of doing things that we're uncomfortable doing.

1186
01:25:21,177 --> 01:25:22,218
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very different than an EpiPen.

1187
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:25,746
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people can use an EpiPen very effectively.

1188
01:25:25,826 --> 01:25:30,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Superintendent didn't say anything about forcing people to do it who didn't want to do it.

1189
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:34,011
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking that there are people who, in fact, would like to learn how to do it.

1190
01:25:34,031 --> 01:25:34,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand what you're saying.

1191
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:40,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make it clear that this isn't one of those things like CPR that everyone is going to be trained in.

1192
01:25:40,194 --> 01:25:47,998
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that you really want to make sure that the four or five people in the building who are the go-to people are the people that are really comfortable using a device like this.

1193
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:51,520
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a very sophisticated device.

1194
01:25:53,828 --> 01:26:00,890
[SPEAKER_04]: miss, miss, you all set this fan clue, miss must own the nurses.

1195
01:26:11,014 --> 01:26:12,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that, but I will check that.

1196
01:26:12,894 --> 01:26:20,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that, but I'm told by Tony Vento that they check them every day and that's their, one of their responsibilities.

1197
01:26:20,357 --> 01:26:20,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Now,

1198
01:26:21,533 --> 01:26:26,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it be that one day went by when they didn't entirely possible, but we will certainly reinforce that.

1199
01:26:26,957 --> 01:26:35,042
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to make sure that, you know, the people that use this know what they're doing, but we'll provide that.

1200
01:26:36,503 --> 01:26:37,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a question.

1201
01:26:37,523 --> 01:26:43,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, do the schools, um, conduct like practice drills to prepare for an emergency?

1202
01:26:44,348 --> 01:26:50,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so they can time themselves because it does, I guess the device has to be applied within four minutes.

1203
01:26:51,094 --> 01:27:08,956
[SPEAKER_11]: of the cardiac arrest, so I was just curious, like, if you're in the high school and it's in the front lobby and somebody's way down and they have to, you know, walkie-talkie that person, come down here, we have an emergency, they have to go get the defibrillator and then get to the person, you know, I was just curious, like, how that was going to work.

1204
01:27:11,368 --> 01:27:16,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Four minutes is the guideline from the point of which the heart stops.

1205
01:27:16,952 --> 01:27:22,897
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not for the person starting to feel chest pain or starting to feel dizzy or things of that type.

1206
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:24,638
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's tricky.

1207
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:28,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously, you know, we have a 500,000 square foot high school.

1208
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:29,742
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1209
01:27:29,762 --> 01:27:31,043
[SPEAKER_10]: And things can happen anywhere.

1210
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:37,467
[SPEAKER_10]: But obviously, you know, our goal is to get people to the scene as quickly as possible.

1211
01:27:37,487 --> 01:27:38,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing with CPR.

1212
01:27:38,808 --> 01:27:39,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing with any other.

1213
01:27:40,093 --> 01:27:44,936
[SPEAKER_10]: with EpiPens, anything that requires a medical intervention to get them there as quickly as possible.

1214
01:27:45,536 --> 01:27:51,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go over it with Tony and with other people and see exactly if we can give you more specifics as to how they would respond.

1215
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. Benedetto.

1216
01:28:11,028 --> 01:28:11,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Each floor.

1217
01:28:12,588 --> 01:28:15,929
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope.

1218
01:28:17,049 --> 01:28:17,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

1219
01:28:17,249 --> 01:28:17,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

1220
01:28:18,049 --> 01:28:19,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Benetton.

1221
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:29,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one point of information is that on the fields, our athletic director, I'm sorry, our athletic trainer is always there.

1222
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:32,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that she knows what she's doing.

1223
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:44,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that when we have games and when she's not able to be at a particular game because she's at another game, we also have EMTs that have to be on the field to make sure that they're there.

1224
01:28:44,338 --> 01:28:46,139
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that part of it.

1225
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:55,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the curiosity of that is we can't mandate everybody to take it, and we have to make sure that we are letting the people that want to do this

1226
01:28:56,469 --> 01:28:57,509
[SPEAKER_03]: learn it the correct way.

1227
01:28:58,090 --> 01:29:02,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So is Tony Vento going to be providing the courses, the classes?

1228
01:29:02,472 --> 01:29:10,155
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll sit with Tony, and let's go over a list of people who are more likely to be available and capable.

1229
01:29:10,856 --> 01:29:13,437
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll approach them and try to add to the list.

1230
01:29:14,337 --> 01:29:24,562
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's unlikely that we're going to be able to get every person in every corner, nor should we try, because I think inappropriate application is more dangerous than none at all.

1231
01:29:26,357 --> 01:29:27,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm strong is more than willing.

1232
01:29:27,517 --> 01:29:48,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I know in this building as well to train whoever wants to learn more than willing to train people Thank you, there's a motion on the floor offered by mr. Benedetto seconded by mr. Scary Roll call vote has been requested as well as Mia miss my stones question I actually forget what your question was I'm sorry

1233
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:56,640
[SPEAKER_05]: The list by school and to also have a list posted next to the defibrillator.

1234
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:00,823
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's checked every day and if it's signed off on.

1235
01:30:00,843 --> 01:30:01,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Maintenance.

1236
01:30:01,443 --> 01:30:03,464
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, roll call vote.

1237
01:30:03,484 --> 01:30:03,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1238
01:30:03,544 --> 01:30:03,944
[SPEAKER_05]: VanDekloot.

1239
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:20,532
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1240
01:30:20,912 --> 01:30:21,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1241
01:30:22,513 --> 01:30:25,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Update report on elementary class size, Mr. Superintendent.

1242
01:30:25,714 --> 01:30:28,755
[SPEAKER_10]: You asked for a report that broke it out by actual classes.

1243
01:30:29,295 --> 01:30:30,816
[SPEAKER_10]: You have that report in front of you.

1244
01:30:30,996 --> 01:30:32,777
[SPEAKER_10]: It was appended to the previous report.

1245
01:30:33,377 --> 01:30:38,418
[SPEAKER_10]: It shows you what each teacher has as of the same date that the previous report was provided.

1246
01:30:38,438 --> 01:30:42,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to take any questions.

1247
01:30:42,599 --> 01:30:44,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept this report and place on file by Ms.

1248
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:45,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Disceri.

1249
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second on the floor?

1250
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:47,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1251
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:47,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Vandekloot.

1252
01:30:48,781 --> 01:30:49,641
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1253
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:51,361
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1254
01:30:51,421 --> 01:30:52,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1255
01:30:52,441 --> 01:30:54,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1256
01:30:55,573 --> 01:30:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Mister Benedetto.

1257
01:30:56,593 --> 01:30:57,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, thank you so much.

1258
01:30:57,554 --> 01:31:01,755
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, I want to thank you for providing us with this report in a timely manner.

1259
01:31:02,135 --> 01:31:20,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Secondly, I would like you to present it to the City Council as they requested the numbers, and I ask that they get the breakdown as well, so that they can see all the transparency and that where our schools are highly populated in certain areas, okay?

1260
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:44,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, this report will become very handy as well when you provide us the other report on any new developments in the city and where kids are, if the new developments are in the area where our numbers are higher, that will give us some information and some planning for our budget and for our space, because we want to make sure we have enough space for all the children.

1261
01:31:45,943 --> 01:31:57,829
[SPEAKER_16]: The next thing I wanted to say is, having looked at this report, I'm wondering does this include children that may be in a supported class and come into the regular classroom?

1262
01:31:58,109 --> 01:31:59,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Do the numbers go up during the day?

1263
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:06,253
[SPEAKER_10]: If a youngster comes from a substantially separated class, they come with the teachers or the staff that's with them.

1264
01:32:06,853 --> 01:32:11,996
[SPEAKER_10]: So these numbers could, during the day... A number could increase mostly for gym or for some of the larger

1265
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:17,832
[SPEAKER_10]: activities, but certainly not for classes that are substantially contained.

1266
01:32:18,452 --> 01:32:23,494
[SPEAKER_16]: So not, not most, most generally not for academic classes, but more social classes.

1267
01:32:23,534 --> 01:32:27,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Although occasionally a youngster may try, they may try to put a youngster in a class.

1268
01:32:27,035 --> 01:32:27,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1269
01:32:27,635 --> 01:32:31,797
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to be clear and put it out there because that, you know, that's a question that's always asked.

1270
01:32:31,877 --> 01:32:41,320
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing you got to keep in mind is on any given day, you know, with not to say that we encourage this, but any given day, a hundred percent of the pupils aren't always in attendance.

1271
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:48,307
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have 20 youngsters in the class, you might have 18 on a given day, you know, on that day and then another day you might have all 20.

1272
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:52,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So it just depends on who's there on any given day as well.

1273
01:32:53,870 --> 01:33:02,535
[SPEAKER_16]: So my, my other comment is that just looking at this is that the second grade class is, is pretty, it's a pretty big class.

1274
01:33:03,615 --> 01:33:08,098
[SPEAKER_16]: So we want to keep that in mind when, um, the, as they get older.

1275
01:33:08,784 --> 01:33:11,686
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, because that's a large grouping of students.

1276
01:33:11,726 --> 01:33:21,232
[SPEAKER_16]: You have almost across the board an average of over 22, except for the Brooks School, which is a little bit smaller.

1277
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:24,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

1278
01:33:28,858 --> 01:33:32,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Just this past month, we've had a bubble in our second grade.

1279
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:36,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the McGlynn and at the Roberts in particular,

1280
01:33:37,117 --> 01:33:40,380
[SPEAKER_06]: We had five new students just for second grade.

1281
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:45,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, there is a bubble that's going on in that particular classroom.

1282
01:33:46,024 --> 01:33:52,229
[SPEAKER_06]: We have students moving into Station Landing and students, you know, where the Malden-Metford line is, where all the apartments are.

1283
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:55,291
[SPEAKER_06]: We had one or two students moving in from that area.

1284
01:33:55,331 --> 01:34:00,275
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just unusual that we would have five, particularly in second grade.

1285
01:34:00,815 --> 01:34:04,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Those students were all designated for the McGlynn Elementary School.

1286
01:34:04,822 --> 01:34:08,425
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually had to split them up because I couldn't put five new students.

1287
01:34:08,465 --> 01:34:13,369
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see at the McGlynn Elementary, we have 23 and 24 students.

1288
01:34:13,809 --> 01:34:16,231
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Roberts has always been high in second grade.

1289
01:34:17,912 --> 01:34:23,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's a way we could transport students on a bus, we will try to do that just to make sure our numbers don't go over 24.

1290
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:41,064
[SPEAKER_16]: The only concern I have with that is siblings or, you know, if they've already been in a building for a while and they're comfortable there to at some point switch them because of the number of students in that particular school.

1291
01:34:41,524 --> 01:34:47,706
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, that's not my hope is to have to do that to any family or any students.

1292
01:34:48,926 --> 01:34:49,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would.

1293
01:34:49,186 --> 01:34:53,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the other thing we need to be cognizant of is that if they have siblings, then siblings we would

1294
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,641
[SPEAKER_06]: just out of courtesy, move the siblings with the family as well.

1295
01:34:56,781 --> 01:35:01,243
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could be conceivably two or three students in one school move.

1296
01:35:03,505 --> 01:35:11,749
[SPEAKER_16]: It just seems like the numbers are somewhat higher than I anticipated for our second and maybe third grade.

1297
01:35:12,029 --> 01:35:14,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Looks a little high in some schools to me.

1298
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:16,492
[SPEAKER_16]: And a little bit in fourth.

1299
01:35:16,772 --> 01:35:21,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to keep an eye on this, and if more students in that age level come into the district,

1300
01:35:22,336 --> 01:35:30,360
[SPEAKER_16]: We just want to be very, very aware of those class sizes and keep an eye on them throughout the calendar year.

1301
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:34,202
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm glad that we are now getting this report twice a year.

1302
01:35:34,402 --> 01:35:43,587
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that was a motion that was passed so that we get it in early September when kids settling in and then again in January so we can keep an eye on this.

1303
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the report, Mr. Superintendent.

1304
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:53,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, when you present us with the new development report that was requested, could you also include this with it?

1305
01:35:53,545 --> 01:35:56,346
[SPEAKER_16]: So that way we have both reports together at the same time.

1306
01:35:56,787 --> 01:35:58,007
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it would be helpful too.

1307
01:35:58,507 --> 01:36:03,890
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you for sharing it with the city councils and being so transparent about everything.

1308
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:11,534
[SPEAKER_10]: So just so we have one understanding that we have to have all the time, I never send anything to the civil city council like this until you get it first.

1309
01:36:11,554 --> 01:36:11,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

1310
01:36:12,254 --> 01:36:12,435
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

1311
01:36:13,576 --> 01:36:19,403
[SPEAKER_10]: It may be a little bit of a wait sometimes when they ask for something like this, but you always get it first before they get it.

1312
01:36:19,683 --> 01:36:21,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate that.

1313
01:36:21,385 --> 01:36:21,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1314
01:36:21,925 --> 01:36:24,388
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we send it through the council just so you understand the process.

1315
01:36:24,629 --> 01:36:24,809
Okay.

1316
01:36:25,329 --> 01:36:28,072
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion that this report be received and placed on file.

1317
01:36:28,133 --> 01:36:29,014
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

1318
01:36:29,674 --> 01:36:30,435
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed.

1319
01:36:30,475 --> 01:36:31,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1320
01:36:32,545 --> 01:36:35,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Recommendation to approve reasonable use policy.

1321
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:50,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So this policy was in front of you earlier and we took it back to review it to make sure there were no situations that we were missing using current, you know, let's say legal opinions that were out there.

1322
01:36:50,215 --> 01:36:51,556
[SPEAKER_10]: We vetted it at this time.

1323
01:36:52,117 --> 01:36:53,938
[SPEAKER_10]: We believe that this is ready to go.

1324
01:36:54,378 --> 01:36:57,860
[SPEAKER_10]: So I recommend that you approve it.

1325
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:01,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Skerry, just one question through you, the superintendent.

1326
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:16,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Roy, I reviewed the document and it indicated two places that the individual that had the document, I read and understand the rules, I understand if they break any of the rules, I may lose the privilege of using the Internet and may have other consequences.

1327
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:19,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there space for a signature line and a date?

1328
01:37:20,562 --> 01:37:21,122
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be.

1329
01:37:21,343 --> 01:37:23,445
[SPEAKER_10]: When a person gets in the States, they sign off on the

1330
01:37:24,308 --> 01:37:30,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and on the copy that goes out to the individuals, could you please provide us a copy of it also?

1331
01:37:30,274 --> 01:37:34,577
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look on the cover page, all users must sign off on the reasonable use policy each year.

1332
01:37:34,818 --> 01:37:40,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, but I just didn't see a sign, a line for a signature or a letter.

1333
01:37:40,503 --> 01:37:46,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and it's done individually, it's not done on one sheet by each student?

1334
01:37:46,028 --> 01:37:46,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Individually.

1335
01:37:46,769 --> 01:37:47,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, thank you.

1336
01:37:48,891 --> 01:37:49,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1337
01:37:49,871 --> 01:37:50,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1338
01:37:50,112 --> 01:37:50,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

1339
01:37:51,493 --> 01:37:53,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to share some helpful tips.

1340
01:37:53,534 --> 01:38:05,258
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a good idea for all of us to make sure we keep our kids safe at home by monitoring their sites and limiting the time they spend on their devices, even when they're at home.

1341
01:38:05,618 --> 01:38:08,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of implement something similar to this in your own household.

1342
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,160
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a good idea.

1343
01:38:14,526 --> 01:38:15,246
[SPEAKER_03]: with the signature.

1344
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:21,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure that where it says here, like this is for grade five, but I'm assuming this is for everyone.

1345
01:38:22,171 --> 01:38:23,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1346
01:38:23,472 --> 01:38:25,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, also to send it home.

1347
01:38:25,613 --> 01:38:31,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So a parent and a guardian could sign and make sure that they are, once you're approving it, we won't

1348
01:38:31,721 --> 01:38:33,422
[SPEAKER_10]: then we'll work on distribution.

1349
01:38:33,482 --> 01:38:33,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1350
01:38:33,802 --> 01:38:36,763
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to, it wasn't clear here if it was just the student or not.

1351
01:38:36,783 --> 01:38:41,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to make sure that we incorporate the guardian or the parent to sign off also.

1352
01:38:41,725 --> 01:38:45,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way they can't come down the road and say, gee, I wasn't aware of it.

1353
01:38:45,566 --> 01:38:46,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know about it.

1354
01:38:48,627 --> 01:38:48,927
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1355
01:38:48,967 --> 01:38:56,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that motion as amended to accept this report that Mr. Skerry, is there a second?

1356
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:56,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1357
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:58,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Second by Ms.

1358
01:38:58,270 --> 01:38:58,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuno.

1359
01:38:59,311 --> 01:38:59,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

1360
01:39:01,401 --> 01:39:01,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1361
01:39:04,162 --> 01:39:06,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1362
01:39:08,763 --> 01:39:09,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1363
01:39:09,283 --> 01:39:10,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero on the negative.

1364
01:39:12,484 --> 01:39:13,545
[SPEAKER_05]: The policy is approved.

1365
01:39:15,265 --> 01:39:16,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Negotiation in legal matters?

1366
01:39:16,546 --> 01:39:16,886
[SPEAKER_05]: None.

1367
01:39:17,086 --> 01:39:20,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent?

1368
01:39:22,407 --> 01:39:22,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly.

1369
01:39:22,787 --> 01:39:24,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Scari, point of information.

1370
01:39:24,268 --> 01:39:29,750
[SPEAKER_15]: A few months back, we met in executive session regarding a couple of contracts and wondered if we'd get an update on those.

1371
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:30,730
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's coming.

1372
01:39:31,655 --> 01:39:39,079
[SPEAKER_15]: I would rather see it sooner than later because these poor souls have been in limbo for a number of months and I think we have to get this done.

1373
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,741
[SPEAKER_10]: The unions to come in and work with us until they're ready.

1374
01:39:41,781 --> 01:39:45,103
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't, I can't, we should expect something very soon.

1375
01:39:45,883 --> 01:39:46,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1376
01:39:47,344 --> 01:39:48,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1377
01:39:48,285 --> 01:39:48,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1378
01:39:48,965 --> 01:39:56,690
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, under requested reports, um, the quarterly financial report, you said that we would be getting it soon.

1379
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:58,691
[SPEAKER_16]: We voted, um,

1380
01:40:00,152 --> 01:40:05,975
[SPEAKER_16]: as a committee to get these, um, the community schools financial report on a quarterly basis.

1381
01:40:06,015 --> 01:40:08,576
[SPEAKER_16]: And we haven't had one since before last June.

1382
01:40:08,976 --> 01:40:11,298
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're almost a year out, Mr. Superintendent.

1383
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:15,940
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to answer what I answered before until the hall straightens out the accounts.

1384
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to give you a report where commingled money is, it can't be,

1385
01:40:20,376 --> 01:40:23,238
[SPEAKER_10]: can't be separated out so I can actually give you an accurate report.

1386
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:24,379
[SPEAKER_10]: They're working on it.

1387
01:40:24,419 --> 01:40:33,546
[SPEAKER_10]: We have major changes in the financial administration of the city and major change in the financial administration of the schools, and they're working on that right now.

1388
01:40:33,566 --> 01:40:42,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I would hope to have it soon, but as late as last week, I'm down there talking to the people in the city hall trying to get that broken out so we can give you an accurate report.

1389
01:40:43,834 --> 01:40:46,717
[SPEAKER_10]: The good news is that we're not in jeopardy of anything financial.

1390
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:58,992
[SPEAKER_10]: The bad news is, what do you call it, I'm still trying to get this separated out so that you can see each account very cleanly as opposed to having four or five accounts somehow consolidated together which doesn't give you a real picture.

1391
01:41:05,033 --> 01:41:05,233
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1392
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:07,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I'm just asking for an update.

1393
01:41:07,134 --> 01:41:08,555
[SPEAKER_16]: I asked for this in January.

1394
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:09,695
[SPEAKER_16]: It's two months later.

1395
01:41:09,715 --> 01:41:18,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I, you said in a few weeks because the city, the mayor said that the city was done posting what they needed to win the last time I asked.

1396
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:21,600
[SPEAKER_16]: And now it's been more than a month since then.

1397
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:22,420
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the reason.

1398
01:41:22,841 --> 01:41:25,922
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I am, I am asking for a timeline.

1399
01:41:26,902 --> 01:41:33,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Soon as it, as soon as I get the numbers, the way they should be given to me, I will be happy to give you the report and I hope it's soon.

1400
01:41:33,721 --> 01:41:42,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, and I'm asking you, from now to the next meeting, just look at a few of these items and see if you can clear any of them up from the list that we have.

1401
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:43,687
[SPEAKER_16]: We're working on it.

1402
01:41:43,707 --> 01:41:44,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

1403
01:41:44,627 --> 01:41:45,688
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, new business.

1404
01:41:45,948 --> 01:41:47,109

[SPEAKER_10]: It was a great event up at the high school.

1423
01:43:17,076 --> 01:43:32,059
[SPEAKER_10]: It was exciting, and the youngsters enjoyed sitting in the Ferrari and the Maserati and listening to La Traviata and maybe sampling some food from Italy to getting a sense of Italian culture.

1424
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:33,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was a great day.

1425
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:36,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Dovetailed with the science fair, with a few other things going on.

1426
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,340
[SPEAKER_10]: with Dr. Seuss.

1427
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,721
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot going on in the public schools.

1428
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:46,863
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a March handout from Lisa, which gives you some activities in March.

1429
01:43:47,243 --> 01:43:48,204
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very busy.

1430
01:43:49,244 --> 01:43:52,545
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't make everything, but the ones you can make, it's worth it.

1431
01:43:53,205 --> 01:43:55,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a lot of good things going on in the schools.

1432
01:43:55,326 --> 01:44:01,988
[SPEAKER_10]: And in our next meeting, there'll be a number of other presentations to students who have achieved some exciting things.

1433
01:44:02,828 --> 01:44:04,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And we want to recognize them.

1434
01:44:05,804 --> 01:44:09,287
[SPEAKER_10]: in public and we will do that on our meeting on the 20th.

1435
01:44:10,128 --> 01:44:12,409
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of good stuff going on.

1436
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:24,939
[SPEAKER_10]: You did get a handout tonight from the actual presentation by the governor on Friday of the $495,000 grant for the culinary arts and the hospitality program.

1437
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:30,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Expect another major announcement coming up this week, possibly later this week or early next.

1438
01:44:31,504 --> 01:44:34,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Another major grant which dovetails with our SOI

1439
01:44:35,447 --> 01:44:38,849
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, requests and other requests of, uh, for funding for capital planning.

1440
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:45,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we'll be working on when we go to the council fairly soon and, uh, we'll get back to you and let you know what's going on.

1441
01:44:45,913 --> 01:44:54,519
[SPEAKER_05]: We received the other $100,000 grant from the other $100,000 grant, uh, bioscience and that the vocational and the high school bio.

1442
01:44:55,299 --> 01:45:00,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And you also have something on middle school mathematics night pathways to high school mathematics.

1443
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:06,645
[SPEAKER_10]: important because a lot of people aren't sure of how the progression of courses take place.

1444
01:45:07,345 --> 01:45:16,152
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that this is a good opportunity for people to become aware of that so that there's no misunderstanding of what a youngster can take for coursework.

1445
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:20,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Ms.

1446
01:45:20,332 --> 01:45:20,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

1447
01:45:21,433 --> 01:45:22,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, two things.

1448
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:37,828
[SPEAKER_03]: One, are we utilizing the city calendar because this is a situation where, I don't know if you're aware of it, but on Thursday, April 6th, from 7 to 8, the Medford High School is having a science lecture, and then on the same night,

1449
01:45:38,642 --> 01:45:41,705
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a method high school's, oh I'm sorry, it was a math.

1450
01:45:42,425 --> 01:45:43,766
[SPEAKER_03]: One says math, one says science.

1451
01:45:43,827 --> 01:45:44,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was two separate things.

1452
01:45:45,028 --> 01:45:45,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

1453
01:45:46,509 --> 01:45:47,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's all one.

1454
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:48,611
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two of them.

1455
01:45:49,391 --> 01:45:54,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just to piggyback, I just want to take the opportunity to say thank you to the Italian consulate.

1456
01:45:56,357 --> 01:45:59,241
[SPEAKER_03]: and to Cassidy who helped us out last Friday.

1457
01:45:59,561 --> 01:46:01,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a great day.

1458
01:46:01,504 --> 01:46:03,546
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a program that I was approached on.

1459
01:46:04,667 --> 01:46:12,377
[SPEAKER_03]: The Italian Consulate is really into education and he really wanted to showcase as much as he possibly can

1460
01:46:13,349 --> 01:46:21,678
[SPEAKER_03]: not only in helping us out with the CASA grants, but also to incorporate the culture of where the Italian background is really from.

1461
01:46:21,858 --> 01:46:24,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he wanted to showcase different schools.

1462
01:46:24,501 --> 01:46:27,464
[SPEAKER_03]: We were fortunate enough, there were 14 schools that they showcased.

1463
01:46:27,985 --> 01:46:30,848
[SPEAKER_03]: We were fortunate enough that they selected us as their first.

1464
01:46:31,368 --> 01:46:41,312
[SPEAKER_03]: which I believe was very beneficial for us because we really got to showcase the technical side, which our Ferrari people came in and were very impressed by.

1465
01:46:41,332 --> 01:46:47,255
[SPEAKER_03]: The students, the opportunity to see the cars was open to everyone.

1466
01:46:47,455 --> 01:46:49,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just open to one side or another side.

1467
01:46:49,976 --> 01:46:51,297
[SPEAKER_03]: All students had that opportunity.

1468
01:46:51,893 --> 01:47:07,657
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to showcase Cafe Electra, who were very generous enough to provide lunch for everyone who attended, which was the Italian consulate, his staff, Casa President, the Ferrari people, and also the opera singers who actually had just come in from Italy.

1469
01:47:09,217 --> 01:47:12,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a lot of discussion, and I was happy to say that

1470
01:47:13,418 --> 01:47:19,163
[SPEAKER_03]: The staff and the Italian consulate are really thinking of trying to pilot a lot of different programs.

1471
01:47:19,604 --> 01:47:31,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we have a different jewel in our city, which is the technical side and the academic side of a school, they were really talking about doing this much more in the future and really more partnering

1472
01:47:32,274 --> 01:47:33,375
[SPEAKER_03]: which made me really happy.

1473
01:47:33,435 --> 01:47:43,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to say thank you to the administration, to Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio, who really helped me at the last minute trying to organize it, to Ms.

1474
01:47:43,421 --> 01:47:44,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelson and Ms.

1475
01:47:44,021 --> 01:47:46,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Caldwell, and of course, our superintendent.

1476
01:47:46,182 --> 01:47:54,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really nice day, and I loved just seeing the kids' reactions when they saw the vehicle and walking into the Ferrari and getting pictures.

1477
01:47:54,547 --> 01:47:55,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a good day.

1478
01:47:55,508 --> 01:47:56,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very good day.

1479
01:47:56,898 --> 01:47:57,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1480
01:47:57,418 --> 01:47:59,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for your hard work on this.

1481
01:47:59,659 --> 01:48:00,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

1482
01:48:00,839 --> 01:48:02,740
[SPEAKER_17]: We will.

1483
01:48:04,581 --> 01:48:05,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1484
01:48:06,922 --> 01:48:07,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1485
01:48:07,102 --> 01:48:07,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

1486
01:48:10,323 --> 01:48:10,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're welcome.

1487
01:48:11,383 --> 01:48:11,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1488
01:48:12,064 --> 01:48:14,445
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion that we adjourn, all those in favor?

1489
01:48:14,465 --> 01:48:14,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1490
01:48:14,545 --> 01:48:15,445
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?
