1
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:12,414
Excuse me?

2
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:17,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes.

3
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:17,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

4
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:24,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:25,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Be my guest.

6
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:30,526
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford School Committee regular meeting of October 16 will now come to order.

7
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:32,668
[SPEAKER_13]: The secretary will call the roll.

8
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:33,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

9
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:33,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno.

10
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:34,769
Present.

11
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:35,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Vendetto.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:36,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Kress.

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

16
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:37,891
Ms.

17
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:38,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone.

18
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:39,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

19
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:39,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

20
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:40,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Kerrick.

21
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:40,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

22
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:45,310
[SPEAKER_13]: present, six present, one absent, all please rise and salute our flag.

23
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:58,659
[SPEAKER_13]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, if the minutes could reflect that Sebastian Tringali, our Meckler High School representative, is present this evening.

25
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:06,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

26
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:15,562
[SPEAKER_13]: The first item of business, approval of the minutes of October 2, 2017 on the motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, Mr. Benedetto.

27
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:19,144
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

28
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:22,305
[SPEAKER_06]: That's OK.

29
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:27,268
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so there's a few things that I noticed on the minutes.

30
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,833
[SPEAKER_06]: On the second page, I had made a motion last week to have

31
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:49,281
[SPEAKER_06]: internal rankings and notifications made on the transcript, and that if they couldn't be made, then we needed to have an emergency meeting.

32
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:54,723
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just wondering if the superintendent, we didn't call the meeting.

33
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:57,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the minutes stand on their own.

34
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:02,946
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so it should have said by last week, by the end of last week, in the minutes.

35
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:07,128
[SPEAKER_06]: The emergency meeting was supposed to happen by the end of last week.

36
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the first change.

37
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:13,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

38
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

39
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:19,455
[SPEAKER_21]: At that meeting, you made a motion.

40
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:24,559
[SPEAKER_21]: And since that time, grievances were filed and other processes, legal matters were filed.

41
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,145
[SPEAKER_21]: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session, because I believe it affects our legal status.

42
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,667
[SPEAKER_21]: And I believe that should be taken into account before any meetings are scheduled.

43
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:35,068
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

44
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:46,765
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the next section, it says, Mrs. Kreatz said that the robotics engineering team are presently traditional classes.

45
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:51,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And in 2019, it's scheduled to go on a cooperative plan.

46
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she made a motion to have that happen.

47
00:02:56,152 --> 00:03:04,978
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted, I can ask you later about an update on it, but I just wanted to comment on that.

48
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:07,795
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, there isn't a question.

49
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:08,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you all set with your?

50
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:10,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

51
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:12,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Kurtz, did you have an amendment to the list?

52
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

53
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually spoke to Jill Sawyer about the robotics engineering program.

54
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:32,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And so if they go to the schedule, which is three periods per day, the company who's actually doing the co-op with the students would be willing to accept the students in the afternoon.

55
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:35,612
[SPEAKER_11]: and they could work maybe a 12 to 5 schedule.

56
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:49,480
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would still be a cooperative program, but it would have a different schedule so that the students could continue on with the calculus and the foreign language, which is something that some of the students that are juniors and seniors haven't taken.

57
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,302
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that would be satisfactory.

58
00:03:54,142 --> 00:04:03,227
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was speaking to my son, who's out on co-op, because it's a lot to juggle getting all the classes in and then going to the co-op.

59
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:16,452
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's definitely something, you know, if superintendent wants to have a meeting and we can talk about all the programs and, you know, just making sure that the programs who should be on co-ops are on co-ops on the A week and the B week.

60
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:23,075
[SPEAKER_11]: We did get a report in this package with who is going out on co-ops.

61
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,841
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that'll come up later in the program.

62
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to share that point of information.

63
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:33,246
[SPEAKER_06]: My other two are exactly about the minutes themselves.

64
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:48,716
[SPEAKER_06]: On the next thing, community participation, there also was a motion made to have the teachers, the administration, and the school committee meet to update the action plan to make sure all voices were on that action plan.

65
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,658
[SPEAKER_06]: That motion isn't in the notes.

66
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:55,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And that motion was made at our last meeting.

67
00:04:55,895 --> 00:05:00,178
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can discuss it after, but as far as just the minutes, that's what you want, right?

68
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:04,782
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion for the amendment to be added to the minutes from last week prior to their approval.

69
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:07,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's one more issue.

70
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:13,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It says on the motion of Mrs. Cugno, second by Mrs. Stone, that the meeting was adjourned.

71
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Cugno wasn't there.

72
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:17,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So that couldn't have been her.

73
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:20,636
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the only other correction on the minutes themselves.

74
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:25,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the superintendent wanted to comment on anything, that's fine.

75
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,841
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion for approval of the minutes as amended, all those in favor?

76
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:30,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

77
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:30,842
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

78
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:31,642
[SPEAKER_13]: The minutes are passed.

79
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:31,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

80
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:38,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

81
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:40,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Ms.

82
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:41,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Discari.

83
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on the floor?

84
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:43,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

85
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:43,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

86
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:44,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Second by Ms.

87
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:44,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Kreatz.

88
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,143
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

89
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:46,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

90
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:49,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a quick question on page 9 of 13.

91
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:52,648
[SPEAKER_06]: It says MMH Clearinghouse.

92
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's over $10,000.

93
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says youth opiate prevention.

94
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just had never seen that on our website.

95
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:04,594
[SPEAKER_06]: on our bills before, and I was just wondering what that was.

96
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,595
[SPEAKER_13]: The Attorney General grant?

97
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:08,236
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

98
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:09,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Christine?

99
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And what types of things does that cover?

100
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:11,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Curriculum.

101
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's the curriculum?

102
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:13,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

103
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:17,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's taught through the superintendent.

104
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,842
[SPEAKER_06]: What age group is getting the curriculum?

105
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:22,863
[SPEAKER_06]: The opioid grant.

106
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:23,863
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the opioid grant.

107
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:25,484
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.

108
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:27,285
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, and that's great.

109
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:30,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hadn't seen it on the bills, and I'd just like to know what's going on.

110
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:32,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

111
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,241
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my only question on bills.

112
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:34,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

113
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:38,684
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Scarey, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

114
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:39,424
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

115
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:39,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

116
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:40,905
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

117
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:41,706
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes.

118
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:45,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of payrolls.

119
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Mr. Scarey, seconded by Ms.

120
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:49,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Kreatz.

121
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:51,512
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

122
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:52,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

123
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,233
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

124
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:53,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

125
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:56,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Report of Secretary.

126
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:56,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen.

127
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:58,301
[SPEAKER_08]: In the absence of Ms.

128
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:01,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Vandenbrook, Mayor, I have to take care of the bills.

129
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:02,484
[SPEAKER_08]: The bills seem to be in order.

130
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:10,771
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been signed and sent to a proper payment, and it's been approved somewhat under the weather, and she will be back next week.

131
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:11,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

132
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:14,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. Skerry, for working on this.

133
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:16,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Community participation.

134
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Joseph Viglione, Open Meeting Law.

135
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:22,502
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

136
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:27,026
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

137
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,707
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, school committee, for hearing me.

138
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:39,735
[SPEAKER_23]: On September 19, 2017, the Attorney General's office found that the Chapter 74 board of the school had violated the open meeting law.

139
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:44,559
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, this is a very serious offense, even though some people fluffed it off at the city council meeting.

140
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:48,742
[SPEAKER_23]: Very serious offense, especially in the light of the $650,000 or so dollars that

141
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:56,415
[SPEAKER_23]: were allocated from the old TV3 to the new station.

142
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:59,717
[SPEAKER_23]: So what are we going to do about it?

143
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,660
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a board for a year and a half.

144
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,003
[SPEAKER_23]: School committee, I don't believe, knew about it.

145
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:09,924
[SPEAKER_23]: City Council certainly didn't know about it.

146
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:21,552
[SPEAKER_23]: Flies under the radar, but it was so significant because Bob Penter and other citizens and myself were attending all of Mayor McGlynn's tribunals, which were talking about the

147
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:38,998
[SPEAKER_23]: new access station, and all of a sudden, the high school is talking about the access station, but the public doesn't know if the MCC monies are here, and the educational monies are here, and the governmental monies are there, and the general fund, it's all convoluted.

148
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:41,638
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been on this project for 15 years.

149
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,279
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not that dumb.

150
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,679
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't figure it out.

151
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:45,999
[SPEAKER_23]: The public can't.

152
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,660
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that this serious, serious offense of not letting us know

153
00:08:51,103 --> 00:09:00,493
[SPEAKER_23]: about this chapter 74 board, which had people that weren't even from Medford, Revere and outside of Medford, all very, very smoky.

154
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:03,596
[SPEAKER_23]: So I propose something.

155
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:10,643
[SPEAKER_23]: I propose, especially after the media day yesterday at the public access station, which seems so very educational oriented.

156
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:15,057
[SPEAKER_23]: Politicians, neighbors of mine are saying, I didn't hear about it, Joe.

157
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:18,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Anthony D'Antonio, a significant member of the Medford community.

158
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,280
[SPEAKER_23]: Joe, I didn't know about it.

159
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,101
[SPEAKER_23]: I spoke about it at the city council.

160
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,502
[SPEAKER_23]: There was no outreach.

161
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:30,927
[SPEAKER_23]: I propose, because of this egregious offense, this failure, I mean, we have very smart people here.

162
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,048
[SPEAKER_23]: The mayor's a very smart woman.

163
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,590
[SPEAKER_23]: Superintendent Belson is a very smart man.

164
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:38,994
[SPEAKER_23]: We can't feign ignorance that, oh, we didn't know about the open meeting laws.

165
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:42,636
[SPEAKER_23]: My God, you people have to take tests for the open meeting law.

166
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:53,679
[SPEAKER_23]: I feel, sadly, that my opinion is it was intentional to keep me out, specifically, because I've been fighting for public access in this city for 15 years.

167
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,161
[SPEAKER_23]: But many might know that I fought the good fight in Woburn for a good five years.

168
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,762
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm a member in Stoneham.

169
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:01,742
[SPEAKER_23]: And Woburn airs my show.

170
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:03,203
[SPEAKER_23]: It was my strength.

171
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,094
[SPEAKER_23]: that made that right up there, and we all know that it was my fight that shut down TV3.

172
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:19,042
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think it would have been prudent for this city to let me, Bob Penter, and D'Antonio, and other individuals know, and the city council, and the school committee.

173
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:23,105
[SPEAKER_23]: So, especially yesterday, I feel very uncomfortable

174
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:30,159
[SPEAKER_23]: having it at the high school when a state rep acted in an inappropriate manner, and the mayor laughed.

175
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:33,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I am staying within the area.

176
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,241
[SPEAKER_23]: Because you laughed at the sexual joke.

177
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:35,841
[SPEAKER_23]: You laughed.

178
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,122
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're shutting me off.

179
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:37,822
[SPEAKER_23]: Censorship.

180
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:41,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, you can leave this meeting if you cannot be a responsible adult.

181
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:46,006
[SPEAKER_23]: You laughed at a sexual outrage, and you don't want it talked about.

182
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:50,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

183
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:50,954
No.

184
00:10:57,722 --> 00:11:01,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the chair.

185
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:02,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Me.

186
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:06,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Ask a question through the chair.

187
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:07,826
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no recommendation.

188
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,287
[SPEAKER_13]: We've already taken care of it.

189
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,688
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a chapter 74 advisory board.

190
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,389
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't deliberate.

191
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,510
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't make decisions for the school system.

192
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,251
[SPEAKER_13]: All the meetings will be posted.

193
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been taken care of.

194
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:19,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

195
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:20,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Next item.

196
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:25,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Next item, report of superintendent.

197
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:28,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on Nellie Mae Education Foundation Grant.

198
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:29,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

199
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:31,174
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

200
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:37,781
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor and members of the committee,

201
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:49,364
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a report on the Nellie Mae Education Foundation Grant.

202
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:56,229
[SPEAKER_21]: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who is a recipient of the O'Toole Award.

203
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:58,790
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a very significant award.

204
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:01,192
[SPEAKER_21]: It's done a lot of very good things for us.

205
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:02,013
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do even more.

206
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,614
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.

207
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:05,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

208
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

209
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:20,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited to be here tonight to announce that one of our school Councilors, Tim Klein, has won the Lawrence O'Toole Educator Leadership Award and grant for $15,000.

210
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:34,950
[SPEAKER_04]: This award is given to an educator who advocates for student-centered approaches to learning, not only in their classroom, but within their practice.

211
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:42,957
[SPEAKER_04]: This award is sponsored by the Nellie Mae Foundation, and this year was given to 12 recipients across New England.

212
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:50,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim has won this award as a result of his innovative pilot program, Empower, which was started last year at the high school.

213
00:12:51,900 --> 00:13:05,348
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lawrence O'Toole Award is also accompanied with a $15,000 grant, and this grant will be used to bring innovative digital technology to the MPower program, which will help us grow this program over the next three years.

214
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Tim here, and I would like to ask him to give you a brief summary of the program and to answer any questions that you may have of the work that he's been doing.

215
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Mr. Klein.

216
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:19,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, thanks for having me.

217
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:25,059
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm really excited to be here and to win this award on behalf of Medford Public Schools.

218
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:34,148
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's from Empower, which it started from the research partnership that Dr. Perella started with Harvard University and Boston College.

219
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:39,526
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's based in this emerging field in youth development called youth purpose.

220
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:49,654
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that's how do we ensure that all of our high school students are actively pursuing a long-term goal that's personally meaningful and also is beneficial to the world outside the self.

221
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:58,038
[SPEAKER_22]: So honestly, when I'm sitting up here, we want all of our students to be looking like Sebastian up here, who's obviously actively pursuing something that's meaningful to him.

222
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:12,445
[SPEAKER_22]: So Empower is really about asking students not just to consider what college they want to go to or what major or what career, but really to understand why they want to pursue those things, how it aligns with their core values, how it's going to allow them to build their strength and skills.

223
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:14,806
[SPEAKER_22]: So to understand the intrinsic motivators.

224
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:19,729
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm really excited for this award because we've piloted this with seniors in the

225
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,570
[SPEAKER_22]: high school, and the vocational school.

226
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:23,872
[SPEAKER_22]: We did it last year with 25 students.

227
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:25,293
[SPEAKER_22]: We've tripled the number this year.

228
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:32,998
[SPEAKER_22]: But this award is going to allow us to really bring in really innovative digital technology and curriculum that we can bring.

229
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:42,985
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's going to allow us to bring in an application that not only me and our Empower students can use, but the entirety of the public school district can use as well when we get it out there.

230
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:45,507
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm really excited to bring this to Medford Public Schools.

231
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:46,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice job.

232
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:47,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

233
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:47,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

234
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:48,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

235
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:51,819
[SPEAKER_15]: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.

236
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,802
[SPEAKER_15]: This is absolutely wonderful.

237
00:14:54,422 --> 00:15:00,309
[SPEAKER_15]: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and

238
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Miss Westmark, nope, I have to get it right.

239
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:08,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I've known her before she was married.

240
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,195
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.

241
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:26,183
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city that it would really be beneficial I think and speaking to others that I think this would go hand in hand

242
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:37,628
[SPEAKER_15]: if we're able to put our students into the community and have them have some type of internship with the businesses or fields that they're interested in.

243
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:40,288
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a hotel in the square.

244
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:43,809
[SPEAKER_15]: We have different types of businesses.

245
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:45,250
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to see, if possible,

246
00:15:50,592 --> 00:16:02,654
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students, and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.

247
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:07,575
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you have people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field.

248
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,316
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another door.

249
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:18,277
[SPEAKER_15]: But I've also spoken to the businesses that we want to be very careful,

250
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:28,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields, but if it's something down the road that they could continue working in, then our students need to be paid.

251
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:31,114
[SPEAKER_15]: They can't just always do everything voluntarily.

252
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:34,377
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was just wondering what your thoughts were on something like that.

253
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,306
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you want me to answer that?

254
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,527
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think it's a fantastic idea.

255
00:16:38,808 --> 00:16:39,408
[SPEAKER_22]: It's amazing.

256
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:43,572
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I tried working with Sebastian, not to keep bringing you up, but we tried doing the same thing with Sebastian.

257
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,814
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm all for it.

258
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:46,915
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's greed.

259
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:50,358
[SPEAKER_22]: You want internships that's providing value for our students.

260
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:55,902
[SPEAKER_22]: What I've been, it's been a struggle for me is around scheduling flexibility.

261
00:16:56,303 --> 00:17:01,287
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's just having students having a flexible enough schedule so maybe they could leave during the school day.

262
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:05,650
[SPEAKER_22]: or getting credit for those internships, but I think it's a fantastic, fantastic idea.

263
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:15,416
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you know people from the Chamber of Commerce, let's definitely set up a meeting where we can start connecting with students who might be interested with businesses that would be a good fit.

264
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:23,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during the day, because I know they have a lot on their plates and you don't want to lose any time in classes,

265
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:31,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe there's something that could be worked out like after school or maybe in a Saturday or if the business is open.

266
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:35,934
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, something to really get your teeth into what you want to do.

267
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:40,757
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't want to see kids, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.

268
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:45,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for.

269
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in.

270
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:54,585
[SPEAKER_15]: and they want to pursue, or if it's something they thought they were interested in and they want to go to a different field altogether.

271
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:55,645
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.

272
00:17:55,785 --> 00:18:02,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we definitely encourage students to come to Mr. Klein, because he is our school and community partnerships Councilor, so he makes those connections.

273
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:08,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to Mr. Klein, maybe tell them what they're looking for, and he can help make that connection.

274
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also encourage community members to reach out to us as well.

275
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

276
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,010
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

277
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

278
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:14,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Tringale.

279
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:14,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

280
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:22,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, directly from a high schooler's perspective, working with the guidance Councilors, especially applying to colleges this year.

281
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:31,299
[SPEAKER_01]: My personal guidance Councilor has tons of students and they're working with students from all over the school all the time.

282
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's great that Mr. Klein is here to be that, you know, extra hand.

283
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:44,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with him almost immediately as soon as he came to high school to try to get some, you know, internships.

284
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:49,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, I'm a really busy guy and so are tons of my classmates.

285
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:54,810
[SPEAKER_01]: End up not, you know, I never, you know, followed through with that internship.

286
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,030
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that

287
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:04,564
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what is already being done, I guess, is, you know, he's doing a great job with that.

288
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you and keep up.

289
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:12,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I think from that conversation, you got into journalism, and then you started the school newspaper, essentially, right?

290
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:13,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

291
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:15,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, it was that conversation.

292
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:28,190
[SPEAKER_01]: And to give a back story, it was, I was thinking about business, and Mr. Klein talked me through it, and I realized I didn't really want to do business, and, you know, thought more about journalism, another field I was passionate about.

293
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:39,174
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think I would have had that conversation with my guidance Councilor, because I think she was just really wrapped up in getting kids applied to colleges and all of those things.

294
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:41,335
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's great.

295
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's great that you won this grant to expand your program.

296
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks.

297
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:46,882
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

298
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:48,363
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll just make one more pitch.

299
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
[SPEAKER_22]: It wouldn't have happened without Ms.

300
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:59,166
[SPEAKER_22]: Jensen here, just allowing me, no, to do like a really innovative work that hadn't been happening before, not only in Medford, but it hasn't been really been happening anywhere.

301
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:01,547
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just want to make a plug for our guidance team as well.

302
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:08,789
[SPEAKER_22]: Like what you heard Sebastian said, it's, they feel very, very at capacity and it feels like they have a very high caseload and it's like,

303
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:20,094
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can build up more guidance Councilor capacity to have these meaningful conversations about what do they want their lives to look like, what type of impact they want to have, it can have a very profound impact on our students.

304
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:24,176
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just think the role of the Councilors is as important as ever now.

305
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:25,397
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm glad to be one at Medford.

306
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:25,677
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

307
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:31,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you could add a little bit from that breakfast last year when you had the Chamber of Commerce in and vocational.

308
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:31,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

309
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Sawyer, I believe, was the one leading the charge over in the vocational side.

310
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:37,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe just elaborate a little bit more about your outreach.

311
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:46,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so we had the Chamber of Commerce come in, and they came out for a breakfast, and the vocational students catered an amazing breakfast.

312
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:55,890
[SPEAKER_22]: And I did do a presentation about the need for our students and their desire to get out into the city of Medford to get hands-on experience.

313
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,272
[SPEAKER_22]: So I did some research on what the school resources we had now.

314
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:03,473
[SPEAKER_22]: And we have over 100 clubs at the school.

315
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:07,175
[SPEAKER_22]: And about 85% of our students are actively involved in the school.

316
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:12,098
[SPEAKER_22]: And we did a survey of students saying, well, what would you like to get more involved with?

317
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:17,441
[SPEAKER_22]: And the overwhelming, the majority of students who said they wanted to do more, it was around meaningful employment.

318
00:21:18,002 --> 00:21:20,223
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you look at research now about what

319
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:31,172
[SPEAKER_22]: When you look at what employers are looking for from recent college graduates, they're really emphasizing meaningful employment and job experience.

320
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:39,419
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're getting to a place in the world where it's not so much what college you go to or what grades you have, but it's really more about what meaningful experience in the field do you have.

321
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:51,308
[SPEAKER_22]: So as much as we can get students out into the field to actually give them experience, they can understand what they do want to do, what they don't want to do, and make really meaningful connections in the city of Medford that's going to help them

322
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:57,289
[SPEAKER_22]: to help this city and get, and help our, a lot of our jobs are having a hard time finding meaningful employment.

323
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:02,050
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's really a mutually beneficial relationship for both.

324
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,210
[SPEAKER_22]: But, yes.

325
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:03,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

326
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:04,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

327
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:04,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

328
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say congratulations.

329
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:08,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

330
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:15,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And I noticed that it said that, you know, the students have increased GPAs and post-secondary plans.

331
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:19,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I just wanted to bring attention to that and increase graduation rates.

332
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:29,578
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fantastic, and it sounds like you're going in the right direction, and you're involving both the vocational students and high school students.

333
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,460
[SPEAKER_11]: It just sounds terrific.

334
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,022
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do the students get in touch with you?

335
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:38,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Should they email you, or do they go through their guidance Councilor?

336
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:39,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Which students?

337
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:47,852
[SPEAKER_11]: If students were interested and kind of spending some time with you to find out what their interests are, should they go through their guidance Councilor?

338
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,521
[SPEAKER_11]: they're put in touch with you, or?

339
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:57,384
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I mean, I have, this is probably not gonna work out for me, but I have an open door policy, I always have, so it's like, they can come find me.

340
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:02,106
[SPEAKER_22]: So through Empower, I'll just say, it's being evaluated by Boston College right now.

341
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,587
[SPEAKER_22]: So right now, it's a randomized trial.

342
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:10,670
[SPEAKER_22]: So every single high school senior was automatically randomly selected into the program.

343
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,472
[SPEAKER_22]: So we actually have an intervention, which is Empower, and then we have a control group as well.

344
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:19,136
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're doing pre and post surveys for both of them to see what the actual impact of Empower is.

345
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:21,639
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, just send them my way.

346
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:23,100
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm third floor guidance.

347
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,463
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's just like I have students coming in and out all of the time.

348
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:30,187
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can send them, or go to their guidance Councilor who's doing a lot of the same work that I am.

349
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:30,988
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

350
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:31,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

351
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:32,049
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

352
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:32,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

353
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

354
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:34,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

355
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:53,379
[SPEAKER_06]: It just really speaks to the approach of how we handle students in MedFit, the whole child, because it's not just about getting them through and getting them either off to college or military or to a job, but to really seek what they are looking for in their needs and trying to meet those needs.

356
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:00,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really think that having job experience, even if it's not paid,

357
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:10,013
[SPEAKER_06]: position, it gives you so many life skills that a lot of our young people are lacking, and that employers and colleges are looking for.

358
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:31,285
[SPEAKER_06]: They're looking for students that are prepared, that are on time, that show up when they're supposed to, or call if they're sick, or can't answer the phone in a professional manner, and all of those skills that you might not get in a day at school, but need to move forward and need to present yourself

359
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:36,237
[SPEAKER_06]: not only yourself, your family, but also your community in Medford High.

360
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:40,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you move on, people are like, oh, look at that kid from Medford High.

361
00:24:40,602 --> 00:24:49,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a skill that all children need, not only financial skills, but just professionalism and all of those type of things.

362
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:52,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great that we have this position now at Medford High.

363
00:24:52,815 --> 00:25:02,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we struggled for a few years with amount of guidance people per student ratio, and we've increased them in the last six years.

364
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:16,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the superintendent's commitment to that department has been great, and I'm glad that we're taking a whole child approach at Medford High, as well as, you know, I'm very proud of the work you've done, that it's been acknowledged,

365
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:23,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm very happy to bring in any dollars you want to bring that benefit our students.

366
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:24,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you.

367
00:25:25,353 --> 00:25:29,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And you deserve all the recognition that comes along with this.

368
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:44,288
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe a note in someone's employee file would be warranted at this time, Mr. Superintendent, that the committee is impressed and appreciates the hard work of both

369
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:46,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Jenkins.

370
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say it right?

371
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:49,127
[SPEAKER_06]: It's usually Ms.

372
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:49,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Westmock to me.

373
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:54,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Mr. Kline and Ms.

374
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Jensen, for your hard work in bringing this home.

375
00:25:57,031 --> 00:25:57,791
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate it.

376
00:25:58,071 --> 00:25:58,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Great program.

377
00:25:58,772 --> 00:25:59,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep up the good work.

378
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:05,215
[SPEAKER_13]: And certainly, if you want to set up any meetings with the chamber, we certainly could facilitate for you as well.

379
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:06,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'll put that out there.

380
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:11,298
[SPEAKER_22]: If anyone out here is looking to partner with us, I'm all ears.

381
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,239
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you very much for all of your support.

382
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:13,879
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, seriously.

383
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:14,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

384
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:14,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

385
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive in place on file offered by Ms.

386
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuno, seconded by Ms.

387
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:20,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Mastoon?

388
00:26:20,802 --> 00:26:21,563
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

389
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:21,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

390
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:23,163
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

391
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:23,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

392
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:26,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

393
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:28,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on online Be Good Academy.

394
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:32,388
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to call upon our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.

395
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:34,949
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

396
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:49,314
[SPEAKER_26]: On Thursday, September 28th, four eighth grade students from the Andrews Middle School and their teacher, Mr. Chris Tremonti, attended a day-long program on social media for social good.

397
00:26:50,175 --> 00:27:02,102
[SPEAKER_26]: Rick Rendon, founder of Empower Peace, asked me if we could gather a group of students together from Medford to participate in launching an innovative use of social media.

398
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:05,484
[SPEAKER_26]: So the following students attended WGBH,

399
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:13,588
[SPEAKER_26]: at this conference, Sophia Zimanski, Andre Perez, Luke Gatti, and Sarah Biannimi.

400
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:18,232
[SPEAKER_26]: In addition, Mr. Twonte and myself were available for this conference.

401
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:28,259
[SPEAKER_26]: The students listened to John Rendon, President and Executive Officer of the Rendon Group, discuss strategic communications in the 21st century.

402
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:34,658
[SPEAKER_26]: Macon Phillips Skyped from Spain to talk about social media for the social good.

403
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:38,378
[SPEAKER_26]: There were other interactive panelists and discussions.

404
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,820
[SPEAKER_26]: The highlight for many of us was listening to Andrew Frady's brother, Apeet Frady's.

405
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:55,941
[SPEAKER_26]: The discussion about how the Ice Bucket Challenge came about and how social media from people all over the world participated and spread the word.

406
00:27:56,782 --> 00:27:59,282
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Frady said his brother continues his fight

407
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,183
[SPEAKER_26]: in finding a cure for ALS.

408
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:06,505
[SPEAKER_26]: The students told me what they learned from the conference.

409
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:12,549
[SPEAKER_26]: Statements like, what you put online is there forever, even if it's not, even if you take it down.

410
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,990
[SPEAKER_26]: So be careful with what you say.

411
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:19,593
[SPEAKER_26]: It can hurt you for years later, especially when you're looking for a job.

412
00:28:20,254 --> 00:28:23,636
[SPEAKER_26]: And don't always focus on the negative in social media.

413
00:28:24,882 --> 00:28:29,984
[SPEAKER_26]: The students are here with us this evening to tell you about what they learned for social media for social good.

414
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,944
[SPEAKER_26]: They have an action plan.

415
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:39,867
[SPEAKER_26]: Their issues will focus on communicating with their peers about online fake accounts, bullying, and protecting privacy.

416
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:42,967
[SPEAKER_26]: They will be working with sixth grade students.

417
00:28:43,668 --> 00:28:49,830
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've provided with you in your packet the program for the day and a copy of the agenda and the action plan.

418
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,271
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd also like to take a moment to thank Mr. Paul DeLeva, the principal of the school,

419
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:59,497
[SPEAKER_26]: who helped me put together this group of students and is also here with us this evening.

420
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:06,800
[SPEAKER_26]: So at this time, I would like to ask Sarah, Bien-Ami, and Andre to come up and discuss what they have learned.

421
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,642
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'd like to thank Chris Tremonti as well.

422
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:13,703
[SPEAKER_26]: So Sarah, why don't you come up, and Andre as well.

423
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:17,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

424
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:19,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, how was y'all day today?

425
00:29:20,187 --> 00:29:20,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Great?

426
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:22,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Was your day great today?

427
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it good?

428
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:24,772
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.

429
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:29,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So the online for goods group has been an eye opener for us.

430
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:38,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And it taught my peers and I that it taught my peers and I the uses of the internet and how it affects us in our future.

431
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:44,229
[SPEAKER_03]: not only did it provide background information, but it also provided fun activities to grab the youth's attention.

432
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:57,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And one major thing that really, one major thing that I loved about this group was that you see, you saw several schools, like in the Massachusetts, in the state of Massachusetts come together and try to

433
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:01,961
[SPEAKER_03]: make a difference, not only in reality, but in online use.

434
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:13,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And we learned how the ice bucket began, and how it represented ALS, and how the FedEx sign, if you look at it, there's an arrow, which means delivered.

435
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,975
[SPEAKER_03]: That can symbolize the deliverance.

436
00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:21,199
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a really great experience for us, personally.

437
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Sarah.

438
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

439
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,761
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Andre Perez from Andrews Middle School, and I'm in the eighth grade.

440
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:36,982
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wrote a short paper on my experience at Online for Good.

441
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:42,563
[SPEAKER_12]: The time I had at Online for Good was very fun and a great learning experience.

442
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:48,824
[SPEAKER_12]: The day started off with being picked up early in the morning and heading to the WGBH building in Boston.

443
00:30:49,524 --> 00:30:54,645
[SPEAKER_12]: My friend Luke and I met up with the two other students who were joining us on the trip, Sarah and Sophia.

444
00:30:55,353 --> 00:31:00,155
[SPEAKER_12]: The four of us picked a table to sit at, and we talked for a little bit, and then got right into the lecture.

445
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:05,217
[SPEAKER_12]: The lecture was very good, and we learned a lot about online safety and the power of the internet.

446
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:08,698
[SPEAKER_12]: One example that was given was the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

447
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,223
[SPEAKER_12]: After the activity was over, Mr. Tremonti and the group decided that we were going to try to pursue an activity where the four students in the group

448
00:31:21,704 --> 00:31:28,906
[SPEAKER_12]: go into a sixth grade room during RTI class and talk to them about what to do and what not to do on the internet and how to stay safe.

449
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:35,327
[SPEAKER_12]: We as a group would like very much to have this activity run through the Andrews Middle School system throughout the years.

450
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:37,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

451
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:39,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you met with the sixth graders yet?

452
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,509
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're planning on doing that before RTI, yeah.

453
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice job.

454
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:46,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

455
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:49,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a question for the students.

456
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:56,360
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, thank you for going and representing Medford so well, and thank you for presenting this evening in such a professional manner.

457
00:31:56,921 --> 00:32:01,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very impressed by both your presentations and glad you're Medford students.

458
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:10,245
[SPEAKER_06]: My question to you is, since you've gone there, what different things have you done on your social media?

459
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:11,878
[SPEAKER_06]: since you've gone there?

460
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:17,422
[SPEAKER_06]: How have you taken what you learned and it changed your everyday life?

461
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:24,608
[SPEAKER_03]: To be careful on what you post on the internet and not to entertain in things that are not appropriate.

462
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've changed how you speak and what you post?

463
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:34,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Things on the other side of social media

464
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:51,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, as she said, the FedEx sign, you look at it carefully and you can see an arrow between the E and the X. Ever since that, I've looked at other things more carefully to see if they have any other symbols inside of them.

465
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:52,592
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

466
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:59,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And even your contract with your friends and your schoolmates, has it changed how you speak and what you might say?

467
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:03,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it make you rethink before you hit post?

468
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it helped a lot.

469
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:13,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Because sometimes you can say stuff that aren't nice, and it gives you a chance to reassure what you're going to say before you send it.

470
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Also adding to that, it helps us think before we say something.

471
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:19,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Think before you speak.

472
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:22,677
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing that also improved.

473
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:28,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And it helps us not entertain things that are inappropriate.

474
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:30,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a request.

475
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:33,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Since this seemed to have touched you both,

476
00:33:34,254 --> 00:33:40,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only would the Andrews kids benefit from your presentation, the McGlen Middle School would as well.

477
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:50,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And since they don't have representatives going, I'm going to request that you maybe get a chance to present to the sixth graders at the McGlen as well.

478
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:52,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to ask Ms.

479
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:56,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Caldwell and your principal if they could make that happen.

480
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:58,994
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to squirt you over and do that presentation as well.

481
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:03,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would really love to see students from both schools attend next year.

482
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:06,348
[SPEAKER_06]: so that we have representatives talking about this.

483
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:09,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is what we hear is a big problem.

484
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:19,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Bullying, cyber bullying, cyber issues, they happen at night, but then they come into the school every day.

485
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:24,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And the school's in a very tricky situation on how to handle things that happen outside of school.

486
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:32,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to set policies and procedures, which we're still working at because things change so quickly.

487
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:33,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we have

488
00:34:34,612 --> 00:34:42,254
[SPEAKER_06]: students like you, strong professional students talking to other students, they might hear you, you know?

489
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:49,857
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that your work that you've done and what you've learned is very valuable and I'd love you to share it to the other building as well.

490
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:55,999
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my first motion on the floor to make sure that these children get the chance to do that.

491
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll need a second.

492
00:34:58,419 --> 00:34:58,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

493
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um,

494
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:04,651
[SPEAKER_06]: to make sure that both schools have the opportunity to attend this next year.

495
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:06,874
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do more of that collaboratively.

496
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:15,643
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my next motion, is to make sure both schools get a chance to partake in this next year.

497
00:35:15,743 --> 00:35:18,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So very good.

498
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:19,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

499
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:19,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

500
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:20,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Cugno?

501
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

502
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:33,019
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't 100% sure before we started the meeting, and I sat down with you really quick.

503
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:41,865
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would have asked you a thousand questions, because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do was, it was the anti-bullying.

504
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:47,810
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we brought in a lot of forums, not only children, and not only our students, but for everybody.

505
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:52,535
[SPEAKER_15]: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.

506
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:55,679
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, trying to tell

507
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:17,942
[SPEAKER_15]: children all the time or anyone just to be careful what you write you know I get it all the time the snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes I want to know from you what have you learned as far as like these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes and they disappear have you now had a different way of thinking about that yeah.

508
00:36:20,718 --> 00:36:34,962
[SPEAKER_12]: As an example for Snapchat, things that you think are only there for like up to three to 10 seconds, people can take screenshots or save them and they can never go away.

509
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:37,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

510
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:42,023
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.

511
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:49,065
[SPEAKER_15]: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn

512
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:52,532
[SPEAKER_15]: It's important that your peers hear from you.

513
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:59,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes, as adults, we'll say it and, oh, no, it's not true, or you don't know about it, or you have no idea about it.

514
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:03,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college.

515
00:37:04,442 --> 00:37:16,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, that was one of the biggest things is students were doing certain things, you know, just fooling around or whatever in college and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards and the employers are looking into everything.

516
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,868
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it has to be something that you really, I hope,

517
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:23,130
[SPEAKER_15]: will continue bringing to your peers.

518
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:32,438
[SPEAKER_15]: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.

519
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:37,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Because even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.

520
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:38,243
[SPEAKER_15]: You really have.

521
00:37:38,283 --> 00:37:44,228
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.

522
00:37:44,688 --> 00:37:46,229
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for representing us.

523
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for absorbing

524
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:51,747
[SPEAKER_15]: what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.

525
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:52,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

526
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:54,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

527
00:37:55,393 --> 00:38:01,544
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motions that this information be shared with the McGlynn Middle School as well and that the McGlynn participate at the next forum.

528
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:03,833
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

529
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:04,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

530
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:05,294
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

531
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:06,275
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes.

532
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:09,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much for contributing this evening.

533
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:10,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful job.

534
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:11,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

535
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on Global Scholars Program.

536
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:16,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

537
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:19,005
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor and members of the committee, this report is in two parts.

538
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,287
[SPEAKER_21]: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.

539
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:28,212
[SPEAKER_21]: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.

540
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:30,974
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an initiative of the Global Cities

541
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:35,236
[SPEAKER_21]: program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.

542
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:40,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.

543
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:41,178
[SPEAKER_21]: We're the first to do it.

544
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:45,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.

545
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:50,201
[SPEAKER_21]: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.

546
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:56,683
[SPEAKER_21]: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.

547
00:38:57,427 --> 00:39:06,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.

548
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:10,835
[SPEAKER_21]: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.

549
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:18,520
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.

550
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:20,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

551
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:29,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been here a number of times to talk about the Global Scholars Program, and each time I am excited because, again, it is a wonderful program.

552
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:33,946
[SPEAKER_10]: So just following up on the last presentation, we were talking about social media.

553
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:37,549
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a program that has its own portal.

554
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,531
[SPEAKER_10]: It has the Haiku portal system.

555
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:46,437
[SPEAKER_10]: So all of the communication that occurs between our seventh grade students in the program and students around the world

556
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:47,735
[SPEAKER_10]: is protected.

557
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:55,820
[SPEAKER_10]: And the students know ahead of time that teachers can go in and they can look at all of the dialogue that occurs among the students.

558
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,642
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want you to know that it is a highly protected system.

559
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:03,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So as the superintendent mentioned, it includes Medford.

560
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:06,226
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're considered Medford Boston.

561
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:09,609
[SPEAKER_10]: We now have other schools in the area participating.

562
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:14,892
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some Boston public schools, Everett, I think there's one school in Chelsea now.

563
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:20,754
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a couple of schools in New York and in Jacksonville, Florida.

564
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:25,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were the first school here in the United States.

565
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:29,189
[SPEAKER_10]: to participate in this program.

566
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:36,711
[SPEAKER_10]: So not only is it worldwide, but it really not only has it grown worldwide, but it has grown here in the United States as well.

567
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:43,534
[SPEAKER_10]: So as far as the curriculum is concerned this year, the focus is on food and feeding our cities.

568
00:40:44,214 --> 00:40:46,075
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the yearly curriculum.

569
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:51,977
[SPEAKER_10]: So it began October 1st, or thereabouts October 1st, and it will end the end of May.

570
00:40:52,797 --> 00:41:09,274
[SPEAKER_10]: There are five units, so classes, again, all seventh grade students at both the McGlynn and the Andrews have participated in unit one, which is an introduction to the program, including introduction to the eClassroom.

571
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:12,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, the responsibilities that come along with that.

572
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:18,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Unit 2, which we'll be getting shortly, has to do with nourishing ourselves and our cities.

573
00:41:18,822 --> 00:41:25,744
[SPEAKER_10]: So students explore the basic principles of nutrition and investigate the health impact of processed foods and sugar.

574
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:31,226
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll learn how to deal with such issues such as obesity and access

575
00:41:31,938 --> 00:41:32,859
[SPEAKER_10]: to healthy food.

576
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:41,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to Unit 3, which probably will be towards the beginning of the new calendar year, growing the food we need.

577
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:47,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Students will learn of the global system that produces our fruit, vegetables, grains, meat, and seafood.

578
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:51,842
[SPEAKER_10]: They will consider how climate impacts our ability to grow food.

579
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Along the way, they'll be doing a lot of writing, a lot of critical thinking, again, a lot of communicating with their partners around the world.

580
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:09,226
[SPEAKER_10]: As they move on to Unit 4, probably around late February, early March, they will be studying delivering food to the world.

581
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,667
[SPEAKER_10]: That is that unit theme.

582
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:17,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Students will learn how food gets from the farm to their plates through a network of global food supply chains.

583
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:26,607
[SPEAKER_10]: which I think is a great lesson because many of us don't appreciate how difficult it is for our food to be transported to us.

584
00:42:28,268 --> 00:42:40,092
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, as is true with all of the curriculum projects in this program, there's an action plan or an action project called Community in Action.

585
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:46,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And students will reflect on what they have learned about nutrition and food security and they will design a project

586
00:42:46,988 --> 00:42:49,929
[SPEAKER_10]: that addresses one of these topics.

587
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,650
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, in a nutshell, that is the curriculum.

588
00:42:52,691 --> 00:42:58,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly do have more information if anyone is interested, but in the interest of time, that's a snapshot.

589
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:03,875
[SPEAKER_10]: This program has a lot of professional development embedded into it.

590
00:43:04,736 --> 00:43:12,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So the teachers who are involved, at least once a month, are involved with online professional development through a webinar.

591
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the reviews have been very positive.

592
00:43:17,086 --> 00:43:28,535
[SPEAKER_10]: So not only are they getting professional development in pedagogy, but they're also getting professional development in content, which we know our teachers want and need for their relicensure.

593
00:43:30,437 --> 00:43:35,441
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a symposium that is occurring in just a few days, really.

594
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:38,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it begins on October 22nd.

595
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:44,929
[SPEAKER_10]: So select district personnel were invited to participate in this project in Paris.

596
00:43:45,517 --> 00:43:46,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is really exciting.

597
00:43:47,178 --> 00:43:55,622
[SPEAKER_10]: So the title of the symposium is Students and the Global Edge, Evaluating the Global Digital Educational Experience.

598
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:57,443
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're really excited.

599
00:43:57,463 --> 00:44:05,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent Belson and one of our seventh grade teachers, Frank Zizzo, who is at the Andrews, will be participating in this symposium.

600
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:19,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Frank Zizzo has been instrumental in bringing the Skype aspect to these interactions with these other schools around the world, and he has been a model, so he was invited to participate in the program.

601
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:29,866
[SPEAKER_10]: So at this point, I think Superintendent Belson wanted to add something to the symposium part of this presentation.

602
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,989
[SPEAKER_21]: So the program is a terrific program.

603
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:45,367
[SPEAKER_21]: really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.

604
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:48,210
[SPEAKER_21]: This is cutting edge activity.

605
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:53,214
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.

606
00:44:53,954 --> 00:44:56,016
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.

607
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:57,377
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.

608
00:44:58,338 --> 00:45:03,362
[SPEAKER_21]: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia.

609
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,451
[SPEAKER_21]: coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.

610
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:09,994
[SPEAKER_21]: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.

611
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:22,045
[SPEAKER_21]: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.

612
00:45:22,785 --> 00:45:41,540
[SPEAKER_21]: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority, you're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend, and we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.

613
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:51,848
[SPEAKER_21]: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more to enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in

614
00:45:52,812 --> 00:45:53,352
[SPEAKER_21]: in Paris.

615
00:45:53,892 --> 00:46:00,713
[SPEAKER_21]: So I look forward to this activity and I ask your approval to have Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.

616
00:46:01,013 --> 00:46:01,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

617
00:46:01,914 --> 00:46:02,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

618
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:11,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.

619
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's really very important.

620
00:46:15,256 --> 00:46:21,637
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go through them really quickly, but I mean, to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about,

621
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:30,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate opportunity for all.

622
00:46:31,343 --> 00:46:47,607
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.

623
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:48,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Petersburg, Istanbul,

624
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:54,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.

625
00:46:54,591 --> 00:47:00,033
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these, I mean, it's incredible.

626
00:47:01,354 --> 00:47:04,735
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's very important that we have representation.

627
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:09,337
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, do I have to make a motion?

628
00:47:09,357 --> 00:47:10,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval.

629
00:47:10,278 --> 00:47:12,098
[SPEAKER_15]: So motion to approve that the superintendent.

630
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on the floor?

631
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:15,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

632
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Ms.

633
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Kreatz.

634
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

635
00:47:20,115 --> 00:47:29,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just wondering, are we the only Massachusetts school attending this conference?

636
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,421
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.

637
00:47:34,461 --> 00:47:40,524
[SPEAKER_21]: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tibbin.

638
00:47:40,764 --> 00:47:46,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it typical for a superintendent to go as well as a teacher?

639
00:47:47,427 --> 00:47:47,867
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

640
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:48,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just checking.

641
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:49,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just asking.

642
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:50,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, absolutely.

643
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:57,991
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, you know, obviously they're looking for educational leaders to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.

644
00:47:59,492 --> 00:48:00,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I think my colleague has a question.

645
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:01,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

646
00:48:01,893 --> 00:48:03,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Quinn, must don't.

647
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:05,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

648
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:08,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Riccadeli, so Mr. Zizzo is the point person for the Andrews.

649
00:48:08,896 --> 00:48:11,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a point person at the McGlennan where they invited as well?

650
00:48:13,497 --> 00:48:13,697
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

651
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:17,680
[SPEAKER_10]: There were, to my knowledge, three people invited.

652
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I was invited.

653
00:48:19,141 --> 00:48:20,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I declined the invitation.

654
00:48:22,123 --> 00:48:25,304
[SPEAKER_10]: They did not select four schools.

655
00:48:25,885 --> 00:48:29,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Zizzo was selected because of his contribution.

656
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:35,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Outside of his regular duties, he introduced the entire program

657
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:38,629
[SPEAKER_10]: to how Skype could be used in it.

658
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,452
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how he differentiated himself from the rest.

659
00:48:42,792 --> 00:48:44,254
[SPEAKER_10]: The other teachers are fantastic.

660
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:45,354
[SPEAKER_10]: They do a great job.

661
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:51,299
[SPEAKER_10]: The other teacher, there's several teachers involved at the Andrews and the McGlynn.

662
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,262
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, what set him apart was his contribution with the Skype.

663
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:59,785
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's four seventh grade global scholars, right?

664
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:01,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Two at each middle school, A and B side?

665
00:49:01,926 --> 00:49:02,487
[SPEAKER_18]: That's correct.

666
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:05,449
[SPEAKER_18]: So should that be something we should think about?

667
00:49:07,104 --> 00:49:11,766
[SPEAKER_18]: to let a McGlynn rep go, just to bring it back.

668
00:49:11,786 --> 00:49:14,627
[SPEAKER_21]: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.

669
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:22,770
[SPEAKER_21]: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.

670
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:26,372
[SPEAKER_21]: All the young people, all of our teachers, did a good job doing things.

671
00:49:26,852 --> 00:49:31,494
[SPEAKER_21]: But Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.

672
00:49:31,534 --> 00:49:35,035
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, we were the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.

673
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:39,128
[SPEAKER_21]: They were looking at us for ideas.

674
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:44,070
[SPEAKER_21]: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning, and other things like that.

675
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:50,391
[SPEAKER_21]: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions, as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.

676
00:49:50,411 --> 00:50:06,475
[SPEAKER_21]: But there are teachers, and administrators, and professors, and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.

677
00:50:07,027 --> 00:50:08,488
[SPEAKER_21]: and create some outcomes that are there.

678
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:10,709
[SPEAKER_21]: So it was a selection of the program.

679
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,031
[SPEAKER_18]: And I mean, I think Mr. Zizzo's great.

680
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:15,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Tegan has him this year for seventh grade.

681
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:21,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So then is Mr. Zizzo, does he come back and teach the rest of the three seventh grade teachers about the Skyping tool?

682
00:50:22,057 --> 00:50:23,018
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, he's already done that.

683
00:50:23,058 --> 00:50:33,765
[SPEAKER_21]: But he'll come back, as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed, and how it can be advanced, and where we can grow from it, and what other people have suggested.

684
00:50:34,975 --> 00:50:39,659
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.

685
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:41,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, it's only in its fourth year.

686
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:49,947
[SPEAKER_21]: And as you might imagine with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.

687
00:50:50,607 --> 00:50:53,329
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we bring back some ideas.

688
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:59,874
[SPEAKER_21]: And these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.

689
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:03,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I just follow up?

690
00:51:05,276 --> 00:51:08,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.

691
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:16,869
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.

692
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:24,898
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent go and Mr. Zizek go, if discussion comes,

693
00:51:25,602 --> 00:51:28,244
[SPEAKER_15]: up in as far as what will be done in the future.

694
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:38,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.

695
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:41,114
[SPEAKER_15]: As you said, it's only been four years.

696
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:48,340
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on that Mr. Azuz will go before.

697
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Not to Europe.

698
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Zizou actually participated in a teleconference.

699
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:56,265
[SPEAKER_15]: The teleconference I knew of.

700
00:51:56,285 --> 00:51:57,486
[SPEAKER_21]: That was earlier in the year.

701
00:51:58,127 --> 00:52:08,137
[SPEAKER_21]: And his contributions were such that they felt that needed to be shared in a more, let's say, complete setting at the international symposium.

702
00:52:08,544 --> 00:52:17,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?

703
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:18,447
[SPEAKER_15]: How has that worked?

704
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:20,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not easy.

705
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:21,148
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very good question.

706
00:52:21,188 --> 00:52:27,470
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some cities around the world who we are not able to Skype with because of the time difference.

707
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:35,412
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have heard stories of schools around the country actually coming back at 6 o'clock at night so that they can Skype with our students.

708
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:43,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's kind of taken off on a whole new life of its own in other countries, and they get excited to do it.

709
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Have our students done that too?

710
00:52:45,071 --> 00:52:47,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go back to the school to accommodate the time frame?

711
00:52:48,313 --> 00:52:49,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to my knowledge, no.

712
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:51,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to my knowledge.

713
00:52:51,555 --> 00:53:00,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I just, I just want to, just so everyone hears, the selection of Mr. Zizzo was done by Bloomberg Philanthropies.

714
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,781
[SPEAKER_10]: It had nothing to do with

715
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:06,626
[SPEAKER_10]: with Medford Public Schools, and I think that is important to make very clear.

716
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:08,227
[SPEAKER_10]: They selected him.

717
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:10,349
[SPEAKER_10]: They selected Superintendent Belson.

718
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:11,310
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I figured.

719
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:11,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

720
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

721
00:53:12,851 --> 00:53:20,136
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.

722
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:26,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.

723
00:53:28,734 --> 00:53:29,455
[SPEAKER_21]: It was interesting.

724
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:36,500
[SPEAKER_21]: I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to the students in Athens in Greek last year.

725
00:53:37,061 --> 00:53:46,968
[SPEAKER_21]: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.

726
00:53:47,048 --> 00:53:50,531
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English.

727
00:53:51,572 --> 00:53:57,797
[SPEAKER_21]: And our students will be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that

728
00:53:58,218 --> 00:53:59,079
[SPEAKER_21]: belongs to another country.

729
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

730
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto follow up you.

731
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:07,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I'm very glad that you're going, Mr. Superintendent, um, for a few reasons.

732
00:54:07,386 --> 00:54:12,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, I've seen you represent us very well and very, um, official capacities.

733
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:15,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you represent as well.

734
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:18,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that you will take every opportunity

735
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:24,854
[SPEAKER_06]: to talk to Mr. Bloomberg and bring him and his money back to Medford where he started and where his money belongs.

736
00:54:25,454 --> 00:54:29,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And so make sure you, you know.

737
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:30,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Use your time wisely.

738
00:54:30,978 --> 00:54:40,785
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to tell you one quick, one quick cute story, which I'm not sure I should, I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,

739
00:54:42,054 --> 00:54:50,561
[SPEAKER_21]: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released his transcript from Medford High School.

740
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:55,184
[SPEAKER_21]: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.

741
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:57,346
[SPEAKER_21]: And it turned out that he got a D in French.

742
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:01,549
[SPEAKER_21]: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?

743
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

744
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:05,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Tringali.

745
00:55:06,187 --> 00:55:12,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I was wondering in what ways are students allowed to communicate with each other student to student?

746
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,472
[SPEAKER_10]: So they text each other.

747
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:16,732
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have a common lesson.

748
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:20,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So all of the lessons are formed well in advance.

749
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:24,036
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, again, on that Haiku portal.

750
00:55:24,496 --> 00:55:26,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have prompts.

751
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:28,318
[SPEAKER_10]: They have questions about a lesson.

752
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,080
[SPEAKER_10]: So in this case, it will be a lesson about food.

753
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,241
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're responding.

754
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,122
[SPEAKER_10]: So students are asked to critique

755
00:55:36,091 --> 00:55:37,958
[SPEAKER_10]: in a pleasant way to critique the writing of their.

756
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,082
[SPEAKER_10]: of the fellow students on the other side of the world.

757
00:55:42,582 --> 00:55:53,687
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of times there's a conversation that develops about this is my, I can imagine conversations about this is what we eat here, and we have farms here.

758
00:55:54,307 --> 00:56:06,993
[SPEAKER_10]: So it starts off as a very defined conversation, but often times it evolves into what would a 10 to 13 year old want to talk about with regard to the content area.

759
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:15,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it's defined, and it's prescriptive, but there's a little wiggle room for the kids to express their personality, all in a protected environment.

760
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:16,897
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.

761
00:56:17,117 --> 00:56:17,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

762
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:28,062
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to approve for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for Mr. Superintendent's expenses, there's already a motion for approval by Ms.

763
00:56:28,082 --> 00:56:29,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Cunio, seconded by Ms.

764
00:56:29,823 --> 00:56:30,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Kreatz.

765
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:32,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please.

766
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:34,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

767
00:56:34,185 --> 00:56:34,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Cunio?

768
00:56:34,845 --> 00:56:35,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

769
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:36,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto?

770
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:36,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

771
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:36,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

772
00:56:36,866 --> 00:56:37,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz?

773
00:56:41,247 --> 00:56:44,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, 6 in the affirmative, none in the negative, 1 absent.

774
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

775
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:45,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

776
00:56:46,131 --> 00:56:46,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

777
00:56:49,694 --> 00:56:54,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up, recommendation to accept the Buddy Bench donation.

778
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:59,281
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.

779
00:57:00,603 --> 00:57:05,226
[SPEAKER_26]: So as you know, we have buddy benches in all of our elementary schools, and we're very proud of that.

780
00:57:05,887 --> 00:57:10,510
[SPEAKER_26]: But Mr. Mark Tonello is donating a buddy bench to the Brooks Elementary School.

781
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:15,453
[SPEAKER_26]: This will be an indoor buddy bench, in memory of his uncle, Victor Lepore.

782
00:57:15,953 --> 00:57:19,796
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Lepore taught English and reading for 30 years in Medford.

783
00:57:20,596 --> 00:57:25,820
[SPEAKER_26]: In his early years, he taught at the Deans School, and then at the Hobbs Junior High School.

784
00:57:26,553 --> 00:57:30,714
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm very proud to say that school committee member Robert Emmett Skerry, Jr.

785
00:57:31,094 --> 00:57:35,055
[SPEAKER_26]: constructed this bench for the Tonello-DePaulo family.

786
00:57:35,075 --> 00:57:37,076
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you very much, Mr. Skerry.

787
00:57:37,716 --> 00:57:44,397
[SPEAKER_26]: There will be a dedication taking place on Friday, October 20 at the Brooks Elementary School at 4 o'clock.

788
00:57:44,517 --> 00:57:45,578
[SPEAKER_26]: And you're all invited.

789
00:57:46,178 --> 00:57:46,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

790
00:57:49,557 --> 00:57:49,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

791
00:57:49,737 --> 00:57:56,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Cugno, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Martinello, please, and his family?

792
00:57:56,882 --> 00:57:57,643
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. Skerry?

793
00:57:58,223 --> 00:58:00,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're saying thank you to him.

794
00:58:00,305 --> 00:58:02,447
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll save some paper, and we'll say thank you in person.

795
00:58:03,187 --> 00:58:05,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

796
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:05,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

797
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:05,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Cugno?

798
00:58:05,709 --> 00:58:06,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion.

799
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

800
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please.

801
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:09,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

802
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:10,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Cugno?

803
00:58:13,795 --> 00:58:14,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

804
00:58:14,676 --> 00:58:14,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

805
00:58:14,896 --> 00:58:15,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Van Bell?

806
00:58:15,236 --> 00:58:15,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

807
00:58:15,316 --> 00:58:15,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

808
00:58:15,896 --> 00:58:16,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Gress?

809
00:58:16,377 --> 00:58:16,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

810
00:58:19,488 --> 00:58:21,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, one absent.

811
00:58:22,149 --> 00:58:22,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

812
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:24,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Ms.

813
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Caldwell.

814
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you up next as well?

815
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:26,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

816
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:28,111
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I'm standing here.

817
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Going on the Kiwanis book donation.

818
00:58:30,751 --> 00:58:30,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

819
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:31,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Caldwell.

820
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:35,252
[SPEAKER_26]: So I have to say, this is one of my favorite times of the year.

821
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:40,134
[SPEAKER_26]: Although it happens at the end of the school year in June, I am so very proud.

822
00:58:40,174 --> 00:58:44,735
[SPEAKER_26]: And we should all be very happy that we have Kiwanians in our community.

823
00:58:45,242 --> 00:58:48,163
[SPEAKER_26]: that give back to our schools on a regular basis.

824
00:58:48,924 --> 00:58:56,467
[SPEAKER_26]: So we'd once again like to thank the Kiwanis Club of Medford for their generous donation of books to our first and third grade children.

825
00:58:57,007 --> 00:58:58,828
[SPEAKER_26]: The Kiwanis Club has always gone

826
00:58:59,311 --> 00:59:01,432
[SPEAKER_26]: above and beyond for the children of Medford.

827
00:59:02,012 --> 00:59:09,296
[SPEAKER_26]: So in June, members of the Kiwanis Club visited each of our schools and gave each child a bag filled with books for summer reading.

828
00:59:09,856 --> 00:59:12,798
[SPEAKER_26]: So I know I've said this before, but you have to see the students.

829
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:17,360
[SPEAKER_26]: They get their books and we say, now don't open your books till you get back to the classroom.

830
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:20,002
[SPEAKER_26]: The words even out of our mouths.

831
00:59:20,282 --> 00:59:25,945
[SPEAKER_26]: The kids have opened the books, they're looking at the, and they're trading already, which is very, very exciting.

832
00:59:26,705 --> 00:59:29,647
[SPEAKER_26]: So once again, I have some Kewanian members here.

833
00:59:29,727 --> 00:59:39,693
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to call, if they can all come to the podium, Kelly Catalo, Andrea Bates-McGrath, Rick Harviello, and Chuck Veneziano.

834
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:42,775
[SPEAKER_26]: So you have to be there to watch this happen.

835
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:44,816
[SPEAKER_26]: Chuck does this song and dance with the kids.

836
00:59:45,116 --> 00:59:46,377
[SPEAKER_26]: He's so entertaining.

837
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:52,261
[SPEAKER_26]: But if you don't mind, if I could read some of these letters, because they are priceless.

838
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:55,122
[SPEAKER_26]: So our teachers obviously have the kids

839
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:57,985
[SPEAKER_26]: write letters to thank the Kiwanis.

840
00:59:58,005 --> 01:00:00,430
[SPEAKER_26]: These happen to come from Miss McKay's room.

841
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,274
[SPEAKER_26]: She always gets these out right away.

842
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:04,584
[SPEAKER_26]: Dear Kiwanis, we love you.

843
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:07,445
[SPEAKER_26]: We love that you spend your free time with us.

844
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:10,186
[SPEAKER_26]: I will be sad that I won't get to see you anymore.

845
01:00:10,246 --> 01:00:11,507
[SPEAKER_26]: She must be a third grader.

846
01:00:12,207 --> 01:00:15,728
[SPEAKER_26]: But we'll always cherish you in my heart and in the books.

847
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:17,848
[SPEAKER_26]: By the way, I wrote a book myself.

848
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:21,610
[SPEAKER_26]: It's called Zoe in the Class School Bus Adventures.

849
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:27,331
[SPEAKER_26]: And just after that inspirational speech, I finally know what book to write.

850
01:00:27,571 --> 01:00:28,031
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

851
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:29,212
[SPEAKER_26]: Love, Regina.

852
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,367
[SPEAKER_26]: a second letter of only read three.

853
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,669
[SPEAKER_26]: There could be a lot here.

854
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:38,653
[SPEAKER_26]: Dear Kiwanis members, thanks so much for the books.

855
01:00:39,193 --> 01:00:41,295
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks for spending your free time with us.

856
01:00:41,796 --> 01:00:43,918
[SPEAKER_26]: When we get in the classroom, we get to trade.

857
01:00:44,638 --> 01:00:48,222
[SPEAKER_26]: I got rid of Skateboard Party, apparently didn't like that one.

858
01:00:49,163 --> 01:00:51,045
[SPEAKER_26]: Where did you get those awesome books?

859
01:00:51,185 --> 01:00:54,729
[SPEAKER_26]: You're the best book givers in the whole universe.

860
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,612
[SPEAKER_26]: This was from Sarah.

861
01:00:57,753 --> 01:01:00,636
[SPEAKER_26]: And the last one is like one of my very favorites.

862
01:01:00,696 --> 01:01:02,859
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, you see it, it's all in caps.

863
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:08,711
[SPEAKER_26]: Dear Kiwanis members, I'm very grateful for the books you gave me and my friends.

864
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:12,832
[SPEAKER_26]: You guys are very, caps, bold, helpful.

865
01:01:13,472 --> 01:01:15,252
[SPEAKER_26]: You are also very inspiring.

866
01:01:15,752 --> 01:01:18,353
[SPEAKER_26]: You show people to have hope when they're down.

867
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:22,153
[SPEAKER_26]: You help people with moving soft drinks and bills.

868
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:26,874
[SPEAKER_26]: You're a caring group of people who want to make the world a better place.

869
01:01:27,654 --> 01:01:31,815
[SPEAKER_26]: If you keep doing what you're doing, the Kiwanis might go worldwide.

870
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:35,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Should we tell her you're already worldwide?

871
01:01:36,003 --> 01:01:40,905
[SPEAKER_26]: You help people know that they're safe when they're around you.

872
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:45,126
[SPEAKER_26]: Medford is a better place to live in it with you guys here.

873
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:46,887
[SPEAKER_26]: Sincerely, Jaden.

874
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:47,447
[SPEAKER_26]: P.S.

875
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:52,169
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to ask my mom if she can post a video picture of me reading one of your books.

876
01:01:54,050 --> 01:02:02,033
[SPEAKER_26]: So on behalf of Medford Public Schools, grades one and three, all of our teachers and staff and families, thank you so much.

877
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:14,875
[SPEAKER_16]: It is actually our honor and privilege to contribute to the children of Medford, because that's what Kiwanis is all about.

878
01:02:15,536 --> 01:02:20,358
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all about serving the children of the world, and our job is to serve the children of Medford.

879
01:02:20,758 --> 01:02:33,764
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not just the literacy program that we hold dear to our heart, it's our scholarship program, it's our contributing to the graduation ceremony at Curtis Tufts, providing a scholarship to a Curtis Tufts student,

880
01:02:34,464 --> 01:02:38,207
[SPEAKER_16]: It's giving to Medford High School Athletics, Medford High School Band.

881
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:44,551
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, we picked up the culinary arts program and provided new aprons and jackets to them.

882
01:02:45,232 --> 01:02:51,216
[SPEAKER_16]: And more than half of our fundraising budget goes to the children of Medford.

883
01:02:52,036 --> 01:02:53,097
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are committed.

884
01:02:53,617 --> 01:02:54,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

885
01:02:55,419 --> 01:02:58,581
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm glad that my fellow Colonians, our current president

886
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:04,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Chuckie Veneziano, Rich Caraviello, as all of you know, is our past president.

887
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:07,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Kelly Catalo will be the president next year.

888
01:03:07,568 --> 01:03:09,550
[SPEAKER_16]: And my presidency just ended.

889
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:10,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

890
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Madam President.

891
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:26,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Tonight, we had the honor of welcoming a man who was a student from Italy from 1983.

892
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:30,918
[SPEAKER_20]: And he stayed with a Kiwanian family, John Sertrano's family.

893
01:03:31,439 --> 01:03:37,705
[SPEAKER_20]: And Sertrano's and the Frakes stayed friendly for all these years to the kids or anything.

894
01:03:38,185 --> 01:03:40,107
[SPEAKER_20]: And tonight he was our guest at the Kiwanis.

895
01:03:40,628 --> 01:03:43,250
[SPEAKER_20]: And he is the mayor of St.

896
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:45,573
[SPEAKER_20]: Ambrose in Italy.

897
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:46,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, wonderful.

898
01:03:46,914 --> 01:03:48,255
[SPEAKER_20]: We were proud to have him there tonight.

899
01:03:49,096 --> 01:03:49,697
[SPEAKER_20]: And I say,

900
01:03:50,662 --> 01:03:51,983
[SPEAKER_20]: The family just keeps growing.

901
01:03:52,183 --> 01:03:53,024
[SPEAKER_13]: What a nice story.

902
01:03:53,565 --> 01:03:59,390
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to witness firsthand the event at the Roberts, and it is an event, I got to tell you.

903
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:08,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I was quite surprised, but the kids were so elated to see you all come in and just to hear the stories and Kelly's enthusiasm, and it was a fabulous afternoon.

904
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:10,341
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for letting me share with you.

905
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:15,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to the city of Medford for helping us put on jail day 5K and shutting down the streets so we could do that.

906
01:04:15,205 --> 01:04:15,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

907
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:22,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

908
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:27,652
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion that this report be placed on file, second by Mr. Benedetto.

909
01:04:27,712 --> 01:04:28,412
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

910
01:04:29,153 --> 01:04:29,833
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

911
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:30,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

912
01:04:33,735 --> 01:04:36,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we send a thank you letter to the Quantians as well?

913
01:04:38,498 --> 01:04:41,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on Professional Development Day, November 7, 2017.

914
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

915
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:44,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Caldwell.

916
01:04:46,502 --> 01:04:50,805
[SPEAKER_26]: So as most of you know, our Professional Development Day is coming up on November 7.

917
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:54,003
[SPEAKER_26]: It'll be our first of two days.

918
01:04:54,764 --> 01:05:03,849
[SPEAKER_26]: The elementary staff will be meeting at the McGlynn Elementary School, and of course we've asked them to park at Hormel because it's voting day, we don't want that to interfere.

919
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:10,233
[SPEAKER_26]: And they will be participating in grade level workshops on response to intervention.

920
01:05:11,113 --> 01:05:19,258
[SPEAKER_26]: You may remember this was one of the district initiatives that you wanted to see us do and our teachers want to be trained in.

921
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:32,899
[SPEAKER_26]: Teachers 21 is a consulting firm from Newton, Mass., who will work with our staff to build a shared understanding of RTI fundamentals and help us consider our next steps.

922
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:41,185
[SPEAKER_26]: Staff will understand the structures, processes, and instructional practices needed for successful implementation of RTI.

923
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:47,550
[SPEAKER_26]: In addition, staff will work collaboratively, self-assess current capacities, and plan

924
01:05:47,937 --> 01:05:50,898
[SPEAKER_26]: for the next step for implementation of RTI.

925
01:05:52,138 --> 01:05:58,059
[SPEAKER_26]: The middle schools will participate in Study Island as a universal screening behavioral intervention tool.

926
01:05:58,759 --> 01:06:06,421
[SPEAKER_26]: Teachers will learn to utilize Study Island questions and develop a fall winter screener exam for grades six, seven, and eight.

927
01:06:07,161 --> 01:06:17,123
[SPEAKER_26]: Administrators and teachers will review behavioral interventions and develop their own pyramid to determine what is considered tier one, tier two, and tier three.

928
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:22,103
[SPEAKER_26]: The Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School will meet at Medford High School.

929
01:06:23,084 --> 01:06:40,372
[SPEAKER_26]: Medford High Vocational School and the Curtis Tufts staff will participate in workshops regarding specific building-based data collection in focus group discussions and identify topics from their ongoing partnerships with Harvard University and Boston College.

930
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:46,255
[SPEAKER_26]: Paraprofessionals in Medford will collaborate with each other on online curriculum

931
01:06:46,773 --> 01:06:54,677
[SPEAKER_26]: in three research-based modules, independence, positive behavior supports, and effective communication.

932
01:06:55,418 --> 01:07:02,682
[SPEAKER_26]: The fine arts department will focus on teaching pathways through the music curriculum, as well as concepts in art education.

933
01:07:03,462 --> 01:07:08,965
[SPEAKER_26]: Nurses, physical education, and health education staff will participate in safety care training.

934
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:13,070
[SPEAKER_26]: There are many other groups of specialists involved.

935
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:19,255
[SPEAKER_26]: There are guidance people and psychologists that we're just getting information on them.

936
01:07:19,295 --> 01:07:21,096
[SPEAKER_26]: I just couldn't put them all down at one time.

937
01:07:22,057 --> 01:07:28,202
[SPEAKER_26]: So after Professional Development Day, we will provide you with a report letting you know how we made out on that day.

938
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:29,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

939
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:31,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

940
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:32,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

941
01:07:32,365 --> 01:07:34,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the report.

942
01:07:34,948 --> 01:07:37,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a question about the RTI fundamentals.

943
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we were considering

944
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:42,885
[SPEAKER_06]: adding additional help last year at budget time.

945
01:07:42,965 --> 01:07:44,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure.

946
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:49,686
[SPEAKER_06]: At that time, we identified additional staff members that may be helping with RTI.

947
01:07:50,047 --> 01:07:52,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Will they be helping with this training?

948
01:07:52,567 --> 01:08:00,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly what staff members, off the top of my head, we identified as helping out with RTI.

949
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:04,430
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just want to make sure that if we are providing any training and insight,

950
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:09,441
[SPEAKER_06]: to make that program better that all staff members are invited, not just the regular ed teachers?

951
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:11,343
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's not just the classroom teachers.

952
01:08:11,823 --> 01:08:14,786
[SPEAKER_26]: We have Title I. We have literacy specialists.

953
01:08:15,186 --> 01:08:16,988
[SPEAKER_26]: We have special education teachers.

954
01:08:17,028 --> 01:08:18,469
[SPEAKER_26]: We have our EL staff.

955
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:24,294
[SPEAKER_26]: Most of our elementary staff will be participating in this RTI.

956
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:26,356
[SPEAKER_26]: So it will be grade level.

957
01:08:26,376 --> 01:08:31,160
[SPEAKER_26]: So it will be K1 teachers with one consultant, two, three, and then four or five.

958
01:08:31,648 --> 01:08:42,935
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're all learning this together, so that when they have their RTI block, that everyone jumps in and helps the students to progress.

959
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:43,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

960
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:48,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says here, help us consider our next steps.

961
01:08:48,398 --> 01:08:52,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you provide us with a report of what, you know, those steps are?

962
01:08:53,191 --> 01:08:57,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we want to keep track of this this year in case it becomes a budget issue for next year.

963
01:08:58,173 --> 01:08:58,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

964
01:08:58,953 --> 01:08:59,273
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

965
01:08:59,433 --> 01:08:59,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

966
01:09:00,093 --> 01:09:04,135
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'll put that on my request of reports.

967
01:09:04,815 --> 01:09:09,577
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're beginning the pilot in January with first grades and with fourth grades.

968
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:17,159
[SPEAKER_26]: And we'll probably know by the end of May how that's working out, and then how we can roll that out to K to 5.

969
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,460
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

970
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:26,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I just really want to make sure, because teachers spoke about how important RTI is in making those changes.

971
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:36,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So before budget times and if we're going to allocate additional funding, I want some data and updates throughout this year.

972
01:09:36,253 --> 01:09:41,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe in January, we can have an update of how it's going and what it's looking like.

973
01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:44,776
[SPEAKER_06]: So by March, when the superintendent's thinking

974
01:09:45,898 --> 01:09:50,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Where I'm allocating funds for next year, if we do see any concerns, he can keep it on his radar.

975
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm keeping it on mine, Mr. Belson.

976
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:58,162
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would think that by the end of January or February, because we're just beginning January.

977
01:09:58,182 --> 01:10:00,423
[SPEAKER_26]: So we need about four to six weeks to get it started.

978
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,624
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'll put by February 1 on my paperwork.

979
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:06,525
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion that reports do be listed for RTI next steps.

980
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:06,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

981
01:10:07,005 --> 01:10:08,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Added to our agenda.

982
01:10:08,646 --> 01:10:09,506
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

983
01:10:09,526 --> 01:10:09,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

984
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:10,967
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

985
01:10:11,227 --> 01:10:11,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

986
01:10:15,934 --> 01:10:24,156
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a request that you had made for a report at our last meeting that I didn't notice on our... And there's one on there that should come up too.

987
01:10:24,676 --> 01:10:24,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

988
01:10:25,436 --> 01:10:26,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

989
01:10:26,477 --> 01:10:30,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just didn't know if this was an appropriate time to make a comment for that.

990
01:10:30,318 --> 01:10:30,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that okay?

991
01:10:31,078 --> 01:10:31,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

992
01:10:31,618 --> 01:10:40,661
[SPEAKER_06]: You had asked for a breakdown of the male-female concussion report at our last meeting, and I didn't see that report on the list of requested reports.

993
01:10:41,443 --> 01:10:44,884
[SPEAKER_13]: So male-female concussion reports by sport.

994
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:45,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

995
01:10:46,245 --> 01:10:54,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And also just to keep in mind that we asked that non-athletic concussions be followed if we're notified at that same meeting.

996
01:10:55,369 --> 01:11:01,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So just as a reminder that that data is important for all students, not just our athletic students.

997
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:02,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

998
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:04,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

999
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:07,053
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to this report be placed on file.

1000
01:11:07,073 --> 01:11:07,794
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1001
01:11:08,434 --> 01:11:09,134
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1002
01:11:09,154 --> 01:11:09,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1003
01:11:09,775 --> 01:11:10,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Report is on file.

1004
01:11:12,672 --> 01:11:15,434
[SPEAKER_13]: report on elementary science programs, school year 17-18.

1005
01:11:15,474 --> 01:11:17,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Cieri.

1006
01:11:18,676 --> 01:11:33,908
[SPEAKER_26]: So this evening, Rocco Cieri, Director of Science, will update you on the efforts to realign the science and technology engineering curriculum, as well as the variety of science programs that are being piloted in our elementary schools.

1007
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:40,853
[SPEAKER_26]: The following topics will be discussed, information on science programs, professional development and materials,

1008
01:11:41,515 --> 01:11:50,217
[SPEAKER_26]: surveying staff, administrators, and parents on said programs, professional development for current school year, and additional resources.

1009
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:56,258
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just want to take a moment to thank Mr. Cieri for his very hard work in science.

1010
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:09,560
[SPEAKER_26]: He spent a lot of time working with not just our elementary staff, but parents who wanted to be a part of looking at what we might pilot next year.

1011
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:13,078
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you, Mr. Sierra, and I give this to you.

1012
01:12:27,335 --> 01:12:28,216
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, everyone.

1013
01:12:29,036 --> 01:12:30,557
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for having me here tonight.

1014
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:36,662
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm pretty excited to be speaking about K-5 science rather than high school science, middle school science.

1015
01:12:37,422 --> 01:12:41,565
[SPEAKER_24]: We're finally here looking at K-5 science programs.

1016
01:12:42,626 --> 01:12:48,410
[SPEAKER_24]: The report you have in front of you sort of highlights a little bit of what we've accomplished since last year.

1017
01:12:49,831 --> 01:13:06,265
[SPEAKER_24]: Starting in April 6th through the end of May, we invited vendors in with their most current science programs and had teachers review them, look at the materials that they provided, a whole series of things, let them do presentations.

1018
01:13:06,746 --> 01:13:08,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Parents were there, administrators were there.

1019
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:16,465
[SPEAKER_24]: myself and 24 teachers from all, there were representatives from every elementary school at every level.

1020
01:13:16,565 --> 01:13:23,890
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was a very sort of cohesive group that showed up on a regular basis after school.

1021
01:13:24,771 --> 01:13:31,216
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, some chocolate snacks were provided as often as I could put them in place, but they were always there.

1022
01:13:32,177 --> 01:13:36,580
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was a really very productive group.

1023
01:13:37,733 --> 01:14:02,603
[SPEAKER_24]: So we looked at five programs, Know Adam, Inspire Science from McGraw-Hill, Elevate Science from Pearson, Carolina Science presented a program called Smithsonian Science in the Classroom, and Delta Education, which is also a part of school specialty, these are all companies, showed us FOSS Next Generation.

1024
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:06,185
[SPEAKER_24]: The teachers filled in at the end of each

1025
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:18,507
[SPEAKER_24]: presentation, a survey, and then they filled in a survey at the end where they provided sort of like, now that you've seen all the programs, which ones would you, you know, want to pilot?

1026
01:14:19,307 --> 01:14:21,328
[SPEAKER_24]: And three sort of emerged out of those.

1027
01:14:22,489 --> 01:14:26,510
[SPEAKER_24]: The top by far was the McGraw-Hill Inspire Science Program.

1028
01:14:27,691 --> 01:14:29,851
[SPEAKER_24]: The second two were essentially tied.

1029
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:37,362
[SPEAKER_24]: the Pearson Elevate Science Program and the Delta Education FOSS Next Generation Program.

1030
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:46,866
[SPEAKER_24]: And I inquired further with those three companies about what was possible for the pilot, what they would provide for us as you had requested last year.

1031
01:14:47,586 --> 01:15:00,892
[SPEAKER_24]: McGraw-Hill agreed to pilot with full access to the curriculum online, gave hard copies of the teacher guides for two teachers per grade level, all the student consumable workbooks that we need for all the students,

1032
01:15:02,275 --> 01:15:05,496
[SPEAKER_24]: and the small group hands-on group activity kits.

1033
01:15:06,216 --> 01:15:09,757
[SPEAKER_24]: So per teacher, it's about $1,600 worth of materials.

1034
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:17,899
[SPEAKER_24]: They provided the training, which is ongoing, and we have 48 teachers this year going through that particular program.

1035
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:26,422
[SPEAKER_24]: A second company I pursued a bit was Pearson, asking them what they could do.

1036
01:15:27,442 --> 01:15:30,963
[SPEAKER_24]: They would allow us to pilot with full access to the curriculum online

1037
01:15:31,413 --> 01:15:37,257
[SPEAKER_24]: and hard copies of teacher guides, but their pilot was to start in January of this upcoming year.

1038
01:15:38,257 --> 01:15:42,520
[SPEAKER_24]: They also weren't going to provide hands-on kits because they would never be available in time.

1039
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:48,724
[SPEAKER_24]: Their program is brand new, and the teachers had limited access to see what the table of contents of those programs were.

1040
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:55,428
[SPEAKER_24]: So with all of that kind of information, we're kind of waiting to see what

1041
01:15:55,916 --> 01:16:05,060
[SPEAKER_24]: Pearson provides, and they said they were interested in providing at least a bid if in the future there was something to do, something to look at.

1042
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:13,224
[SPEAKER_24]: We could also look forward and say, okay, well, maybe we'll pilot in a future year with that particular program.

1043
01:16:13,865 --> 01:16:18,927
[SPEAKER_24]: FOSS just allowed us to pilot one unit.

1044
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:22,946
[SPEAKER_24]: It would include the materials, the professional development.

1045
01:16:24,307 --> 01:16:42,099
[SPEAKER_24]: One unit for them is about 12 weeks worth of instruction, 12 to 14 weeks of instruction, so it's a fairly large swath, and they only give you about three units per year, so we're piloting about a third of their curriculum for the next 12 to 14 weeks.

1046
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:46,242
[SPEAKER_24]: That training will start at the end of this month, will continue into the next month,

1047
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:49,837
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have eight teachers piloting that from K to four.

1048
01:16:51,158 --> 01:16:52,979
[SPEAKER_24]: And they will be trained as well.

1049
01:16:53,439 --> 01:17:03,483
[SPEAKER_24]: It sounds like a much smaller pilot, but we can still sort of give them some super delegates as they provide us information about what FOSS is like and how the implementation goes.

1050
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:12,486
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm not sort of concerned about the number difference as much as I am the quality of the information that we get back from them as we make decisions moving forward.

1051
01:17:13,507 --> 01:17:16,228
[SPEAKER_24]: So those are the pilots that are ongoing at this time.

1052
01:17:17,726 --> 01:17:24,889
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to make sure I have a bullet list and making sure that I touch everything rather than give you a summary, just read through.

1053
01:17:24,909 --> 01:17:33,773
[SPEAKER_24]: OK, so I mentioned McGraw-Hill, FOSS.

1054
01:17:36,554 --> 01:17:43,557
[SPEAKER_24]: We should be prepared to consider adoption at the end of this year, looking at the two programs.

1055
01:17:46,085 --> 01:18:01,273
[SPEAKER_24]: sort of we'll bring back that information to the school committee to make a decision about which direction to go and whether or not there's enough information for us as educators to make a good, solid decision.

1056
01:18:03,994 --> 01:18:08,937
[SPEAKER_24]: As I said, we've got another opportunity that was provided.

1057
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,257
[SPEAKER_24]: It's at the end of the report.

1058
01:18:12,579 --> 01:18:24,075
[SPEAKER_24]: I still see a bit of a need to help elementary educators understand the engineering design process and engineering thinking.

1059
01:18:24,476 --> 01:18:27,600
[SPEAKER_24]: This is part of the curriculum frameworks.

1060
01:18:27,973 --> 01:18:31,755
[SPEAKER_24]: but it's not something that most elementary educators are trained in.

1061
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:37,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Generally, a trained engineer will work in engineering and not go to K to 5 education.

1062
01:18:38,258 --> 01:18:52,966
[SPEAKER_24]: So there is some support for us in being able to train teachers using the Engineering is Elementary program, which is produced by the Museum of Science in Boston.

1063
01:18:53,026 --> 01:18:56,188
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a phenomenal, well-researched-based program

1064
01:18:57,577 --> 01:19:05,303
[SPEAKER_24]: Whether or not we choose to purchase that program for our teachers is something outside of the discussion.

1065
01:19:05,343 --> 01:19:11,829
[SPEAKER_24]: It's really about what the training would give to the teachers in terms of how to understand engineering design.

1066
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:22,297
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's available to us for March 12th, and we plan to offer that as one of the PD's opportunities for the teachers.

1067
01:19:23,056 --> 01:19:25,618
[SPEAKER_24]: At no cost, it won't cost us anything, so.

1068
01:19:25,638 --> 01:19:26,659
[SPEAKER_24]: There you go.

1069
01:19:27,259 --> 01:19:27,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Skerry.

1070
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Through you to Mr. Skerry.

1071
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:41,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Rocco, would it be possible to supply us with some of the samples that you've been given so that we can see what we could possibly look at down the road as far as instrumenting a new program?

1072
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:42,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1073
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1074
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:44,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1075
01:19:45,552 --> 01:19:45,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1076
01:19:45,732 --> 01:19:46,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Cugno.

1077
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:48,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Chesteri.

1078
01:19:49,376 --> 01:19:51,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?

1079
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:55,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Have any of the teachers been involved in any of this?

1080
01:19:56,850 --> 01:20:00,812
[SPEAKER_24]: So, as I said, there are 48 teachers currently piloting.

1081
01:20:01,412 --> 01:20:05,514
[SPEAKER_24]: They've received all the kits, the teacher materials, teacher guides.

1082
01:20:05,974 --> 01:20:13,138
[SPEAKER_24]: They were initially trained at the end of September, so they've gone through one training that sort of gives them an overview of the program.

1083
01:20:14,499 --> 01:20:17,220
[SPEAKER_24]: We're training again in October at the end of the month.

1084
01:20:18,969 --> 01:20:20,891
[SPEAKER_24]: The feedback's been really positive.

1085
01:20:21,712 --> 01:20:24,875
[SPEAKER_24]: It's very aligned to the curriculum.

1086
01:20:25,455 --> 01:20:33,503
[SPEAKER_24]: And teachers were really, when they expressed through last year's pilot that they wanted a full year,

1087
01:20:34,325 --> 01:20:46,288
[SPEAKER_24]: or sort of uninterrupted time of using a program, I honored that and didn't try to find one that was a half measure along that.

1088
01:20:47,008 --> 01:21:03,493
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, they requested that, especially at the K-2 level, that the materials were sort of hands-on, that they, you know, the initial sort of program explanation is a lot of

1089
01:21:04,087 --> 01:21:07,470
[SPEAKER_24]: the workbook-based or the teacher guides.

1090
01:21:08,691 --> 01:21:19,940
[SPEAKER_24]: And so they were concerned that it wasn't a hands-on program, at least for McGraw-Hill, but I thought they've shown something very different.

1091
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:22,843
[SPEAKER_24]: Every grade level has hands-on kits.

1092
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:25,507
[SPEAKER_24]: The workbook is supposed to be like a notebook.

1093
01:21:25,587 --> 01:21:30,892
[SPEAKER_24]: It is scaffolded, but it's really sort of like a science notebook that students use and write in.

1094
01:21:31,072 --> 01:21:33,614
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a pretty interesting program.

1095
01:21:34,615 --> 01:21:39,579
[SPEAKER_15]: The 48 teachers that were involved, are they even across the board?

1096
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,383
[SPEAKER_24]: It's two per grade level, per school.

1097
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:50,689
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's essentially half the faculty across the board.

1098
01:21:51,563 --> 01:21:53,385
[SPEAKER_24]: And most of the kids, believe it or not.

1099
01:21:53,925 --> 01:22:02,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, because some schools have three teachers or have one teaching science, so it captures all of the kids in some grade levels.

1100
01:22:02,373 --> 01:22:06,437
[SPEAKER_15]: What have the teachers heard from the students as far as feedback?

1101
01:22:06,497 --> 01:22:07,098
[SPEAKER_24]: They love it.

1102
01:22:07,844 --> 01:22:09,225
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, the kids really like it.

1103
01:22:10,727 --> 01:22:13,569
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of them are saying that it's finally science time.

1104
01:22:13,589 --> 01:22:14,710
[SPEAKER_24]: They're getting excited.

1105
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:15,611
[SPEAKER_24]: They're moving ahead.

1106
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:19,034
[SPEAKER_24]: We're getting requests for other materials and things like that.

1107
01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:20,575
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's been positive.

1108
01:22:20,816 --> 01:22:22,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Any feedback from parents?

1109
01:22:23,278 --> 01:22:23,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Not yet.

1110
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:25,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Looking forward to it, though.

1111
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:26,240
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1112
01:22:26,661 --> 01:22:27,021
[SPEAKER_18]: Curious.

1113
01:22:27,982 --> 01:22:28,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1114
01:22:28,182 --> 01:22:28,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Nostal.

1115
01:22:28,382 --> 01:22:28,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1116
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,541
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, Mr. Ceri.

1117
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:34,624
[SPEAKER_18]: For the FOSS one with the eight teachers at the Brooks, that hasn't started yet.

1118
01:22:34,884 --> 01:22:35,845
[SPEAKER_24]: That has not started.

1119
01:22:36,405 --> 01:22:40,748
[SPEAKER_24]: We want to train first, provide kits, and then the teachers can start.

1120
01:22:41,048 --> 01:22:41,308
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1121
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:50,735
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the other that just caught my attention, because I know it's been a while that we've been waiting to pilot, the Inspire Science Program was adopted this year by Stoneham Public Schools of the K through 5.

1122
01:22:51,075 --> 01:22:52,797
[SPEAKER_18]: So they didn't pilot programs.

1123
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:56,059
[SPEAKER_18]: They just went with it and started this past September.

1124
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,440
[SPEAKER_24]: They did.

1125
01:22:59,292 --> 01:22:59,572
[SPEAKER_24]: So.

1126
01:23:00,933 --> 01:23:02,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And are they having any regrets?

1127
01:23:02,073 --> 01:23:03,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have a contact there?

1128
01:23:03,254 --> 01:23:04,735
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, but I can find out.

1129
01:23:05,055 --> 01:23:05,675
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1130
01:23:05,715 --> 01:23:05,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1131
01:23:06,295 --> 01:23:09,917
[SPEAKER_18]: They kind of threw the dice and bought a whole curriculum for a whole school system.

1132
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:10,537
[SPEAKER_18]: They did.

1133
01:23:11,558 --> 01:23:11,878
OK.

1134
01:23:12,118 --> 01:23:12,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1135
01:23:12,879 --> 01:23:14,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to receive and place this on the aisle?

1136
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion.

1137
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:16,180

01:23:17,641 --> 01:23:18,021

1140
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:18,821
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1141
01:23:19,182 --> 01:23:19,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1142
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:20,222
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1143
01:23:20,582 --> 01:23:21,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1144
01:23:21,843 --> 01:23:22,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for all your work.

1145
01:23:22,483 --> 01:23:23,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1146
01:23:23,363 --> 01:23:23,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1147
01:23:23,724 --> 01:23:23,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1148
01:23:25,938 --> 01:23:28,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on vocational technical advisory committee schedule.

1149
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:38,163
[SPEAKER_21]: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.

1150
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:44,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.

1151
01:23:44,985 --> 01:23:54,909
[SPEAKER_21]: They've existed over the years, but with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved and many more people

1152
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:56,170
[SPEAKER_21]: were involved.

1153
01:23:57,811 --> 01:24:05,753
[SPEAKER_21]: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources to the school administration, the various shop instructors.

1154
01:24:06,653 --> 01:24:16,636
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories, include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.

1155
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:21,618
[SPEAKER_21]: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.

1156
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:33,761
[SPEAKER_21]: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.

1157
01:24:33,801 --> 01:24:44,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.

1158
01:24:44,443 --> 01:24:47,184
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're in violation, but

1159
01:24:48,336 --> 01:24:54,179
[SPEAKER_21]: This attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.

1160
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay?

1161
01:24:57,041 --> 01:25:01,504
[SPEAKER_21]: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.

1162
01:25:01,524 --> 01:25:03,745
[SPEAKER_21]: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.

1163
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,407
[SPEAKER_21]: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op

1164
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:11,948
[SPEAKER_21]: locations that our young people go to.

1165
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:14,228
[SPEAKER_21]: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.

1166
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:18,570
[SPEAKER_21]: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.

1167
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:28,273
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various advisory committees so you see who's actually involved at this point in time.

1168
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:31,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.

1169
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:39,237
[SPEAKER_21]: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.

1170
01:25:39,818 --> 01:25:46,701
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.

1171
01:25:49,622 --> 01:25:57,805
[SPEAKER_21]: You can be sure that our current administration at the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that

1172
01:25:58,315 --> 01:26:02,678
[SPEAKER_21]: are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.

1173
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:06,661
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.

1174
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:10,063
[SPEAKER_21]: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas.

1175
01:26:10,443 --> 01:26:13,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of them combine because of the affinity for each other.

1176
01:26:13,386 --> 01:26:15,747
[SPEAKER_21]: They're really crossover areas.

1177
01:26:16,288 --> 01:26:21,691
[SPEAKER_21]: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that

1178
01:26:22,832 --> 01:26:31,238
[SPEAKER_21]: We have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and what they do.

1179
01:26:32,839 --> 01:26:33,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1180
01:26:33,299 --> 01:26:33,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1181
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:34,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

1182
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,761
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking at the co-op employers.

1183
01:26:37,482 --> 01:26:42,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?

1184
01:26:42,605 --> 01:26:43,866
[SPEAKER_21]: We actually have students right now.

1185
01:26:43,886 --> 01:26:47,829
[SPEAKER_21]: We actually have students in their businesses right now.

1186
01:26:48,182 --> 01:26:52,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like, construction doesn't have anything?

1187
01:26:52,786 --> 01:27:00,894
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers, and we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly a business activity, it's mostly with the laborers.

1188
01:27:01,034 --> 01:27:02,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?

1189
01:27:03,276 --> 01:27:03,636
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry?

1190
01:27:03,816 --> 01:27:05,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Business, tech, and marketing?

1191
01:27:05,518 --> 01:27:10,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Jill is working on filling all these areas.

1192
01:27:10,565 --> 01:27:12,266
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, and the same thing with the graphic arts?

1193
01:27:12,306 --> 01:27:12,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1194
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:14,047
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, and the media?

1195
01:27:14,928 --> 01:27:17,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Media tech, I'm assuming, will be utilizing our media?

1196
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:19,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Not necessarily.

1197
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:20,391
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be internships and co-ops.

1198
01:27:20,411 --> 01:27:21,091
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be outside.

1199
01:27:21,131 --> 01:27:23,253
[SPEAKER_21]: There'll be expansions of this.

1200
01:27:23,273 --> 01:27:25,034
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very early in the year for this.

1201
01:27:25,554 --> 01:27:25,634
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1202
01:27:25,734 --> 01:27:26,374
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thank you.

1203
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:28,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1204
01:27:28,456 --> 01:27:28,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz?

1205
01:27:29,076 --> 01:27:29,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1206
01:27:30,057 --> 01:27:36,120
[SPEAKER_11]: When we do get the next report, could we get a breakdown of how many students are in the co-op at each program?

1207
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:36,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1208
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just curious about that also.

1209
01:27:38,021 --> 01:27:38,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1210
01:27:39,651 --> 01:27:42,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

1211
01:27:42,113 --> 01:27:43,093

1228
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:16,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it was before you started talking about this issue.

1229
01:28:16,435 --> 01:28:21,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I just realized that there was another report on the reports requested list missing.

1230
01:28:22,559 --> 01:28:26,681
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll wait until after the superintendent talks about the.

1231
01:28:26,741 --> 01:28:34,506
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we tabled this so that people could have an opportunity to look it over to determine whether or not they could attend this conference.

1232
01:28:35,207 --> 01:28:36,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any members that would like to be

1233
01:28:37,967 --> 01:28:39,948

1234

01:29:02,326 --> 01:29:15,141
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.

[SPEAKER_15]: There are vendors there.

1240
01:29:17,023 --> 01:29:18,645
[SPEAKER_15]: There are opportunities on workshops.

1241
01:29:19,065 --> 01:29:24,087
[SPEAKER_15]: There's really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are.

1242
01:29:25,848 --> 01:29:37,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's, you know, a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations or it's a particular city that tries to do that.

1243
01:29:37,274 --> 01:29:39,575
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot more involved than that.

1244
01:29:39,655 --> 01:29:42,496
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state.

1245

[SPEAKER_15]: for our positions here, the Robert's Rules of Order.

1246
01:29:47,585 --> 01:29:55,970
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures.

1247
01:29:57,451 --> 01:29:58,752
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying we don't know them.

1248
01:29:58,872 --> 01:30:00,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.

1249
01:30:03,115 --> 01:30:06,197
[SPEAKER_13]: So is there a motion just to receive this paper and place it on file?

01:32:11,007 --> 01:32:18,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that some days there's less than, there's a few open seats on the bus leaving from the high school going back.

1282
01:32:18,852 --> 01:32:21,113
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's some days that overcrowding is happening.

1283
01:32:21,793 --> 01:32:24,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like some more significant data.

1284
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:27,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that all our students have a ride home.

1285
01:32:27,114 --> 01:32:32,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's over 100 students taking the bus on any given day.

1286
01:32:32,576 --> 01:32:37,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want data, and I'm requesting that for the next meeting.

1287
01:32:37,657 --> 01:32:40,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I can read the email that I received.

1288
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:40,758
[SPEAKER_06]: That's OK.

1289
01:32:40,778 --> 01:32:43,459
[SPEAKER_13]: We can add it to the reports list, and Christine can put it together.

1290
01:32:43,499 --> 01:32:45,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Christine can comment on that, because we've done some work on that.

1291
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:47,980
[SPEAKER_21]: And we can give you a quick idea, and then we'll give you a formal report.

1292
01:32:51,736 --> 01:32:56,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Overview, we have been monitoring the activity for the bus from the high school.

1293
01:32:57,339 --> 01:33:03,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And there has generally been between 40 and 45 students that are routinely taking the bus.

1294
01:33:03,503 --> 01:33:10,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have not seen the overcrowding since we have been monitoring that on a pretty much daily basis.

1295
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:17,211
[SPEAKER_05]: So there has been representation out there at the bus and making sure that the overcrowding is not taking place.

1296
01:33:17,271 --> 01:33:20,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have adjusted for some of that on other routes as well.

1297
01:33:21,187 --> 01:33:21,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1298
01:33:21,767 --> 01:33:22,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1299
01:33:23,469 --> 01:33:25,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you still like a written report?

1300
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:31,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, just because it's different from what I had gotten from an email.

1301
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:39,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I would like to know how many passes are given out for that bus, because I heard that they have IDs to get on and off that bus at this point.

1302
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:49,907
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a new implementation that we have done to monitor the usage of the bus and ensure that there are not overcrowding for the students that are actually

1303
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,921
[SPEAKER_05]: intended to ride that bus.

1304
01:33:52,321 --> 01:33:56,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So the bus passes are being monitored as well.

1305
01:33:56,962 --> 01:34:01,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will confirm the count with the headmaster.

1306
01:34:01,184 --> 01:34:01,964
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1307
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:13,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the email that I have in front of me, it says we currently have 104 eligible students that live in North Medford Heights area that have rode the bus at some point over the past three weeks.

1308
01:34:13,808 --> 01:34:14,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Eligible.

1309
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:15,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1310
01:34:15,409 --> 01:34:18,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And that they issued bus passage to eligible students

1311
01:34:20,115 --> 01:34:26,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are days that are a couple open seats, and other days we are over capacity by a few students.

1312
01:34:26,278 --> 01:34:34,301
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure nobody's over capacity driving and riding in any of our buses, especially the high school kids.

1313
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:35,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Their backpacks are huge.

1314
01:34:36,102 --> 01:34:37,022
[SPEAKER_06]: The kids are bigger.

1315
01:34:37,462 --> 01:34:40,584
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only two to a seat, realistically, not three.

1316
01:34:41,124 --> 01:34:43,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would just like some data or like

1317
01:34:44,487 --> 01:34:46,268
[SPEAKER_06]: On Mondays, this is what happens.

1318
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:47,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And on Fridays, this is what happens.

1319
01:34:47,928 --> 01:34:49,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wednesdays, it goes crazy.

1320
01:34:49,329 --> 01:34:50,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it rains, it's impossible.

1321
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:55,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know so that way we are transporting our students safely.

1322
01:34:56,452 --> 01:34:57,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all that matters.

1323
01:34:57,532 --> 01:35:01,014
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like a report of that in that way.

1324
01:35:01,494 --> 01:35:04,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's on the reports due list.

1325
01:35:05,315 --> 01:35:09,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like that soon because we are halfway through.

1326
01:35:10,193 --> 01:35:14,336
[SPEAKER_06]: October and we need to make sure all our children are transported safely.

1327
01:35:14,356 --> 01:35:15,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hate to have something happen.

1328
01:35:16,057 --> 01:35:25,243
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, just as a follow-up, we do work very closely with the bus company to ensure that safety is the number one issue for all of our buses.

1329
01:35:25,363 --> 01:35:34,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So that has been a priority, especially with the high school, given the size of the seats and the reduced counts that are available.

1330
01:35:35,353 --> 01:35:38,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the eligible count does not mean that they're all riding.

1331
01:35:38,374 --> 01:35:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have many MBTA bus passes that we issue as well.

1332
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:48,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So on a given day, there is not 100 students that are trying to get onto the yellow bus.

1333
01:35:48,777 --> 01:35:49,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, however.

1334
01:35:50,017 --> 01:35:52,298
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'd like the numbers, if you can provide them.

1335
01:35:52,338 --> 01:35:53,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

1336
01:35:53,698 --> 01:35:54,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1337
01:35:54,378 --> 01:35:54,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1338
01:35:54,859 --> 01:35:55,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1339
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:57,579
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion for suspension of the rules.

1340
01:35:57,739 --> 01:35:58,440
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1341
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,640
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1342
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:00,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1343
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Stone would like to discuss something.

1344
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:07,152
[SPEAKER_18]: for a minute just to make a resolution.

1345
01:36:07,712 --> 01:36:19,920
[SPEAKER_18]: Kathy, I spoke to Kathy, a parent emailed that there is currently not a behaviorist at the Glen Elementary, our middle school, and there are children who are on IVs who have it in their IV for behavior.

1346
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:31,708
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know you're interviewing currently, but if there's something we can do to help get it moving, I don't know if we can subcontract with the company until someone's hired.

1347
01:36:32,297 --> 01:36:35,540
[SPEAKER_18]: But the parent is very concerned that there's not a behaviorist at that school.

1348
01:36:36,121 --> 01:36:36,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Kathy, you want to comment?

1349
01:36:44,628 --> 01:36:44,809
Sure.

1350
01:36:44,909 --> 01:36:45,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

1351
01:36:45,369 --> 01:36:46,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

1352
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:49,433
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a late resignation just before the start of the school year.

1353
01:36:50,129 --> 01:36:52,412
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have been actively looking for a replacement.

1354
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:56,437
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been interviewing individuals to replace that position.

1355
01:36:56,998 --> 01:37:02,145
[SPEAKER_17]: In the meantime, we do have two other BCBAs and two other behavioral specialists in the school district.

1356
01:37:02,887 --> 01:37:05,429
[SPEAKER_17]: And the responsibilities have been evenly divided.

1357
01:37:05,489 --> 01:37:14,055
[SPEAKER_17]: So all IEP services and all evaluations are on target and all being done in compliance with regulations.

1358
01:37:14,175 --> 01:37:22,620
[SPEAKER_17]: So there haven't been, to the best of my knowledge, there are no students who have gone without any service that is to be provided by a BCBA.

1359
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:29,625
[SPEAKER_17]: I do realize that school teams oftentimes depend on people when a disruption occurs in the moment.

1360
01:37:30,107 --> 01:37:39,509
[SPEAKER_17]: But we are well-staffed with school psychologists, school adjustment Councilors, and other support staff who are equipped to be able to manage those situations.

1361
01:37:39,929 --> 01:37:47,711
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm unclear of the roles of everyone, but in the McGlynn, they said the adjustment Councilor is doing some of what a behaviorist would do.

1362
01:37:47,811 --> 01:37:50,771
[SPEAKER_18]: So is the adjustment Councilor the same schooling as a behaviorist?

1363
01:37:51,351 --> 01:37:54,092
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, so a BCBA is an analyst.

1364
01:37:54,692 --> 01:37:59,393
[SPEAKER_17]: So their role is not necessarily to do the direct hands-on work with the student.

1365
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:14,698
[SPEAKER_17]: It's to respond to situations after they've gone through a school adjustment Councilor, school psychologist, and other members of the team to analyze the situation, to look at it from a behavioral perspective, and to design intervention plans.

1366
01:38:15,078 --> 01:38:25,422
[SPEAKER_17]: The intervention plans then get carried out by, say, a school psychologist or a school adjustment Councilor, maybe teachers, paraprofessionals, other members of the school team.

1367
01:38:28,008 --> 01:38:33,170
[SPEAKER_17]: the school adjustment Councilor should be the person who's on the ground working with students directly.

1368
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:37,011
[SPEAKER_18]: And is there a shortage of behaviorists in our area?

1369
01:38:37,872 --> 01:38:46,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think there's a growing presence of BCBAs in the school setting.

1370
01:38:46,815 --> 01:38:54,978
[SPEAKER_17]: So in past years, I mean, as you know, here in Medford, I mean, we didn't have three BCBAs until two years ago.

1371
01:38:55,588 --> 01:38:58,029
[SPEAKER_17]: So we added a BCBA two years ago.

1372
01:38:58,109 --> 01:39:02,992
[SPEAKER_17]: We added the second BCBA maybe four years ago.

1373
01:39:03,012 --> 01:39:04,533
[SPEAKER_17]: And prior to that, we had one.

1374
01:39:04,653 --> 01:39:07,134
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you went back 10 years ago, we didn't have any.

1375
01:39:07,715 --> 01:39:13,037
[SPEAKER_17]: So BCBAs are very, they look at things from an analytical perspective.

1376
01:39:13,057 --> 01:39:20,622
[SPEAKER_17]: They break down a behavior to identify the cause and recommend interventions to mitigate that need.

1377
01:39:21,082 --> 01:39:23,263
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just that schools are seeing

1378
01:39:23,895 --> 01:39:30,220
[SPEAKER_17]: with an increase of individuals with social behavioral presentation, they're seeing a greater need.

1379
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:34,803
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, schools are hiring BCBAs, so that creates a shortage.

1380
01:39:35,223 --> 01:39:39,747
[SPEAKER_17]: But we are doing what we can to hire qualified staff to replace that position.

1381
01:39:39,947 --> 01:39:44,150
[SPEAKER_18]: Is our salary comparable to areas around us for our behaviorists?

1382
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:44,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1383
01:39:45,161 --> 01:39:46,801
[SPEAKER_18]: And have you had any leads?

1384
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:48,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we've been interviewing.

1385
01:39:48,402 --> 01:39:54,963
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's just we haven't identified a person who could fit our needs, what we're looking for in a BCBA.

1386
01:39:56,083 --> 01:40:02,504
[SPEAKER_18]: And in the meantime, you're confident that kids are all getting their services met, that we don't need a subcontractor for behaviors?

1387
01:40:02,544 --> 01:40:09,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody has reported that there are any students with IEP services to me that have not been provided for.

1388
01:40:10,005 --> 01:40:12,746
[SPEAKER_17]: And the evaluation load, like I said,

1389
01:40:13,781 --> 01:40:22,228
[SPEAKER_17]: redistributed, and all of the evals we've been monitoring, the evaluations, and they have been coming back on time within the required timeline.

1390
01:40:22,488 --> 01:40:27,733
[SPEAKER_18]: So the three that we have, one's full-time at the Roberts, one's shared between the Andrews and the Columbus?

1391
01:40:27,793 --> 01:40:27,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me.

1392
01:40:28,073 --> 01:40:29,474
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all district-wide staff.

1393
01:40:29,895 --> 01:40:32,077
[SPEAKER_17]: So we place staff when we need those staff.

1394
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:38,542
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now, we have a large need for BCBA services at the Roberts.

1395
01:40:39,023 --> 01:40:40,924
[SPEAKER_17]: So Mr. Corman's

1396
01:40:42,289 --> 01:40:44,050
[SPEAKER_17]: his home base is at the Roberts.

1397
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:48,232
[SPEAKER_17]: But he can provide services to other students around the district as needed.

1398
01:40:48,792 --> 01:40:58,596
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have another individual who has their office over at the Columbus, because that's a high needs building, but also provides BCBA services across the district.

1399
01:40:59,276 --> 01:41:04,618
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the individual who had left primarily had an office over at the McGlynn.

1400
01:41:04,638 --> 01:41:10,641
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why they're feeling the loss, because if your office is in a building, you're easier to

1401
01:41:11,719 --> 01:41:16,901
[SPEAKER_17]: obtain contact with and come to somebody's aid in an immediate way.

1402
01:41:17,222 --> 01:41:18,882
[SPEAKER_17]: And then where's the third one's office?

1403
01:41:19,743 --> 01:41:21,724
[SPEAKER_18]: We have Island Buckley's up at the high school.

1404
01:41:22,024 --> 01:41:22,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1405
01:41:23,084 --> 01:41:28,367
[SPEAKER_18]: So then has the one that's housed at the Columbus or the one that's housed at the Roberts gone to the McGlynn?

1406
01:41:29,007 --> 01:41:29,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1407
01:41:29,287 --> 01:41:30,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't know specifically.

1408
01:41:31,568 --> 01:41:35,290
[SPEAKER_17]: What we did was we sat down and said, these are the evaluations that need to be conducted.

1409
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,001
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are the students with direct services oversight.

1410
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:41,482
[SPEAKER_17]: And those children are covered.

1411
01:41:43,082 --> 01:41:43,382
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1412
01:41:43,422 --> 01:41:49,984
[SPEAKER_18]: So just so we're all on the same page, what I'm hearing is that the one at the Roberts is at the Roberts, doesn't go anywhere else.

1413
01:41:50,064 --> 01:41:52,745
[SPEAKER_18]: The one at the Andrews and the Columbus only goes to the Andrews and the Columbus.

1414
01:41:53,245 --> 01:41:54,225
[SPEAKER_18]: There must be one at the high school.

1415
01:41:54,245 --> 01:41:55,926
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't know anything about that one.

1416
01:41:56,346 --> 01:42:05,048
[SPEAKER_18]: So that the McGlynn doesn't have a behaviorist, that the person, the kid's IEPs, what they're asking, the adjustment Councilor is doing what typically the behaviorist would be doing.

1417
01:42:05,513 --> 01:42:22,199
[SPEAKER_17]: if the behaviors was- Okay, so in the world of BCBAs, students who typically have a BCBA service on their IEP are typically children with autism who have ABA, discrete trial programming, or oversight from the BCBA.

1418
01:42:22,959 --> 01:42:29,521
[SPEAKER_17]: So the populations of students who have those needs are primarily located in those buildings that you just mentioned.

1419
01:42:29,701 --> 01:42:34,663
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there are some students from different disability categories in buildings such as

1420
01:42:35,339 --> 01:42:43,184
[SPEAKER_17]: the McGlynn Elementary School, but they don't have the level of direct service that you would see on some other students' plans.

1421
01:42:43,264 --> 01:42:46,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So I mean, I don't want to get into comparing all the children.

1422
01:42:46,366 --> 01:42:48,127
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't either, but I just want to make sure.

1423
01:42:48,147 --> 01:42:53,531
[SPEAKER_17]: But I can assure you that we've looked into this, and I think I explained this to you in an email.

1424
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:54,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I have.

1425
01:42:55,512 --> 01:42:56,653
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't know how we can help.

1426
01:42:56,733 --> 01:43:03,898
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's been a few months since the person left, and I'm just wondering, what can we do to attract people here better?

1427
01:43:05,785 --> 01:43:06,165
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1428
01:43:06,725 --> 01:43:10,148
[SPEAKER_17]: We put laced ads on School Spring.

1429
01:43:10,188 --> 01:43:12,309
[SPEAKER_17]: We have ads on the website.

1430
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:17,272
[SPEAKER_17]: And ads have gone out to the other venues that we typically put ads out to.

1431
01:43:17,693 --> 01:43:18,773
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had some bites.

1432
01:43:19,154 --> 01:43:27,339
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just a very unfortunate time of year to require a key staff person where we don't have hundreds of people applying for these jobs.

1433
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,061
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had maybe six.

1434
01:43:30,297 --> 01:43:35,163
[SPEAKER_17]: We thought we had somebody didn't work out, and we have another interview tomorrow with somebody.

1435
01:43:35,183 --> 01:43:39,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Another individual, we called him for an interview, and they just got snagged by Malden.

1436
01:43:39,668 --> 01:43:43,953
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're not the only community who's out there looking for these professionals.

1437
01:43:43,973 --> 01:43:45,074
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1438
01:43:45,315 --> 01:43:46,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you.

1439
01:43:46,116 --> 01:43:46,376
[SPEAKER_15]: You're good.

1440
01:43:47,357 --> 01:43:47,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1441
01:43:47,577 --> 01:43:47,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Cugno.

1442
01:43:48,572 --> 01:44:05,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?

1443
01:44:05,404 --> 01:44:10,508
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they absolutely can go to the other schools as the need arises and that's what they've been doing.

1444
01:44:11,114 --> 01:44:13,254
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the clarification I needed to have.

1445
01:44:14,215 --> 01:44:15,735
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are down at the McGlynn.

1446
01:44:16,255 --> 01:44:20,356
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?

1447
01:44:20,876 --> 01:44:22,716
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.

1448
01:44:23,897 --> 01:44:24,197
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1449
01:44:24,237 --> 01:44:34,779
[SPEAKER_17]: So the person who was assigned to the McGlynn was assigned to the McGlynn Elementary, McGlynn Middle, some students at the high school, out of district, some out of district students, the Brooks.

1450
01:44:35,299 --> 01:44:40,100
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's all of the, it depends on what their area of expertise are.

1451
01:44:40,558 --> 01:44:45,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Because some BCBAs are ABA discrete trial specialists.

1452
01:44:46,001 --> 01:44:50,303
[SPEAKER_17]: Other people might have their strength in the area of social emotional dysregulation.

1453
01:44:51,043 --> 01:44:56,066
[SPEAKER_17]: So we try to match up people with what they do best.

1454
01:44:56,426 --> 01:45:02,849
[SPEAKER_15]: But the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school

1455
01:45:03,405 --> 01:45:05,547
[SPEAKER_15]: office was located, which was at the moment.

1456
01:45:05,567 --> 01:45:19,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, right now that's where there is a hole, but if the person who we hire ultimately has a different skill set, we might need to do some moving around so that we make sure that people are where they need to be to support the students.

1457
01:45:20,881 --> 01:45:23,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that's the most important thing for us is supporting the students.

1458
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:23,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1459
01:45:23,924 --> 01:45:28,468
[SPEAKER_15]: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person.

1460
01:45:29,339 --> 01:45:37,603
[SPEAKER_15]: the Councilors from the other schools or the BCP from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.

1461
01:45:37,703 --> 01:45:37,803
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1462
01:45:37,943 --> 01:45:50,689
[SPEAKER_17]: If there is an evaluation, if that need arises, of course, we've covered what we need to do to cover to make sure that IEPs and our evaluation timelines have been completed within regulations.

1463
01:45:50,709 --> 01:45:50,749
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1464
01:45:50,769 --> 01:45:52,870
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1465
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:53,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1466
01:45:53,230 --> 01:45:53,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1467
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:54,010
Thank you.

1468
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:54,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1469
01:45:54,571 --> 01:45:54,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1470
01:45:54,971 --> 01:45:55,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1471
01:45:56,151 --> 01:45:57,052
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have one item.

1472
01:45:57,916 --> 01:45:58,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1473
01:45:58,156 --> 01:46:04,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelson would like to explain something about our upcoming Committee of the Whole meeting regarding the new MCAS.

1474
01:46:09,478 --> 01:46:11,478
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

1475
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:13,579
[SPEAKER_25]: This is MCAS season again.

1476
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:20,740
[SPEAKER_25]: And once again, we have a very short time frame to get things ready for everyone.

1477
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:25,921
[SPEAKER_25]: This morning, the results were made known to the administrators.

1478
01:46:28,021 --> 01:46:32,906
[SPEAKER_25]: working very diligently all day trying to put the figures together.

1479
01:46:32,926 --> 01:46:42,034
[SPEAKER_25]: The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has provided us with information related to the release, the public release.

1480
01:46:42,735 --> 01:46:45,617
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, we have the results today.

1481
01:46:45,637 --> 01:46:50,221
[SPEAKER_25]: The public release is scheduled for Wednesday, October 18th.

1482
01:46:51,022 --> 01:46:54,065
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, we are planning that individual student scores

1483
01:46:54,539 --> 01:47:00,021
[SPEAKER_25]: will be mailed home when they're sent to the superintendent's office around October 24th.

1484
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:11,865
[SPEAKER_25]: As all of you know, in the spring of 2017, all students in grades three through eight were administered the Next Generation MCAS.

1485
01:47:12,405 --> 01:47:18,507
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a new version of the 20-year-old MCAS, which is now known as the Legacy MCAS.

1486
01:47:18,867 --> 01:47:23,629
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're really working with two different assessments, one which is grades three through eight,

1487
01:47:24,853 --> 01:47:34,198
[SPEAKER_25]: generation, and then the high school is still, and the science exams, 5, 8, and the high school science, are still with the older version of MCAS.

1488
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:46,964
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, that legacy MCAS was administered in grade 10, students in English Language Arts and Mathematics, and all students taking the science exams.

1489
01:47:48,745 --> 01:47:53,127
[SPEAKER_25]: On Thursday, October 12th, DESE held a webinar containing information

1490
01:47:53,678 --> 01:48:00,140
[SPEAKER_25]: related to 2017 MCAS accountability ratings and student score reporting.

1491
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:12,824
[SPEAKER_25]: We've attached the PowerPoint from that webinar, and again, we plan to report specifics of our scores on Wednesday evening.

1492
01:48:12,884 --> 01:48:16,146
[SPEAKER_25]: We're planning a meeting at 6.30, is it?

1493
01:48:16,366 --> 01:48:17,206
[SPEAKER_25]: 6 o'clock or 6.30?

1494
01:48:17,586 --> 01:48:17,206
6.30.

1495
01:48:18,566 --> 01:48:19,767
[SPEAKER_25]: 6.30.

1496
01:48:18,946 --> 01:48:19,767
[SPEAKER_25]: Very brief meeting.

1497
01:48:19,787 --> 01:48:23,328
[SPEAKER_25]: I know there's another meeting at the high school that most of you want to attend.

1498
01:48:25,704 --> 01:48:33,207
[SPEAKER_25]: This particular webinar and the PowerPoint speaks to a few different issues, one of which is accountability.

1499
01:48:33,647 --> 01:48:42,790
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, as you all know, in years past, schools get accountability ratings and the district gets a rating which is only as good as its lowest school's rating.

1500
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:53,553
[SPEAKER_25]: Because the Next Generation MCAS was a new test, the state has decided that this year we will have a very different way of reporting accountability.

1501
01:48:54,418 --> 01:48:58,079
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's not based on student scores for grades three through eight.

1502
01:48:58,579 --> 01:49:01,160
[SPEAKER_25]: It's going to be based upon participation rates.

1503
01:49:01,821 --> 01:49:11,604
[SPEAKER_25]: So as long as you have a participation rate of 90% or better, the school remains in a level two, which we currently were last year.

1504
01:49:12,124 --> 01:49:16,265
[SPEAKER_25]: So they're not going to come out and look at student scores to reassign accountability levels.

1505
01:49:16,906 --> 01:49:23,868
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, we will have that information for you on Wednesday when it's publicly released.

1506
01:49:25,287 --> 01:49:27,168
[SPEAKER_25]: This will serve as the new baseline.

1507
01:49:27,868 --> 01:49:34,030
[SPEAKER_25]: So next year, the DESE is projecting that we will go back to a different kind of accountability rating.

1508
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:37,351
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, what that's going to be is not yet decided on.

1509
01:49:37,751 --> 01:49:39,831
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're still waiting for details on that.

1510
01:49:41,232 --> 01:49:51,915
[SPEAKER_25]: The second area that the webinar discussed, the PowerPoint discussed, is that the new MCAS exam, again,

1511
01:49:52,509 --> 01:49:54,791
[SPEAKER_25]: For many of our students, they took it on computer.

1512
01:49:55,011 --> 01:49:59,974
[SPEAKER_25]: Some students took it on paper and pencil still, which was allowable.

1513
01:50:01,295 --> 01:50:05,578
[SPEAKER_25]: And gradually, it's all gonna go to a computer-based.

1514
01:50:06,039 --> 01:50:12,823
[SPEAKER_25]: So this year, in the spring, we're gonna have more grades that will be required to be tested students on the computers.

1515
01:50:13,364 --> 01:50:19,048
[SPEAKER_25]: And by 2019, all the exams, except, I think, for the science high school,

1516
01:50:19,506 --> 01:50:20,466
[SPEAKER_25]: will be computerized.

1517
01:50:20,506 --> 01:50:27,629
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're moving more and more towards that, and we're preparing with our equipment and all that to make students ready for that.

1518
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:32,531
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so we had a lot of trial runs last year.

1519
01:50:32,551 --> 01:50:36,432
[SPEAKER_25]: It went pretty well, so we're hoping to have similar results this year.

1520
01:50:37,853 --> 01:50:46,116
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the major differences that I want to call your attention to is how the scores are reported under the new exam.

1521
01:50:46,697 --> 01:51:11,297
[SPEAKER_25]: So in the PowerPoint, if you turn to the section on scoring, the categories are not going to be Advanced, Proficient, Needs Improvement or Failing Warning.

1522
01:51:11,857 --> 01:51:13,519
[SPEAKER_25]: We have four new categories.

1523
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:20,314
[SPEAKER_25]: And so as we're getting the reports in today, the data is organized into those categories.

1524
01:51:21,274 --> 01:51:26,777
[SPEAKER_25]: We have, to replace advanced, we have exceeding expectations.

1525
01:51:27,978 --> 01:51:32,341
[SPEAKER_25]: Proficient is now being replaced with meeting expectations.

1526
01:51:33,842 --> 01:51:39,645
[SPEAKER_25]: Needs improvement is being replaced with partially meeting expectations.

1527
01:51:40,506 --> 01:51:42,927
[SPEAKER_25]: And warning is being replaced with not.

1528
01:51:43,432 --> 01:51:44,772
[SPEAKER_25]: meeting expectations.

1529
01:51:45,613 --> 01:51:51,515
[SPEAKER_25]: So again, we're dealing with very different proficiency or different categories of ratings.

1530
01:51:51,555 --> 01:51:53,856
[SPEAKER_25]: We want to pay attention to that.

1531
01:51:54,676 --> 01:52:09,741
[SPEAKER_25]: And the State makes a very important point when they state that the proficient meeting expectations, the requirements for that, the rubric for that, are more rigorous than the rubric for proficient.

1532
01:52:10,382 --> 01:52:11,442
[SPEAKER_25]: So again, it's not

1533
01:52:11,789 --> 01:52:13,790
[SPEAKER_25]: quite equatable, you know, equally.

1534
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:24,598
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't say that proficient and meeting expectations is exactly the same because the expectations are going to be higher for meeting expectations than they were for proficient.

1535
01:52:25,218 --> 01:52:27,100
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're getting all of the data together.

1536
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:38,568
[SPEAKER_25]: Tomorrow we're meeting with the directors and Dr. Riccadeli and Mrs. Caldwell and myself to put things in a format for you for Wednesday evening.

1537
01:52:39,308 --> 01:52:47,214
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything is embargoed until Wednesday, and so we'll have all of that for you, as well as a preliminary report on Wednesday evening.

1538
01:52:47,795 --> 01:52:53,159
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you have any questions on the PowerPoint, the information there, I'd be more than glad to answer those for you.

1539
01:52:53,999 --> 01:52:59,523
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, there are still questions that are unanswered, that we're waiting for some clarity from the state.

1540
01:53:00,004 --> 01:53:06,809
[SPEAKER_25]: The high school still remains with the same categories, advanced, proficient, needs improvement, and failing.

1541
01:53:07,418 --> 01:53:13,860
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're still working with the older version of MCAS at the English and mathematics and science levels at the high school.

1542
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:15,920
[SPEAKER_25]: Any questions?

1543
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:17,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any questions?

1544
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:22,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to receive this paper and place it on file.

1545
01:53:22,902 --> 01:53:23,762
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a request?

1546
01:53:26,543 --> 01:53:33,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.

1547
01:53:33,444 --> 01:53:36,985
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, I want to mention too, and I'm going to ask principals tomorrow,

1548
01:53:37,355 --> 01:53:56,174
[SPEAKER_25]: At the very last slide, they have actually some information, Desi's posted information for parents, so we'll ask principals to put that on their websites because that information is specifically for parents where this information in the PowerPoint might be more technical.

1549
01:53:56,394 --> 01:54:00,158
[SPEAKER_25]: We can do both, but I think the resources for parents

1550
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:01,930
[SPEAKER_25]: would be the more useful.

1551
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:02,631
[SPEAKER_25]: We will do that.

1552
01:54:02,651 --> 01:54:14,234
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as we make sure we put something, because I know that there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with the same child or even with older children.

1553
01:54:14,614 --> 01:54:17,435
[SPEAKER_15]: So at least they can get an understanding of what's going on.

1554
01:54:17,515 --> 01:54:17,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1555
01:54:17,895 --> 01:54:18,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1556
01:54:18,095 --> 01:54:20,556
[SPEAKER_25]: Because the student score reports will look different.

1557
01:54:20,916 --> 01:54:27,618
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the things that I'm still questioning, and I don't have an answer for it, is that they are going to give student growth percentiles.

1558
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:38,870
[SPEAKER_25]: even though they really aren't using the same instruments to measure the student growth, because we've had different exams over time, but they say they're still going to give a growth percentile.

1559
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:44,855
[SPEAKER_25]: How they're going to equate that, when you have apples and oranges, once again, they do this to us all the time, so we're kind of used to it.

1560
01:54:45,495 --> 01:54:50,520
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll take a look at that, but parents will have that data too, although I wonder how valid it is when you

1561
01:54:51,082 --> 01:54:55,743
[SPEAKER_25]: are using two different instruments, and you're trying to equate things between two different instruments.

1562
01:54:56,823 --> 01:54:57,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1563
01:54:57,363 --> 01:54:57,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1564
01:54:57,563 --> 01:54:57,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Krutz.

1565
01:54:58,383 --> 01:54:58,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1566
01:54:58,923 --> 01:54:59,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1567
01:54:59,383 --> 01:54:59,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Nelson.

1568
01:55:00,344 --> 01:55:01,124
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have a question.

1569
01:55:01,204 --> 01:55:19,327
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we have good participation rates, and we're above 90%, and we have good graduation rates, and if our students are in partially meeting expectations, would that affect us and put us into a different level, or is it going to be strictly by

1570
01:55:19,898 --> 01:55:21,839
[SPEAKER_11]: participation rates and graduation rates.

1571
01:55:21,919 --> 01:55:23,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I was a little, I just didn't really know what.

1572
01:55:24,039 --> 01:55:25,080
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very different.

1573
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:28,841
[SPEAKER_25]: I think they didn't quite know what to do with the accountability this year.

1574
01:55:29,261 --> 01:55:33,643
[SPEAKER_25]: So they came up with something that, you know, in their way is a compromise.

1575
01:55:34,063 --> 01:55:38,204
[SPEAKER_25]: It's our understanding that grades three through eight, it's participation.

1576
01:55:38,644 --> 01:55:42,706
[SPEAKER_25]: You have to have 90% or higher participation to stay in level two.

1577
01:55:43,146 --> 01:55:46,707
[SPEAKER_25]: Now my question, which again, I can't get an answer to, is how can you get in level one?

1578
01:55:47,114 --> 01:55:48,355
[SPEAKER_25]: Because they really don't explain that.

1579
01:55:48,395 --> 01:55:51,698
[SPEAKER_25]: If they're not going to use student scores, because that's what we always relied on.

1580
01:55:52,198 --> 01:55:55,981
[SPEAKER_25]: So they're not really giving us a clear response to that right yet.

1581
01:55:56,102 --> 01:56:05,810
[SPEAKER_25]: So again, it's participation rate and graduation rate is our understanding as the sole criteria for the accountability levels.

1582
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:10,674
[SPEAKER_25]: And then the data from the student scores this year will be used as the baseline data.

1583
01:56:11,134 --> 01:56:15,378
[SPEAKER_25]: And next year, they're going to go back to some kind of a different system, which again,

1584
01:56:15,969 --> 01:56:23,232
[SPEAKER_25]: Still haven't made all the guidelines for that, which will probably factor in student scores, since we'll have a year of baseline data on that.

1585
01:56:24,412 --> 01:56:25,413
[SPEAKER_25]: That's my understanding.

1586
01:56:26,093 --> 01:56:27,974
[SPEAKER_25]: Subject to change by them, not us.

1587
01:56:27,994 --> 01:56:32,055
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a pretty good idea right now of participation.

1588
01:56:32,175 --> 01:56:36,557
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, we really feel very confident that participation rates have been met.

1589
01:56:37,197 --> 01:56:42,459
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the things that's tricky with participation, it's not just the aggregate, it's each of the subgroups.

1590
01:56:42,966 --> 01:56:50,891
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have to be careful when you have a subgroup that's very, very small, that you need more students in that smaller subgroup to participate, to get that 90%.

1591
01:56:51,552 --> 01:56:59,017
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you have a subgroup with 10 students, 9 out of the 10 have to participate, where if you have 100 students, it's a lot less students.

1592
01:56:59,037 --> 01:57:03,900
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have to watch those numbers very carefully, but we're pretty confident that we've met it all around.

1593
01:57:04,942 --> 01:57:05,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1594
01:57:05,462 --> 01:57:05,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1595
01:57:05,862 --> 01:57:06,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a follow-up?

1596
01:57:07,163 --> 01:57:07,503
[SPEAKER_13]: One more.

1597
01:57:07,523 --> 01:57:08,244
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize.

1598
01:57:08,324 --> 01:57:15,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them?

1599
01:57:15,907 --> 01:57:18,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Or were they granted because we went back and forth with this?

1600
01:57:19,149 --> 01:57:21,350
[SPEAKER_25]: 10th graders, nothing really changed.

1601
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:22,391
[SPEAKER_25]: It was the old exam.

1602
01:57:22,471 --> 01:57:25,932
[SPEAKER_25]: It was the legacy MCAS, which is the older exam.

1603
01:57:26,593 --> 01:57:30,154
[SPEAKER_25]: They are still going to be rated on the old levels.

1604
01:57:30,695 --> 01:57:33,316
[SPEAKER_25]: Advanced, Proficient, Needs Improvement, and Warning.

1605
01:57:33,663 --> 01:57:39,166
[SPEAKER_25]: You'll see in the reports that we're providing for you that those categories are different for the high school testing.

1606
01:57:40,167 --> 01:57:43,949
[SPEAKER_25]: And so that hasn't changed in terms of that exam.

1607
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:48,292
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, the students are pretty much taking everything on paper at the high school level.

1608
01:57:48,972 --> 01:57:57,537
[SPEAKER_25]: We're waiting for some more direction with that and when they're going to actually transition to computers and when they're going to transition to the newer version of the test.

1609
01:57:57,998 --> 01:58:01,700
[SPEAKER_25]: All things that the DESE still hasn't, I guess, decided on.

1610
01:58:02,673 --> 01:58:06,263
[SPEAKER_15]: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually put

1611
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:10,880
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students.

1612
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:16,341
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if they're taking these MCAS in the ninth grade, and then all of a sudden, the 10th grade, it changes.

1613
01:58:16,881 --> 01:58:19,622
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?

1614
01:58:19,642 --> 01:58:23,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.

1615
01:58:23,663 --> 01:58:25,603
[SPEAKER_15]: So I mean, I just hope.

1616
01:58:25,903 --> 01:58:27,944
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.

1617
01:58:27,964 --> 01:58:29,944
[SPEAKER_15]: I know how they change their things overnight.

1618
01:58:30,564 --> 01:58:33,265
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city,

1619
01:58:34,165 --> 01:58:48,448
[SPEAKER_15]: try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th grade and then all of a sudden we change it overnight on them and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.

1620
01:58:48,568 --> 01:58:56,969
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that because I'm sure, I mean I know the administration does, I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.

1621
01:58:57,009 --> 01:59:00,010
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we have to advocate for that because that's really high stakes.

1622
01:59:00,454 --> 01:59:05,117
[SPEAKER_25]: That depends on your diploma, and that really is, you really shouldn't be doing that to students unfairly.

1623
01:59:05,637 --> 01:59:06,198
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

1624
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:07,278
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not fair to those students.

1625
01:59:07,699 --> 01:59:09,880
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not fair to anybody, but those students especially.

1626
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:10,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1627
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:15,524
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1628
01:59:15,564 --> 01:59:16,324
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1629
01:59:16,664 --> 01:59:16,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1630
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:17,685
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1631
01:59:17,725 --> 01:59:18,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1632
01:59:18,485 --> 01:59:19,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make a general announcement.

1633
01:59:21,127 --> 01:59:25,590
[SPEAKER_13]: At 5 o'clock on Thursday, we're having a birthday party for this building, as well as dedicating

1634
01:59:26,184 --> 01:59:28,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Several unique spaces within it.

1635
01:59:28,727 --> 01:59:37,035
[SPEAKER_13]: So come on down should be a fun night birthday cake and Food so come on down and there's a motion to adjourn this meeting.

1636
01:59:37,095 --> 01:59:37,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no.

1637
01:59:37,396 --> 01:59:44,583
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're going into executive session Motion to go into executive session seconded by mr. Benedetto roll call vote, please.

1638
01:59:44,603 --> 01:59:45,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Scurry.

1639
01:59:46,064 --> 01:59:46,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I

1640
01:59:50,705 --> 01:59:53,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, one absent.

1641
01:59:53,971 --> 01:59:54,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1642
01:59:54,633 --> 01:59:56,356
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll now enter executive session.

1643
01:59:57,538 --> 01:59:59,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much for participating tonight.
