1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:03,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't find anyone from Mustang Report and it's due in two days.

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:05,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what I'm going to do.

3
00:00:05,154 --> 00:00:06,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to go find someone.

4
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:17,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Mateo's in the library somewhere.

5
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:21,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, Shakespeare.

6
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:21,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Mateo, what are you doing?

7
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:23,327
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to finish the Mustang Report.

8
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:23,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to make some copies for the Once and Furniture King.

10
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:30,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully I'll find someone from the Mustang Report while I'm here.

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,167
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

12
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:36,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I might as well have this book online.

13
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:37,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need copies.

14
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Jocelyn!

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been looking for you everywhere!

16
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:40,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on!

17
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:41,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

18
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:44,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where Amber is.

19
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:51,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard you had a squirrel problem in school, so I don't know if that's Amber or squirrels.

20
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Amber, is that you?

21
00:00:54,702 --> 00:00:55,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, let's go.

22
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:57,724
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the Mustang report to work on.

23
00:00:57,784 --> 00:00:58,625
[SPEAKER_06]: You help?

24
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,265
Okay.

25
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:02,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, this cooking magazine looks good.

26
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:08,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Courtney!

27
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,212
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing?

28
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:10,892
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the Mustang report.

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you sleeping?

30
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:12,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Third period.

31
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:14,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Third period?

32
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:14,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Amber Harbison, and I'm here with the Mustang Report, and we're going to do a little weather report on the snowstorm that happened yesterday.

34
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a look.

35
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:35,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say we have about, you know, 13 inches, maybe more in some places, maybe a little less, but definitely not as much as Canada yesterday.

36
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:37,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, do you think this is great softball weather?

37
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:38,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

38
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:39,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's never been warmer.

39
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:47,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we could invent like a new sport, like snowball, where they play baseball with snow?

40
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's actually a great idea.

41
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,460
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get back to you on it.

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, what's your favorite snow time activity?

43
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:58,823
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite snow time activity is hot chocolate and warm fire in a warm bedroom.

44
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:02,725
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best kind of activity for the snow time and for the season.

45
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:05,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hope you enjoyed your snow day yesterday with that.

46
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:06,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

47
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:07,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot of plowing.

48
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:08,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy plowing, yes.

49
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:10,990
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really a lot of fun and a lot of aggravation.

50
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,512
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer to last week's Question of the Week is... Two.

51
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:24,914
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mustang Report Question of the Week is... Where was I on January 20, 2001?

52
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:35,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's going well is that the fish are growing very rapidly, which is what we want.

53
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:53,193
[SPEAKER_03]: What's also going well is that we got a grant from the Medford Education Foundation to build our hydroponics.

54
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:27,893
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna combine they're smart if they think the net is there they're gonna stay away okay this is a little guy actually you got it?

55
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:32,356
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so they're growing they're growing nicely

56
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're healthy, which is good.

57
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:41,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And the test part's going well.

58
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:43,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

59
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:50,354
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually getting the parts for our grow bed very soon.

60
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:56,735
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually picking up the grow bed from a local company here in Medford called Root Down Hydroponics.

61
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:59,596
[SPEAKER_03]: That grow bed is going to go right over here.

62
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:02,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the outline.

63
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,765
[SPEAKER_03]: of where the bed's going to sit.

64
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of big, but we'll make room for it.

65
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:11,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will allow us to grow edible plants.

66
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it's going to help clean the water.

67
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:19,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll be really great, because it means that I won't have to clean this out all the time.

68
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:24,353
[SPEAKER_03]: This gets a little grody after a while.

69
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:27,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plants will do that cleaning for us, which will be really cool.

70
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And we already had a

71
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:38,591
[SPEAKER_03]: one student do a mini hydroponic system for a science fair project, and it worked great.

72
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It kept the water clean.

73
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:40,513
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have to change the water.

74
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:47,158
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a little fish named Nemo, who was very happy with his hydroponic system.

75
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,982
[SPEAKER_03]: So in short, it's going great.

76
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:55,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully in about another six weeks, we're going to harvest our fish.

77
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,930
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take them out of the culinary, and we're going to start making some tasty fish treats.

78
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a lot of science questions that you want answered?

79
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:07,418
[SPEAKER_06]: What's a molecule?

80
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:08,519
[SPEAKER_06]: How does life work?

81
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,820
[SPEAKER_06]: How do atoms work?

82
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how this works.

83
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:14,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Does your teacher not have enough time to answer all your questions?

84
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, my teacher never has time for my questions.

85
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've got the solution for you.

86
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:22,190
[SPEAKER_06]: A new program called Breaking Science.

87
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:23,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, when is it again?

88
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:27,435
[SPEAKER_06]: The first event is April 12th at 7 o'clock p.m.

89
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,036
[SPEAKER_06]: in the science lecture hall.

90
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I have to go now.

91
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:42,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Victoria here with Marcus Mazzotti, the president of the Drama Club, talking about the upcoming performance of Fiddler on the Roof.

92
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:46,528
[SPEAKER_06]: So Marcus, can you tell me a little bit about what the Fiddler on the Roof is about?

93
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:55,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's about a small village in Eastern Europe, and it's about sort of changing old traditions when new ideas come to town.

94
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:58,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So when is the performance?

95
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:03,477
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a performance this coming Thursday at 7.30 p.m., Friday at 7.30, and then Saturday at 2.30 and 7.30.

96
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:06,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good luck.

97
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:08,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you break a leg.

98
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:08,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

99
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Not literally, of course.
